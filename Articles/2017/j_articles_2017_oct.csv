10/01/2017,"[""The record of all Bitcoin transactions that these computers are constantly updating is known as the blockchain.\n\nWhy do criminals like Bitcoin?\n\nCriminals have taken to Bitcoin because anyone can open a Bitcoin address and start sending and receiving Bitcoins without giving a name or identity. There is no central authority that could collect this information.\n\nBitcoin first took off in 2011 after drug dealers began taking payments in Bitcoin on the black-market website known as the Silk Road. Although the Silk Road was shut down in 2013, similar sites have popped up to replace it.\n\nMore recently, Bitcoin has become a method for making ransom payments — for example, when your computer is taken over by so-called ransomware.\n\nWhy won’t the government just shut it down?\n\nThe records of the Bitcoin network, including all balances and transactions, are stored on every computer helping to maintain the network — about 9,500 computers in late 2017.\n\nIf the government made it illegal for Americans to participate in this network, the computers and people keeping the records in other countries would still be able to continue. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is also one of the qualities that have made it popular with people who are suspicious of government authorities.\n\nCan Bitcoin users give themselves more Bitcoins?\n\nAnyone helping to maintain the database of all Bitcoin transactions — the blockchain — could change his or her own copy of the records to add more money. But if someone did that, the other computers maintaining the records would see the discrepancy, and the changes would be ignored.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAre there legal uses?\n\nOnly a small percentage of all transactions on the Bitcoin network are explicitly illegal. Most transactions are people buying and selling Bitcoins on exchanges, speculating on future prices. A whole world of high-frequency traders has sprung up around Bitcoin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Large international money transfers can take weeks when they go through banks, while millions of dollars of Bitcoin can be moved in minutes. So far, though, these practical applications of Bitcoin have been slow to take off.\n\nHow can I buy a Bitcoin?\n\nPhoto\n\nThere are companies in most countries that will sell you Bitcoins in exchange for the local currency. In the United States, a company called Coinbase will link to your bank account or credit card and then sell you the coins for dollars. Opening an account with Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank or stock brokerage account, with lots of identity verification to satisfy the authorities.\n\nFor people who do not want to reveal their identities, services like LocalBitcoins will connect people who want to meet in person to buy and sell Bitcoins for cash, generally without any verification of identity required.\n\nWho decides what a Bitcoin is worth?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly and is determined by open-market bidding on Bitcoin exchanges, similar to the way that stock and gold prices are determined by bidding on exchanges.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining?\n\nBitcoin mining refers to the process through which new Bitcoins are created and given to computers helping to maintain the network. The computers involved in Bitcoin mining are in a sort of computational race to process new transactions coming onto the network. The winner — generally the person with the fastest computers — gets a chunk of new Bitcoins, 12.5 of them right now. (The reward is halved every four years.)\n\nThere is generally a new winner about every 10 minutes, and there will be until there are 21 million Bitcoins in the world. At that point, no new Bitcoins will be created. This cap is expected to be reached in 2140. So far, about 16 million Bitcoin have been distributed.\n\nEvery Bitcoin in existence was created through this method and initially given to a computer helping to maintain the records. Anyone can set his or her computer to mine Bitcoin, but these days only people with specialized hardware manage to win the race.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAre there Bitcoin competitors?\n\nPlenty. But these other virtual currencies do not have as many followers as Bitcoin, so they are not worth as much. As in the real world, a currency is worth only as much as the number of people willing to accept it for goods and services.\n\nWho is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nPhoto\n\nBitcoin was introduced in 2008 by an unknown creator going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who communicated only by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as likely candidates to be Satoshi, as the creator is known in the world of Bitcoin, no one has been confirmed as the real Satoshi, and the search has gone on.\n\nSatoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then released the software to the world in 2009. Satoshi largely disappeared from view two years later. Anyone can download and use the software, and Satoshi now has no more control over the network than anyone else using the software."", 'Beijing, China\n\nIt’s a sweltering summer night when I’m invited to join a bitcoin miner from Shenzhen at a “bitcoin club” somewhere in downtown Beijing. I’ve just returned from visiting one of the world’s largest bitcoin mines and find myself at a gathering of cryptocurrency enthusiasts at a craft beer brewery in the Sanlitun nightlife district.\n\nI excuse myself from the bitcoin meetup and resort to jumping in a pirate taxi because I don’t have a mobile wallet from Alibaba or Tencent—the primary way to hail and pay for taxis in the city. After paying in cash—now a rarity in China’s mobile payment saturated cities—I disembark, then get lost amid Beijing’s ancient hutongs, the narrow alleyways that link China’s traditional courtyard residences.\n\nMy host puts me out of my misery by sharing his location on a real-time map over our WeChat direct messages. Now drenched in sweat, I meet Jack Liao, who runs a bitcoin mining firm called Lightning Asic. He leads me through a dark hutong, coming to a set of carved wooden double-doors. Pushing them open, we enter into the courtyard of a palatially renovated villa. This is my first look at the elusive “bitcoin club.”\n\nThe Bitcoin Club’s dining room. (Jack Liao)\n\nThe club is located in a 2,000-square-foot villa with a staff of 15, including cooks, cleaners, and wait people. It has two guest rooms, a dining room that hosts two dozen people, a professional Texas Hold ‘Em table emblazoned with the legend, “Faith in Bitcoin,” an automated mahjong table; shelves stacked with fine wine and liquor, a room for practicing Chinese caligraphy, and so on. The table stakes are bitcoin, AliPay credits, and sometimes even yuan, the only non-virtual currency accepted. Guests can sleep, eat, drink, and gamble for free if they’re acquainted with the miners who run the place. “People come here just to chat about projects,” Liao says.\n\nThe eye-popping villa bankrolled by bitcoin mining is a symbol of just how lucrative the cryptocurrency industry has been for some on the Chinese mainland. China is home to the world’s largest bitcoin mines, thanks to abundant and cheap electricity, and at one time the country accounted for 95% of the volume traded in global markets. Its central bank is experimenting with a blockchain-backed digital currency, and its biggest companies, from tech giants to industrial conglomerates, are racing to bake blockchain tech into major new projects.\n\nAll this points to a central question: How did stateless cryptocurrencies get so big in China, a country where the national currency—along with so much else—remains tightly controlled by the government? Why has bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, flourished with so much vigor here in China? A two-week journey through bitcoin trading operations in Shanghai, mining operations in Inner Mongolia, and the club in Beijing hasn’t answered the question definitely—but it’s gotten me much closer.\n\nBitcoin is a political statement\n\nBitcoin began as an experiment in economics and politics, as a project to create electronic money that anyone could use but no one controlled, especially a sovereign authority. The code behind the new currency gave life to libertarian ideals like: money free from government controls on spending and taxation; transactions that could ignore a global, sometimes corrupt banking system; and freedom from central bank targeting of interest rates and inflation. It was also rebuke to the very notion of conventional money.\n\nBitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, encoded a headline from the Times of London in the first block of transactions ever created on the bitcoin blockchain. It read: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”\n\nGiven bitcoin’s political bona fides, it’s a great irony that Chinese companies and individual users are so dominant in its daily activities. The world’s biggest bitcoin miner is a Beijing-based company called Bitmain, which operates two mining pools that control nearly 30% of all the processing power devoted to bitcoin mining. It might seem that Chinese bitcoiners are carrying out some kind of libertarian protest against China’s ruling communist party, subverting the status quo by processing cryptocurrency transactions towards a yet-to-be-revealed political end.\n\nThey aren’t.\n\n“In China, bitcoin is one thing and in America and Europe it is another thing,” Liao said as we sipped tea from porcelain cups on the villa’s top floor. Our host, Wu Bi, explains there is no competition between cryptocurrencies and the government-controlled renminbi, at least as the government sees it. “In China our government says bitcoin is not a currency, it is a commodity, so there is no chance it will compete with the renminbi,” Wu told me in Chinese, with Liao translating. “Bitcoin is a great idea, but in China we care more about blockchain.”\n\n“Faith in bitcoin”—and poker (Joon Ian Wong/Quartz)\n\nWu and his Chinese compatriots are focused not on the currency, but on the technology behind it. Blockchain is simply a technical way to record encrypted transactions that are distributed across a computer network; once entered they cannot be altered. Instead of using blockchain, or bitcoin, as a permissionless cryptocurrency, banks want to shoe-horn some of bitcoin’s features into current transaction systems to create a low-cost network that, crucially, would require administrators to grant users access. Those administrators, of course, would be banks, or central banks. “Different countries may have different ideas about what is government, and what is the liberty of individuals,” Wu says.\n\nBitcoin users I met in Beijing were similarly dismissive of bitcoin’s libertarian politics. They did not want to be named or quoted directly, but their argument was essentially this: People in China simply aren’t interested in bitcoin’s potential for political change. And besides, China’s closely controlled economy has delivered prosperity for now—what benefits does bitcoin bring besides as an investment that might appreciate?\n\nObject of speculation\n\nOrdinary Chinese bitcoin users I spoke to, and those who are served by the exchanges and wallet providers, are far more interested in the ability to speculate on bitcoin’s wild price swings—it’s just another way to make money as China continues to adopt characteristics of a market economy.\n\nAs it happens, bitcoin arrived just as a class of retail investors in China is growing in size, and seeking better returns than those offered by a restricted financial products market. Even the market for property in China’s top-tier coastal cities, usually reliable for spectacular returns, has been subjected to ever tightening lending restrictions by a government eager to curb speculation. “[Chinese consumers] have had such limited channels for so long, and [bitcoin] was finally one that was not tightly controlled by the government,” says Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow specializing in Chinese internet finance at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington DC.\n\nOne seasoned observer of the Chinese bitcoin scene concurs. Eric Zhao is an engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai and runs the widely followed Twitter account CN Ledger. Bitcoin became popular almost by default, because of the paucity of products for the Chinese retail investor, he says. “There are not many good investment choices for common people in China. Many people worry about inflation and lots of people feel insecure about their financial status,” he says. “They buy it simply because they believe it will appreciate in value.”\n\nUncorrelated to major asset classes and generally disconnected from the Chinese economy, bitcoin has been hugely attractive to Chinese investors already overweight domestic stocks and property. Indeed, research from Pantera Capital, a venture fund for blockchain companies, shows that bitcoin is almost completely uncorrelated to major equity, debt, and commodity asset classes. “Because [bitcoin] is globally connected, it’s not easily affected by the Chinese economy,” says Isaac Mao, a longtime entrepreneur and investor in China’s technology scene. “It may be the only economic activity fully connected to the global economy.”\n\n(Pantera Capital Bitcoin Letter, June 2016)\n\nCrackdown\n\nThe wild ride on bitcoin in China, however, braked to a stop Sept. 4, when China’s central bank began to take steps to halt domestic bitcoin trading. It started with a ban on “initial coin offerings,” followed by a shutdown of local bitcoin exchanges. China’s authorities have clamped down on bitcoin trading before, most notably in 2014, when the cryptocurrency was on a historic rally driven, in part, by Chinese money.\n\nNow rumors are swirling that a ban on bitcoin mining may be enacted. But if the government has found bitcoin to be a potentially dangerous element in the country’s socio-political mix, why didn’t it crack down before? Instead, it has been relatively tolerant of a technology that was designed to weaken the state’s grip on money.\n\nThe rare true believer in bitcoin’s libertarian properties is Bobby Lee, an American who runs the world’s oldest bitcoin exchange, BTCC, in Shanghai. His firm was forced to shut down domestic trading through its BTCChina arm, although it still runs an exchange for non-Chinese traders. When we spoke before the crackdown in August, Lee was enthusiastic about government regulation, saying it would help the market mature. But he also struck a defiant note, saying that bitcoin’s design made it impossible for China’s regulators to shut down. “There is nothing [the Chinese government] can do. That is the beauty of [bitcoin],” he said.\n\nI pointed out that the government could seize exchanges, and even bitcoin mining facilities, and compel their owners to run certain types of code or mess with transactions, thus damaging the cryptocurrency. Lee was sanguine. “They’ll want to control it, but bitcoin was not meant to be controlled,” he said. “You can make all the rules you want, and the question is, can they be enforced? With guns you can say, let’s make guns illegal. But with bitcoin, there’s nothing physical. It’s information, and there’s plausible deniability.”\n\nThe reality may be more prosaic. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are simply too small to bother the Chinese government much, says Isaac Mao, the investor and entrepreneur and one of China’s earliest bloggers. “The [Chinese Communist Party] doesn’t recognize it as a threat, so bitcoin actually grows very quickly in China,” he told me at a cafe in Hong Kong, where he is now based. “But it’s too small. There is no scale. The market capitalization of bitcoin is about the same as PayPal,” or about $70 billion.\n\nI spoke to Mao in August, but the crackdown doesn’t signal any political threat, writes Chorzempa of the Peterson Institute. It’s more likely that bitcoin trading is just collateral damage from a wider set of restrictions on alternative financial products that have caused billions in consumer losses. Regulators have reigned in not just crypto trading but peer-to-peer loans, trusts, and lending to non-bank institutions this year, Chorzempa writes: “The clampdown thus fits into a broader set of efforts to lessen financial market risks perceived by Chinese policymakers.”\n\nEveryone hates inflation\n\nTo the extent that bitcoin trading and mining is a political statement, it’s a demonstration against inflation. Prices in China grew rapidly in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008, hitting their highest level in decades in 2007. Inflation has moderated since then, but ordinary Chinese say they still feel the pinch.\n\nBitmain’s Micree Zhang, who developed its proprietary mining chips, says worry about inflation chewing up his earnings was one reason why he first became interested in bitcoin. “Before I knew about bitcoin I disliked, and was very worried about, inflation. Especially in China in the last 10 years,” he said when I visited with him at Bitmain’s main facility in Inner Mongolia. “When I discovered bitcoin, I knew it was a good idea, very quickly.”\n\nOne bitcoin user I met in Beijing told me he was attracted to the cryptocurrency because the government couldn’t devalue it by printing more money, unlike the yuan. The Chinese government controls its currency far more tightly than other major economies.\n\nThis level of control can lead to panics. In 2015, the Chinese government devalued the yuan in an attempt to boost economic growth, sending shockwaves through global markets. While today the central bank’s move is seen as astute, at the time Chinese consumers were hit hard, worrying about paying more for everything from Australian beef to New Zealand milk.\n\nDigging for digital gold\n\nChina has been the world’s largest electricity producer since it surpassed the United States in 2011. Cheap electricity is the crucial ingredient for a profitable bitcoin mining operation—and China has it in spades. So it’s no surprise that China has become a world center for the activity.\n\nTake Beijing-based Bitmain, for instance. It’s the world’s biggest bitcoin miner, but the company doesn’t divulge its financial data, and there’s no easy way to find out because its beneficial owner is a trust in the Cayman Islands. But one longtime commentator in the bitcoin space, Jimmy Song, has performed an analysis of the firm’s likely profitability. His estimate: $77 million in mining profits for the firm this year, of which electricity and other operational costs come up to about $23 million.\n\nIt’s estimated that two-thirds of the world’s processing power devoted to mining bitcoin resides in China. These bitcoin mines take the form of giant warehouses filled with thousands of custom-designed machines and chips, all whirring away to check bitcoin transactions and compete for a slice of the 12.5 bitcoins awarded to a miner every 10 minutes. Collectively, bitcoin miners have collected more than $2 billion in revenue over the cryptocurrency’s nine-year lifespan.\n\nBitmain leads the pack as both a creator of bitcoin mining rigs and chips, and an operator of vast server farms. It’s now raised $50 million from marquee Silicon Valley investors including Sequoia Capital to expand to the US—perhaps reducing its exposure to Chinese regulations—and to develop a new set of chips for artificial intelligence.\n\nSheer scale\n\nBitmain’s position as the world’s largest miner is only the tip of Chinese industrial interest on blockchain technology. Last May, a Chinese company called Wanxiang Group, one of the world largest automotive parts makers, sponsored a blockchain hackathon at the Deloitte offices in Rockefeller Center in New York. Wanxiang plans to embed blockchain technology into a new “smart city“—a nine square kilometer plot of land with a planned population of 90,000 people and $30 billion in investment—that it is building from scratch near Hangzhou in eastern China. It was looking for the world’s brightest blockchain developers.\n\nWanxiang was offering $15,000 to teams who came up with an enticing blockchain project for the smart city, with an additional $1 million in funding. As Wanxiang executive Peter Liang clicked through his slides detailing how blockchains would power everything from the city’s electricity grid to its traffic control system and be embedded in Wanxiang’s factories, the handful of programmers in the room grew both skeptical and awed. “It’s so huge, it’s hard to even believe,” one developer told him.\n\nWanxiang isn’t the only Chinese conglomerate with blockchain dreams. Beyond cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, some of China’s biggest firms are betting on the technical ideas behind it to revolutionize their businesses. They’re placing much bigger bets than their counterparts elsewhere in the world, who are mired in small-scale trials, proofs of concepts, or slow moving consortia. Chinese companies “are not only moving faster, but the scale of their blockchain ambitions dwarf what we’re seeing elsewhere,” says Garrick Hileman, of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce giant JD has already launched a food supply tracking system using a blockchain in Beijing supermarkets and online stores. The tech giant Tencent has partnered with Intel to develop a blockchain architecture. And the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, has said it’s researching blockchain technology as a way to potentially digitize the yuan.\n\nCalligraphy facilities (Jack Liao)\n\nBlockchains for industry\n\nUnlike firms elsewhere in the world, Chinese companies sense an opportunity to unify the fragmented data flows flowing through their stupendously large and complicated factory floors and supply chains by marrying a blockchain data layer with Internet of Things devices. Conveniently, these applications are also free of the regulation and scrutiny that can slow down financial applications. “I personally believe that non-financial [applications] will go commercial sooner,” says Vincent Wang, Wanxiang’s chief innovation officer.\n\nTaiwan’s Foxconn, one of the world’s largest contract manufacturers of electronics and best known for manufacturing Apple’s iPhone, sees blockchain as way for its suppliers to get easy financing. “In China, 85% of SMEs can’t get financing,” Foxconn executive Jack Lee told a conference in New York in May. “They have to go to shadow banking … so it’s very inefficient and costly.” If Foxconn can leverage its current data on small businesses through blockchain, it could create a highly efficient supply chain that could also track delivered goods.\n\nJust as mobile phones allowed China and emerging economies to leapfrog the rich world’s telephone landlines, blockchain technologies could help its industries skip the development of antiquated financial services models. After all, Chinese tech firms Alibaba and Tencent are already processing trillions of dollars through their mobile payments businesses. “We are more interested in getting to a next-generation financial services business,” Foxconn’s Lee says. “That’s the key. As a side benefit for Foxconn, it will streamline the supply chain.”\n\nThose kinds of observations make less worrisome the recent drop in China’s share of bitcoin trading volume as well as rumors on Telegram chat groups about an imminent crackdown on even China’s powerful bitcoin miners. Because Chinese money’s waning influence over the bitcoin markets may be replaced by control over an even greater prize.\n\nAs it continues to move from a rural to an industrial economy, China needs to leapfrog the incumbents and assert itself as a technology leader. Bitcoin and the ideas behind its blockchain may be one way to do that—and it may be why China has been a leader of a stateless cryptocurrency for so long.', 'Japan’s Financial Services Agency has officially licensed 11 bitcoin exchanges as part of the government’s move to bring cryptocurrency trading under supervision following its decision to legalize bitcoin as a legal payment method in April.\n\nAccording to reports, the licensed bitcoin exchanges will have to comply with a range of requirements, including building a strong computer system, segregating customer accounts and checking the identity of customers, the last to assure that the exchanges are not used for money laundering.\n\nA full list of which bitcoin exchanges were awarded licenses were not available at the time of writing, but it is known that Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange bitFlyer Inc. was on the list along with QUOINE Corp.\n\n“Japan has been exploding with demand for both bitcoin trading as well as virtual currency services,” bitFlyer said in a statement. “The FSA’s approval for bitFlyer to operate as a Registered Virtual Currency Exchange, and the agency’s openness and forward thinking regulation could not come at a better time for the Blockchain space.”\n\nMike Kayamori, chief executive officer and co-founder of QUIONE, said in a separate statement that “as the first global crypto fintech company to be fully licensed with the JFSA, we will keep on working hand in hand with regulators and other stakeholders towards the healthy development of the cryptocurrency industry within Japan and on a global scale.”\n\n“Protection of customers’ assets is of the highest priority to us,” he added. “With our JFSA license, this is a positive market signal that we are here to build a trusted exchange, with proper compliance measures in place to prevent security breaches and provide more asset protection for our customers.”\n\nJapan’s move to license bitcoin exchanges comes at a time its neighbors in Asia have moved in the opposite direction, restricting and in some cases outright banning the use of cryptocurrencies. China started the trend, first banning initial coin offerings before going further and banning bitcoin exchanges altogether. South Korea is currently going down a similar path, having also banned ICOs with speculation that it may extend that ban to general cryptocurrency trading as well.\n\nPhoto: geralt/Pixabay', ""A gang of youngsters, who thought they could make a quick buck by posing as Bitcoin traders and robbing businessmen, have been arrested by the Delhi police.\n\nModus operandi\n\nA group of six people who posed as Bitcoin traders and robbed a businessman of INR 3.6 mln ($55,000) have been arrested by the police in Delhi, the capital of India. The businessman had earlier registered his personal details on LocalBitcoins.com. He received a call from a woman, who introduced herself as Karishma Rajput and offered to sell him Bitcoins at a very good price. When the businessman met her with cash at a mall to complete the transaction, he was led to an apartment in the nearby town of Ghaziabad, where he was robbed. He was then thrashed and let off with a warning not to approach the police.\n\nBanking on silence of the victims\n\nThis particular gang had robbed two other persons before running out of luck. Often, the victims who are robbed hesitate to approach the police if the money which has been robbed is unaccounted for. They are then wary about disclosing the source of the money robbed to the police, which might result in the police taking action against them. These criminals were banking on the victims not approaching the police but were unlucky the third time. The police arrested six gang members, which included a bankrupt property salesman, a law college graduate and his girlfriend.\n\nToo good to be true\n\nThe gang of robbers offered to sell the businessman Bitcoins at Rs 72,000 ($1,100), which is a whopping 70 percent discount to the current market price of Bitcoin. This should set alarm bells ringing in any rational person's mind. They offered further discounts if the businessman paid in cash, instead of bank transfer. Unfortunately, this businessman took the bait and agreed to buy the Bitcoins. When something looks too good to be true, it definitely isn't in the crypto world."", 'Altcoins\n\nThe controversy surrounding Tether continues, despite the company’s release of an “internal memorandum regarding consulting services.” The issuer of USDT has been the subject of continual scrutiny in recent months following a sharp increase in the number of tokens issued, despite the company enduring significant banking issues.\n\nAlso Read: Tether’s Messy USD `Peg´ May Be a Liability for Bitfinex\n\nTether Recently Released an Internal Memorandum in an Attempt to Quell Accusations of Shady Practices Surrounding the Creation of USDT Tokens\n\nThe report was written by Friedman LLP (FLLP), and purports to detail the company’s “cash and token balances as of September 15th, 2017”. At the time of writing, Tether’s total market capitalization was approximately $437 million USD.\n\nThe memo has received scrutiny from prominent Tether-skeptic, Bitcrypto’ed. In an article published on Medium, Bitcrypto’ed emphasizes that, in the company’s own words, the report “do[es] not constitute an audit or attestation engagement” and that the information “is intended solely to assist the management of Tether Limited… and is not intended to be, and should not be, used or relied upon by any other party.” The author cites additional evidence to support the lack of legal substance underpinning the release, quoting the company as stating “FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the clients ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than tether token redemptions.”\n\nThe article points out that unlike Tether’s March release which provided unaltered records of relevant associated bank accounts, the recent memorandum does not provide the names of the institutions with which the company is conducting its banking. The author also draws attention to the repeated use of the phrase “for the benefit of Tether Limited”, speculating that one of the company’s accounts purported to hold more than $60 million USD is likely “in reality under another name, like a trust, as Tether itself can’t get banking.” Bitcrypto’ed accuses Tether company of deliberately concealing the identity of the financial institution with which they are banking, warning that “in the case anything goes wrong, [customers] don’t know what bank or jurisdiction to file a lawsuit against them in.”\n\nThe Number of USDT Tokens in Circulation Has Increased By Approximately 500% Since Announcements of Tether’s Banking Issues\n\nIn late April, Tether announced that “since April 18, 2017, all incoming international wires to Tether have been blocked and refused by our Taiwanese banks.” The company has not provided a detailed explanation on how it has resolved its banking issues or if it has even done so.\n\nIn light of Tether’s assertion that “every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in [the company’s] reserves”, Bitcrypto’ed accuses the company of using a fractional reserve system in order to inflate the supply of tokens – asserting that the banking problems experienced by the company would have made it extremely difficult to access the volume of liquidity required to drive the recent surge in USDT supply.\n\nThe Ownership Structure Pertaining to Bitfinex and Tether Is Convoluted\n\nAccording to a post on Reddit, the Linkedin profile of Tether’s co-founder, Reeve Collins, previously stated that “Tether was acquired by Bitfinex.” On September 14, Bitfinex stated that “Bitfinex is owned & operated by iFinex Inc.” However, analysis provided on Twitter by Blockswater would suggest that both companies would ultimately be controlled by Digfinex Inc. This obfuscation of the ownership structures surrounding Bitfinex has intensified perceptions that the company is seeking to evade transparency pertaining to its operations.\n\nBitcrypto’ed had previously pointed out that Tether’s website clearly states that “Tethers are not money… monetary instruments[, and] are also not stored value or currency”, before adding that “there is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers.”\n\nDo you use USDT as a hedging tool?

For long-term investors, it is possible to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies through individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, which have several benefits over simply buying digital currencies on a bitcoin exchange.\n\nHere\'s an introduction to digital IRAs, the broader category of self-directed IRAs, and reasons you might want to use (or not use) an IRA to invest in digital currencies.\n\nWhat is a digital IRA?\n\nA digital IRA is a type of self-directed individual retirement account that is designed to allow investors to invest in digital currencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum. The IRS characterizes digital currencies such as bitcoin as personal property, which allows for them to be held and treated as investments, so allowing for their investment in an IRA is a logical next step.\n\nBecause digital IRAs are relatively new, I recently spoke with George Harris and Andy Klein of digital IRA provider First Digital IRA to learn more about this new option for retirement savers.\n\nNot just for digital currencies\n\nThis is perhaps the most important point to know about digital IRAs. One popular misconception, and one that I admit I had before speaking with the First Digital IRA team, is that the digital IRA concept is intended so that investors can open an IRA that only holds digital currencies. In other words, I thought that a client might deposit $3,000 in a new IRA and invest the entire sum in bitcoin. That is 100% false.\n\nIn fact, First Digital\'s team tells me that most people who have opened digital IRAs allocate just a small percentage of their assets to bitcoin and other digital currencies -- they simply want to have it as an option.\n\nSelf-directed IRAs are different from what you would normally think of when you hear the term ""IRA,"" in that a much wider variety of investments are available. In a self-directed digital IRA, you can hold investments such as the traditional choices of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, as well as other assets such as real estate, private businesses, and precious metals, just to name a few. In other words, self-directed IRAs, such as the digital IRAs First Digital IRA offers, give investors a tremendous ability to diversify their retirement assets.\n\nTo be clear, self-directed IRAs have their pros and cons, and if you\'re interested in learning more, here\'s an excellent explanation from my colleague Dan Caplinger.\n\nReasons to use an IRA to invest in digital currencies\n\nAs someone who has purchased bitcoin through an exchange -- Coinbase, to be specific -- and found the process to be fast and convenient, I asked the team at First Digital IRA why someone might be better off investing through an IRA.\n\nThe most obvious reason to use a digital IRA to invest in digital currencies, as opposed to simply buying them through an exchange, is for the tax advantages. For as long as your money stays in the IRA, you won\'t pay any tax on profits your investments earn. You only may have to pay tax when you eventually take a distribution.\n\nOn the same topic, a self-directed digital IRA can be structured as either a traditional or Roth IRA, so you can choose whether you want your tax deduction now or if you would rather have tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The same rules apply as with a conventional IRA, in terms of contribution limits and withdrawal restrictions.\n\nAnother advantage is the ability to buy an unlimited amount of digital currency almost instantly. Exchanges tend to set limits for most customers, and in fact, I use Coinbase and my daily bitcoin purchase limit is $100. With a digital IRA, this isn\'t an issue.\n\nFinally, another big advantage is security. Without getting too deep into the technical side of digital currency security, First Digital IRA stores all of investors\' digital currencies in heavily encrypted wallets. Simply put, it\'s extremely difficult for thieves to break through the type of security First Digital has in place.\n\nShould you use a digital IRA?\n\nI\'ve written many times before that while the vast majority of anyone\'s retirement assets should be in blue-chip stocks, bonds, and similar lower-risk assets, there\'s nothing wrong with speculating with a small portion of your savings -- as long as it\'s with money that you can afford to lose if things don\'t go your way. After all, bitcoin has risen from roughly $200 to nearly $4,000 in just a few years, and it\'s certainly not impossible for the opposite to happen. I\'ve made the case before that bitcoin could potentially be worth $1 million someday, but to be clear, I think it\'s equally likely that it could be worth far less than it is now.\n\nMy point is that it isn\'t a bad idea to use a digital IRA to invest in bitcoin or another digital currency, provided that:\n\nYou thoroughly understand digital currencies and the risk involved with them. ""A digital IRA is appropriate for someone who is educated about digital currencies and understands what they\'re getting into,"" says Klein.\n\nYou open your digital IRA with a reputable company. As Harris says, ""Buyer beware. If you decide to invest in digital currencies, be sure to work with a reputable company -- preferably one registered with the Treasury as an MSB [Money Services Business].""\n\nYou only put a reasonably small amount of your savings into digital currencies. Bitcoin, and especially other digital currencies, are still in the early days, and can be rather volatile. For example, if you\'ve determined that you\'ll need $1 million to retire comfortably, and you\'d still be on track to reach that target without the money you invest in digital currencies\n\nIn a nutshell, a bitcoin IRA can work as a small complement to an existing, well-rounded retirement portfolio, but it\'s important to understand the pros and cons of self-directed IRAs, as well as to have a basic knowledge of digital currencies and the risks involved with investing in them.', 'CLOSE Take a look at the Rochester Hills home being sold by rap star Eminem. Elissa Robinson/DFP\n\nEminem at the Palace of Auburn Hills, Oct. 29, 2000. Photo by Amy E. Powers/Special to the Free Press. (Photo: Amy E. Powers, Special to the Free Presss)\n\nDaring to dream big is part of the deal these days when it comes to pitching a piece of the action on everything from Eminem to Bitcoin.\n\nBut before you start seeing dollar signs, know the big risks associated with buzzworthy deals. After all, everyone’s looking for the next cutting-edge thing but don’t lose your money in the moment.\n\nRoyalty Flow is a new enterprise that\'s aiming to ""acquire and manage royalty interests in media assets,"" according to its website.\n\nWe\'re not looking at anything near the frenzy of Bitcoin. But Royalty Flow\'s ""mini-IPO"" is building buzz with talk of acquiring royalties from Eminem\'s recording catalog from 1999-2013 — including the iconic Marshall Mathers LP released in 2000.\n\n""Because of streaming, we believe that the music industry is on the cusp of a bull market that hasn\'t been seen since the invention of CDs,"" states Royalty Flow, which is a subsidiary of Royalty Exchange, an online marketplace for music and media royalties.\n\nFinding a hot idea, such as digital music streaming or virtual currency, seems appealing during the height of a bull market as the Dow Jones Industrial Average trades well above 22,000.\n\nWhat hip-hop investors need to know is that the Royalty Flow deal isn\'t a typical stock offering. It\'s an SEC-registered Regulation A+ offering, which went into effect in 2015 to offer a streamlined process that enables upstarts to raise up to $50 million from investors.\n\nThe Royalty Flow deal isn\'t a Kickstarter project. But it\'s not a stock offering that will undergo more rigorous regulations at the state or federal level, either.\n\nOffering documents will be reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission before the company is allowed to sell securities.\n\nRoyalty Flow’s offering would begin after the SEC qualifies the filing, which the company expects will happen later in October.\n\nThe parent company, Royal Exchange, would own a minimum of 20% of Royalty Flow. But ordinary investors, like you and me, could very much be part of the deal. The company said the minimum investment is $2,250 for 150 shares or $15 a share.\n\nFans who are interested can go to royaltyipo.com. No money is being solicited now.\n\nThe company\'s fund-raising target is $11 million to $25 million.\n\nNot surprisingly, it helps if a ""mini-IPO"" has popular appeal, such as hit songs. On the upside, more superstars could come on board at some point, too.\n\nThe latest move brings back memories of the old ""Bowie Bonds."" David Bowie raised $55 million in 1997 by turning to Wall Street to roll out a bond deal involving royalties from his back catalog.\n\nBut Eminem is not involved in this offering and has no connection to Royalty Flow, according to a statement that Dennis Dennehy, Eminem\'s spokesperson, provided to NPR.\n\nBut there are Eminem-specific risks in the Royalty Flow campaign.\n\nSomething out there could damage Eminem\'s reputation — and cut into the cash generated through royalties.\n\nWhat happens if his music is no longer popular? The cash flow can be highly unpredictable, according to Nanalyze.com, an investment forum.\n\nKat Liu, research analyst at the Chicago investment firm IPOX Schuster, said the risks to investors are higher with Regulation A+ offerings because the mini-IPOs do not have to comply with state blue sky laws that regulate the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud.\n\nAs for specific risks associated with Royalty Flow, Liu noted that the company will need to acquire more catalog and media assets in addition to Eminem\'s catalog. Proceeds from the mini-IPO will be used to buy up to 25% of Eminem music royalty rights from producers Mark and Jeff Bass, the brothers who signed the rapper in 1995.\n\nShares are to be listed on a public stock exchange — possibly NASDAQ or an over-the-counter exchange.\n\nBut Liu said the investment itself is likely to be valued more on any future potential dividend payout, not stock growth.\n\nExperts in the Regulation A+ space note that you\'re not looking at any short-term pop in value, as you might with a typical IPO.\n\nSallie Jian, vice president for SeedInvest in New York, said investors may need to wait five to 10 years to see shares climb in value.\n\nThe potential for making more money exists much later when the company might go through the process for a traditional IPO, repurchases shares or take part in a merger or acquisition, she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nBig dreams, of course, aren\'t limited to the royalties of rappers. We\'re hearing plenty of buzz about Bitcoin and ICOs — or initial coin offerings — too.\n\nBut the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has issued an alert about the risk of investing in a company trying to raise capital to create and distribute virtual coins. Some ICO pitches may be from unlicensed individuals, according to the SEC.\n\nOn Friday, the SEC charged a business owner and two companies with defrauding investors as part of initial coin offerings purportedly backed by real estate and diamonds.\n\nThe SEC alleges that Maksim Zaslavskiy and his companies have been selling unregistered securities. Regulators charged that investors in REcoin Group Foundation and DRC World (also known as Diamond Reserve Club) have been pitched promises of significant returns but no real operations exist.\n\nThe Bitcoin buzz is huge — so huge that Yale economics professor Robert J. Shiller, who spoke at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business on Sept. 14, told me then that he\'d say Bitcoin was in a speculative bubble.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency, created in 2009, that can be used to buy goods or services with relative anonymity and without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.\n\nBitcoin has skyrocketed in value from $1,000 in early 2017 to around $4,165 in late September.\n\nBut Shiller, a Nobel Prize winning economist, is worth listening to since he successfully warned of the dot-com stock bubble in his book ""Irrational Exuberance,"" published in March 2000. Shiller is also credited with being able to call the housing bubble well in advance.\n\nShiller wrote in his column in the New York Times in September that conversations in the financial universe about Bitcoin have gone viral twice, once in 2013, and again this year. But Bitcoin\'s total market value is less than $100 billion, so Shiller wrote that potential problems in the virtual coin market aren\'t likely to impact the vastly larger stock market.\n\nBut realistically, we\'re talking about digital angst here, new technologies and a wonderful opportunity for con artists to dupe investors with some virtual currency offerings.\n\nBuzz is one thing — but it\'s never enough of a reason to part with your money.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

The key innovation is how it reduces the need for central third-party institutions to serve as central authorities of trust — banks, courts, large corporations, stock markets and even governments, for example.\n\nDistributed trust enables co-operative forms of organization without a centre. It can distribute power away from centralized institutions to those that traditionally have less power. Such powerful institutions do not let go of their influence easily.\n\nThe ongoing debate about how to regulate distributed trust technologies assumes that the advocates of the technologies will seek both legal status and enforceability. Scholars propose that such developments in distributed trust are a competitive threat to nation-state paper currencies.\n\nMuch of the current, popular focus is on cryptographic currency — or cryptocurrency — applications such as Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin vs. banks\n\nRegulators are struggling to deal with a fundamental shift in market structure. National central banks are implementing policies to keep control and regulate distributed trust technology.\n\nFor example, the Chinese government has banned several types of distributed trust activities, and is launching its own non-distributed, centralized digital currency.\n\nThe Japanese government has made Bitcoin a legal payment method, and major Japanese banks are planning to launch a J-Coin digital currency pegged to the Yen which may be built on a blockchain.\n\nRussia initially treated non-approved currency trades as illegal, but is now determining how to regulate them.\n\nIn fact, traditional centralized, powerful organizations like banks, governments, regulators and technology behemoths are all spending billions figuring out how to use and control distributed trust technologies.\n\nBut distributed trust technologies have many uses beyond cryptocurrency.\n\nVolunteer-driven communities\n\nOrganizational theory has a lot to say about this transition. Distributed trust technologies are organized in what we call a Community Form (C-Form) of organization.\n\nC-Forms are not new. They have been around since the 1800s when the Oxford English Dictionary was created by a distributed community of volunteers.\n\nThe growth of C-Forms was accelerated by technological developments enabling inexpensive peer-to-peer communication. C-Forms came into focus with the last internet-enabled major organizational shift to distributed information-creation platforms.\n\nAs a result of that innovation, we have seen many forms of information production shift to C-Forms. Open source software such as the Linux computer operating system, which competes with Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS, is produced and shared by individuals in C-Forms instead of centralized software companies. Encyclopedias such as Wikipedia are created by individuals in a C-Form instead of a centralized publishing house. Video content on Vimeo is produced and shared by individuals in a C-Form instead of centralized studios.\n\nSimilarly, distributed trust technologies are shifting the organizational landscape of how trust is produced and managed from centralized institutions to a C-Form.\n\nThe development of distributed trust technologies is having a similar enabling effect on the growth of C-Forms replacing the trust functions of centralized institutions.\n\nFundamentally, this is a decentralization of power.\n\nPower shift\n\nMany of our previous assumptions about formal organization are being challenged by shifts to distributed forms of trust.\n\nIndividuals can now enter into direct peer-to-peer trusted exchanges with strangers. They no longer need a central institution to vouch for the other party. A blockchain-enabled microgrid in Brooklyn is already allowing individuals to sell their excess solar energy directly to neighbours without involving a central utility company.\n\nThis is a drastic shift to many of the underlying assumptions about how markets and society are organized. As power centralizes, opportunities emerge.\n\nMany Silicon Valley success stories are simply centralized platforms. They capitalize on the power and legitimacy of enabling trusted interactions for others.\n\n(Shutterstock)\n\nCentralization creates new opportunities\n\nJust as Uber matches riders to drivers, Facebook matches consumers to advertisers. This centralization of power has created an opportunity for distributed trust.\n\nThe major platforms stand to lose their power as distributed trust takes hold. Such powerful organizations will no longer be needed.\n\nBut those in power tend to try to hold onto power.\n\nMicrosoft faced a challenge to its centralized market power as open-source software C-Forms grew. The “Halloween Documents” were internal Microsoft communications about responding to the strategic threat of open-source software. One tactic detailed was “FUD” (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).\n\nWe are now seeing similar responses to distributed trust technologies.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a “fraud,” and claims governments are going to close down “crypto things.” He is being accused of market abuse in Sweden by a company called Blockswater. Blockswater alleges he “deliberately spread false and misleading information.”\n\nIn other words, Dimon is being accused of creating FUD.\n\nThe future of distributed trust\n\nWe used to assume that large centralized organizations had legitimacy and power. But that’s starting to change. As distributed trust technologies develop, we will continue to see this power shift.\n\nWe must question the role of centralized organizations in a time of distributed trust. The key now is to ensure that we use insights from organizational theory, and sociology, to shape our joint societal future in a world of distributed trust.\n\nIt’s a world where the role of powerful central institutions will be greatly diminished. With such insight, we will be able to design a more equitable future for all.', 'European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi stated that the agency does not have the authority to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nECB Does Not Have Authority to Regulate Bitcoin\n\nDraghi made these comments in a meeting of the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Although Draghi’s formal statement did not address cryptocurrency, a committee member asked him to reveal what approach the ECB intends to take toward cryptocurrencies, in light of China’s recent ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), as well as more conciliatory stances from Japan and Mexico, among others.\n\nDraghi replied that the European Central Bank has not yet discussed the implications of cryptocurrency. However, he said that if it later decided to analyze the risks of digital currency, the bank would take the same approach as with all financial innovations: examine the technology’s scale, usage, and impact on the European economy.\n\nHe added that it is not within the ECB’s powers to prohibit or regulate bitcoin.\n\n“Certainly it’s not within our powers to prohibit or to do something of the nature…or to regulate” bitcoin,” he said, “but we didn’t have a discussion on an institutional view of” cryptocurrency.\n\nHe added that the ECB’s greatest fear with cryptocurrency and other FinTech projects is the risk of cyber attacks. This latter comment reinforces a recent statement from the European Commission announcing the creation of a pan-European Cybersecurity Agency.\n\nIncluded within the agency’s directives will be a mandate to “strengthen the ability of law enforcement authorities to tackle [monetary fraud] by expanding the scope of the offences related to information systems to all payment transactions, including transactions through virtual currencies.”\n\nGovernments Clarify Positions on Cryptocurrency\n\nAlthough Draghi declined to issue specific guidance on cryptocurrency usage, many governments have begun to clarify their positions on the growing digital currency ecosystem. China has adopted a strict stance toward cryptocurrency, as evidenced by its blanket ban on initial coin offerings and bitcoin exchanges. Others, however, have been more accommodating.\n\nEarlier this year, Japan adopted cryptocurrency-friendly regulations that have led to a surge in bitcoin adoption within the country. Mexico is working on regulations intended to help the FinTech industry grow at a healthy pace. Malaysia is also reportedly planning to legalize and regulate digital currency usage, potentially introducing millions of new users into the cryptocurrency community.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Prominent venture capital firm and growth stage investor Institutional Venture Partners (IVP) has revealed its new $1.5 billion fund that will focus on early-stage startups in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency sectors.\n\nOver the past two years, IVP has experienced significant success in funding bitcoin startups. In August 2017, IVP invested $100 million in Coinbase, the world’s largest bitcoin wallet platform and a major cryptocurrency trading platform, valuing the company at $1.6 billion. In the upcoming months, IVP intends to aggressively pursue investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, providing startups with necessary infrastructure and capital for operating at a larger scale and expanding internationally.\n\nWith the latest $100 million funding round provided by IVP, Coinbase fulfilled the promise of its CEO, Brian Armstrong, to drastically improve its customer support. For the first time in the company’s history, Coinbase released a live phone support system for its customers in mid-September, after receiving hundreds of complaints through regulated government financial regulators.\n\nAs it did with Coinbase, IVP and its partners are aiming to provide companies with resources they need to evolve into multi-billion dollar companies. In the past decade, IVP has produced some of the technology market’s most iconic startups including SnapChat operator Snap and AppDynamics, which was recently acquired for $3.7 billion. Forbes further reported that IVP invested in more than 20 billion dollar startups apart from Coinbase, Domo, Slack, Snap, and The Honest Company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe newly created $1.5 billion cryptocurrency fund will be managed by long-time IVP partners including IVP general partner Todd Chaffee. He explained that the firm wants to be a part of the rise of cryptocurrencies and the exponential growth of bitcoin. In regards to the naysayers in the traditional finance sector such as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Chaffee stated, “it feels like the rise of computing did [fuel the cryptocurrency industry]. I think Jamie Dimon is wrong.”\n\nVenture Capital Firms in the Cryptocurrency Sector: Can They Coexist With ICOs?\n\nOn August 9, 2017, initial coin offerings (ICOs) surpassed the amount of investment raised by venture capital firms within the cryptocurrency sector. CNBC reported that 92 ICOs in 2017 raised $1.25 billion, securing more funds from crowd sales than early-stage venture capital firms.\n\n“ICO as a new business model leveraging blockchain technology will sustain as the digital way, combining crowdfunding and (a) new hybrid asset class of equity ownership and currency,” Oliver Bussmann, a former chief information officer at UBS, told CNBC.\n\nBut, venture capital firms and ICOs could still coexist. In the Bitcoin industry specifically, the majority of startups are directly dealing with bitcoin as a cryptocurrency, unlike in the Ethereum ecosystem wherein startups focus on building completely new applications on top of the decentralized Ethereum protocol. Thus, startups in the bitcoin industry such as mining firms, exchanges, trading platforms, and payment service providers will need venture capital funding to expand their services and maintain their operations, as ERC20 tokens will not be applicable to their business models.\n\nFor instance, the services offered by Bitcoin startup Xapo and Ethereum-based platform Token Card are nearly identical. Xapo offers bitcoin wallet and Visa debit card services, while Token Card allows users to spend cryptocurrencies by connecting consumer wallets with debit cards. Token Card conducted an ICO campaign to sell its tokens that are used as a native currency in the platform. But, Xapo, a company that has been offering similar services to Token Card since 2016, did not run an ICO campaign because it did not need native tokens to operate its platform.']"
10/02/2017,"['Even as China shutters Bitcoin exchanges and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission signals heavier scrutiny of initial coin offerings, clients of trading giant Goldman Sachs are still trying to get in on the cryptocurrency trade.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal citing people with knowledge of the matter, the banking giant is reportedly considering a new trading operation involving cryptocurrency thanks to increased interest in digital currencies. Potentially, the operation under consideration could become a full-fledged team of traders and sales people.\n\nSuch an operation would make Goldman the first Wall Street giant to directly deal with cryptocurrency, according to the Journal.\n\n“In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them in the space,” a Goldman Sachs representative said in a statement.\n\nInterest in Bitcoin has indeed risen in the U.S., with the cryptocurrency trading at about $4,400 Monday, up roughly 341% since the start of 2017. Meanwhile, investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Union Square Ventures have all gotten involved in cryptocurrency.\n\nGoldman Sachs has also been ahead of the curve in addressing bitcoin as an investment in comparison to other trading giants. Goldman Sachs is likely the only banking giant with a Bitcoin analyst issuing price targets.\n\nJ.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon on the other hand again dubbed Bitcoin a “fraud” recently, though his company is still catering to his clients’ fear of missing out. The banking giant has still been routing customer orders for an exchange-traded note tracking Bitcoin, but notably not the cryptocurrency itself.', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\n* BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\n\nThe Chinese traders don’t want to miss the action in trading cryptocurrencies. Therefore, they are moving over to Hong Kong as the Chinese exchanges shut down.\n\nElsewhere, Japan, South Korea and the US are moving ahead with steps that will promote the digital currency markets. As a result of these positive steps, the virtual currencies continue their march higher.\n\nSo, has the pullback run its course or is there more steam left? Let’s see.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nTraders who followed our previous recommendations would have entered long positions around $3,900 and $4,120, levels marked on the chart via ellipse. Though both the positions are in profit and our target objective is $4,680, we recommend selling about 30 percent of the position at the current levels of $4,418 and raising the stop loss on the rest to $4,000.\n\nThat way, our entire remaining position will become risk-free and we will also pocket some profit.\n\nOur first target objective is $4,680, where we shall book profits on another 20 percent of the position because we expect some resistance to creep in.\n\nIf Bitcoin breaks out of the $4,680 levels, it is likely to retest the highs, where we plan to book profits on the remaining 50 percent of our original position.\n\nOn a fall, the digital currency will find support in the $4,000 to $4,165 zone. Once $4,000 level breaks, the virtual currency can extend its fall to $3,850 and thereafter to $3,600 levels.\n\nETH/USD\n\nWe don’t have any live trades in Ethereum. The digital currency has been consolidating in a tight range of about $280 to $310 for the past seven days. This tight range will soon resolve itself either to the upside or downside.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency breaks out of $317 levels, it will gain momentum and quickly rally to $344, where we expect some resistance to creep in. If this level is crossed, then a move to $400 to $420 levels is likely. Therefore, we recommend buying at $317.\n\nHowever, if Ethereum breaks down of the uptrend line, it will invalidate the bullish pattern and a move to lower levels of $255 is likely. Therefore, we want to keep a stop loss just below the trendline at $275 once our buy levels are triggered.\n\nWe recommend tightening the stop loss if the virtual currency struggles to breakout of $344 levels.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nThe level of interest in Bitcoin Cash has dwindled down, which has resulted in a range bound action in the last few days. The cryptocurrency is even finding it difficult to rally to the highs of the range.\n\nFor the past few days it has remained in the lower half of the range. Therefore, we don’t recommend any trading positions in Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWe shall resume trading in Bitcoin Cash if it breaks out of the range or if it strengthens the range with two touches on the upper end of the range and two bounces off the lower end of the range.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nRipple is testing our patience, as it has been range bound for the past five days. Our long positions are at a marginal loss. We want to raise our stop loss to $0.18500 levels because if the digital currency breaks down of the small uptrend line, it can correct to $0.16600 levels.\n\nThe cryptocurrency will gain strength above $0.22000 levels. Our target objective remains $0.25000.\n\nWe don’t see any pattern developing on ripple. Therefore, lackluster trading is likely to continue for a few more days.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nWe don’t have any trades on Litecoin because it never reached our buy levels of $58.\n\nThe digital currency did not breakout of the ascending triangle. The pattern is now invalid as the price has broken down of the uptrend line. Litecoin is likely to remain in the range of $44 and $57.\n\nWe have two trade recommendations on Litecoin. First is a buy at $58 with a stop loss of $50, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the range.\n\nHowever, if Litecoin falls to the lower end of range before breaking out of it, we shall buy around $44 and keep an SL of $40. For this trade, our target objective is $57.', '1. Virtual currencies\n\nLet us start with virtual currencies. To be clear, this is not about digital payments in existing currencies—through Paypal and other “e-money” providers such as Alipay in China, or M-Pesa in Kenya.\n\nVirtual currencies are in a different category, because they provide their own unit of account and payment systems. These systems allow for peer-to-peer transactions without central clearinghouses, without central banks.\n\nFor now, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin pose little or no challenge to the existing order of fiat currencies and central banks. Why? Because they are too volatile, too risky, too energy intensive, and because the underlying technologies are not yet scalable. Many are too opaque for regulators; and some have been hacked.\n\nBut many of these are technological challenges that could be addressed over time. Not so long ago, some experts argued that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets would only be used as expensive coffee trays. So I think it may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies.\n\nBetter value for money?\n\nFor instance, think of countries with weak institutions and unstable national currencies. Instead of adopting the currency of another country—such as the U.S. dollar—some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0.\n\nIMF experience shows that there is a tipping point beyond which coordination around a new currency is exponential. In the Seychelles, for example, dollarization jumped from 20 percent in 2006 to 60 percent in 2008.\n\nAnd yet, why might citizens hold virtual currencies rather than physical dollars, euros, or sterling? Because it may one day be easier and safer than obtaining paper bills, especially in remote regions. And because virtual currencies could actually become more stable.\n\nFor instance, they could be issued one-for-one for dollars, or a stable basket of currencies. Issuance could be fully transparent, governed by a credible, pre-defined rule, an algorithm that can be monitored…or even a “smart rule” that might reflect changing macroeconomic circumstances.\n\nSo in many ways, virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money. The best response by central bankers is to continue running effective monetary policy, while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.\n\nBetter payment services?\n\nFor example, consider the growing demand for new payment services in countries where the shared, decentralized service economy is taking off.\n\nThis is an economy rooted in peer-to-peer transactions, in frequent, small-value payments, often across borders.\n\nFour dollars for gardening tips from a lady in New Zealand, three euros for an expert translation of a Japanese poem, and 80 pence for a virtual rendering of historic Fleet Street: these payments can be made with credit cards and other forms of e-money. But the charges are relatively high for small-value transactions, especially across borders.\n\nInstead, citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash—no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities. If privately issued virtual currencies remain risky and unstable, citizens may even call on central banks to provide digital forms of legal tender.\n\nSo, when the new service economy comes knocking on the Bank of England’s door, will you welcome it inside? Offer it tea—and financial liquidity?', 'The US government may follow the roadmap of Japan in regulating trading activities around cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nLast week, the Japanese government and its financial regulator the Financial Services Agency (FSA) officially authorized and licensed 11 cryptocurrency exchanges including BitFlyer, the country’s largest trading platform with over 800,000 users.\n\nIn a statement, Yuzo Kano, the CEO at BitFlyer, emphasized that the establishment of practical regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and investors by the Japanese government would allow the country’s cryptocurrency market to position itself at the epicenter of global cryptocurrency trading, development, and innovation.\n\n“Japan has been exploding with demand for both bitcoin trading as well as virtual currency services. The FSA’s approval for bitFlyer to operate as a Registered Virtual Currency Exchange, and the agency’s openness and forward thinking regulation could not come at a better time for the blockchain space,” said Kano.\n\nGovernments Can Either Do Nothing or Create a Fair Ecosystem For Exchanges\n\nEarlier this year, at the Blockchain NZ conference held in Auckland, New Zealand, bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos explained that governments can either leave the cryptocurrency exchange sector as is or create a more transparent, fair, and efficient environment for businesses.\n\n“Governments can choose to either do nothing – which is okay; make things worse for cryptocurrency trading – like what Australia did by imposing sales taxes on all cryptocurrency transactions; or they can make things easier for companies by reining in the banks and encouraging companies by creating a level playing field,” said Antonopoulos.\n\nBy authorizing and licensing cryptocurrency exchanges, the Japanese government has officially recognized cryptocurrency exchanges as regulated financial service providers, allowing the companies to fully operate as legal financial companies within the country. Already, within less than a week, the optimistic approach from Japan’s FSA in regulating cryptocurrency markets has triggered an increase in demand toward bitcoin and as a result, the daily trading volume of Japan, the largest bitcoin exchange market in the world, has risen at a rapid rate. The growing demand toward bitcoin is also evident in the price trend of bitcoin, as the bitcoin price surpassed the $4,470 mark earlier today, on October 2.\n\nThe US Government May Follow Japan in Licensing Exchanges\n\nAt an event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika told reporters that he is open toward cryptocurrency exchanges applying for bank status. Noreika also noted that he is considering the imposition of a nationwide licensing program for cryptocurrency exchanges, eliminating regional licenses such as New York’s BitLicense and releasing a unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading platforms and investors.\n\n“I wouldn’t be adverse to those people coming in and talking to the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] about how a charter could make sense for them. But that is a long process they’d have to go through, and just because you get in the door doesn’t mean you’re going to get out the door on the other side,” said Noreika.\n\nIt could take a longer period for the US government and its financial regulators to offer unified licensing programs for cryptocurrency exchanges and bitcoin businesses. But, it is an optimistic indicator of bitcoin growth that the US, the second largest bitcoin exchange market behind Japan, is carefully considering creating a more robust and well-regulated market for investors and general consumers.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The U.S. Justice Department has claimed the proceeds from the sale of 144,336 bitcoins, valued at just over $48 million, that it obtained after shutting down the notorious online drug market Silk Road in 2013.\n\nWhile the government had already sold the bitcoins in a series of auctions in 2014 and 2015, the creator of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht (aka Dread Pirate Roberts) had challenged the legality of the forfeiture.\n\nUlbricht, however, agreed to drop the claims last weeks, according to the office of Joon H. Kim, the Acting U.S. Attorney for Manhattan—meaning the government can now claim the proceeds.\n\nThe $48.2 million total proceeds means the government sold the bitcoins for an average of $334. In retrospect, the sale appears to be a matter of bad timing for the government: the price of a bitcoin was as high as $1,000 at the end of 2013 before the digital currency went into a prolonged slump until mid-2016 when it began to soar. The current price is around $4,400—meaning the Justice Department would have made around $630 million had the sale taken place today.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries of the government’s bitcoin fire sale was venture capitalist Tim Draper, who bought an additional batch of nearly 30,000 bitcoins seized from Silk Road.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s office did not specify if the proceeds from the seizure will go to the agencies, including the FBI and IRS, that helped bring down Silk Road, or if the money will instead go to the U.S. Treasury. A spokesperson for Koon declined to provide an initial comment, but said he would offer more details soon.\n\nUlbricht’s decision to challenge the bitcoin seizure came in part because the investigation that brought down Silk Road was marred by two corrupt agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Secret Service, who posed as criminals in order to steal bitcoins.\n\nThe corrupt agents did not, however, significantly affect the trial of Ulbricht, who was convicted based on a mountain of evidence, including detailed server and chat records that identified him as the “Dread Pirate Roberts” who built and controlled Silk Road.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the present day value of the bitcoins.\n\nThis article is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance.

But on October 2, the Wall Street Journal reported that rival Goldman Sachs is considering trading in cryptocurrencies, potentially the first Wall Street firm to do so.\n\nFor me, the jury is still out. Here’s why.\n\nBack in the 1960s, I partnered with a commodities broker at the then-existent Hayden, Stone brokerage firm to form the Comsec Fund, a mutual fund that could trade commodities as well as other securities. I provided a statistical trading system; he handled administration and sales. Hedging was an important feature of the fund, since trading in commodities requires frequent short selling of commodities contracts. Registering the fund with the Securities and Exchange Commission was difficult and time-consuming. We had to persuade staff members that hedging both securities and commodities contracts was an acceptable investment strategy and not mere speculation. Eventually, we succeeded in registering with the SEC and 37 US states before piling up legal debts that were so large that we had to find a buyer, in our case a financial services company, to bail us out.\n\nThe experience could have soured me on the entire notion of hedge funds. But of course hedge funds later came into vogue, prompting the growth and development of an entire hedge fund industry. If anything, the experience left me more open-minded than ever about innovative financial endeavors. So that brings me to the subject of digital money or “cryptocurrency,” a form of encrypted digital money.\n\nHow should we think about the future of a currency that is manufactured (“mined”) and priced in the private economy (as opposed to being minted on a controlled basis by governments) through an innovative, supposedly secure, and secretive system of digital codes that enables owners of the currency to complete transactions off the books and out of the sight of government regulators?', 'The US government is open to integrate cryptocurrency companies, exchanges and trading platforms into the country’s banking industry as of late September 2017. Under the plan, the cryptocurrency players will be regulated by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nAt a 2017 event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, acting Comptroller of the Currency, Keith Noreika, said that they are actively studying effective methods of implementing a national licensing program for Bitcoin businesses.\n\n“I wouldn’t be adverse to those people coming in and talking to the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] about how a charter could make sense for them. But that is a long process they’d have to go through, and just because you get in the door doesn’t mean you’re going to get out the door on the other side.”\n\nSeveral US states have already authorized the operations of digital currency operators. Among them is New York, which has introduced its state-specific licensing initiative for Bitcoin called BitLicense. However, several startup companies, exchanges, businesses and trading platforms in the sector have voiced out their concerns over regulations like BitLicense due to high costs and impracticality in terms of compliance.\n\nThe acceptance of digital currency exchanges, as well as the introduction of a nationwide licensing program for trading platforms, are expected to trigger an increase in demand from institutional and retail traders in the US.\n\nOther global developments in Bitcoin adoption\n\nMeanwhile, in Japan, the government has implemented a nationwide licensing program for Japanese Bitcoin and digital currency exchanges. Among the operators already licensed as of late September are 11 major exchanges including BitFlyer.\n\nIn South Korea, the government has implemented measures to promote the virtual currency market to become more mature and well-regulated making the country the Ethereum powerhouse.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Ehrsam will visit New Zealand after having been chosen for the first intake of the Edmund Hillary Fellowship.\n\nAlso Read: Professor Urges New Zealand Government to Develop Bitcoin Regulations\n\nCoinbase Has Been Eyeing the New Zealand Bitcoin Markets, According to NZ Herald\n\nThe publication has reported that Coinbase co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, will be visiting NZ alongside 23 other entrepreneurs as part of the Edmund Hillary Fellowship. Ersham has a meeting with New Zealand’s reserve bank to discuss cryptocurrency and blockchain technology during the trip. This follows on from his recent meetings with regulators in the US, Japan, and Britain.\n\nEhrsam told NZ media, “I want to create a regulatory framework for digital currencies that is in line with societal values,” emphasizing the need to balance the confidence of investors and entrepreneurs with developing a legislative apparatus that is complementary to the values of each nation. Ersham expressed Coinbase’s desire to begin operating in New Zealand, but stressed that greater regulatory clarity is needed before it can become a reality, stating that “the rules around it aren’t particularly clear at the moment.” NZ Herald described Ersham’s expectations of the discussions, stating that like many meetings with regulators, Ersham is anticipating the experience to be “a learning process on both sides.”\n\nFred Ehrsam is a former Goldman Sachs trader who co-founded Coinbase in 2012. The entrepreneur was featured by Time magazine in their ‘30 People Under 30 who are changing the world’ list of December 2013. Since January, Ersham has stepped back from day-to-day operations at Coinbase, seeking instead to promote cryptocurrency technology to regulators, and to advise other startups within the blockchain space. Ersham was quoted stating that Coinbase’s “main goal was to make digital currencies easy to use for the everyday person… Digital currency is this new weird thing that doesn’t fit into a particular bucket.”\n\nEhrsam Believes That Cryptocurrencies Will Coexist With Traditional Financial Institutions in Future\n\nEhrsam describes the inevitability of creative destruction born of cryptocurrency disrupting the conventional operations of legacy financial institutions, albeit a future where cryptocurrencies and banks coexist. “I think [traditional financial institutions] will morph, not completely go away,” he said. “At its core, a bank really is a risk management company. I can’t see that going away.” Ultimately, Ersham believes that bitcoin will undermine the ability for banks to extract fees from payment transfers, but expects the banking industry to adapt and grow in response to disruptive technologies.\n\nAt the start of September, Auckland University Professor, Alex Sims, urged New Zealand to develop a clear regulatory apparatus pertaining to bitcoin – accusing NZ regulators of having “dropped the ball” with regards to cryptocurrency regulations. Although the possession and use of cryptocurrency is not prohibited in New Zealand, Sims asserted that “businesses aren’t able to accept digital currencies, because if they do, they get their bank accounts closed down,” before advising legislators to adopt a similar regulatory framework that was developed in Australia.\n\nDo you think that Coinbase’s meeting with the New Zealand central bank will spur the NZ government to develop a regulatory apparatus for cryptocurrencies?

Then, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman took a more moderate position on bitcoin, saying it was ""more than just a fad.""\n\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg News, Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, the world\'s largest investor with $5.7 trillion under management, said he thinks the explosive growth of bitcoin points to nefarious behavior.\n\n""It just identifies how much money laundering there is being done in the world,"" Fink said. ""How much people are trying to move currencies from one place to another.""', 'Bitcoin price continues to increase in the stock market and remains on course to reach the $4,500 level after falling below $3,000 due to the regulatory campaign by China against cryptocurrencies. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $4,291, a 3.91 percent decrease on the day.\n\nBased on a price action analysis, the possibility of the Bitcoin to regain its record highs has improved after the bullish price action over the weekend.\n\nIt has posted an 11.3 percent week-on-week increase, but still down by 4.9 percent on a monthly basis. Trend indicators, however, showed a lack of vigor in the market, which will surely test the patience of investors. Another slight cause of concern is the sustained weak volumes in the market.\n\nChina and South Korea’s moves against virtual currencies\n\nThe recent sharp decline in Bitcoin price was due to the move by the Chinese government to prohibit the conduct of initial coin offerings (ICO) in China. The government argued that nascent fundraising mechanisms like ICOs are illegal under the country’s domestic laws.\n\nIn South Korea, the country’s financial regulator Financial Services Commission (FSC) has ordered the prohibition of all forms of ICOs “regardless of technical terminology,” as well as the margin trading of digital currencies. The FSC is also scheduled to implement other measures that are expected to adversely affect the operations of cryptocurrency companies, including on-site inspections, starting the end of September and the examination of digital currency accounts for user data beginning December.\n\nWill it ever bounce back?\n\nThe upward movement of Bitcoin price coupled with a bullish relative strength index (RSI) and the directional movement index (DMI) show that the leading cryptocurrency can regain its Sept. 6 high of $4,692 and possibly, hit back towards its record high of $5,000. It remains to be seen, however, if this will be the case in the coming weeks.', ""The weekend rally in the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate may have come to a halt at $4,470 on Monday, but bulls appear to be crowding out the weak hands.\n\nThe retreat to $4,255 over the last day suggests investors who lack the financial resources to carry their positions have been spooked by minor price changes. While this unwinding of speculative bets could have gathered pace, spreading uncertainty amongst a wider swathe of investors, that outcome now appears unlikely.\n\nMoreover, the overall outlook remains constructive, given there are no signs of stress on the technical charts and indications that the number one cryptocurrency has already digested the bearish regulatory news out of China and South Korea.\n\nPrice action analysis today suggests that the digital asset is now ready to pop higher, having taken the 50-day moving average hurdle in a convincing manner over the weekend.\n\nAt press time, the digital currency is trading at $4,290 – down 2.85 percent in the last 24 hours.

He said he saw “huge opportunities” but that presently the atmosphere around bitcoin was “more speculative.”\n\nThose comments echo some of the criticisms that have been leveled by other investing pros against cyberunits that have achieved a notable ascendancies in popularity and price over the past year.\n\nIndeed, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.81% Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has described bitcoin as “a fraud” that would “eventually blow up.”\n\n“It’s worse than tulip bulbs and won’t end well,” Dimon said, referring to the classic 17th century asset bubble.\n\nFink was most definitive in his optimism around so-called blockchain, an open-sourced, distributed ledger, which underpins cryptocurrencies. Fink said the asset manager is looking at blockchain technologies as a way to facilitate the “more flow through of information.”\n\nThe BlackRock CEO’s comments come as bitcoin has created a clear divide between those who think the digital currency is a bubble and those who believe it has a future.\n\nIn recent trade, a single bitcoin was down 2.6% at $4,288, but has been up about 350% so far in 2017. Comparatively, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.41% is up 13% year to date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.31% has gained 14.5% over the same period.\n\nSee also: What investors need to know about initial coin offerings', 'Industry analysts predict the bitcoin price could surpass $6,000 by the end of the year, depending on whether the SegWit2x hard fork is implemented and, if so, how contentious and disruptive the fork is.\n\nBitcoin Price May Reach $6,000 by December\n\nThe bitcoin price rose nearly 75% during Q3 and has mostly recovered from the early-September contraction that was initiated by China’s blanket ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and bitcoin exchanges. On Monday, the bitcoin price rose as high as $4,470, although it has since dipped to a present value of $4,259.\n\nNow that bitcoin has demonstrated consistent support for the $4,000 level, many analysts believe the bitcoin price will begin extending toward its record near $5,000, eventually reaching past it to a new all-time high.\n\n“Throughout the year we’ve been predicting the bitcoin price will surpass $5,000 and creep closer to $6,000 by year’s end. That prediction is looking more in line with market sentiment these days,” Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business development at bitcoin exchange Gatecoin, told CNBC in an interview.\n\nCryptoCompare CEO Charles Hayter is not certain bitcoin will be able to rise quite that far by the end of the year, but he agrees with many other analysts who believe $5,000 is within sight. He believes that this uptrend has been and will continue to be spurred on by increased regulatory clarity in major sectors of the crypto economy.\n\n“Bitcoin’s biggest price catalyst is regulation. Japan has breathed life into the price and as the fog of uncertainty clears in other jurisdictions, clarity on regulation will release a break on the price,” he added.\n\n…Depending on What Happens With SegWit2x\n\nOf course, any number of hurdles could trip up bitcoin’s bull run before the end of the year, and there is one clear obstacle bitcoin faces during its march to $6,000: the contentious SegWit2x hard fork that is scheduled for November. SegWit2x was designed as an “upgrade” to the Bitcoin protocol, and though it has support from many mining operations and bitcoin firms, a large segment of the community — including all of the Bitcoin Core developers — opposes it.\n\nDespite months of fierce debate, SegWit2x supporters and opponents remain entrenched in their positions. Unless one side concedes to the other or a compromise is reached, the network will split into two competing blockchains, each vying for the bitcoin moniker. As it currently stands, it is likely that the free market will decide which chain survives. But though this process may be fair, it will not be painless, and it is not known what short- and long-term ramifications it will have on bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The US Justice Department was finally able to claim the proceeds from the sale of 144,336 Bitcoins sized when they shut down illicit online market, the Silk Road, in 2013.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, also known as the Dread Pirate Roberts, and the man behind the Silk Road, recently gave up his claim to these seized coins as he remains behind bars.\n\nThe amount collected by the Feds was around $48 mln for the 144,336 coins, far below their worth at today’s prices as it seems even the Justice Department fell folly to the old adage of selling low.\n\nSelling low\n\nThe seized Bitcoins were sold off in a series of auctions back in 2014 and 2015, and the accumulation of $48 mln indicates that they averaged to price of the coins at $334.\n\nIn retrospect, the sale appears to be a matter of bad timing for the government: the price of a Bitcoin was as high as $1,000 at the end of 2013 before the digital currency went into a prolonged slump until mid-2016 when it began to soar.\n\nThe current price is around $4,400 - meaning the Justice Department would have made around $630 mln had the sale taken place today.\n\nDropping the claim\n\nIt was only last week that Ulbricht decided to formally drop the claims he had to the Bitcoin that was sized. According to the office of Joon H.

RSI, on the other hand, is heading north so bitcoin price might follow suit.\n\nIf bullish momentum returns, bitcoin price could still climb back inside the channel and resume its move up to the resistance around $4500. But if bearish pressure kicks in, a drop below the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point could confirm that a longer-term drop is taking place.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nDollar demand is increasing thanks to a strong showing from leading jobs indicators, which could set the tone for an upside NFP surprise. In that case, Fed December hike expectations could increase and lead to more gains for the currency.\n\nStill, bitcoin price has plenty of factors on its side, one of which is persistent geopolitical risks, this time stemming from the European region. Apart from that, the increase in bitcoin core nodes by 30% in the past three months signaled strong support for this version of the software and continued to ease incompatibility concerns over the hard fork.\n\nSome analysts predict that bitcoin price could reach $6000 this year, although additional volatility could be seen before that happens.

Keene’s show highlighted bitcoin’s all-time chart (as shown below) while marking a particular event in 2014.\n\nAt the time, JP Morgan had just published a stinging critique of bitcoin with an 8-page report penned by John Normand, the company’s then global head of foreign exchange (FX) strategy. Titled the ‘Audacity of Bitcoin’, Normand argued that bitcoin was “vastly inferior” to fiat currency and that it performs ‘no better or worse’ than fiat currencies as a medium of exchange.\n\nOver three years later, Normand was asked what had changed with bitcoin since his stinging report. At the time of the report, bitcoin was trading at $668. At the time of publishing, bitcoin’s price is trading at $4,280 to the dollar, after hitting an all-time high above $5,000 in September.\n\nNormand, who is now head of FX and commodities at JP Morgan said:\n\nProbably the only thing that’s changed is its popularity. My view on it in 2014 when I wrote on it is that it was essentially a retail novelty.\n\nIn weighing in, Bloomberg’s Keene underlined Normand’s use of ‘retail novelty’ as a ‘comfortable way of saying Ponzi’. “I don’t think it’s a ponzi scheme,” Keene added, stating bitcoin’s very existence is one borne out of “good intentions”.\n\nTo this, the JP Morgan Chase executive replied:\n\nThere are people who are using [bitcoin] for good intentions, there people who are using it for malevolent intentions. Another analogy – other than ponzi – is maybe air miles because there are lots of things that can be used to acquire goods and services. The same way that air miles can, this cryptocurrency can too. It just has the added dimension of being more globally accepted by a retail community in a wider range of countries and that’s why it’s so popular.\n\nElaborating on his opinion of seeing bitcoin as a retail novelty, Normand said: “It isn’t something that institutional clients or corporates should become involved with. There are lots of reasons for this, I just never thought it would never attain scale because it’s a currency that no government backs – and that’s really the essential quality in becoming a widely used means of transactions. There were always enough retail clients, libertarians, even criminals who want to become involved in.”\n\nThe JP Morgan executive’s admission of bitcoin’s growing gains in popularity comes soon after JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s much-publicized comments on calling bitcoin “a fraud” before doubling down and claiming the cryptocurrency is “worth nothing.”\n\nBitcoin is now trading at nearly $4,300, gaining 430% since the turn of the year.\n\nFeatured image from Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'South Korean authorities have confirmed that hackers from North Korea targeted bitcoin exchanges in the country in multiple attempts to steal the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Republic of Korea’s National Police Agency (NPA) has published details of its investigation surrounding several claims of cybersecurity incidents involving hackers from North Korea. As covered by CCN in the past, a recent report by cybersecurity firm FireEye pointed to a state-sponsored North Korean campaign to steal bitcoin from South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nNorth Korea has been accused of turning to digital currencies in cash-strapped times due to sanctions from multiple countries and the United Nations in the wake of its nuclear and missile programs.\n\n“State-sponsored actors [are] seeking to steal bitcoin and other virtual currencies as a means of evading sanctions and obtaining hard currencies to fund the regime,” read an excerpt from the FireEye report.\n\nNow, the South Korean police have confirmed that the attacks did occur in the form of spear phishing attempts.

However, police added that all of the recent attacks were unsuccessful, with no compromised computers nor theft of bitcoin or any other digital currency.\n\nYonhap, South Korea’s largest news agency, has quoted police as stating that the phishing emails were all sent from the same North Korean IP address that was previously linked to other hacking attempts targeting Seoul.\n\nAccording to one South Korean cybersecurity firm, North Korean hackers routinely stole bitcoin worth ?100 Million (approx. $90,000) every month between 2013-2015 as a means to increasing reserves of its safe haven (hard) currency.\n\nThe police’s confirmation comes in the months following the noteworthy hack and breach of Bithumb, South Korea’s largest bitcoin and Ethereum exchange.

In the case of Bioptix Inc., a maker of diagnostic machinery for the biotech industry, it didn’t bother waiting.\n\nThe penny stock nearly doubled in value in the days leading up to the company’s announcement Wednesday that it’s renaming itself Riot Blockchain Inc. to reflect a new focus on buying cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses. After the Castle Rock, Colorado-based firm formally unveiled the change in direction, the shares extended their rally, gaining as much as 17 percent to $9.50, the highest intraday level since January 2015.\n\nOther companies have shown that a foray into the cryptocurrency space is often rewarded by investors, at least initially, as the astronomical increase in the value of virtual coins has lured everyone from big banks to startups. Overstock.com Inc. shares rallied after the online retailer said it was starting a digital-coin exchange. Shares of MGT Capital Investments Inc., the cybersecurity firm with ties to controversial anti-virus software developer John McAfee, soared after the company announced a move into bitcoin mining.\n\nIn regulatory filings, the address Bioptix provides for its headquarters is identical to the address of a shipping and mailbox rental company called PostalAnnex, which sits next door to a Blimpie sandwich store in a Castle Rock shopping center. Karen Chase, a spokeswoman for Bioptix, said that the company uses the address for mail, and also operates a small office in the area.\n\nFormerly known as Venaxis Inc., Bioptix bought out BiOptix Diagnostics Inc. in 2016, which wasn’t the best move, according to Chief Executive Officer Michael Beeghley, who said Tuesday that the company wasn’t in a big enough market and noted its significant cash burn.\n\n“When I got on the board, they had made an acquisition that we decided as a board did not make sense, so we closed that down and then decided to change our focus,” he said Tuesday in a phone interview. “We looked at the sector and said, ‘How can we participate in this, and how can our shareholders participate in this very exciting industry that’s like the beginning of the internet?”\n\nIts first move under the new moniker is an investment in Coinsquare Ltd., a Canadian exchange for trading digital tokens like bitcoin. Riot is paying a few million dollars for about a 12 percent interest in Coinsquare, and has warrants to increase its stake to 20 percent, Beeghley said. Next, the CEO is looking to buy companies focused on bitcoin mining, blockchain and security software. He said he plans to fund the deals with a combination of cash on hand and stock. Bioptix had minimal revenue in 2016.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of success taking companies where we have closed down operations and identifying new sectors to invest,” said Beeghley, who became CEO of Bioptix in April. “The most recent is Polarity -- ticker symbol COOL -- which we took public in March.”\n\nBioptix has already shuttered operations, and is selling its remaining patents and intellectual property to a private company in the diagnostics industry. It will receive an upfront payment as well as a royalty stream that will likely be as much as about $2.5 million, Beeghley said. Bioptix plans to change its ticker symbol to RIOT.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Name Dropping Revives Market Memories of Dot-Com Mania\n\n— With assistance by Chris Nagi', ""Bitcoin has found support at three-day lows, as commentators fear the impact of SegWit2x may see markets “price in maximum disruption.”\n\nCurrently trading around $4240 on Bitstamp at press time, Bitcoin temporarily went below Sunday’s low of $4221 to drop below $4200, before rebounding.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency is down over $200 from highs seen Monday, as investors assumed the “bad news” from China, South Korea and Jamie Dimon had finally ceased to matter.\n\n“[...] The market may now price-in the 'max disruption' strategy employed by the NYA developers,” entrepreneur Alistair Milne commented in a tweet Wednesday, as prices declined once more.\n\nHope I'm wrong, but the market may now price-in the 'max disruption' strategy employed by the NYA developers#bitcoin #bizcoin — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) October 4, 2017\n\nCrypto markets had been recovering through Tuesday as Bitcoin increased above $4400, with NEO in particular continuing to recover lost ground in the wake of China’s ICO and fiat trading ban.\n\nBitcoin’s fluctuations continue to shape the landscape, however, with the new downturn shaving profits off the majority of altcoin yields.\n\nA new air of uncertainty has surrounded the upcoming SegWit2x hard fork, of which the industry is warier of than Bitcoin Cash, due to the potential for it to gain significant support.\n\nDiscussing the issue on social media Tuesday, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee said it was not as easy for industry players to take sides on the next fork as it was when Bitcoin Cash came into being.\n\n“For the 2x hardfork, things are a bit more tricky,” he wrote.\n\n“...

During the crash, the ETH exchange rate plummeted down in an instant, but quickly regained its price. According to Bloomberg, Ethereum dropped from trading at $317.81, down to 10 cents in a split second. However, its recovery was also swift. It regained a $300 price point in mere seconds.\n\nAlso read: Switzerland’s FINMA Eyes Crypto Valley\n\nThe Bloomberg article said, “The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has requested information from Coinbase Inc. about a June 21 incident on its GDAX platform in which the Ether digital token suffered a precipitous drop, falling to 10 cents from $317.81 in milliseconds before quickly recovering, said two people familiar with the matter.”\n\nCould Margin Trading have caused the Plunge?\n\nThe CFTC is concerned that leveraged or margin trading may have precipitated the flash crash. Margin trading allows users to borrow money to trade. This is called trading “on margin” or “leveraged” trading.\n\nAmong the issues the agency is focused on is what role leverage might have played in the plunge, as Coinbase allowed traders to use borrowed money to make bigger wagers than would have otherwise been possible, said the people, who asked not to be named because the review isn’t public.\n\nAfter the flash crash, Coinbase discontinued their margin trading service. Their actions quickly piqued regulatory interest and scrutiny.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Wild West and Coinbase Cooperation\n\nRegulators are now scrutinizing cryptocurrency exchanges even more. It comes as no surprise that the CFTC is thoroughly investigating Coinbase because the CFTC wants to control the “wild west” nature of the digital currency ecosystem. The Bloomberg article also pointed out that Coinbase had conducted $20 billion in cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nEven though officials and regulators are putting pressure on Coinbase, Coinbase doesn’t seem to be sweating it. They are fully cooperating with the CFTC’s investigation and even emailed this statement in response to the investigation:\n\n“As a regulated financial institution, Coinbase complies with regulations and fully cooperates with regulators. After the GDAX market event in June 2017, we proactively reached out to a number of regulators, including the CFTC. We also decided to credit all customers who were impacted by this event. We are unaware of a formal investigation.”\n\nEven though Coinbase is cooperating, some people are still curious about the cause of the crash.\n\nWhat Initiated the Flash Crash?\n\nAccording to sources, the Ethereum flash crash was caused by one monstrous trade. A single $12.5 million dollar sell order triggered auto-trades preset by other traders. This resulted in the immediate crash down to 10 cents. Luckily, as soon as Ethereum hit the 10 cent mark, a multitude of traders immediately placed new orders for the digital currency. This caused a jump back to around $300.\n\nIt is currently unclear if margin trading was the culprit, or if Coinbase was culpable for the incident. Regardless, the cryptocurrency and bitcoin markets will continue to generate mainstream regulatory scrutiny, as well as mainstream adoption.\n\nWhat do you think of the Ethereum “flash crash” on Coinbase? Was it caused by margin trading? Even if Coinbase had a hand in it, is it up to regulators to control the markets and market actors?

We even have a casino.', ""On October 25th, the Bitcoin blockchain is set to hard fork and create a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Gold (BTG). Existing private keys holding a Bitcoin balance at that time will be credited with the same amount of Bitcoin Gold on November 1st, similar to how they received Bitcoin Cash at the beginning of August. A wallet for Bitcoin Gold may not be available in time, however, which could cause a delay of up to a few weeks before holders will be able to use the new coins.\n\n\n\nThe driving force behind Bitcoin Gold is a team of developers, miners, and other contributors led by Jack Liao, the CEO of Hong Kong mining manufacturer LightningAsic. His financial partner in the endeavor is known simply as Wubi, a Chinese mining tycoon and owner of Chinese Bitcoin news portal Jinse.com. The project’s anonymous lead developer goes by the name H4x3rotab, and several other developers and contributors can be found inside the project’s GitHub project and slack channel.\n\nDeemed a “friendly fork” by the development team, many differences in this copy of Bitcoin make it less like Bitcoin Cash and more like a complimentary accessory to Bitcoin. H4x3rotab explained to Brave New Coin that there are “vested interests who benefit from blocking upcoming upgrades of Bitcoin by making hard forks like C-cash, D-cash, or SegWit4x and SegWit8x.”\n\nHis team’s plan to combat this ongoing attack is to have Bitcoin Gold take a similar, supporting role to Bitcoin, much like Litecoin did for the segwit upgrade when it deployed segwit first. However, unlike Litecoin, which has shorter block times and uses a mining algorithm that is different but still allows for ASICs, Bitcoin Gold “is also a real blockchain to pilot Bitcoin upgrades,” H4x3rotab says.\n\n— Bitcoin Gold lead developer h4x3rotab\n\nThe project’s originator and primary financial backer says the goal of Bitcoin Gold is to compete with Bcash, Ethereum, and GPU Coins, increase mining decentralization, and protect the Bitcoin ecosystem. “We will use Segwit and try to follow Core as closely as possible,” says Liao. “Because unlike Bcash, we know that the best engineers in the industry are working on Core, so that is obviously the best technical roadmap to take Bgold safely into the future.”\n\nThe biggest change in the code that helps it be complementary to Bitcoin, is that it uses a different mining algorithm that is resistant to ASIC chips, called Equihash. Zcash uses the same mining algorithm, and just like Ethereum, these coins both require the use of GPUs instead of Bitcoin’s current ASIC mining machines. ASICs are widely regarded among bitcoin's development team and their supporters as the primary source of many of Bitcoin’s current problems, leaving Bitcoin centralized in the hands of a small number of miners.\n\nAnother advantage for the project is that it uses the Equihash algorithm instead of Bitcoin’s SHA-256. Bitcoin Gold will therefore compete with Ethereum for mining hardware, despite being closer in design to Zcash. This is noteworthy because sometime in 2018, the Ethereum project plans to switch its Proof of Work mining algorithm over to a new one based on Proof of Stake. Ethereum is currently using a large percentage of the world’s total GPU mining equipment, so the Bitcoin Gold team has designed their coin to become the prime recipient of that mining hardware.\n\nBitcoin Gold has also altered its difficulty adjustment time. Every two weeks, Bitcoin adjusts a ‘handicap’ setting that makes it easier or harder for miners to solve a block and get their reward. Doing so ensures that as more mining power is added, blocks continue to get mined at an average rate of one per ten minutes. This long adjustment period had been working well enough until the Bitcoin Cash fork in August, but now with the hashpower available to Bitcoin fluctuating so often, two weeks was too long for the Bitcoin Gold team. Instead, their blockchain will measure and adjust its difficulty setting with every block found.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin Gold project has been a work in progress since July, it has recently taken shape as more than just another free dividend to Bitcoin holders. This particular fork is similar enough to Bitcoin to also serve as a disaster recovery backup for Bitcoin’s blockchain if the Segwit2x split in November doesn’t go well — positioning Bitcoin Gold to take over for Bitcoin if necessary. It could possibly even have its code merged with Bitcoin, thus eliminating Bitcoin’s problems that are rooted in an ASIC mining monopoly.\n\n— Jack Liao, LightningAsic CEO\n\nLiao welcomed the thought of Bitcoin Gold becoming Bitcoin in such circumstances, but says such a decision is “up to community choice. No individual can decide it.” Asked if he would welcome Bitcoin Gold’s code being merged into the Bitcoin core directory, he told Brave New Coin “Yes. We will provide BIP for Bitcoin.”\n\nBitcoin Gold still has a few hurdles to clear before it launches, however. The mining software, mining pool, and block explorer have yet to be released and although the project doesn’t have a wallet yet, it still plans to allow miners to test-mine Bitcoin Gold on a testnet within two weeks. In addition, the project has not yet added strong replay protection code to its software. This important code change ensures Bitcoin Gold users don’t accidentally spend real Bitcoin and vice versa, otherwise known as a ‘replay attack’. However, Liao has assured several different people who questioned him that “Bgold will have replay protection; friendliness to Bitcoin is paramount.”\n\nThe single largest criticism directed at the project, however, is the developer’s decision to mine the new blockchain themselves for some time after the fork — thus keeping all the mining rewards. The community is concerned this will result in an unknown amount of Bitcoin Gold being mined. Talking to supporters on the project’s slack channel, H4x3rotab says the number of blocks they plan to mine is still under deliberation and “would be at most one percent of the total supply.”\n\nTwo exchanges so far have committed to listing BTG in November: Hong Kong’s Bitexchange, and a new CFD exchange, Bitstar."", 'The skyrocketing popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has introduced a whole new level of uncertainty to gold’s price movements.\n\nIn early September, gold approached the $1,350 level, nearly $200 above where it stood last December.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'China put its red-hot cryptocurrency market on ice last month when it shut down bitcoin exchanges and banned initial coin offerings (ICOs), an emerging tactic through which cryptocurrency ventures raise capital by selling investors a percentage of newly released coins. With the Chinese Communist Party’s 19th national congress approaching—the every-five-years gathering is the nation’s most important political event—many Western commentators have suggested that the crackdown at least partially reflects the regime’s interest in strictly enforcing capital controls.\n\nThat desire may well be one regulatory motive, but state media reports both before and after the crackdown frame ICOs as one of China’s many bubbles in which unsavvy retail investors are preyed upon. As governments around the globe struggle to comprehensively regulate virtual currency—mostly by juggling regulatory perspectives of tax evasion and illicit finance—China’s crackdown highlights an underappreciated perspective: consumer protection.\n\nICO Fever\n\nGlobally, 2017 is shaping up as the year of the ICO. In the first half of 2017, cryptocurrency offerings raised an estimated $1.27 billion. ICO funding has surpassed early-stage venture capital funding; in July, ICOs raised $300 million compared with $200 million in angel and seed funding.\n\nIn China, token sales have been wildly popular. More than 100,000 Chinese investors bought new cryptocurrencies through 65 ICOs in the first half of 2017—often with little more information than a roadshow presentation and a white paper. According to one state media report (link in Chinese), a popular roadshow venue in Beijing’s tech district, Zhongguancun, hosted an ICO presentation almost every other day in August. A government report (link in Chinese) estimated that ICOs had raised 2.6 billion RMB (almost $400 million) during the first half of 2017. Regulators estimate that as much as 90 percent (link in Chinese) of those coin offerings involved fraud or illegal fundraising.\n\nFew countries have comprehensive regulations regarding virtual currencies or coin offerings. Regulators have largely framed the issue as countering illicit finance and tax evasion. In the United States, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has applied anti-money-laundering program requirements to bitcoin exchanges, and the IRS has investigated transactions for tax evasion. In the European Union, the European Commission has recently sought to tighten regulations around virtual currency to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. But China’s focus on virtual currencies as a potential consumer-protection problem emphasizes a regulatory angle that is only beginning to gain notice. In an investor alert in July, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) addressed the risks of participating in ICOs after hackers stole the majority of coins in an offering known as the DAO, warning that “fraudsters often use innovations and new technologies to perpetrate fraudulent investment schemes.” The alert was perhaps the first regulatory move in the United States toward framing virtual currencies as an issue of consumer protection. The SEC followed up this week with what appears to be its first time filing fraud charges against two ICOs. In the wake of China’s action, South Korea banned ICOs as well, also citing the risks of fraud and speculation-driven overheating. The United Kingdom, too, released a statement less than a week after China’s ban that warned investors ICOs were “very high-risk, speculative investments.” But on the whole, consumer protection remains an exceptional, not common, driver of cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nChinese Markets Are Particularly Vulnerable\n\nChinese regulators’ suspicion of ICOs is not all that different from the SEC’s, but Chinese markets’ vulnerability to bubbles makes the risk more acute to regulators. Chinese state media report (link in Chinese) that investors piling on to token sales include an “auntie army” of middle-income older women who were beginning to invest their savings. One state media article (link in Chinese) reported that scores of groups on WeChat (an omnipresent messaging service in China) each hosted hundreds of aunties conversing about their ICO investments. “No one knows how huge this community is,” the article said, noting that the aunties traveled in hordes to ICO presentations. Some of these investors admitted to journalists that they weren’t investing in the projects’ inherent value but in the hype the presentations could generate.\n\nRetail investors, and especially mom-and-pop investors—people with extra cash, little formal education and a voracious appetite for high-risk, high-reward investments—dominate Chinese financial markets. In 2015, slumping property prices and low interest rates drove retail investors toward stocks, fueling a speculative boom that was quickly followed by a market-shaking bust. Retail investors have been blamed for a variety of bubbles that, like whack-a-mole, have drawn attention and reaction from the Chinese government. Regulators imposed extraordinary limits on trading after the 2015 market rout. A boom in bitcoins last year—peaking with some 90% of global bitcoin transactions reportedly taking place in China—was moderated only when regulators put a four-month investigative freeze on bitcoin exchanges. Part of regulators’ apprehension stems from recent unrest among amateur investors whose savings have disappeared in fraudulent investment vehicles and market crashes. Last year, investors in the failed Fanya Metal Exchange staged protests in cities across China, demanding that the government help recoup their losses. Against this backdrop, token sales are another mole threatening unsuspecting aunties’ savings and the country’s broader economic stability.\n\nIn the wake of the crackdown, Chinese news headlines focused on making an example of one ICO mogul in particular: Li Xiaolai, one of China’s largest bitcoin holders, whose rags-to-riches story generated a massive following. Li launched his own cryptocurrency, PressOne, in July through an ICO that drew (link in Chinese) around 14,000 investors and more than $75 million without even publishing a white paper. To buy in, investors had to use bitcoin, ether or the then-weeks-old EOS coin—a cryptocurrency created by a June ICO that Li also backed. PressOne promised to build a decentralized content distribution platform off the EOS blockchain.\n\nThese ICOs created a self-stimulating profit for Li, as PressOne drove more investment in EOS. In all, the PressOne sale collected more than 30 million EOS coins. Meanwhile, the EOS offering has become one of the largest ICOs in the world this year, netting what some skeptics in China (link in Chinese) have called “$500 billion worth of air.” The ICO is still ongoing (though no longer in China), and it broke records in July by raising $185 million in its first five days. While one Chinese headline in the days after the ICO ban asked whether Li was “an angel or a scammer” (link in Chinese), another called him a “fraudster on the road to financial independence” (link in Chinese).\n\nIn the Chinese government’s moves against ICOs, bitcoin exchanges might simply have been collateral damage. Although bitcoin’s speculative bubble has already cooled significantly, Chinese regulators have other reasons to be wary. Bitcoin’s anonymity and decentralization make it a currency of choice for criminal activity and malware: the worldwide WannaCry attack hit tens of thousands of Chinese institutions and ransom was demanded in bitcoin. Given China’s strict capital controls, the government’s uneasiness with unregulated currency is no surprise. But in the state media reports that so harshly criticize Li and other ICO “fraudsters,” bitcoin exchanges are barely mentioned. One article (link in Chinese) suggested that regulators held a “milder attitude” toward cryptocurrencies compared to token sales but think it is “better to mistakenly kill than to mistakenly let be.”\n\nIn a recent op-ed in Caixin, Sheng Songcheng, a counselor to the People’s Bank of China, portrayed the policy less harshly, arguing that “with the ICO chaos being cleaned up,” blockchain enthusiasts can direct their energies into more productive outcomes. It’s not a crackdown on the decentralized technology, he emphasized, but a necessary righting of the course of an unruly emerging industry. Perhaps other countries’ regulators should take note.', 'Many fondly remember their first Bitcoin transaction. It likely took place on Coinbase, one of the first exchanges to serve the Western marketplace. Bitcoin became tradeable on Coinbase when the price of a coin was in the single digits and daily volume couldn’t match the population of a small country town. Since then, this exchange has helped Bitcoin gain traction and made it more accessible to consumers the world over. There’s no doubt that Bitcoin fans today have a soft spot for the exchange, and those who began trading early probably have Coinbase to thank for their riches.\n\nThe company wields its influence over the market quietly, but this power in the cryptocurrency world is undeniable. As a certain wise uncle once said, with great power comes great responsibility, and Coinbase currently sits in a precarious position. Some questionable behavior in the past is raising eyebrows inside the community and out, yet few seem to grasp just how thin a line the exchange walks.\n\nExchanging the Game\n\nBitcoin was originally a closed ecosystem, with those who mined it the only ones to receive the cryptocurrency as a reward. This is the unique “proof of work” algorithm that keeps the ecosystem running to this day, reimbursing miners with Bitcoin for verifying and processing transactions on the network. However, exchanges allowed trading between Bitcoin that had already been mined, and fiat money like Dollars, Pounds and Yen. In some ways, this was good: It put Bitcoin into the hands of those who didn’t want to, or couldn’t, mine it, but it also opened a whole new can of worms.\n\nExchanges are vital to the Bitcoin economy because they remain the primary way of obtaining value from one’s Bitcoins, since merchant acceptance of Bitcoin is still quite low. Though eCommerce is relatively eager to adopt cryptocurrency as a payment solution, like in the case of Alibaba or Overstock, brick and mortar is still slow on the uptake. Unfortunately, many people still patronize physical stores and shops where cash or credit cards are infinitely easier to use.\n\nNaturally, a place to turn your Bitcoin into cash becomes an extremely in-demand service. Though it gives people an easy way to grasp the value of their Bitcoin, it also opens the market for speculation. Coinbase and other early exchanges created a relationship between fiat currencies and Bitcoin and changed the name of the game forever. No longer was it about creating a new banking system, or an easier way to trade. It was about hitting the “moon,” “hodling” and making the coin’s price its only measure of success.\n\nThe Power of Exchanges\n\nBecause exchanges are an avenue to Bitcoin trading, they also have a lot of influence on the price of Bitcoin itself. Many understand that when an exchange adds an altcoin for Bitcoin pair trading, the price of that coin is likely to rise significantly due to a new source of volume. Early buyers of altcoins like NEO have petitioned the world’s exchanges to accept NEO as a tradeable coin, and it’s largely working. In turn for listing popular coins, the exchanges profit from fees (if they even impose them) and the spread.\n\nThey can also take advantage of high volume in more sinister ways. Throughout the years, many have noticed that during times when the price of Bitcoin is falling rapidly, Coinbase goes offline. Though the company says it’s because of an influx of new customers, unmanageable trade volume, insufficient server capacity and the like, many suspect Coinbase of front-running.\n\nDuring these times, an exchange could theoretically fill their own buy and sell orders before clients’ and make a great deal of money. In fact, US watchdog organization the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission is currently investigating Coinbase’s GDAX exchange for potential margin trading violations following Ethereum’s flash crash this summer.\n\nAny exchange that has so much influence and goes mostly unchecked is troubling. The US has mostly let cryptocurrency flourish in the country, but should a rogue politician get scared and encourage restrictive measures like those imposed in China and South Korea, Coinbase might have something more to worry about. Should it ever be ordered offline like some others, it will surely cause a sizeable crash in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nOn the Bright Side\n\nCoinbase might have to get its story straight for when regulators come knocking and wish to poke around more thoroughly. However, it will also have a lot of good on its record. It’s currently insured by the FDIC and is largely compliant with all the guidelines established thus far in its home country, Coinbase is based in San Francisco. As more time passes, and more governments, central banks, and financial institutions realize the good that cryptocurrency and Blockchain can do, they may take a less harsh stance on those already operating within their borders. For Coinbase and their customers, this is welcome news.', 'Regulation\n\nXinhua News Agency reporter Pan Ye has published an editorial piece calling for regulators to take a “zero tolerance” approach to crimes involving or facilitated by cryptocurrencies. Despite the article’s firm tone, a list of regulatory recommendations is made in the piece, including “licensing” and other provisions indicative of a permissive regulatory apparatus.\n\nAlso Read: Virtual Currencies Expected to Be Regulated in China on October 1st\n\nState-Backed Chinese Media Outlet, Xinhua, Has Called for Regulators to Adopt a Strong Stance Regarding Crimes Involving Cryptocurrencies\n\nXinhua has published an editorial piece condemning the usage of virtual currencies by criminals. The article urges that the state adopt a “zero tolerance” position with regard to crimes committed with cryptocurrencies, arguing in favor of an “iron fist governance” policy. Xinhua is an official government media outlet whose president is a member of the Chinese Central Party’s Central Committee – leading many to interpret the publication’s positions as indicative of the central government’s sentiments.\n\nThe article begins by describing China’s transition from initiating a prohibition on ICOs to suspending the operations of all cryptocurrency exchanges operating within the country. According to a Google translation, Xinhua states that “seven ministries called a stop to… ICO[s]” before “the major domestic [virtual] currency trading platform[s] and related RMB trading business[es]… [were] shut down.”\n\nXinhua describes virtual currencies as the “first choice” for online criminals – asserting that cryptocurrencies are used to facilitate “money laundering, drug trafficking, smuggling, illegal fund-raising and other criminal activities.” Xinhua stated that bitcoin has been popular among criminals because it can be used “anonymous[ly], [is] not subject to national boundaries, [and is] not easy to track.” The article asserts that “the regulators… shut down the [virtual currency] trading platform[s]” out of the “inten[tion of]… prevent[ing] the spread of… risk, to combat speculation in the field of virtual currency, [and] to maintain financial order.”\n\nXinhua Asserts That Blockchain Technology “Is Considered to Have Broad Prospects for Development” in China\n\nDespite bitcoin and cryptocurrencies being the subject of increasing scrutiny from the financial regulators of various states, Xinhua states that “ there are still many regulatory vacuums in the field of virtual currency, which require governments and central banks to give enough attention to the regulation as soon as possible.”\n\nUltimately, Xinhua concludes that incorporating “virtual currency into the law” will require that legislators “establish a sound regulatory framework for virtual currency”. The article advocates that the central government “select targeted regulatory measures, such as filing management, licensing, anti-money laundering duties and processes, user real name, large transaction limits”, among other measures. Xinhua predicts the adoption of such policies “resolutely put an end to all disturb[ances to] the financial order” currently associated with cryptocurrencies in China.\n\nThe editorial piece comes just days after China’s “General Principles of the Civil Law of the People’s Republic of China” legislation was expected to take effect. Chinese media outlet Jinse reported that the legislation contained regulations for cryptocurrencies, with October 1st expected to mark the beginning of virtual currencies being formally regulated in China.\n\nFollowing China’s recent cryptocurrency crackdown, all exchanges but Okcoin and Huobi have formally stopped operations in China – leading to speculations that the central government has sought to purge China’s cryptocurrency economy as a precipitous step toward developing a stringently controlled regulatory apparatus that monitors the operations of a select cryptocurrency oligopoly.\n\nDo you think that China’s cryptocurrecy crackdown will be discarded in favor of a tightly controlled regulatory apparatus that allows a select few Chinese businesses to legitimately conduct operations related to cryptocurrencies?

Vinnik was arrested by authorities late July 2017, and stands accused of masterminding a $4 billion money-laundering ring through the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e.\n\nAlso Read: BTC-E Rebrands to Wex Exchange — Claims to Be AML/KYC Compliant\n\nAlexander Vinnik Will Face up to 55 Years in Prison If Extradited to the United States\n\nThe Russian is accused of providing money laundering services and facilitating a wide range of crimes extending back from 2011, including drug trafficking and computer hacking. Vinnik denies having been the former operator of BTC-e, instead claiming that he only worked as a “technical consultant” for the cryptocurrency exchange. Vinnik is also accused of having profited from the Mt. Gox hack, with U.S. authorities claiming that Vinnik “obtained” funds that had been stolen from Mt. Gox, before laundering them via BTC-e and Tradehill.\n\nRussia has also submitted an extradition request for Vinnik, who there would be subject to more lenient charges of fraud. Although Alexander Vinnik also denies accusations of fraud, he has consented to Russia’s extradition request. A date has yet to be set for the formal hearing of Russia’s extradition request. Vinnik is one of seven Russian nationals that have been arrested or indicted for U.S. cybercrime charges this year.\n\nVinnik and his lawyers have appealed to the Greek Supreme Court, arguing that “insufficient indications, let alone evidence” had been presented against Vinnik by the Thessaloniki court that ruled in favor of extraditing the Russian. The lawyer leading Vinnik’s defense, Alexandros Lykourezos, told media, “we hope and expect a better outcome.” If the appeal is unsuccessful, Greece’s justice minister will have the final say regarding Vinnik’s future, as the Greek justice minister has the power to approve or block competing extradition requests for individuals tried in Greece. “We have faith in the Greek justice system and a long road ahead of us,” Xanthippi Moisidou, another lawyer defending Vinnik told reporters.\n\nVinnik Was Arrested in a Coastal Village Located in Northern Greece During Late July\n\nFollowing Vinnik’s arrest, BTC-e went offline, hosting a static front page claiming that the website was under maintenance. The U.S. Department of Justice described BTC-e as “one of the largest entities in the field of electronic money laundering.”\n\nThe arrest and subsequent seizure of BTC-e’s assets has brought into question how far the international jurisdiction of the United States extends with regards to cybercrime. These actions comprised the first instance of U.S. government agencies attacking a completely foreign exchange on foreign soil. BTC-e reported that “on July 25… the FBI staff came to the data center… and seized all equipment, the servers contained databases and purses of our service,” in addition to fining the company $110,003,314 USD. Amidst the chaos, numerous presumably innocent traders’ funds were seized – including an Australian who lost $430,000 USD worth of bitcoin as a consequence of the U.S. government’s seizures.\n\nBTC-e has since rebranded to Wex.nz, and claims to operate in full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer laws and requirements.\n\nDo you think that Alexander Vinnik will be extradited to the United States for trial?

Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said at a September 12 financial service conference, when asked why he thinks bitcoin is a ""fraud.""\n\n""They control it through a central bank...the bigger these things get...they close it down.""\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts were quick to point out that bitcoin can\'t be shut down because it doesn\'t have a CEO or corporate headquarters. It\'s a software network that runs on computers spread around the globe, so any efforts to close it down would resemble a game of wack-a-mole.\n\nHere\'s the other point Jamie Dimon doesn\'t understand: Bitcoin is also free speech. And though other countries could ban it, it can\'t be made illegal in the U.S. thanks to the First Amendment. That\'s because bitcoin is just code, and code is just speech, which is based on legal precedent established during the so-called crypto wars of the early 90s.\n\nIn 1993, Phil Zimmerman faced possible criminal charges for writing the encryption software PGP. The government said that it was as dangerous as guns and bombs. To make the point that PGP\'s source code is protected speech, MIT Press printed it in a book, sold it abroad, and Zimmerman was never indicted.\n\nThen in 1995, with help from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, mathematician Daniel Bernstein sued the U.S. government on First Amendment grounds for blocking publication of his encryption program.\n\n""Computer language is just that, language,"" wrote Judge Marilyn Hall Patel. Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit Court affirmed Patel\'s ruling that code has the same constitutional protections as a poem or newspaper article.\n\nThe First Amendment protects users who keep their own bitcoins printed on a sheet of paper or stored in a software wallet, but it doesn\'t preclude regulatory regimes like the New York BitLicense, which constrains the activities of third-party companies that maintain other people\'s crypto holdings. But these firms are a vestige of the old-world financial system.\n\nIf the world transitions from a dollar standard to a bitcoin standard, by then, software will have made it easier for users to maintain and trade their own cryptocurrency without involving a regulated company. And those activities have the same constitutional protections as other forms of controversial speech.\n\nThat money can now be expressed in strings of numbers and letters that don\'t require a government-sanctioned bank to declare them valid poses a mortal threat to the existing financial industry. Is it any wonder that the CEO of the world\'s sixth largest bank wants to believe that the government can step in and offer protection?\n\nWritten and produced by Jim Epstein.\n\nMusic:\n\n""Rollin at 5"" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com), Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License, http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n""Too Cool"" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com), Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License, http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n""Common Consensus"" by The Franks is licensed under a Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.\n\nSubscribe at iTunes.\n\nFollow us at Soundcloud.\n\nSubscribe at YouTube.\n\nLike us on Facebook.\n\nFollow us on Twitter.', 'An executive for the world\'s largest asset manager said this week that he doesn\'t see the case for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSpeaking with Bloomberg on October 3, Mark Wiedman, who serves as Global Head of iShares and Index Investments for BlackRock, was asked about his views on the prospects of a cryptocurrency-tied ETF. A number of firms have attempted to launch such a product, but to date the SEC has been largely dismissive of the concept, issuing notable rejections in the public and, in other cases, prompting some bitcoin ETF backers to withdraw their efforts.\n\nWiedman said in the interview that he doesn\'t see it happening, citing other ETF-related products that the firm would encourage clients to hold ""in perpetuity."" In the case of bitcoin, Wiedman said that he ""would not encourage a client to hold bitcoin in perpetuity.""\n\nOn the question of an ETF specifically, Wiedman went on to say:\n\n""I don’t quite get the point of a bitcoin ETF in any case, because we’re talking about...trading products that are difficult to access.

But if it were [successful], why would you need an ETF to access it?""\n\nWiedman isn\'t the only BlackRock executive to comment on cryptocurrencies this week.\n\nThat same day, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was quoted as saying that he is a ""big believer"" in the potential of cryptocurrencies.

""We\'re discussing in the ECB to put concrete legal restrictions in place,"" Nowotny said.\n\nICOs are a means of raising funds in a cryptocurrency venture and are often considered a strategy that bypasses rigorous regulation in the capital-raising process. In an ICO, part of the cryptocurrency raised is sold to early backers, usually in exchange for either legal tender or bitcoin. China banned ICOs in the country last month.\n\n""In China, there is a particular problem because bitcoins are used as an instrument for capital flight and to bypass legal regulations,"" Nowotny said. ""It doesn\'t have this dimension here, yet.""\n\nMore of What\'s Trending on TheStreet:', 'Further Reading Over 10,000 people were duped by Bitcoin mining startup, feds say Homero Josh Garza, who founded two cryptocurrency startups, GAW Miners and ZenMiner, has been ordered to pay a final civil judgment of $9.1 million, plus $700,000 in interest.\n\nThe judgement, which was formally approved by a federal judge in Connecticut on Tuesday, comes months after Garza pled guilty to a single criminal wire fraud charge. In May 2017, as part of the same lawsuit, Garza’s companies were hit with a default judgment of more than $10 million. No representatives made any formal response to the lawsuit—Garza himself invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege.\n\nAccording to the civil complaint, which was first brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2015, Garza and his companies sold more than 10,000 “investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated from using their purported computing power to ‘mine’ for virtual currency.”\n\nThe judgment against Garza comes just days after the SEC also sued a New York man and his two companies that were allegedly involved in fraudulent initial coin offerings despite the fact that “neither has any real operations.”\n\nFurther Reading Feds try to force former sketchy Bitcoin mining firm employee to testify In his plea deal, Garza admitted that his businesses were, in fact, an illegal pyramid scheme. In early 2014, GAW Miners was first introduced to the Bitcoin public as a reseller of mining rigs. Later, the company shifted to cloud-based mining (Hashlets) and, in early 2015, introduced its own altcoin, dubbed “Paycoin.” GAW also tried its hand at its own cloud-based wallet service (Paybase) and its own online discussion board (HashTalk).\n\nIn January 2015, Garza told Ars that he “started the company because of scammers.” He claimed that he first heard of Bitcoin around a year ago, at which point he tried to buy a hardware mining rig and “spent $100,000 for a product I never got.” Garza declined to say from which company he purchased the rig.\n\n“I’d never had any experience with that—realizing a couple weeks later that these guys didn’t care how much money I can afford to lose,” Garza said. “I got really frustrated and thought we should start a company to try to fix this.”\n\nGarza told Ars that GAW (“Geniuses At Work”) made “over $1 million in sales our first month,” adding that, within a few months, “We leveled at $60 million to $80 million per year.”\n\nThe purported entrepreneur, who did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, is due to be sentenced in the criminal case on January 5, 2018 at 10:00am in Hartford, Connecticut, before US District Judge Robert N.

Its first move under the new moniker is an investment in Coinsquare Ltd., a Canadian exchange for trading digital tokens.\n\nThe penny stock nearly doubled in value in the days leading up to the company’s announcement Wednesday. After Riot formally unveiled the change in direction, the shares extended their rally, gaining as much as 17 percent to $9.50, the highest intraday level since January 2015.\n\nOther companies have proven that a move into the cryptocurrency space is often rewarded by investors, at least initially, as the astronomical increase in the value of digital tokens like bitcoin has lured everyone from big banks to startups. Overstock.com Inc. shares rallied after the online retailer said it was starting a digital-coin exchange.\n\nShares of MGT Capital Investments Inc., the cybersecurity firm with ties to controversial anti-virus software developer John McAfee, soared after the company announced a move into bitcoin mining, though the stock has since pared its gains.\n\nFormerly known as Venaxis Inc., and before that, AspenBio Pharma, the company had developed a blood test to detect a protein associated with inflammation of the appendix, but received a negative response from the FDA in 2014, the company said. It also owns intellectual property rights related to veterinary products.\n\nIn January, three Bioptix board members resigned, including former Colorado Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler.\n\nBioptix bought out BiOptix Diagnostics Inc. in 2016, which wasn’t the best move, according to Chief Executive Officer Michael Beeghley, who said the company wasn’t in a big enough market and noted its significant cash burn.\n\n“When I got on the board, they had made an acquisition that we decided as a board did not make sense, so we closed that down and then decided to change our focus,” he said Tuesday in a phone interview. “We looked at the sector and said, ‘How can we participate in this, and how can our shareholders participate in this very exciting industry that’s like the beginning of the internet?”\n\nThe company is paying a few million dollars for about a 12 percent interest in Coinsquare, and has warrants to increase its stake to 20 percent, Beeghley said. Next, the CEO is looking to buy companies focused on bitcoin mining, blockchain and security software. He plans to fund the deals with a combination of cash on hand and stock.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of success taking companies where we have closed down operations and identifying new sectors to invest,” said Beeghley, who became CEO of Bioptix in April. “The most recent is Polarity — ticker symbol COOL — which we took public in March.”\n\nBioptix has already shuttered operations, and is selling its remaining patents and intellectual property to a private company in the diagnostics industry. It will receive an upfront payment as well as a royalty stream that will likely be as much as about $2.5 million, Beeghley said. Bioptix plans to change its ticker symbol to RIOT.']"
10/06/2017,"['Russia\'s foreign ministry has sharply criticized a Greek court\'s decision to extradite Alexander Vinnik to the US for his alleged role in laundering funds through the BTC-e bitcoin exchange.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs said today that they ""noted with regret"" that the court opted to comply with the US\'s extradition request for Vinnik, who was arrested in Greece in late July and was accused of laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin through the exchange.\n\nBoth Vinnik and BTC-e were later charged by US prosecutors, with FinCEN handing down a $110 million fine after the sealed indictment was unveiled.\n\nSince then, Vinnik has remained in Greece pending the outcome of the extradition process. During that time the Russian government moved to extradite Vinnik on unrelated charges, a move that was later endorsed by Vinnik himself in a statement to Russia Today.\n\nTo date, Vinnik has maintained that he is innocent of the charges, though he claims to have worked for BTC-e in the past. BTC-e, for its part, has denied Vinnik\'s involvement and, since the exchange\'s site domain was seized by US agents, has moved to establish a new cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBut this week\'s ruling by a Greek judge was met with dismay by the Russian foreign ministry, which in a statement urged the court to reconsider the decision.\n\nThe Russian government said:\n\n""We deem the verdict unjust and a violation of international law. A request from the Russian Prosecutor General\'s Office on extraditing Mr Vinnik to Russia was submitted to the Greek authorities. Based on legal precedent, the Russian request should take priority as Mr Vinnik is a citizen of Russia.""\n\nThe statement notably makes no mention of BTC-e or the specific crimes for which Vinnik has been accused. That said, it does make note that Vinnik\'s legal team will appeal the decision, potentially leaving it up to the Greek Justice Ministry to decide on where the Russian national will be sent.\n\nThe foreign ministry also expressed hope that Vinnik will ultimately be extradited to Russia.\n\n""We hope the Greek authorities will consider the Russian Prosecutor General\'s Office request, and Russia’s reasoning, and act in strict compliance with international law,"" the ministry said.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It was also mining the digital assets—and making money while doing so.\n\nIt turns out Fidelity has been at this for three years, using its own computers to harvest the digital currencies bitcoin and Ethereum, which today trade for around $4,300 and $300 respectively.\n\nHadley Stern of Fidelity Labs tells Fortune that the U.S. based mining operation is very modest, however, and the undisclosed profits—CEO Johnson reportedly told the conference the mining “is actually making a lot of money”—are mostly the result of cryptocurrencies’ dramatic rise in value. (Bitcoin traded as low as $200 in early 2015, while the newer Ethereum was just $8 at the start of this year.)\n\nThose profits are nice, of course, but for Fidelity they are not the point. Stern says the real purpose of the mining is to learn about the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.\n\n“Think of it as an experiment. The real reason we began mining, and still do, is to learn how the network works, how consensus works, how difficulty levels work,” says Stern, referring to aspects of the mining process, which involves a network of computers competing to solve complex math problems.\n\nStern adds that Fidelity’s mining project is not sophisticated compared to professional operations, which involve companies, most of them in China, connecting giant rooms of specialized computers to cheap sources of electricity. But he says Fidelity continues to learn valuable lessons, including about recent campaigns by miners to create so-called “forks” in blockchains, which serve as an immutable record of all cryptocurrency transactions. (The most famous fork occurred this summer when some miners created a rival to bitcoin called “Bitcoin cash.”)\n\nThe lessons Fidelity (fnfv) is learning could give it a valuable advantage at a time when other big financial institutions are dipping their toes into the world of cryptocurrencies, which are together worth well over $100 billion today.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nIn the last month, J.P. Morgan (jpm) has begun handling customer orders for bitcoin-related financial instruments, while Goldman Sachs (gs) has stoked rumors it might open a trading desk dedicated to digital currencies.\n\nFidelity’s mining operations aren’t the only way the company is gaining insights into cryptocurrency. This summer, the brokerage entered an arrangement with Coinbase, a popular San Francisco-based exchange, to let customers view the value of their digital currency alongside stocks and others assets on their Fidelity homepage. The Coinbase tie-up is a convenience for customers, but also lets Fidelity gain insight into how many how investors are interested in cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, Fidelity has also included bitcoin in a program that helps individuals donate specialized assets, such as fine art, to charity. Stern says the company often conducts interviews with customers who donate bitcoin, in part to learn about their interest in the cryptocurrency.\n\n“It’s another way to assess market demand, get our hands a bit dirty with the technology, and learn what’s going on,” says Stern.\n\nThis article is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance. Click here for more on The Ledger.\n\nAn earlier version of this story misstated the current price of Ethereum.', 'Ian Simpson is head of marketing and communications at Lakeside Partners, an early-stage investment firm in Zug, Switzerland.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Simpson lays out why his country is poised to remain a hotbed of ICO activity for the time being, despite recent regulatory developments – and why it should not try to be the only hub.\n\nLast week\'s news that the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is investigating ICOs generated predictably sensational headlines around the world.\n\nBusiness Insider went so far as to include the ""terrorist"" angle in its headline – gratuitously, in my opinion. Some were quick to lump the news together with other negative announcements from around the world.\n\nBut it would be wrong to assume that FINMA\'s statement – even coming at roughly the same time as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\'s announcement of charges against two ICOs – spells doom for the ICO market in Switzerland.\n\nThose most closely involved in making ICOs happen in Switzerland are not at all naive about the possibility of scams. In a recent interview with online portal Finews, Luka Mueller of MME Legal made it clear that he was well aware of dubious tactics being used.\n\nMoreover, the local blockchain community – far from rooting for each and every project that lands in Crypto Valley – is very focused on self-regulation. I have often been on hand to witness the hard questions and critical attitude during local meetups when teams from around the world show up to promote their ICO campaign.\n\nCode of conduct\n\nThe Crypto Valley Association recently came out in favour of a code of conduct as a means to encourage the community to foster best practices and weed out scammers.\n\nThis is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the global blockchain community – peer-to-peer review and balance where no one central player needs to enforce or control things.\n\nOn a larger scale, this is one of the reasons why Switzerland is still one of the best places to conduct an ICO.\n\nThe country\'s legal and political system has been and will continue to be stable and predictable – and decentralised. The Swiss cantonal system with 26 semi-autonomous regions and rotating federal presidency provides a balanced framework, and a real-world example of the principles that power blockchain.\n\nAnd even when politicians do get involved, it is in the spirit of ""consensus-building."" We recently hosted two of the seven Swiss Federal Councillors – Johann Schneider-Ammann (economic affairs) and Ueli Maurer (finance) at our offices in Zug. Both showed an openness to learn and try to understand the potential – and complexities – of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nLeading the way\n\nAnother reason is that there is a wealth of experience and technical talent in Switzerland\'s Crypto Valley. What started with the founding of the Ethereum Foundation in Zug continues to grow and multiply.\n\nAt the ICO Summit in Zurich last month, nearly everyone in attendance was clear on the fact that regulations would come – as William Mougayar pointed out in his keynote speech – but with the hope that they recognize tokens as a completely new asset class. So, despite FINMA\'s announcement, the Swiss crypto/blockchain ecosystem still offers the most stable and promising conditions for ICOs.\n\nFor now, anyway.\n\nBecause Switzerland, like every other place, should not seek to have a monopoly. This would go against the very spirit of decentralization. Instead, it should focus on trying to lead the way forward so others, including the SEC, can learn from its example.\n\nSwiss Alps image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Blodget doubles down on prior comments that bitcoin is a perfect example of a speculative bubble, and lacks intrinsic value.

She also stresses that a great deal of bitcoin pessimism stems from a lack of understanding."", 'Public documents reveal that a second US financial services firm has withdrawn an effort to create exchange-traded futures (ETFs) tied to bitcoin.\n\nIn a letter dated October 5, an executive for Connecticut-based REX ETFs requested to pull back an amendment related to two previously proposed ETFs: the REX Bitcoin Strategy Fund and the REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. The withdrawal is a notable one, given that the company said in August that it would seek to launch multiple investment products around cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe letter, penned by REX president J. Garrett Stevens, indicates that officials at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) don\'t want to weigh in on such products in the absence of available derivatives contracts in which to invest.\n\nStevens wrote:\n\n""The Trust notes that on a call with the Staff, the Staff expressed the view that it is the Commission’s policy not to review a registration statement for a fund where the underlying instruments in which the fund intends to primarily invest are not yet available. The Staff requested that the Trust withdraw Amendment No. 47 until such time as the underlying instruments in which the Funds intend to invest (i.e., bitcoin futures contracts) become available for investment.""\n\nIndeed, that language is virtually identical to statements included in a withdrawal letter from VanEck, a New York-based money manager that yanked its own bitcoin derivatives ETF bid late last month. Like REX, the firm clarified that it had not yet sold any securities tied to the ETF.\n\nThe new development suggests that continued efforts to create investment products around cryptocurrency markets will still face some degree of optimism from regulators like the SEC.

Central banks are major owners, holding an estimated 18% of the 190,000 metric tonnes outstanding as of June, according to the World Gold Council. Perhaps they should consider owning Bitcoin instead.\n\nFundstrat Global Advisors\' Thomas Lee points out in a recently published report that 98% of gold ever extracted still exists today and that gold prices have historically tended to rise when supply slows. ""Looking forward, the supply growth for gold is likely to rise given the surge in production in past few years. Hence, the outlook for gold prices is not that attractive, at least compared to 2002,"" Lee says.\n\nGold glitters when the ratio of the yellow metal to U.S. dollars in circulation is below 300%, which was the case in the 1970s and again in 2002, and looks pricier when the ratio is above 750%. The ratio now is about 481%. Those figures combined with the very real possibility of Bitcoin\'s aggregate value exceeding $500 billion could turn some central banks onto cryptocurrency. And there are some reportedly considering it.\n\nFundstrat introduced a series of reference indices dedicated to the cryptocurrency market to ""create a framework for institutional investors to better understand the evolution and behavior of crypto-currencies."" The firm says Bitcoin continues to have the best risk/reward profile and captures the majority of the upside for the group, because it trades across multiple exchanges. Lee argues that adding cryptocurrencies to portfolios could add to returns and boost a portfolio\'s Sharpe ratio. He explains:\n\nBy adding even 2% to the portfolio (funded by reducing equities by 200bp), 3-yr annualized gains rise 226bp. Pushing this to 5% increases total return by 547bp, nearly doubling the return of a typical stock/bond blend... Only equities and crypto-currencies managed to produce a Sharpe-ratio greater than 1.0 in the past 3-years.', 'Indian P2P car and bike sharing platform Drivezy is accepting bitcoin as a method of payment and has announced an ICO for a P2P sharing marketplace after raising $10 million in funding.\n\nDrivezy, a Y-Combinator-backed startup formerly known as JustRide, has just raised $10 million in a part-equity and part-debt round of fundraising. The platform has also begun accepting bitcoin for payments to capitalize on the growing popularity of the cryptocurrency in the country.\n\nThe $10 fundraising round sees $5 million in equity investments from Japanese and American investors including Das Capital, IT Farm and Axan Partners. A further $5 million debt comes from a consortium of major Indian private banks and financiers.\n\nDrivezy launched earlier in 2017 and now has a fleet of about 1,000 cars and 300 bikes across four Indian cities. The peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform is now accepting bitcoin as a method of payment on its website and mobile applications, via a partnership with Indian bitcoin exchange Unocoin – the best-funded bitcoin startup in the country.\n\nCo-founder and CEO Ashwarya Singh stated:\n\nWith the growing popularity of Bitcoin in India, we feel that this is the right time to open ourselves up to alternative means in the sharing economy.\n\nFurther, the platform has already “seen 150-160 transactions” through bitcoin, Singh told the Economic Times.\n\nPrivate ICO\n\nFurther, Drivezy will also launch a private ICO in Japan with the support of Japanese FinTech AnyPay, an investor in the startup. The private ICO, only open to accredited investors subject to regulations, will enable Drivezy’s investors to purchase cryptographic tokens to gain a share of revenues generated by rental revenue on the platform.\n\nAccording to Drivezy’s ICO portal, investors will purchase ‘RentalCoins’ to facilitate investment into a fleet of shared vehicles operated by the platform. 95% of the subsequent revenue from the rentals will go to investors, with the remaining 5% to Drivezy in the first week of each month. 12.6 million tokens are up for sale over two private offerings with a unit price of 0.00141 ETH.\n\nCEO Ashwarya Singh added:\n\nThis ICO is part of our vision to leverage the power of the blockchain to build an open, secure and transparent technology to globalize the Indian car sharing marketplace. Rental coins can potentially create almost 10 lakh (1 million) micro-entrepreneurs who can supplement their household income by renting their assets.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The idea that cash is becoming obsolete is perhaps a little flawed. With so many different payment methods available, from credit and debit cards, and now digital currencies, many would think that cash, as an outdated payment method, may be falling away.\n\nA recent survey has shown that cash is only six percent down on debit cards as people’s prefered payment method. A lot of it has to do with its simplicity as well as security.\n\nPeople still prefer cash\n\nAccording to a recent study by Cardtronics and Edelman Intelligence, which surveyed 1,000 people in May and June, cash was prefered by 27 percent of people, while debit cards were on top with 33 percent preferring them.\n\nDigital currencies fared quite well, with 15 percent of people saying it was their prefered method of payment. The survey also showed that there are payment methods that are nearly obsolete, as only three percent backed cheques.\n\nThis survey was performed on an American audience, but it is not the only one of its kind. A similar survey was conducted in the Asian markets, where again it came out that cash still held a large majority for preferred payment methods.\n\nLessons to be learned for Bitcoin\n\nThere has to be a reason why a payment system that is as old as cash is still around today, and still so popular. It is perhaps a lesson that digital currencies like Bitcoin should heed.\n\nThe survey theorised that cash held such sway because it is the simplest form of payment, but it is also a very safe and practical form of payment. Digital currencies are still notoriously difficult to use, let alone understand for the average citizen, while they are also prone to hacks and scams.\n\nThe company which conducted the survey said 84 percent of respondents are worried about data security, and two-thirds said they make payment decisions based on which form is considered the most secure, up six percent since 2016.\n\nCompromised\n\nIt is not just digital currency security concerns that are keeping people clutching their dollar bills, credit and debit card fraud is still a huge problem, and a factor in many people’s thinking when choosing a payment method.\n\nThe threat posed when using digital currencies is different to that of credit and debit fraud, but it also far more scary because there are no guarantees from a central authority.\n\nHarley J.

10/07/2017,"['Bitcoin’s supremacy is strengthening in the cryptocurrency market, as its resiliency continues to impress experts and Wall Street’s top executives. The financial markets are clearly reflecting this sentiment as Bitcoin’s value now surpasses the US$ 4,300 mark.\n\nBitcoin Leads the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nBitcoin maintains its preeminence not only among fiat currencies but also among the other cryptocurrencies. According to a recent CNBC article, “Bitcoin was the top performing cryptocurrency in the last three months, despite the mega-rally earlier this year in so-called alternative coins, or altcoins.”\n\nThe CNBC article also points out the fact that in this quarter investors have started to move back to Bitcoin from altcoins.\n\nEarlier this year, some investors had moved away from Bitcoin, becoming interested in altcoins, such as Dash, Ether, and Monero, either as a hedge against the cryptocurrency’s volatility or because they had missed a Bitcoin rally.\n\nBitcoin’s superiority is most remarkable when considering that, in general, cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed. According to Business Insider, “the market for cryptocurrencies, digital coins powered by so-called blockchain technology, is up by more than 720% since the beginning of this year, at $145 billion.” In this regard, the article underlines that Bitcoin has increased by 450 percent in the last nine months.\n\nIn parallel, hedge funds are reportedly pumping millions of dollars into Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\n\nBitcoin Continues Marching Towards $5,000 Mark\n\nBitcoin has shown its capacity to adapt to the changing environment and absorb tremendous shocks. For example, when Chinese exchanges imposed transaction fees earlier this year, trading volumes fell dramatically. As a result, on January 25, 2017, Bloomberg reported that BTC trading volume had plunged 98 percent compared with the first days of 2017.\n\nNevertheless, within a few months, showing remarkable resiliency, the value of the cryptocurrency took off in an impressive ascending trajectory and on September 1, 2017, Bitcoin pierced an all-time high value of $5,000 USD in some of the Asian markets.\n\nShrugging off the Chinese government crackdown on Bitcoin exchanges and anti-Bitcoin comments made by JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, after a brief dip, Bitcoin’s value is rapidly recovering and now exceeds the $4,300 USD target.\n\nSimilarly, the main altcoins are picking up steam. Ethereum recovers from the South Korean’s banning of ICOs, climbing over $300 USD per coin, as of writing. Dash, on the other hand, continues its ascendant trend, topping the $300 USD mark.\n\nEncouraging news reports that might further sustain Bitcoin’s spectacular price trajectory are starting to appear again.\n\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that the Goldman Sachs Group was considering the possibility of setting up a dedicated desk to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, positive news reports from the Asia region are counteracting the effects caused by China and South Korea’s imposition of restrictions on cryptocurrencies.\n\nMost recently, Taiwan expressed Bitcoin-friendly sentiments. Wellington Koo, Chairman of Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission, gave assurances that Taiwan would not prevent the development of ICOs and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn effect, Koo said in a joint session of the Parliament and cabinet, “Taiwan would not regulate against the technology,” reported The News Lens.\n\nJapan is already a Bitcoin-friendly country. Since April 2017, Japan has recognized the digital currency as a legal tender and now the country is poised to take over as a leader in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTherefore, it is entirely within the realm of possibility that while maintaining its supremacy among altcoins, Bitcoin might break above its previous $5,000 USD record-high price in the next few months, Or, even, as the cryptocurrency expert Thomas Glucksmann recently predicted in an interview with CNBC, Bitcoin could get close to $6,000 USD by the end of 2017.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about Bitcoin sustaining its supremacy over other cryptocurrencies? Do you think that prices will continue to climb?

The San Francisco-based trading platform and wallet provider follows the recent Bitfinex announcement detailing plans for a possible bitcoin split.\n\nAlso read: An Inside Look at Genesis Block — Hong Kong’s New Cryptocurrency Working-Space\n\nCoinbase Reveals Customers Will Have Access to Bitcoin on Both Blockchains\n\nThis week the exchange Coinbase which provides over 36M wallets to bitcoin users revealed some parts of its plan for the upcoming Segwit2x fork. Coinbase states that they want to let customers know the company’s business mission is to ensure trust and safety within the cryptocurrency environment. Further, Coinbase emphasizes that there is no action required from users and “bitcoin can be securely stored on Coinbase before, during, and after the fork.”\n\n“Customers with bitcoin balances stored on Coinbase at the time of the fork will have access to bitcoin on both blockchains,” explains the exchange.\n\nAfter the fork, we will enable access when we have determined each blockchain is secure and stable. We expect this to happen within a few days after the fork, but it may take longer if additional risks emerge.\n\nThe San Francisco Exchange Will Reveal Distinct Names of the Two Bitcoin Blockchains Soon\n\nThe company executive, Dan Romero, explains they are still in the process of working on bitcoin cash withdrawals. The firm is also presently researching “engineering and security requirements for each bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nOf course, the announcement did not give away what everyone wanted to hear — Which is an answer to the question on how Coinbase will name each fork (due to the online debates around which fork has “the right to be called Bitcoin”). The announcement is also different than when the exchange revealed its initial plans to not support the previous hard fork, bitcoin cash. This time around, the company is saying they will allow access to the new chain, and customers do not have to withdraw their coins by a certain date.\n\nCommunity members are curious about the decisions made by companies like Coinbase and Blockchain.info as these firms have a lot of users within the bitcoin ecosystem. Coinbase does intend to tell the public how it will deal with the naming the two forks, as the company reveals it will be releasing this information in the near future.\n\nIn the coming weeks — nearer to the date of the fork — we will provide a more detailed plan for how Coinbase will approach naming the two Bitcoin blockchains.\n\nWhat do you think about the announcement from Coinbase concerning the Segwit2x fork?

Vinnik also denies the Russian charges but has agreed to be sent back to Russia. [Reuters]', 'The cryptocurrency market has exploded this year with over 1,000 digital currencies now on the market.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency, has captured the most attention, with Wall Street CEOs from JPMorgan\'s Jamie Dimon to Goldman Sachs\' Lloyd Blankfein weighing in on the coin this month alone.\n\nIt\'s up over 350% this year at near $4,400 per coin.\n\nBut bitcoin\'s meteoric rise doesn\'t mean that it\'ll be the top-dog crypto forever.\n\nMatthew Goetz, a former Goldman Sachs vice president and cofounder of BlockTower Capital, a Connecticut-based crypto hedge fund, recently told Business Insider that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are technologies like any other, and as a result, are susceptible to being usurped by a digital currency with superior tech.\n\n""Bitcoin is the most entrenched, it has very stable protocol, it doesn\'t change a lot, and it has a very strong developer base, but at the end of the day it is still software,"" Goetz said. ""There is some chance that something an order of magnitude better than bitcoin, technologically, could come along.""\n\nKind of like how Facebook replaced MySpace as the go-to social media site.\n\nTo be sure, Goetz said a bitcoin rival can\'t just be slightly better. Bitcoin\'s massive scale would require the hypothetical coin to have substantially better capabilities.\n\nHere\'s Goetz:\n\n""It\'s something like Facebook. If someone creates a new Facebook that has slightly better features, say 10% better. That\'s great, but network effects are strong. So, that new thing isn\'t going to kill Facebook.""\n\nBitcoin isn\'t the only crypto that has to worry about competition.\n\nEthereum, which has been touted as a bitcoin rival, operates in a slightly different space, according to Goetz. Bitcoin was built to be a currency, whereas Ethereum is a blockchain platform on which other applications can be built.\n\n""Ethereum is competing on features and now has four competitors,"" Goetz said. ""And it\'s all about who has the most cutting edge cryptographic technology, who can build features the fastest to make developers come build their smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of those platforms.""\n\nSmart contracts are a computer protocol based on Ethereum\'s blockchain technology that facilitates and enforces a contract or exchange. Just because the developers of Ethereum were the first to introduce this technology to the market doesn\'t mean they will win-out in the long run, according to Goetz.\n\n""If you look at other industries across history, there\'s a real chance that just because the first mover got out there doesn\'t mean that that\'s the one that ends up ultimately winning and capturing all the value,"" he said.\n\n""For some cryptocurrencies that are in a more competitive space, like decentralized file-storage, there are a number of projects attacking that,"" he added.\n\nAnd there are incumbents, he says, such as Amazon Azure and DropBox.\n\nBut it\'s still early days. Goetz says if you liken cryptocurrencies to the internet, then we are still in 1992. Just like bets during the early days of the internet were risky, so too are bets in the crypto market today.\n\n""You could be right on the thesis that cryptocurrencies are transformative and you could make what you think is the right bet at the time, but remember one time you had Yahoo and then this thing called Google came along,"" he concluded.', 'Regulation\n\nWellington Koo, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) chairman, today expressed his desire for Taiwan to emulate Japan’s cryptocurrency regulations, also suggesting that he does not wish to adopt a heavy-handed legislative approach to ICOs. The statements have been made in the lead up to Taiwan’s “Financial Innovation Experimentation Act” going before parliament – a bill designed to facilitate the creation of regulatory sandboxes pertaining to Taiwan’s fintech industry.\n\nAlso Read: Hong Kong Exchange Tidebit Seeks to Capitalize Upon Chinese Cryptocurrency Crackdown\n\nTaiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Has Indicate His Reluctance to Develop Heavy-Handed Cryptocurrency Regulations\n\nThe News Lens reports that the Financial Supervisory stated that he would not regulate against bitcoin, describing cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technologies as representing a major potential growth industry for Taiwan.\n\nThe statements came in response to a request for a clarification of Taiwan’s official position regarding cryptocurrency. The question was asked by congressman Jason Hsu of the Kuomintang Party during a joint session of parliament and cabinet. Hsu described Koo’s position as importantly paving the way for the “Financial Innovation Experimentation Act”.\n\nThe Financial Innovation Experimentation Act is a bill that was proposed by the Executive Yuan in May. The bill proposes the development of a “regulatory sandbox” approach to the fostering of innovation within experiment sectors of Taiwan’s fintech industry. K&L Gates recently published an article arguing that if passed, the bill would “enable experiment[ation with] innovative financial technology within a well-defined space and duration under relaxed legal requirements.” The bill is seen to comprise the legislative realization of the 2016 whitepaper published by Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission, in which the FSC advocated both private and public “efforts in the research and development of blockchain technology applications”.\n\nTaiwan’s Parliament Will Consider a Bill Designed to Promote the Development of Regulatory Sandboxes for Taiwan’s Fintech Industries\n\nHsu advocated that Taiwan adopt a regulatory framework similar to that of Japan, and avoid the legislative path undertaken by China and South Korea – suggesting that the congressman is in favor of encouraging innovation within the emerging ICO industry in addition to adopting regulations favorable to bitcoin ownership and use. Hsu stated “just because China and South Korea are banning [ICOs], doesn’t mean that Taiwan should follow suit – there is a huge opportunity for growth in the future… We should emulate Japan, where they treat cryptocurrency as a highly regulated, highly monitored industry like securities.”\n\nTaiwan’s cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology industries have shown signs of significant development in recent years. The country’s sole virtual currency exchange platform, Maicoin, currently hosts approximately 25,000 active users – which equates to approximately 1 out of every 1000 Taiwanese citizens. Maicoin’s sister company, Amis, is currently seeking to develop a private blockchain consortium alongside Taiwanese financial institutions – having so far struck deals with Taipei Fubon Bank and Taishin International Bank. Several off-shore based bitcoin exchanges have also recently sought to enter Taiwan’s cryptocurrency markets in recent months, including Hong Kong’s Tidebit and Japan’s Bitpoint.\n\nDo you think Taiwan will seek to adopt cryptocurrency regulations counter to those in China?

If anything, it's another clear sign the cryptocurrency is here to stay.\n\nUsing Bitcoin for Tuition Payments\n\nBitcoin has been used to buy homes, and countries like Venezuela and Vietnam are beginning to truly embrace the currency. Now, certain universities are adopting the payment method of bitcoin for tuition, albeit with a few caveats.\n\nThe Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Switzerland announced the decision to accept bitcoin payments this week, saying it is an indication of “its ability to disseminate knowledge on cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain, as well as its desire to gain experience in the practical aspects of this novel area.” The university offers courses focused on financing, economics, music, and more, meaning it was really only a matter of time before it invited bitcoin inside its walls.\n\nLucerne doesn’t handle the bitcoin transactions, instead entrusting all bitcoin payments to processing firm Bitcoin Suisse AG. The company will use a banking system similar to an e-banking portal, enabling the school to accept the digital currency without having to maintain possession of it. Bitcoin payments are converted into Swiss francs once a week, or once a day if more than 10,000 Swiss francs are acquired.\n\n“Bitcoin Suisse AG bears the risk of any exchange rate losses and currency fluctuations,” explains Lucerne.\n\nStudents who use bitcoin for tuition will incur a 1% payment fee, which Bitcoin.com notes is much less than traditional payment fees. Lucerne doesn’t expect many of its students to pay with bitcoin initially, but believes those who understand the currency will be among the first to take advantage of the option.\n\n“Those most likely to avail themselves of this opportunity will either be already familiar with the concept of financial services and blockchain or interested in pursuing continuing and executive education opportunities in this subject area,” the university added.\n\nExpanding Curriculum\n\nAccording to Bitcoin.com, Lucerne isn’t the only university that’s started to accept bitcoin. Last December, business school ESMT Berlin became the first German university to accept the cryptocurrency as payment, calling it “the most well-developed blockchain application.” Even earlier than that, The University of Nicosia in Cyprus announced that it was the first school in the world to adopt bitcoin in 2013, while King’s College was the first U.S. college to do so in 2014. Despite these colleges’ efforts, many people are unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and how they work. As a society, we’re a long way out from being to use them for all of our transactions.\n\nAs bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more popular and widely accepted, expect to see universities around the world to not only accept them as payment, but also introduce courses focused on blockchain technology. As reported by CoinTelegraph, the financial industry has a large demand for people with blockchain expertise, but the supply currently isn’t there. Fortunately, universities in the U.S., Europe, and Russia have incorporated such courses, including Duke University, Princeton University, UC Berkeley, the aforementioned University of Nicosia, and the National University of Science and Technology.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets.

An initial resistance on the upside is around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $486 high to $343 low. However, it won’t be easy for buyers to gain momentum above $380. The next major hurdle is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $486 high to $343 low at $390. The mentioned $390 level was a support earlier and now it would stop upsides in BCH.\n\nHowever, the recent break is a positive sign above $350.

If you did exactly that and are currently reading this over a glass of Armand De Brignac aboard your 100ft superyacht, then bully for you. If, however, you don\'t understand what Bitcoin is, let alone know how to get hold of any, it\'s time to gen up. There could well be more money to be made and chances are that someone you know has already bought in. Got fomo? Here\'s a quick-start guide...\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency whose every coin and transaction is tracked on a huge database called the blockchain. Rather than existing in one place, this database is held by all Bitcoin users. That means it’s difficult to cheat: rather than hacking a central computer, you would have to hack every single record on the network. Like any currency, Bitcoin has a value in terms of others – dollars, say, or pounds – and, as people have become interested in its potential, Bitcoin\'s value has soared. It has been the best-performing currency globally every year since 2010 (apart from 2014 when it was, err, the worst).\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin\n\nGood news: you don\'t have to buy a whole Bitcoin – at the time of publishing this, that would cost you £3,360. Instead, you can snap up as tiny a fraction of one as you please. The most user-friendly method is to download a free mobile app called Coinbase. You can transfer local currency to your Coinbase ""wallet"" via a credit or debit card and buy or sell Bitcoin at the click of a button for a small fee. Coinbase also lets you invest in two rising-star ""alt coins"": Ethereum and Litecoin.\n\nAlt coins?\n\nThese are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and there are hundreds of them. Some have been set up as a joke, such as Dogecoin (because: geeky internet memes), but others – including Monero, Ripple and Dash – have the potential to go far. Ethereum, which recently won backing from Microsoft and JP Morgan Chase, is up 900 per cent this year.\n\nWhat are the risks of buying cryptocurrency?\n\nRead next 10 coolest things this week: Adidas trainers to Peckham Levels type-gallery 10 coolest things this week: Adidas trainers to Peckham Levels A list full of goodies\n\nBuying cryptocurrency is a crapshoot. It\'s highly volatile: the last time the US stock market fell by more than ten per cent in a day was back in 1957; Bitcoin has seen more than ten per cent wiped off its value 38 times since January 2012. A cryptocurrency could also be obliterated overnight. Should major governments regulate hard against it or hackers manage to break its security, that\'s your money up in smoke. What\'s more, criminals have been stealing from online wallets (though that is avoidable: keep your cryptocurrency offline if you own a significant amount).\n\nHow much could I make?\n\nDepends on who you listen to. The doom mongers say that we\'re in a cryptocurrency bubble that\'s about to burst (indeed, the market took a steep downturn recently), while others believe a single Bitcoin could be worth $500,000 by 2030.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Everyone has heard of ICOs, but an older approach involving airdrops and hard forks is gaining new traction and holders of Bitcoin and Ethereum stand to benefit significantly if the trend continues.\n\nIn an ICO, participants contribute capital to buy tokens whereas, in an airdrop (or hard fork), tokens are allocated to existing holders of a particular chain—typically Bitcoin or Ethereum. That’s right, instead of buying tokens, they’re simply given away to the holders of another coin.\n\nIf the trend continues, Bitcoin and Ethereum are poised to spin-off dozens or hundreds of crypto-offspring. If so, this phenomenon could have significant implications for Bitcoin and Ether (the native asset of Ethereum) holders—and increase urgency for prospective holders. (Disclosure: My firm, Blockchain Capital, invests in blockchain startups and crypto assets including Bitcoin and Ether.)\n\nLet’s dig in to understand the viability of this approach and, most importantly, its implications for Bitcoin and Ether holders.\n\nObjectives of a token sale\n\nWhy would a project distribute its tokens for free instead of selling them? In many ways, the airdrop (or hard fork) method of distributing tokens is a better way to accomplish the same objectives of an ICO, which are usually three-fold:\n\nDistribute the token: The idea is to get your token into as many hands as possible to build a strong early foundation of user-advocates—so, breadth of distribution is typically the important metric, particularly given that many projects are trying to jumpstart a network effect. Raise awareness & gain mindshare: A high-profile ICO can help raise awareness among users and developers. Raise capital: To fund the future development and build-out of the project.\n\nAdvantages of an airdrop or hard-fork', 'LONDON — Bitcoin is at a one month high against the dollar on Sunday as it continues to rise.\n\nBitcoin is up 2.3% to $4,538.90 at 3.30 p.m. BST (10.30 a.m. ET):\n\nIt marks the first time bitcoin has been above $4,500 since early September and continues a rally that began on Thursday.\n\nCommenting on the rally on Friday, Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at trading platform eToro, said: ""European regulators have been cracking down on all things crypto lately and are considering introducing more regulatory framework that could hamper the growth of blockchain based assets.\n\n""On the other hand, Brazil\'s biggest financial firm [XP Investimentos] has announced that they plan to add bitcoin trading for their clients.

According to the security firm RedLock, the two affected companies were Aviva and Gemalto. The security firm was somewhat surprised by the hack since the hackers didn’t target any sensitive data of either company. The hackers were only interested to access the Amazon Cloud servers in order to mine cryptocurrencies by executing a bitcoin mining command.\n\nThe report further states:\n\nUpon deeper analysis, the team discovered that hackers were executing a bitcoin mining command from one of the Kubernetes containers. The instance had effectively been turned into a parasitic bot that was performing nefarious activity over the internet.\n\nHackers are usually known for breaching into digital enterprise infrastructure in order to steal sensitive data like social security numbers, credit card numbers, emails, passwords etc.\n\nCryptocurrency Mining Boom\n\nCryptocurrency mining has become a very competitive industry in the last couple of years. After the market capitalization “exploded” in 2017 and reached the record-breaking sum of $176 billion, more and more companies started mining cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum received the most attention from miners, as both reached their all-time high price of $5031 and $400 respectively.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by almost 10 million Th/s from last year and Ethereum managed to reach a daily hash rate of 100,000 GH/s. The Ethereum hash rate might not stay this high for very long, since the Ethereum development team is planning to transition the Ethereum protocol from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, effectively disabling Ethereum mining for cryptocurrency miners. Expert and analysts expect that current Ethereum miners will point their hash power to the next profitable cryptocurrency.\n\nDo you think that more hackers will try to gain access to hardware in order to mine Bitcoin?

Mr. Shanmugaratnam replied by stating that the Singaporean regulator did not recognize bitcoin as legal tender, and that the MAS will likely seek to regulate companies providing bitcoin payment services, rather than the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nAlso Read: Singapore-Based Bitcoin Startups Deal With Bank Account Closures\n\nThe MAS Does Not Intend to Develop a Distinct Regulatory Apparatus for Cryptocurrency\n\nIn response to a parliamentary question regarding the MAS’s regulatory conclusions and assessments pertaining to cryptocurrency, Mr. Shanmugaratnam stated that the MAS has determined cryptocurrency and ICOs to fall outside of its current financial legislation.\n\nThe question to which the MAS chairman responded asked “whether the Government is keeping track of the use/investment of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in Singapore; (b) how do cryptocurrencies affect our finance industry; (c) whether studies are being conducted to assess the problems and risks of using/investing in cryptocurrencies; and (d) whether regulatory frameworks are necessary in the future.”\n\n“MAS has been monitoring the use of… virtual currencies.” – Mr. Shanmugaratnam, Chairman of MAS\n\nThe MAS chairman responded with a number of points, first stating that Singapore’s central bank has concluded that cryptocurrency is not legal tender. The deputy prime minister defined legal tender as “the medium of exchange is recognized by law to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.”\n\nMr. Shanmugaratnam states that the “MAS has been monitoring the use of… virtual currencies.” The deputy prime minister states that the financial regulator has determined that virtual currency “use is not prevalent in Singapore” estimating that “about 20 Singapore retailers like restaurants and online shops currently accept bitcoins”, adding that “in the Singapore[an] financial industry, use of virtual currencies as a mode of payment is not significant.” The MAS is concluding that cryptocurrency “trading is generally for speculative investment purposes,” noting however that Singapore’s trading volume is significantly lower than that which is produced by the dominant markets of the U.S., Japan, and Hong Kong.\n\nSingapore’s Financial Regulator Recently Issued a Statement Pertaining to ICOs\n\nRegarding regulations, Mr. Shanmugaratnam stated that “MAS does not regulate… virtual currencies… However… regulates the activities that surround them if those activities fall within our more general ambit as financial regulator.” Mr. Shanmugaratnam also revealed that the MAS is currently developing new regulations for payment services designed to address the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with “the anonymous nature of [cryptocurrency] transactions.”\n\nThe deputy prime minister indicated that a similar regulatory approach would likely be applied to ICOs, stating that the “MAS has not issued new legislation specifically for ICOs”. Mr. Shanmugaratnam iterated that digital tokens through ICOs that are determined to comprise securities will be subject to the regulatory requirements of securities – including having to register a prospectus, obtain intermediary or exchange operator licenses, and mandatory compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terror financing laws. Mr. Shanmugaratnam stipulated that the monetary authority of Singapore “will continue to monitor the developments of [the ICO industry], and consider more targeted legislation if necessary.”\n\nIn recent weeks, reports have detailed that numerous bitcoin-based startups domiciled in Singapore have experienced bank account closures due to uncertainty pertaining to the legal status of cryptocurrency. The statement comes approximately two months after the MAS first sought to clarify its regulatory position regarding ICOs, asserting that token deemed to comprise securities would fall under the purview of existing regulations.\n\nDo you think that Singapore’s plan to avoid developing unique regulations for cryptocurrencies will be viable long term?

The exchange says this is the startup’s first step towards creating a trustless exchange process.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Illegal in Nepal? Police Arrest Seven Individuals for Trading Operations\n\nAltcoin Exchange Performs the First Atomic Swap Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIn the cryptocurrency space, atomic swaps are a pretty hot topic, and there are only a few blockchains that have exchanged this way. Atomic swaps allow two parties to transact between two blockchains in a trustless manner without counterparty risk. So far only a few altcoins have performed this function with bitcoin; including currencies like litecoin, decred, and vertcoin. On October 7th the Altcoin Exchange development team processed a swap between both bitcoin and ethereum networks.\n\n“We have completed the very first Ethereum <> Bitcoin atomic swap! More details coming soon,” the Altcoin Exchange team announced this week.\n\nThe Altcoin Exchange team transferred 0.12345 ETH for 0.12345 BTC using an on-chain open source process. Altcoin Exchange plans to launch the project’s Github repository this Tuesday, the company’s CEO Andrew Gazdecki told news.Bitcoin.com.\n\nThe Centralized Trading Model Will Soon Be a Memory of the Past\n\nGazdecki tells us that decentralized exchanges are the “future of cryptocurrency trading” and atomic swaps will be a big part of the business model. Altcoin Exchange believes the team’s demonstration of an atomic swap between ethereum and bitcoin means the centralized trading model is soon to be a memory of the past. Gazdecki explains that atomic swaps will replace traditional exchange transactions with a more secure method and just as speedy.\n\nSince 2011 Twenty Six Cryptocurrency Exchanges Bit the Dust – Altcoin Exchange Believes Atomic Swaps Will Prevent These Losses\n\nThe team at Altcoin Exchange says they still has some work to do with the code as far as privacy and order matching comes. The group says they are also thankful for the decred development team and Litecoin’s Charlie Lee for help pioneering the atomic swap effort.\n\n“Since June of 2011, 26 exchanges have been compromised, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of coins. To prevent more of these types of hacks, decentralized exchanges are needed, and atomic swaps bring us one step closer to achieving this goal,” Gazdecki explains to news.Bitcoin.com.\n\nWhat makes the technology behind Atomic Swaps so exciting is it allows for nearly instant direct trades between cryptocurrencies. We believe this to be a critical component for creating a truly decentralized exchange that executes transactions at the same speed in which centralized exchanges are able to but without the risk of hacking and theft.\n\nThe atomic swaps performed by Altcoin Exchange between the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains can be viewed here with the swap initiation, the participation, and redeem A and redeem B.\n\nWhat do you think about the first atomic swap between bitcoin and ethereum?

Supporters think the cryptocurrency has the potential to disrupt the financial industry. They also point to bitcoin's staggering returns in recent years. Critics highlight the risks and volatility of bitcoin.\n\nThose same arguments, both for and against, also apply to another investing alternative: biotech stocks. Some investors view biotech stocks as a great vehicle for huge returns from innovative products, while others are afraid of the high levels of risk and volatility. Which of these two promising -- yet potentially perilous -- investment alternatives is the smarter investment pick?\n\nRisks and volatility\n\nTo understand the risks and volatility of bitcoin, it's helpful to first learn exactly what bitcoin is and how it works. My colleague Maxx Chatsko wrote a good article summarizing the key things to know about bitcoin. I recommend reading it if you're not familiar with the cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are three major risks for investors in buying bitcoin. One is the risk that governments prohibit use of the digital currency. China is the the largest market in the world for bitcoin trading. If Beijing decided to make serious moves against bitcoin, prices would crash.\n\nAnother risk is that an alternative cryptocurrency largely supplants bitcoin. The Ethereum network's Ether currently ranks second in total market valuation and has some advantages over bitcoin that could continue to attract more investors.\n\nThe third major risk for bitcoin relates to its underlying technology. Companies and exchanges that focus on bitcoin can be vulnerable to cyber attacks. Two such attacks in the past caused bitcoin prices to fall and contributed to a spike in volatility.\n\nIndividual biotech stocks also face significant risks and volatility. A key risk for biotech stocks relates to concerns about the safety of their drugs. For example, Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT) stock plunged recently after the FDA warned about risks of its liver disease drug Ocaliva. In Intercept's case, Ocaliva had already been approved by the FDA. For many biotechs, though, issues related to safety or efficacy occur in clinical testing and prevent products from ever reaching the market.\n\nThere's also the ever-present possibility for biotechs that another company introduces a rival product that cuts into market share. Even the threat of this happening can wreak havoc on a biotech stock.\n\nBiotechs even face the potential that their products work too well. As a case in point, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) stock dropped more than 40% between mid-2015 and mid-2017 primarily because of declining sales for its hepatitis C drugs. Those drugs cured so many patients that Gilead's market shrank considerably.\n\nWhich is riskier -- bitcoin or biotech? Individual biotech stocks appear to have more risks than bitcoin does. Of course, you can also buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold many biotech stocks. Biotech ETFs tend to be less volatile than bitcoin and could present lower risks for investors.\n\nPerformance\n\nWhen it comes to performance, it's not even close between bitcoin and biotech. The first bitcoin exchange opened in 2010. If you had bought $10 worth of the digital currency then and held on to it, you'd now have a fortune of close to $13.9 million. That's an average annual return of more than 650%. It's hard to find biotech stocks that would have turned $10 into $100 during the same time period.\n\nHowever, most investors wouldn't have bought bitcoin in its infancy. How does the cryptocurrency stack up against biotech stocks more recently? Here's how the NYSE Bitcoin Index has fared so far in 2017 versus the best-performing biotech ETF, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEMKT:XBI), and one of the hottest biotech stocks on the market -- Puma Biotechnology (NASDAQ:PBYI).\n\nClearly, bitcoin is outperforming biotech any way you look at it. Those returns came with high volatility, though.\n\nSmarter investment\n\nInvestors make decisions based on risk-reward profiles. When comparing two investing alternatives, they should determine which option provides the better prospects for return for the amount of risk taken. So far, bitcoin has demonstrated a better risk-reward profile than biotech stocks have. But will that continue? There's no way to be sure.\n\nI certainly don't expect that bitcoin will generate annual returns in the future like it has in the past. On the other hand, the level of risk could decrease as digital currencies become more widely accepted. In my view, putting a small portion of an investment portfolio in bitcoin isn't a bad move. Understand, though, that it would be a purely speculative play.\n\nIf you're truly looking for a disruptive investment, though, I'd go with biotech stocks. The advances that many biotech companies are making are incredible. The possibilities for treating serious diseases are more exciting than ever before. And buying a biotech ETF is a great way to invest in the disruptive potential with lower risk and volatility. A century from now, I suspect the changes to the world introduced by biotechs will be much greater than those resulting from bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin versus biotech? Perhaps the smartest investment choice of all is this: Try a little of both."", 'Crowdfunding\n\nReddit online community members join forces to assist in the placement of North Korea’s Hermit Kingdom refugees.\n\nPeople Over Politics\n\nNorth Korean refugees need help.\n\nReddit /r/BTC users were alerted to a new crowdfunding campaign.

The hackers ultimately got access to Amazon\'s cloud servers after discovering that their administration consoles weren\'t password protected.\n\n""Upon deeper analysis, the team discovered that hackers were executing a bitcoin mining command from one of the Kubernetes containers,"" reads the RedLock report. Kubernetes is a Google-created, open-source technology that makes it easier to write apps for the cloud.\n\n""The instance had effectively been turned into a parasitic bot that was performing nefarious activity over the internet,"" the report says.\n\nThe companies impacted were Aviva and Gemalto, both multi-billion dollar, multi-national companies. They were notified by RedLock about the issues.\n\nHackers are known to slip into corporate servers to steal data, which they usually sell for money, or give to state-actors who are looking for intel. But bitcoin mining is a different thing all together. These hackers are basically just stealing pricey space in corporate cloud storage.\n\nAmazon, Aviva and Gemalto did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nPower in numbers\n\nThough anyone could try to mine bitcoin off their computer services, the process is super energy intensive, and could be costly in electricity costs alone. But it\'s worth while for many because success can be very lucrative.\n\nTo avoid the high cost of going at it alone, most bitcoin miners join a pool of different computers which combined their powers to solve complex algorithms. Successfully solving the problem generates a set number of new bitcoin, which as of Friday were worth upwards of $4,300 each. Inherent to its design, the cryptocurrency can be mined until there are a total of 21 million bitcoin floating around the internet, but the process becomes more and more difficult as the years pass.\n\nRedLock discovered the breaches along with hundreds of other administration consuls which were unlocked across AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud — most likely by a careless systems administrator. But illicit bitcoin mining isn\'t always coming from the outside.\n\nCoinDesk reported that two IT workers for the government of Crimea were fired in late September, after it was discovered that they were mining bitcoins on their work computers. In January, an employee for the US Federal Reserve was put on probation and fined for mining on servers owned by the US central bank.']"

(Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin, the best-known of the upstart digital currencies, is still a mystery to many Americans. But its price is soaring so high into the stratosphere that it\'s being compared to mega asset bubbles of the past and gaining widespread publicity just like Nasdaq\'s exuberant internet stock rally back in the late 1990s, and the U.S. real estate frenzy a decade ago.\n\nIf you\'ve heard about Bitcoin, it\'s mainly from startling headlines about its 1000% gain this year. Or maybe the news of it trading above $11,000, making it the most valuable player in the mushrooming space for so-called cryptocurrencies. Or because Wall Street skeptics call it a “fad,” a “fraud” and a “speculative bubble.” Or because Bitcoin bulls say it is a misunderstood new asset class that has a lot of potential.\n\nBelievers in Bitcoin say it’s the money of the future, a digital alternative to the dollar or euro or yen. Non-believers say it’s not real money. After all, you can\'t dig into your pocket and pull one out like a $10 bill.\n\nSome investment pros say it’s a new asset class, no different from a stock, a bond or an ounce of gold, and that it has great investment promise. Skeptics say it’s not an investment because there’s no good way to value it.\n\nSo what exactly is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency and digital payment system that allows people to send and receive Bitcoins — or digital tokens — to anyone, anywhere in the world. It runs on a decentralized network of computers in which all transactions are recorded, verified and updated by technology known as blockchain, which is akin to an online public ledger. Unlike traditional payment networks such as Mastercard, Bitcoin isn’t owned by anyone. There’s no central authority, such as a bank or government, that\'s in charge of it. That means investors are getting into something that has no regulators to protect them in the event of fraud or other negative outcomes.\n\nMore: No, bitcoin isn\'t going to replace gold as a safe haven investment\n\nMore: Bitcoin price bounces back almost $1,000 as market moves on from recent drama\n\nMore: Chinese bitcoin exchange announces it is ending trading\n\nHow do you buy Bitcoin?\n\nAn easy way to get started is to set up an account with a Bitcoin exchange, such as U.S.-based Coinbase, which allows you to purchase Bitcoins with money from your bank account or credit card. And just as the New York Stock Exchange is a place where you can buy and sell stocks, such as Apple or Amazon, these exchanges will let you trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow do I access my Bitcoin “money”?\n\nBitcoins purchased on an exchange or received in a transaction can be stored and accessed in a so-called ""Bitcoin Wallet,"" which is like a bank account. A Bitcoin Wallet lets you receive Bitcoins, store or save them and send them to others. There are apps that allow you to install a Bitcoin Wallet on your computer or mobile device.\n\nWhere can I spend it, and what can I buy with it?\n\nYou can spend your Bitcoin at any retailer set up to accept it as money. But Bitcoin hasn’t yet enjoyed widespread adoption, and those retailers that do accept it are mostly set up online. You can use Bitcoin to buy more than 1,000 products at discount retailer Overstock.com. You can also go online and use Bitcoin at Microsoft to buy apps, games and videos on Xbox, book airline tickets from CheapAir.com or hotel rooms from Expedia, purchase a satellite TV subscription from Dish Network or buy a sandwichfrom an Allentown, Pa., Subway store.\n\nOne way to get around retailers not accepting Bitcoin is to purchase gift cards for retailers such as Amazon or BestBuy at gift card makers such as eGifter that accept Bitcoin.\n\nHow are Bitcoins priced?\n\nThe price is determined by supply and demand — and market forces. The Bitcoin supply will be limited to 21 million, and currently there are roughly 16.7 million. Whether Bitcoin rises or falls in value depends on whether investors believe it will gain widespread acceptance, whether it can avoid being shut down by governments and whether it can continue to dominate the digital currency market or be surpassed by one of more than 1,300 other cryptocurrencies.\n\nCLOSE Bitcoin has so much flavor of the month because it is a relatively new alternative currency demanded by hackers. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook\n\nWhat do investors need to know about Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin has gained most of its notoriety as an investment. A single Bitcoin ended 2016 at nearly $1,000. Now it\'s over $11,000. But one of Bitcoin’s downsides is that it has proved to be wildly volatile.\n\nBulls and Bears collide on Bitcoin\n\nThat rapid ascent has been accompanied by wildly different prognostications about Bitcoin’s future.\n\nBulls such as Thomas Lee, founder of Wall Street firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, see promise. His firm thinks Bitcoin could be worth $11,500 by the middle of 2018, which is near current levels. His long-term target is as high as $25,000 by 2022. He believes Bitcoin will enjoy “expanded acceptance” as a digital currency and payment platform as well as “broader adoption” as a “store of value,” similar to gold. He also sees a growing interest from big institutional investors.\n\nBut there are some big bears out there. Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, earlier this fall called Bitcoin a “fraud.” At a recent investment conference, Dimon said"" “Right now, cryptocurrencies are kind of a novelty.” His fear is that when people start to lose money, governments around the world will eventually “shut down” exchanges that trade digital currencies. “It will end badly,” he said.\n\nBut where Dimon sees trouble, others see profit-making opportunities.\n\nBitwise Asset Management, a San Francisco-based start-up, has introduced a new cryptocurrency investment fund. The Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index fund tracks the top 10 cryptocurrencies weighted by market cap, including No. 1 Bitcoin and others such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Zcash.\n\nCiting risk and a need to “proceed with caution,” Bitwise co-founder Hunter Horsley says it makes more sense for investors to be able to buy a basket of cryptocurrencies to reduce risk through diversification. His firm\'s new fund will track the biggest cryptocurrencies, like the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index tracks the largest U.S. stocks.\n\n“Our view is that, over time, as cryptocurrencies continue to ascend along with their potential, that more people will want to participate via investing,” Horsley told USA TODAY. He says owning a basket of cryptocurrencies is better than owning just Bitcoin. He notes that Bitcoin, which made up roughly 85% of the total cryptocurrency market earlier this year, accounted for about 55% of its total market cap. “You don’t want to be trying to pick the winners,” he says.\n\nThere are now at least 55 crypto-focused hedge funds, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next. And Goldman Sachs, a big Wall Street bank, is reportedly looking into a new trading operation involving Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nDon’t buy the hype, value investor Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management counters.\n\n“In my view, digital currencies are nothing but an unfounded fad, based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people pay for it,” Marks told clients in a letter in July.”\n\nCLOSE Gil Luria, Wedbush Securities analyst, discusses Bitcoin\'s massive winning streak with Bloomberg\'s Scarlet Fu and Alix Steel on ""Bloomberg Markets."" Bloomberg\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2kzEYfc', 'The bitcoin price surged past $4,875 on Monday as traders began to flee from the altcoin markets and pour their wealth back into bitcoin ahead of the SegWit2x hard fork that is scheduled for November.\n\nBitcoin Price Surges Past $4,875\n\nBitcoin’s dominant hold on the cryptocurrency economy had tapered throughout 2017, with bitcoin’s share of the total market cap falling as low as 34% after entering the year at 88%. The year’s bull market led to a dramatic expansion of the altcoin markets, and the initial coin offering boom reduced bitcoin’s market cap share further still.\n\nToday, however, bitcoin dominance soared to nearly 54%, its highest mark since May, as traders began to liquidate their altcoin holdings and concentrate their wealth in bitcoin. At present, the bitcoin price is trading at a global average of $4,877, which represents a 24-hour gain of 7% and brings bitcoin within $123 of the $5,000 threshold. Altcoin prices, meanwhile, are bleeding. Aside from bitcoin, no top 10 cryptocurrency has experienced a 24-hour price increase, and five of them have posted double-digit declines.\n\nThe bitcoin price is faring well on every major exchange, but Korean traders appear determined to pull it past $5,000 to a new all-time high. At present, Bithumb’s BTC/KRW is trading at $4,999. This is more than $120 above the global average and more than $250 above BTC/JPY on bitFlyer.\n\nThe Role of SegWit2x\n\nOne theory for today’s bitcoin price climb is that traders are positioning themselves to profit from upcoming airdrops. There are two bitcoin hard forks on the horizon that give bitcoin holders the opportunity to claim airdropped coins at the moment of the blockchain split, similarly to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that took place on August 1. The first, Bitcoin Gold, is scheduled for October 25, and the second, SegWit2x, is slated to take place in November. It is unlikely that Bitcoin Gold is having a significant effect on the bitcoin price, although traders will definitely seek to extract any profit that they can from the airdrop. Although SegWit2x — if executed — will produce coins that are most likely more valuable than those minted by Bitcoin Gold, it also seems a bit unlikely that traders are already making such a large push to accumulate bitcoins ahead of an event with a November target date.\n\nThe more likely scenario is that traders are responding positively to signs that bitcoin exchanges and mining pools — even those that purportedly support the SegWit2x hard fork — have begun to announce that they will support both bitcoin blockchains following the chain split. Both Coinbase and Bitfinex have explicitly stated that they will support both the incumbent and the new blockchain, and Bitfinex has further stated that they will list the SegWit2x coins as B2X — not Bitcoin or BTC. Even mining pool ViaBTC — a proponent of both SegWit2x and Bitcoin Cash — has indicated it will allow its users to mine either blockchain. Rightly or wrongly, some traders view these developments as an indication that the SegWit2x fork will not happen or, if it does, the new blockchain will be treated as an altcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""The Pacific island nation of Vanuatu has become the world’s first county to accept the virtual currency bitcoin for its citizenship program.\n\nThe Vanuatu Information Centre (VIC) announced that its Development Support Program (DSP) will allow foreigners to qualify for Vanuatuan citizenship through a one-time payment of $200,000 – or its cryptocurrency equivalent.\n\nAt current market prices, this puts the price of citizenship for the so-called Paradise Islands at slightly more than 43 bitcoins.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nGregory Panayotou/360cities.net via Getty Images\n\n“While attempts have been made in the past to effect payments for citizenship by investment programs via bitcoin, these efforts never had the political stamp of approval, and were shut down as a consequence,” said Geoffrey Bond, Chairman of the VIC.\n\nHe continued: “In this case, the government of Vanuatu has explicitly expressed a desire to be at the forefront of adopting new technologies, officially encouraging the VIC to receive payments in bitcoin.”\n\nAll bitcoin transactions for Vanuatuan citizenship will be run through an Australian cryptocurrency exchange, which complies with requirements imposed by the Australian financial regulations.\n\nVanuatu Development Support Program\n\nVanuatu is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and citizenship allows visa-free travel to 113 countries, including EU states, Russia and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe country also advertises tax and investment incentives as part of the appeal for citizenship to its country.\n\n“I’m convinced Vanuatu’s bold move will give them a considerable competitive advantage in the citizenship market,” says Christian Nesheim, an investment migration specialist and advisor to the VIC, in a news release.\n\n“Many early investors in bitcoin would like to realize some of their earnings without incurring large capital gains taxes. Ideally, then, they would convert their cryptocurrency into tangible assets in a low-tax jurisdiction… As Vanuatu will now be the only country to offer citizenship for bitcoins, I think the program will see a surge in interest more or less immediately.”\n\nThe price of bitcoin hit an all-time high of $5,013 on September 2 but has since dropped to around $4,500, according to industry website CoinDesk.\n\nToday’s slightly reduced price still represents an 18-month gain of more than 1,000 percent and puts bitcoin’s market cap at around $76 billion.\n\nThe cryptocurrency' recent rise in value can in part be attributed to interest from China, despite a crackdown from authorities in the country. The slump of certain currency markets, including the British and Egyptian pound, can also help explain bitcoin’s price rise.\n\nAccording to some cryptocurrency analysts, bitcoin is at a similar stage in its development to the early internet.\n\n“Exponential technologies have incredible impacts on our society,” Nicolas Cary, co-founder of the popular bitcoin wallet Blockchain, said in an opinion piece in Newsweek earlier this year.\n\n“While bitcoin quietly doubles in size year-on-year, it’s covering more and more territory, surprising more and more pundits, and being adopted by more and more people.”"", 'Bitcoin\'s future is undoubtedly tough to predict. The pundits either believe it will go to the moon or collapse. The latest to join the league of those predicting the demise of Bitcoin is Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University.\n\nWho is Kenneth Rogoff?\n\nKen Rogoff is a professor of public policy and economics at Harvard University. He has a distinguished academic background, with degrees from Yale University and MIT. He served as the chief economist of the IMF from 2001 to 2003 and is a chess grandmaster. With such a background, it is inevitable that his views on Bitcoin attract a lot of attention.\n\nDim Views on Bitcoin\n\nIn a blog post in the Guardian, Ken Rogoff writes:\n\n""Is the cryptocurrency Bitcoin the biggest bubble in the world today, or a great investment bet on the cutting edge of new-age financial technology? My best guess is that in the long run, the technology will thrive, but that the price of Bitcoin will collapse.""\n\nWhile he acknowledges that certain governments like Japan have taken the lead in regulating and accepting virtual currencies, he attributes it to a desire to become the global leader of fintech. He expects most governments to ignore Bitcoin when used for small, anonymous transactions; but act against it once Bitcoin becomes more widely used.\n\n""The long history of currency tells us that what the private sector innovates, the state eventually regulates and appropriates. I have no idea where Bitcoin’s price will go over the next couple years, but there is no reason to expect virtual currency to avoid a similar fate.""\n\nEchoes Jamie Dimon\'s Arguments\n\nKen Rogoff\'s arguments for Bitcoin\'s eventual collapse seem to echo Jamie Dimon\'s views - that governments will not allow Bitcoin to become successful and will coerce Bitcoin users into abandoning it. When asked about the government\'s ability to shut down a currency which is virtual and knows no boundaries, Jamie had even added that governments could threaten Bitcoin users with jail. It is interesting to note that all the prophesies about Bitcoin\'s demise come from people within the establishment, whose very future Bitcoin threatens.\n\nEventually...\n\nThe professor has predicted that Bitcoin will eventually collapse, but has given no time frame for this to occur. Hence it is impossible for him to be proven wrong, even if each Bitcoin becomes worth a million dollars, as it might still eventually collapse. Analysts who work in the real world (as opposed to theoreticians) have to make time-bound predictions. There is a lot of difference between an asset\'s price doubling in two years and doubling in twenty years.\n\nRemember Professor Bitcorn?\n\nComparisons with predictions made by another professor, Mark Williams, will be inevitable. Mark William was dubbed ""Professor Bitcorn"" after he bravely predicted in December 2013 that Bitcoins would be worth less than $10 by mid-2014. When Bitcoin remained at over $600 in June 2014, he remained defiant and stated that time would vindicate his prediction. By refusing to specify a time frame for his projection, Ken Rogoff has at least avoided Mark Williams\' fate.', 'Hackers infecting computers to mine Bitcoin have discovered multinational corporations do not even have passwords for their admin consoles.\n\nAs Business Insider reports quoting findings by security firm RedLock, Amazon Web Services suites at both Aviva and Gemalto were easy prey for bad actors.\n\nJust like Deloitte and the ongoing Equifax scandal, where investigators realised vast troves of employee and customer data were protected by a classic “admin/admin” password combination, these two giants also had failed to get to grips with security.\n\nIn addition to AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure cloud storage also lacked passwords.\n\nKubernetes, an open-source app writing aid from Google, served as the site for infection.\n\n“Upon deeper analysis, the team discovered that hackers were executing a Bitcoin mining command from one of the Kubernetes containers,” RedLock reveals.\n\n“The instance had effectively been turned into a parasitic bot that was performing nefarious activity over the Internet.”\n\nThe international community has been on high alert specifically regarding Bitcoin ransomware since May’s wide-reaching WannaCry cyberattack.\n\nAt the same time, multiple reports have voiced warnings about the proliferation of ransomware and phishing emails over the past year.\n\nWith legacy systems offering such little defense, however, hackers have a natural advantage. Neither Aviva nor Gemalto have made official responses to the attack after RedLock informed them about their involvement.', 'Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk\'s product team.\n\nThe following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.\n\nWhile Jamie Dimon may be convinced bitcoin is a fraud, it appears that the competition has a different view.\n\nEarlier last week, The Wall Street Journal reported on a rumor that Goldman Sachs is considering putting together a new trading outfit for cryptocurrencies. Its CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, later tweeted that he was undecided on bitcoin as a currency, deftly skirting the issue. Of course, it\'s not necessary to ""believe"" in the bitcoin story to see that there\'s money to be made by trading it (and Goldman Sachs research covers bitcoin as an asset).\n\nIf true, however, this is more than just another example of Wall Street and bitcoin getting closer. First of all, Goldman Sachs would not be alone in putting financial weight behind bitcoin.\n\nFidelity Investments has been working on bitcoin-related projects for some time through its R&D arm Fidelity Labs, most recently unveiling a partnership with Coinbase to enable account holders to track their cryptocurrency holdings alongside more traditional assets.\n\nStill, it would be the first Wall Street-based institutional trading desk for the asset.\n\nThe report does stress that Goldman may eventually pass on the project. Yet even if it does, it is indicative of an increasing acceptance in the upper echelons of finance that bitcoin is not going away, and that there is money to be made.\n\nWhat\'s more, the strategy does fit in with Goldman\'s reputation as aggressive traders seeking high-risk, high-return turnover – more so than does its recent foray into retail banking.\n\nAnd with market volatility at a five-year low (according to the leading index), it makes sense that the investment bank would look for a new opportunity to offset the recent slump – Q2 trading revenues were down 40 percent year-over-year.\n\nWill other Wall Street giants follow? It\'s likely. Last week the CEO of Morgan Stanley stated that bitcoin was ""more than just a fad.""\n\nChoppy charts\n\nYet, the potential impact of the project, if pursued, would go beyond Goldman Sach’s bottom line.\n\nThe most noticeable impact would be on bitcoin\'s trading volumes, as even more institutional funds pour into the market. This could significantly push up the volatility, making bitcoin even more of a high-risk/high-return asset than it already is – which in turn could attract more risk-seeking institutional funds, perpetuating a chaotic cycle that could well end in tears.\n\nOn the other hand, we could also see a corresponding increase in the trading of bitcoin derivatives. Earlier this year, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission authorized LedgerX as the first regulated bitcoin derivatives exchange and clearinghouse. And the Chicago Board Options Exchange is expected to launch bitcoin futures contracts later this year.\n\nWith heightened demand for hedging instruments, it\'s likely that others will emerge.\n\nSince hedging reduces the need to ""churn"" positions (what investors lose on one position they make on another), a more liquid derivatives market could partially calm bitcoin volatility.\n\nIt could also kickstart a snowball effect on liquidity. One of the reasons the SEC gave for rejecting the Winklevoss brothers’ bid to launch a bitcoin ETF was the vulnerability of the bitcoin price to manipulation. A strong increase in liquidity could encourage a favorable review of the situation.\n\nNew plan\n\nA final, tenuous but nevertheless intriguing effect could be the emergence of bitcoin as a competitive tool. We could see corporate strategies regarding bitcoin services as a differentiating factor that positions financial businesses as more forward-thinking, trader-friendly and value-driven than the ""old school"" counterparts.\n\nThis is already beginning to happen in the banking sector. In Japan, several large financial firms have invested in bitcoin exchanges, with SBI contemplating setting up its own. And Skandiabanken of Norway is offering its clients cryptocurrency services. That investment banks are thinking of officially getting involved is a sign of the idea spreading to other areas of finance.\n\nIt\'s worth emphasizing, though, that rumors by nature are unconfirmed, and Goldman Sachs may decide to not go ahead.\n\nIt\'s even possible that they\'re not even thinking of it at all, and that this rumor was maliciously started to move the bitcoin price. However, the strategy makes sense, and if Goldman Sachs isn\'t thinking of it, it should be.\n\nBecause if they don\'t, a competitor will. And the rest of us will have to brace for yet more of a wild ride.\n\nGoldman Sachs logo image via Glassdoor\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

My presentation focused on the future of mining—not just of gold and precious metals but also cryptocurrencies.\n\niStockphoto.com, pixabay, U.S. Global Investors\n\nBelieve it or not, there are upwards of 2,100 digital currencies being traded in the world right now, with a combined market cap of nearly $150 billion, according to Coinranking.com.\n\nObviously not all of these cryptos will survive. We’re still in the early innings. Last month I compared this exciting new digital world to the earliest days of the dotcom era, and just as there were winners and losers then, so too will there be winners and losers today. Although bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be the frontrunners right now, recall that only 20 years ago AOL and Yahoo! were poised to dominate the internet. How times have changed!\n\nIt will be interesting to see which coins emerge as the “Amazon” and “Google” of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor now, Ethereum has some huge backers. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), according to its website, seeks to “learn from and build upon the only smart contract supporting blockchain currently running in real-world production—Ethereum.” The EEA includes several big-name financial and tech firms such as Credit Suisse, Intel, Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase, whose own CEO, Jamie Dimon, knocked cryptos a couple of weeks ago.\n\nWill Bitcoin Replace Gold?\n\nLately I’ve been seeing more and more headlines asking whether cryptos are “killing” gold. Would the gold price be higher today if massive amounts of money weren’t flowing into bitcoin? Both assets, after all, are sometimes favored as safe havens. They’re decentralized and accepted all over the world, 24 hours a day. Transactions are anonymous. Supply is limited.\n\nCredit: U.S. Global Investors\n\nBut I don’t think for a second that cryptocurrencies will ever replace gold, for a number of reasons. For one, cryptos are strictly forms of currency, whereas gold has many other time-tested applications, from jewelry to dentistry to electronics.\n\nUnlike cryptos, gold doesn’t require electricity to trade. This makes it especially useful in situations such as hurricane-ravished Puerto Rico, where 95 percent of people are reportedly still without power. Right now the island’s economy is cash-only. If you have gold jewelry or coins, they can be converted into cash—all without electricity or WiFi.\n\nFinally, gold remains one of the most liquid assets, traded daily in well-established exchanges all around the globe. Every day, some £13.8 billion, or $18 billion, worth of physical gold are traded in London alone, according to the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). The cryptocurrency market, although expanding rapidly, is not quite there yet.\n\nI will admit, though, that bitcoin is energizing some investors, especially millennials, in ways that gold might have a hard time doing. The proof is all over the internet. You can find a number of TED Talks on bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, but to my knowledge, none is available on gold investing. YouTube is likewise bursting at the seams with videos on cryptos.\n\nBitcoin is up 350 percent for the year, Ethereum an unbelievable 3,600 percent. Gold, meanwhile, is up around 10 percent. Producers, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, have gained 11.5 percent in 2017, 23 percent since its 52-week low in December 2016.\n\nLook Past the Negativity to Find the Good News\n\nThe news is filled with negative headlines, and sometimes it’s challenging to stay positive. Take Friday’s jobs report. It showed that the U.S. lost 33,000 jobs in September, the first month in seven years that this happened. A weak report was expected because of Hurricane Irma, but no one could have guessed the losses would be this deep.\n\nThe jobs report wasn’t all bad news, however. For one, the decline is very likely temporary. Beyond that, a record 4.88 million Americans who were previously sitting out of the labor force found work last month. This helped the unemployment rate fall to 4.2 percent, a 16-year low.\n\nCredit: U.S. Global Investors\n\nThere’s more that supports a stronger U.S. economy. As I shared with you last week, the Manufacturing ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to a 13-year high in September, indicating rapid expansion in the manufacturing industry. Factory orders were up during the month. Auto sales were up. Oil has stayed in the relatively low $50-a-barrel range, which is good for transportation and industrials, especially airlines. Small-cap stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000 Index, continue to climb above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages as excitement over tax reform intensifies.\n\nThese are among the reasons why I remain bullish.\n\nOne final note: Speaking on tax reform, Warren Buffett told CNBC last week that he’s waiting to sell assets until he knows the plan will go through. “I would feel kind of silly if I realized $1 billion worth of gains and paid $350 million in tax on it if I just waited a few months and would have paid $250 million,” he said.\n\nIt’s a fair comment, and I imagine other like-minded, forward-thinking investors, buyers and sellers will also wait to make huge transactions if they can help it. Tax reform isn’t a done deal, but I think it has a much better chance of being signed into law than a health care overhaul.', 'Chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices would be likely to see their stock prices suffer if the bitcoin market were to collapse, brokerage TD Ameritrade has said.\n\nThe question of whether bitcoin is in a bubble or not is one that continues to rage across the tech and financial worlds, particularly after a tumultuous year in which the cryptocurrency more than quadrupled in value—with some bumps along the way. Bitcoin started to crash last month largely due to a negative regulatory outlook in China, but mostly recovered and currently trades at $4,600 to one bitcoin.\n\nHowever, with the virtual currency mostly still being used by speculators rather than regular users, a crash could still come. On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal looked into where the risks lie, and Joe Kinahan, TD Ameritrade’s chief market strategist, predicted “collateral damage” to more than just bitcoin investors themselves.\n\nNvidia (nvda) and AMD (amd) are exposed because they make graphics processors, which are heavily used in the bitcoin “mining” industry. As bitcoin has taken off, the industry has come to represent a significant slice of graphics-processor sales—6.7% of Nvidia’s Q2 revenues, for example.\n\n“Anybody getting more than 5% of their business from crypto, it’s starting to become significant and you could see their stock prices very quickly collapse,” Kinahan said. He also pointed out that bitcoin’s heavy, speculation-led fluctuations in value make it more difficult to use for regular transactions—thereby making it even more of a speculator’s game.\n\nThe article also suggested that financial technology firms could suffer if bitcoin were to crash. However, while many fintech startups and larger banks are investing a lot in blockchain technology, which underpins bitcoin, the technology in no way depends on bitcoin, so the fallout would likely be limited.\n\nWhat would really make bitcoin dangerous to the wider market? Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs), for which the WSJ‘s interviewees saw great demand. “You’re going to put a derivative on a derivative of an unregulated asset?\n\nThat, to me, is a recipe for disaster,” said Themis Trading’s Joe Saluzzi in the piece.', 'Bitcoin is closing in on its all-time high.\n\nThe price of the red-hot currency was up more than 4% on Monday above $4,800 a coin, less than $200 shy of its all-time high of $4,983, according to data from Markets Insider.\n\nBitcoin hit nearly $5,000 at the beginning of September, but quickly saw its price decline amid news of a crackdown in China on the cryptocurrency and regulatory uncertainty around initial coin offerings, a cryptocurrency-based fundraising method. After bottoming out near $2,900 per coin on September 15, it has since rallied.\n\nThat\'s despite mounting criticism from some of Wall Street\'s most powerful players.\n\nIt all started on September 12 when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin ""a fraud"" and said it was ""worse than tulips bulbs"" in the 1600s.\n\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg News, Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, the world\'s largest investor with $5.7 trillion under management, said he thinks the explosive growth of bitcoin points to nefarious behavior. ""It just identifies how much money laundering there is being done in the world,"" Fink said. ""How much people are trying to move currencies from one place to another.""

We will provide rails for moving currency from customer to merchant. The government mandated digital currencies are interesting. Non-government mandated currency is junk,” he said.\n\nNormal rhetoric\n\nBanga’s attack on Bitcoin brought up nothing new or visionary, spurting the usual concerns without much backing or research. He criticised Bitcoin for its volatility, and use-cases for illegal activities, such as ransomware attacks:\n\n“If I pay for a bottle of water in Bitcoin, one day it is two bottles for a Bitcoin the other day it is 9,000 bottles. This does not work. Any currency needs stability and transparency, otherwise you will get all the illegal activities in the world. Why was the ransom for the virus (wannacry ransomware) collected in Bitcoin? Why has China cracked down on Bitcoin?”\n\nBanga seems to be another bigwig who has a stake in the game, and thus is not happy to give up that piece of pie.

He then made a transition most people in the financial markets only dream of – moving from the sell side in banking to the buy side in hedge funds.\n\nMasters opened his first hedge fund in 1999, but in the mid-2010s – as commodities and other traditional asset prices became less volatile and in turn less profitable – he discovered and ultimately became engrossed in the rollercoaster world of cryptocurrency.\n\nYet wild price swings weren\'t the only aspect of the market that interested the former trader. In a new interview, Masters told CoinDesk he was also captivated by the promise of borderless, frictionless, digital money.\n\nFrom there, Masters began developing a strong intuition that bitcoin could, potentially, challenge fiat money and gold, and that it might play an important role in capital formation, the money-raising function that has traditionally been accomplished by stocks and bonds.\n\nMasters said:\n\n""I think, at the core of this, is the development of new tools that are challenging the role that fiat money and gold have historically played. And that challenge is being brought forth by bitcoin.""\n\nAnd while he still keeps an ear to the ground about his old shop – especially when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon opines about cryptocurrency – those disruptive functions have become the foundation on which Masters bases his bullish investment thesis for Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, GABI for short.\n\nThe notorious price\n\nWhile the legacy financial system sits on its haunches, failing to adapt to the opportunities cryptocurrencies present, as Masters sees it, the technology now exists to digitize and tokenize large swaths of traditional asset classes – such as money, precious metals, commodities, stocks and bonds.\n\nMoreover, once those assets have been tokenized on a blockchain, they will be able to perform far more intelligent functions, because the assets themselves will be programmable, just like any other instance of computer code.\n\nThere are serious benefits, something that he points to for the rise of the cryptocurrency market, which is currently valued at over $150 billion.\n\nIn his mind, cryptocurrency has found a way to reach that scale in almost total isolation from the legacy financial system. Now becoming self-sustaining and reaching a kind of ""escape velocity,"" cryptocurrency is finally gaining enough momentum to challenge the old ways of doing business in financial services, he said.\n\nStill, institutions and investors are hesitant, seeing the market\'s intense volatility as a sign for concern.\n\nBut that doesn\'t phase Masters. He believes the price of commodities is ""notoriously fractal,"" meaning that prices swing wildly in both directions, adding the big picture takeaway:\n\n""Don\'t get hung up on price.""\n\nPast precedent\n\nTo highlight his theory, Masters cited his work trading natural gas in the late \'90s.\n\nAt the time, there was a five-year period during which the commodity was trading between $0.50 and $0.85, making it difficult for many people to foresee natural gas trading above $15, as it later did. He also pointed to his years trading in the oil market, when the price of a barrel of oil hovered between $5 and $20, figures that made the $145 it traded at in 2008 seem exaggerated.\n\nIn a similar fashion, if you were obsessing about the price of ethereum\'s ether token when it hit $1, you would never have bought it at $20 – and, as Masters said, ""Look where it is now."" Notably, ether is currently trading at just below $300, according to CoinMarketCap\n\nMasters sees the relatively low valuation of cryptocurrencies when compared to other asset classes as a major opportunity.\n\nWhen you look at all digital assets currently trading, the combined market capitalization isn\'t as high as a single one of world\'s 100 largest stocks, a statistic Masters believes means there\'s room for growth. Further, as bitcoin is only the 65th largest currency in the world, and some of the larger currencies are highly problematic for political and economic reasons, he believes it\'s not unthinkable to believe the cryptocurrency could provide a real alternative.\n\nA blockchain bear\n\nOne of the key drivers of Masters\' thesis is that an investment in cryptocurrency is a fundamental investment in the forward movement of technology.\n\nIn essence, he believes, an investment in cryptocurrency is tantamount to an investment in fintech, medtech and the Internet of Things. In this way, the view provides an elegant counterargument to the cryptocurrency skeptics who believe blockchain technology may change the world, but that cryptocurrencies are a passing fad.\n\nTo Masters, cryptocurrencies will be the true market force.\n\nHe said:\n\n""The vital thing to understand is that the momentum and the scale that you have in some of these public blockchains essentially means that it\'s going to be near impossible to build any of this big technology on any other kind of platform.""\n\nMasters adds that the cost savings derived from using cryptocurrencies to access a global, open-source financial platform will make it impossible for even large tech companies to bootstrap their own proprietary technology to effectively compete.\n\nAnd when you begin to see cryptocurrencies in that context, you get a sense for just how large the potential of its digital economy may be.\n\nDifferences with Dimon\n\nBearing in mind Masters\' bullish view of the cryptocurrency space, one could expect him to disagree with Jamie Dimon\'s comments on bitcoin (most recently calling bitcoin a ""fraud"").\n\nIndeed, despite their common background at JPMorgan, the two former colleagues have gone opposite ways when it comes to cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Masters believes Dimon has proven smart and hardworking in his role running the financial behemoth, Dimon doesn\'t have adequate time to understand the complex issues at stake in the cryptocurrency space, he said, calling the comments on bitcoin ""short-sighted.""\n\n""I don\'t think Jamie Dimon has an open enough mind, all the time, to properly accept the contribution that digital assets can make,"" he said.\n\nHe points out that other senior financial executives – at such renowned institutions as Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Board Options Exchange, and NASDAQ, where Masters\' shop lists its bitcoin trackers – feel very differently.\n\nMasters also points out that JPMorgan does, in fact, trade in bitcoin, and that JPMorgan Securities was buying bitcoin for its clients at the same time Jamie Dimon was criticizing cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""They either need to get with the program and support their clients who want to buy bitcoin, or they need to stop talking about it like a fool. Because those things are not consistent with an organization of that character.""\n\nDaniel Masters image via Vimeo\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, at press time, bitcoin\'s price had dropped to $4,770 – still up 12 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, the price is up 10 percent, while on a monthly basis, the cryptocurrency has seen 12 percent gains.\n\nIndeed, despite the Chinese ban on ICOs as well as hints Russia may take new restrictive actions, bitcoin has been able to regain poise in a relatively short period of time. Less than a month ago, BTC had dropped to $2,980. As of now, bitcoin is only 4.8 percent short of its all-time high of $5,000 set in early September.\n\nThe stellar recovery could be attributed to an increased trading activity in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong in the aftermath of Chinese crackdown. Speculation is also doing the rounds that fears of increasing ICO restrictions across the globe may have triggered a rotation of money out of ether and ethereum-based tokens and into bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin looks set to revisit record highs.\n\nCaution is advised, though, as the price action analysis indicates that the world\'s largest cryptocurrency may see a minor wobble before achieving new heights once again.\n\n1-hour chart\n\nThe 1-hour chart shows:\n\nA bearish symmetrical triangle breakdown\n\nA drop in the volumes over the last few hours\n\nRising trend line support at $4,700.\n\nA ""symmetrical triangle"" is a chart pattern characterized by converging top and bottom, and is formed when there is indecision in the marketplace.

The pullback from $4,875 is accompanied by a drop in volumes, which indicates the retreat is due to profit-taking.\n\nStill, the broader outlook remains constructive.\n\nBitcoin looks likely to revisit the $5,000 in the days ahead, with July\'s pattern being closely repeated.

In this case, the government of Vanuatu has explicitly expressed a desire to be at the forefront of adopting new technologies, officially encouraging the VIC to receive payments in Bitcoin.”\n\nCitizenship program\n\nUnder the citizenship program, foreigners who want to become Vanuatuan citizens should pay Bitcoins through an Australian digital currency exchange. The exchange should comply with the requirements mandated by financial regulations in Australia.\n\nAs Vanuatu is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, its citizens are allowed to travel in 113 countries, including European Union (EU) states, Russia, and Great Britain, without a visa. This privilege will also be given to foreigners who have acquired Vanuatuan citizenship.\n\nAccording to investment migration expert and VIC advisor Christian Nesheim, Vanuatu’s move to accept Bitcoin as payment will give it a competitive advantage in the global citizenship market.\n\n“Many early investors in Bitcoin would like to realize some of their earnings without incurring large capital gains taxes. Ideally, then, they would convert their cryptocurrency into tangible assets in a low-tax jurisdiction… As Vanuatu will now be the only country to offer citizenship for Bitcoins, I think the program will see a surge in interest more or less immediately.”\n\nWe’ve seen investments where investors could pay for their real estate in the form of Bitcoin, but this is by far the first country to offer its citizenship investment payable through Bitcoin.', 'Former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. trader Daniel Masters has taken a decidedly different stance on digital currencies than his ex-boss Jamie Dimon.\n\nMasters, who runs Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Trust, told research and data site CoinDesk in a recent interview that digital currencies have the potential to “digitize and tokenize…precious metals, commodities, stocks and bonds,” potentially altering the fabric of Wall Street and leaving industry veterans seriously behind the evolutionary curve.\n\nMasters took an even firmer position against statements made by J.P. Morgan boss Dimon, who had warned of the dangers of digital currencies, saying that “bitcoin will eventually blow up. It’s a fraud. It’s worse than tulip bulbs and won’t end well.”\n\nMasters told CoinDesk, referencing Dimon and J.P. Morgan’s JPM, -0.81% overall position on bitcoin:\n\n“They either need to get with the program and support their clients who want to buy bitcoin, or they need to stop talking about it like a fool. Because those things are not consistent with an organization of that character.”\n\nMasters’s remark comes as bitcoin has recovered from a slump in the wake of critical statements from Dimon and other Wall Street digital-currency bears.\n\nRead: ‘Fraud’. ‘More than a fad’. The words Wall Street CEOs are using to describe bitcoin\n\nA single bitcoin BTCUSD, +7.94% on Tuesday, most recently, was up 2% at $4,869, near its all-time high around $5,000, with a total market value of $81 billion, representing about 52.3% of the total value of a broad swath of cybercurrencies tracked by CoinMarketcap.com. The total market capitalization for those cyber units stood at about $155 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the second-most popular cryptographic currency, Ether tokens, on the Ethereum blockchain, were was up 1.8% to around $302. Blockchain refers to the publicly distributed ledger on which digital currencies run.\n\nBoth bitcoin and Ether were recovering from lows put in mid September. So far, bitcoin has rallied nearly 400% so far in 2017, while Ether tokens have climbed 3,500% year to date. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.31% has risen 15.5% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.41% boasts a nearly 14% year-to-date return.\n\nFor his part, Masters is big bitcoin proponent and recently launched his hedge fund GABI, which is intended to offer investors exposure to the emerging asset.\n\nSeparately, Eidoo, a cryptocurrency exchange, has taken out ads in The Wall Street Journal, referencing Dimon’s threat to fire any trader caught trading in bitcoin:', ""In Brief Economist Kenneth Rogoff argues in a newly published opinion piece that bitcoin's growth will not last forever, claiming the cryptocurrency's value will fall under government pressure. However, he neglects to set any sort of timeframe for his prediction.\n\nFutures Market\n\nThis summer, the total value of the bitcoin market reached $160 billion, almost 10 times what it was at the beginning of 2017. Now, a leading economic expert is warning investors that while cryptocurrencies may very well be the financial wave of the future, the value of bitcoin will collapse eventually.\n\nKenneth Rogoff is a professor of economics at Harvard University, and from 2001 to 2003, he served as the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. In an opinion piece published by The Guardian this week, he praises the technology underpinning bitcoin, but says he believes too many factors are working against the currency for its value to continue to increase indefinitely.\n\nIn the article, he argues that bitcoin evangelists who expect the currency to become ubiquitous are just setting themselves up for disappointment.\n\n“It is folly to think that bitcoin will ever be allowed to supplant central-bank-issued money,” wrote Rogoff. “It is one thing for governments to allow small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies; indeed, this would be desirable. But it is an entirely different matter for governments to allow large-scale anonymous payments, which would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity.”\n\nBad for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was once the only cryptocurrency with any real cachet, and it’s still the most popular. However, a variety of competing alt-coins and tokens have emerged in recent years, with the likes of ether and ripple quickly establishing themselves within the crypto market.\n\nExternal competition isn’t the only reason Rogoff believes bitcoin will collapse, though. According to the economist, governments could end up crippling the currency’s value if the current “free-for-all” crypto landscape changes too much or too quickly. He holds the opinion that regulation is unavoidable, as governments are going to want to keep an eye on transactions to cut down on tax evasion and other crimes.\n\nRogoff points to Japan as an example. Bitcoin is already very popular in the Asian nation, and it appears set to grow even more so thanks to relaxed regulation. However, if the country decides to draft and enforce new legislation or if its banks are successful in their attempts to create an alternative cryptocurrency, bitcoin’s value could suffer.\n\nRogoff doesn’t say when bitcoin will collapse, though, so actually taking action based on his prediction is futile. Meanwhile, other experts have shared far more concrete predictions for bitcoin’s future, and many of those are also far more optimistic.\n\nRonnie Moas of Standpoint Research believes bitcoin’s value could reach $20,000 in the next three years, while veteran trader masterluc has predicted that bitcoin will be worth $15,000 before the end of 2017. As for regulations having an impact on the crypto’s future value, economists at the central bank of Finland believe blockchain technology is self-regulating and that governments likely couldn’t regulate it even if they wanted to.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets.

They’re increasingly responding to growing interest from clients to track and even trade the digital coins.\n\nBitcoin has surged more than 300 percent this year, drawing the attention of hedge funds and wealthy individuals. China cracked down on crypto-currency exchanges in September, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in July that sales of some new digital currencies would be subject to rules just as equities are.\n\n“We believe existing currencies may move into becoming more of a crypto-currency,” Ermotti said. “We don’t really believe there’s much room for the creation of new currencies if there is no real backing for a hard and credible issuer of that currency.”', 'Bitcoin, which reached record highs just last month, seems to have suffered a precipitous decline, falling by $600 in a couple of minutes this morning. The cryptocurrency\u200b had reached a high of $4,867 yesterday but was trading at $4,200 this morning on the Coindesk Bitcoin Price Index, according to a CNBC article. As of this writing, it was trading at $4,870.86 on the same index. However, the index records a price of $4,765 as bitcoin\'s lowest price within the past 24 hours. In addition, the accompanying chart provides no indication of the fall. The fall in bitcoin\'s price was also not recorded on any of the indexes that comprise the Coinbase index.\n\nThe CNBC article mentions Russia\'s announcement of a ban on bitcoin exchanges as a possible reason for the flash crash. At a press conference, the deputy governor of Russia\'s central bank Sergey Shvetsov said that the bank and government prosecutors were working to ban access to sites that enable bitcoin trading. ""It\'s obvious that when a pyramid (scheme) grows, interest in this pyramid heats up with the high rate of return,"" he said. (See also: Russia Turns Cold on Cryptocurrencies.)\n\nWhile Russia\'s decision to ban bitcoin is a plausible reason for a fall in the cryptocurrency\'s price, the extent and severity of today\'s supposed crash might be a stretch. This is because Russian officials have mostly had a negative assessment of the currency – hence, their statement today was no surprise. (See also: Russian Cryptocurrency Adoption Is Slower Than You\'d Think.)\n\nMeanwhile, commentators are comparing bitcoin\'s fall to a similar ethereum flash crash that occurred last June. Then, the price of ethereum, the world\'s second largest traded cryptocurrency, crashed from around $317 to as low as a dime within a single day on the GDAX exchange. The exchange\'s vice president Adam White said that a ""multi-million dollar market sell"" order had a cascading effect on stop-loss orders and resulted in a shortage of margins on the order books. The CFTC suspended its margin trading services following the incident and is currently investigating reasons for the crash.

Roboforex out of Cyprus added bitcoin CFD trading on their platform. This means clients will have indirect exposure to bitcoin, and speculate on the shorts and gains of bitcoin. The firm has also added ethereum to their available trading pairs. The company decided to add the cryptocurrencies as a result of client and market interest.\n\nAlso read: Lightning Network Centralization Leads to Economic Censorship\n\nThe firm will have btc/usd and eth/usd trading pairs.

However, most of them do not have direct knowledge of bitcoin, and many prefer to trade via CFDs. The fact that bitcoin has nearly tripled in price over the last 8 months has further piqued investor interest. This interest is what led the director of Roboforex to enable bitcoin and ethereum trading. Kiryl Kirychenka, Product Manager at Roboforex, elaborated:\n\nWe’ve decided to enable cryptocurrencies for CFDs trading in the first place because of the keen interest of traders from all over the world to these assets. From now on, our clients will be able to derive profit from the fast growing cryptocurrency market without having to buy them.

In the nearest future, we’re planning to continue developing in this direction and fundamentally improve our offers by adding new instruments and making trading conditions better\n\nMass Crypto Trading in the Marketplace\n\nThe Roboforex press release mentioned the spectacular daily turnover of bitcoin transactions has been a major reason for the surge of brokerage interest in crypto. The daily bitcoin to USD turnover or exchange volume is currently worth about 3 billion USD. This is likely why regulated firms like ETX Capital out of London also recently ventured into the space.\n\nA mix of growing investor enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, mainstream adoption, and the vast amount of capital flowing in the space has generated a lot of excitement and hype.

The gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect strengthening bullish momentum as well.\n\nThe 100 SMA is close to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level around $4600 while the 200 SMA coincides with the channel support and 61.8% Fib at $4400. If any of the retracement levels keep losses in check, bitcoin price could move back to the swing high around $4900 or higher.\n\nStochastic is heading lower but is already dipping into oversold territory, which suggests that bears could take a break soon. RSI has a bit more room to drop so bearish pressure could stay in play for a bit longer until the oscillator turns up from the oversold region. A break below the 200 SMA, however, could be an early signal of a reversal.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nBitcoin price could stay supported as geopolitical risks linger, especially since North Korea appears to be returning to the spotlight once more. South Korea reportedly flew plans over the peninsula as a show of force, possibly eliciting another hostile reaction from Pyongyang at some point.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar is under a bit of pressure since the Trump administration is encountering some headwinds in tax reform. The FOMC minutes are also up for release and it might not be as hawkish as the actual statement turned out, given how a number of policymakers have expressed cautious views on inflation recently.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has called for regulating digital money as securities, while central bank officials vowed to work with prosecutors to block websites that allow retail investors access to bitcoin exchanges. “We think this is a pyramid scheme,” said Sergey Shvetsov, first deputy governor of the central bank.\n\nGlobal efforts to regulate digital money have accelerated in the past month since China banned initial coin offerings and ordered all cryptocurrency exchanges to close, following inspections of more than 1,000 trading venues over a six-month period. At least 13 other countries have imposed new rules or announced plans to tighten regulations, including South Korea, which also banned ICOs. Last week, European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said the bank is discussing ""concrete legal restrictions"" on digital coin sales.\n\nIt’s a development that creators of bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, saw coming, and prepared for. Since it works on a peer-to-peer network, users can buy and sell coins and secure and perpetuate the system without any government or central bank involvement. Trying to control it is “like trying to catch water,” said Alex Tapscott, chief executive of NextBlock Global Ltd., a venture-capital firm that invests in blockchain startups.\n\nNine years after a mysterious coder that goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto unleashed bitcoin on the world, some see it as a revolutionary use of technology that takes power away from governments and gives it to individuals, like handheld video cameras in the hands of civil rights activists, or social media during the Arab Spring uprisings.\n\n""As cryptocurrencies gain wider acceptance, their ability to undermine politicians increases,” said Roger Ver, an early investor in bitcoin who is known as Bitcoin Jesus, for proselytizing about the digital currency in its early days. ""The invention of bitcoin is one of the most liberating technologies in all of human history. It is on par with the importance of the invention of the printing press, or the internet itself.""\n\nDigital currencies live on computers and can be held by millions worldwide, bought and sold on websites, at MeetUps, or in person-to-person meetings. Even if there’s no ATM or exchange nearby, anyone with access to the Internet can buy them. And they can be used to purchase everything from a sandwich to a carpet to a house, or they can be held as an investment.\n\nAn investment of $1,000 in bitcoin in 2012 would now be worth about $4.9 million, while the number of transactions continues to increase. In the second quarter, they reached an average of about 291,000 per day for bitcoin and nearly double that when other major cryptocurrencies are included, from about 60,000 per day in 2013, according to researcher CoinDesk.\n\nDark Side\n\nYet there is an undeniable dark side. Bitcoin rose to prominence with Silk Road, a marketplace for weapons, drugs and other illicit goods, and it’s still used for such sales on the so-called Dark Web even after Silk Road was shut down. It’s also the currency of choice for hackers who have invaded the computers of everyone from hospitals to police departments. Even the North Korean government is accumulating bitcoin as a means to dodge international sanctions.\n\nThat’s why Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., sees bitcoin as a “fraud” that’s destined to come crashing down, as its use in ransomware schemes, drug and arms trafficking ultimately persuades authorities to find a way to put a stop to it. “Someone’s going to get killed and then the government’s going to come down,” Dimon said. “You just saw in China, governments like to control their money supply.”\n\nWhile any central banker might be troubled by a stateless currency competing with the coin of the realm, China’s efforts to crack down suggest it may be harder than it appears. While the government crackdown sent bitcoin prices plunging as much as 30 percent, it has now recovered those losses, even as a growing number of governments take action.\n\nOnce the largest global market for trading, China now accounts for 1.5 percent of bitcoin transactions, while Japan -- where regulators have been more open to digital currencies -- accounts for more than 60 percent, according to CryptoCompare.com.\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nChina is the leader in bitcoin mining capacity -- computers that are used to support bitcoin transactions and then get paid for the service with newly minted coins. Regulators have so far refrained from any action in that area. Wu Jihan, CEO of Bitmain Technologies Ltd., the world’s biggest mining operation, said in an interview that regional governments are welcome to legally set up bitcoin mining farms which are clean and considered part of the high-tech industry.\n\nCryptocurrencies are attractive where there are restrictions on taking cash abroad or where the local currency is weakening because of inflation. In Venezuela, a place with both problems, bitcoin’s weekly trading volume spiked to an all-time high in early April, when violent clashes between protesters and police started. The government has conducted raids on bitcoin miners, accusing them of “internet fraud and electricity theft.”\n\nThe same combination of capital controls, high inflation and a weakening currency have driven demand for cryptocurrencies across Latin America. Bitcoin demand spiked in Argentina in 2013 after former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner banned dollar purchases, while Ecuador and Bolivia are among the few countries that have outright bans on the currency.\n\nBy contrast, the U.K. has exempted bitcoin from value-added taxes, and says it should be considered a foreign currency for corporate tax purposes. The U.K. was early in publishing clear directives, ruling in 2014 that ""bitcoin may be held as an investment or used to pay for goods or services at merchants where it is accepted.”\n\nCrypto-Friendly Japan\n\nJapan this year began enforcing a law that recognizes bitcoin as a legal method of payment, and overseeing cryptocurrency exchanges -- effectively providing clarity and support to local entrepreneurs. That’s something Vietnam may do as well.\n\nThe U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission classified bitcoin as a commodity in September 2015 and this year approved the first cryptocurrency options trading, clearing and settlement firm. The Securities and Exchange Commission in July said some coins issued in ICOs would be considered securities and regulated as such unless “a valid exemption applies.”\n\nWhile government efforts to come to grips with digital money have been fraught, the more important trend may be the growing number of money managers who are looking at cryptocurrencies as an asset class for investment.\n\n""What’s more interesting is the increased sophistication of the institutional buy side for cryptocurrencies,"" said Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk. ""This new type of buyer means this is only a hiccup. There are important sums of fiat ready to cross into crypto in the short term."" There are more than 68 hedge funds focused on cryptocurrencies today, many of them run by people from Wall Street.\n\n— With assistance by Yuji Nakamura, Gary Gao, Hannah Recht, and Andrew Rosati', 'E\n\nven though the value of bitcoin is once again rising at a neck-breaking pace, the clouds of uncertainty aren’t going to disappear anytime soon. According to a Reuters report , Russia is going to block access to cryptocurrency exchanges like bitcoin.\n\nThe report states that these statements were made by Sergei Shvetsov, first deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), at a financial markets conference.\n\nHe further labeled bitcoin’s nature as “dubious.” “We cannot stand apart. We cannot give direct and easy access to such dubious instruments for retail (investors),” he said. According to him, the increased interest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is being seen due to high returns to date.\n\nRussian news website RBC reports that bank authorities are currently working with special prosecutor’s office to execute the future block. At the moment, any tentative date of implementation isn’t available.\n\nOn the other hand, on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that cryptocurrencies could be too risky. He supported Central Bank’s position.\n\n“Crypto-currencies are issued by an unlimited number of anonymous bodies. Thus buyers of crypto-currencies could be involved in unlawful activities,” Putin said.\n\nHow will Russia’s plan to block cryptocurrency exchange websites impact bitcoin and its prices? Don’t forget to share your views.', 'After demonstrating a rapid surge in value in the past three days, the Bitcoin price has recorded a slight correction, decreasing from over $4,900 to $4,780.\n\nDespite the correction, since October 8, within a span of three days, the Bitcoin price has increased from $4,450 to $4,780, sustaining strong upward momentum as a result of growing confidence from investors and traders over Bitcoin’s short and mid-term growth.\n\nPossible Factors For Correction\n\nThe Bitcoin price has surged drastically over the past three days, from $4,450 to $4,980, recording a $530 increase. Normally, when the price of Bitcoin increases by over 10 percent, it tends to correct its short-term surge, providing a more stable platform to build momentum and achieve new highs.\n\nIn the upcoming days, the Bitcoin price will likely recover from its recent correction to above the $5,000 mark due to the upcoming SegWit2x hard fork in November.\n\nEarlier this week, Bitcoin analyst and investor Tuur Demeester emphasized the decline in support of SegWit2x as a driving factor for the short-term price trend of Bitcoin. He noted that if more users, investors, the market, and businesses oppose the SegWit2x hard fork in November and the likelihood of the original Bitcoin blockchain remaining as the majority chain increases, the price of Bitcoin would likely surge in the short-term.\n\nBut, the rise in demand for Bitcoin can also be attributed to the hard fork execution of SegWit2x in November because in order for investors to obtain SegWit2x coins, which leading Bitcoin wallets and exchanges including Coinbase and Bitfinex will list as B2X, investors need to own Bitcoin prior to the SegWit2x fork.\n\nWhile the replay protection implemented by the SegWit2x has been highly controversial–Jameson Lopp, the lead engineer for BitGo, went as far to describe it as a type of attack on Bitcoin–SegWit2x has implemented opt-in replay protection that would allow Bitcoin investors to be credited with SegWit2x coins or B2X tokens subsequent to the fork.\n\nAs Bitcoin developer and Paxos principal architect Jimmy Song explained:\n\n“Segwit2x developers feel that they are going to be the majority chain after the hard fork. As such, they want all current wallets that exist in the Bitcoin ecosystem to be compatible with 2x and not require upgrades. That is, wallets and services won’t need to upgrade their software with opt-in replay protection. Their view is that strong replay protection would then cause a bigger split in the ecosystem than needs to be.”\n\nIn the short-term, the SegWit2x hard fork in November is beneficial for the price trend of Bitcoin because investors that either oppose or support the hard fork will still opt to purchase more Bitcoin for different reasons; investors that are confident the original Bitcoin blockchain would remain as the majority chain would invest in Bitcoin to hold the digital currency as it increases in value, while investors that are confident SegWit2x would evolve into a majority chain would also invest in Bitcoin to gain immediate access to SegWit2x coins after the fork.\n\nAdditionally, if the US, Japanese, and South Korean Bitcoin markets continue to demonstrate increase in demand for Bitcoin, and if the Russian government moves to licensing Bitcoin exchanges and regulating cryptocurrency trading activities as Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted this week, the price of Bitcoin could increase in the short-term.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin is frequently compared to gold. But it’s not an either/or proposition… and I’ll tell you why.\n\nIndeed, gold and bitcoin are the only two widely distributed, decentralized methods of exchanging value as currency. There is no central authority issuance like there is with U.S. dollars or any other fiat currency.\n\nLikewise, neither bitcoin nor gold can just be “printed” at the push of a button by an anxious central banker. You have to either earn your gold by mining it – which is also what you do to get bitcoin, but with computers instead of picks and shovels – or you can pay cash for it. But there’s one big difference between the two…\n\nGold is the very opposite of new technology\n\nGold is a physical, tangible and real asset.\n\nYou can pick it up and feel its satisfying weight in your hand. It can’t be altered. Gold is gold. Once I own it, that’s it. I don’t need to rely on a functioning internet. I don’t need a computer. It’s pure, tangible value.\n\nAnd gold has unquestionably been money for thousands of years. A gold coin can still sit in my pocket, even while I might be fending off mobs, zombies, nuclear winter or hordes of cockroaches.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin is nothing more than a code that exists somewhere on the internet. You can’t pick it up and put it in your pocket. If you lose that code… you lose your bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin isn’t easy to explain to the average guy on the street. The fundamentals of blockchain, and the distributed ledger systems upon which bitcoin is built, are not straightforward. It usually takes time and effort for people to really understand just how much of an innovation bitcoin really is when it is a trust-less mechanism for exchanging value. Most people simply can’t comprehend bitcoin and the blockchain.\n\nAs a guy on a cryptocurrency email thread I was on succinctly put it:\n\n""I prefer a currency that has survived 5,000+ years of wars, empires, the rise and fall of countries, cold spells, hot spells, and has been universally accepted in every country of the world.""\n\nI can’t argue with that.\n\nNo matter how big bitcoin gets, it will never be gold.\n\nIf you were to ask me which I think is more likely to be around a hundred years from now, it’s gold… every time. Nothing has usurped it for millennia as a globally accepted medium of exchange or store of value, and I don’t think bitcoin will do so either.\n\nBut… you should still own bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the ultimate in freedom of asset ownership. The government can’t confiscate it from you, as it did from owners of gold in 1933 in the U.S. under Executive Order 6102.\n\nYou can cross national borders with bitcoin in your possession on a USB-stick device, a piece of paper… or if you can memorize your private key, with no physical object in your possession of any kind.\n\nWhether your bitcoin is worth US$100 or US$100 million, it makes no difference to how you move and store it (which is clearly not the same with gold). You don’t need a trusted middleman to send it, and you can move it around the world, securely, in a matter of minutes.\n\nAnd if you’re looking for gains… bitcoin is a lot likelier than gold to be up 1,000 percent three years from now. Even though its price has soared over the past few years, it’s still nowhere near mainstream yet.\n\nSo gold and bitcoin both deserve a place in your portfolio.\n\nGold has stood the test of time and is a medium of storing value. Bitcoin’s time, on the other hand, is just beginning. Blockchain is the future, and when you have an opportunity to buy the future and tuck it away, you should take it.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\n\nRead the original article on Stansberry Churchouse Research.

Bitcoin ETNs have existed for more than two years after being launched by the same group behind the new ether ETNs. They\'re all part of a new suite of investment products based exclusively on the fledgling $154 billion cryptocurrency market.\n\nGlobal Advisors (Jersey) Limited debuted CoinShares on October 5, billing it as a sort of crypto-specific iShares, the family of exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock. The group behind Global Advisors and CoinShares has Wall Street roots and ""crypto-finance"" aspirations; Co-Principal Daniel Masters dealt in commodities at Salomon Brothers before heading global energy commodities trading at J.P. Morgan for the better part of the 1990s. He founded United Kingdom-based Global Advisors in 1999.\n\n“We are bringing these pioneering products under one brand so that investors can grow with a familiar partner,” Masters says. “It’s the next logical step in professionalizing crypto-finance -- as more assets mature in the space, more investors will demand exposure, and we will continue our focus on providing professional grade access.”\n\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nIn addition to the firm\'s ETN offerings, which Masters says represent about $300 million in assets under management along with a few thousand clients, members of the group including CoinShares manage two active funds, including the first regulated bitcoin fund, GABI, launched in 2014. and an ether-denominated ICO token fund that launched in June. When the firm\'s first bitcoin ETN began trading on Nasdaq OMX in May 2015, the price of bitcoin was hovering around $300.

The subsidiary develops and market products and services customized for the Japanese market. Its shares are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Its parent company provides a few ratings services including the “Sustainability Ratings for Funds” which was launched last year. The ratings help investors evaluate over 35,000 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) globally, worth $27 trillion in assets under management.\n\nThe company explained that there is no ICO regulation in Japan and “investor protection is inadequate.” In addition, when investing in digital currencies, investors often make investment decisions “with only a small amount of information and biased information.” With whitepapers issued by ICO companies, “investors cannot easily judge the accuracy and authenticity of the item,” Morningstar claimed.\n\nIn its announcement, the company stated that it has developed a method of evaluating cryptocurrencies and ICOs, utilizing their expertise in evaluating investment trusts and bonds.

Nonetheless, he said there is a possibility that ICOs will be subject to regulation in the future, especially if they are misused.\n\nFurthermore, an ICO contract could be canceled and compensation for damages may occur based on consumer contract law and civil law. Subsequently, he suggested that ICO token issuers should consider all relevant laws such as the virtual currency law, the prepaid payment instrument regulation, and the fund regulation.\n\nWhat do you think of Morningstar Japan’s new ratings business for digital currencies and ICOs?

10/12/2017,"[""Rising price of the cryptocurrency, now worth four times as much as an ounce of gold, has led to warnings of a bubble\n\nThe price of bitcoin has smashed through $5,000 to an all-time high.\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency rose by more than 8% to $5,243 having started the year at $966. Bitcoin has soared by more than 750% in the past year and is worth four times as much as an ounce of gold.\n\nBut the price has been volatile. The digital currency plunged below $3,000 in mid-September after the Chinese authorities announced a crackdown. Beijing ordered cryptocurrency exchanges to stop trading and block new registrations, due to fears that increasing numbers of consumers piling into the bitcoin market could prompt wider financial problems.\n\nJordan Hiscott, the chief trader at Ayondo Markets, said: “The returns are truly remarkable, especially given the recent ban on bitcoin trading in China, where demand had previously accounted for at least 10% of all global volumes.”\n\nVladimir Putin, the Russian president, called this week for regulation of cryptocurrencies, saying their use “bears serious risks” such as money laundering, tax evasion and funding for terrorism. But he also warned against imposing “too many barriers,” which appears to have given bitcoin a boost.\n\nDespite warnings over a bubble, bitcoin is gaining in acceptance. Last month, a London property developer, The Collective, said it would allow its tenants to pay their deposits in bitcoin and accept rent payments in the cryptocurrency by the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin's price bubble will burst under government pressure | Kenneth Rogoff Read more\n\nTwo weeks ago, Japan’s government implemented rules that recognise bitcoin as a payment method. Celebrities have also got involved, with the boxer Floyd Mayweather, the socialite Paris Hilton and the actor Jamie Foxx promoting coin offerings.\n\nUsing bitcoin allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment processes to pay for goods and services directly. Banks and other financial institutions have been concerned about bitcoin’s associations with money laundering and online crime because transactions take place anonymously.\n\nThe soaring value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies comes despite growing warnings over a price bubble.\n\nThe starkest warning came from the JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a fraud that would ultimately blow up. Speaking last month, he said there was a limited market for the digital currency, arguing that it was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in countries such as North Korea. He pledged to sack any JP Morgan trader investing in Bitcoin, but also admitted he had not been able to dissuade his daughter from investing.\n\nDimon declined to comment on the surge in bitcoin during an earnings call on Thursday. “I’m not going to talk about bitcoin any more,” he said.\n\nKenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University and a former IMF chief economist, has predicted that the technology behind cryptocurrencies will thrive, but the price of bitcoin will collapse.\n\nWarnings grow louder over cryptocurrency as valuations soar Read more\n\n“It is folly to think that bitcoin will ever be allowed to supplant central bank-issued money,” he wrote in the Guardian this week.\n\n“It is one thing for governments to allow small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies; indeed, this would be desirable. But it is an entirely different matter for governments to allow large-scale anonymous payments, which would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity.”\n\nDaniel Murray, global head of research at EFG Asset Management, noted that in 2013, bitcoin soared twelvefold in just four months but within a month had lost a third of its value and four months after its peak had lost 60% of its value.\n\n“Investors buy [an] asset because they are seduced by the prospect of further rapid gains without necessarily thinking about intrinsic value,” he said. He noted that historically currencies were backed by precious metals, and these days most currencies were based on macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation, interest rates and growth, and were backed by a central bank and government. None of this applied to bitcoin, although the supply is carefully controlled.\n\n“It is hard to argue that bitcoin does anything better than existing currency arrangements whilst it does some things to a lower standard,” Murray added. “Individuals are already able to transact electronically using a plastic card.”"", '', 'A Thessaloniki appeals court on Wednesday approved a request from Moscow for the extradition of a Russian national who is also wanted in the US in connection with charges that he laundered 4 billion dollars in bitcoins.\n\n\n\nIn its ruling Wednesday, the court upheld the request from Russia for Alexander Vinnik to return to his homeland and stand trial on lesser charges relating to alleged fraud worth 10,000 euros. That decision came a week after the same court upheld a request from Washington for the extradition of Vinnik over the bitcoin allegations. Vinnik, 38, appealed against that ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nIn such situations, according to Lambros Margaritis, a law professor at Thessaloniki’s Aristotle University, the request of the defendant’s homeland takes precedence. However, if the Supreme Court upholds the ruling in favor of Vinnik’s extradition to the US it will come down to Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis to decide.\n\n\n\nUS authorities accuse Vinnik of laundering 4 billion dollars’ worth of bitcoins through BTC-e, one of the world’s largest digital currency exchanges, which he allegedly operated. Defending himself in court last week, Vinnik claimed that he had nothing to do with the digital platform, saying that he was just a “technician” and the platform was one of his clients.\n\n\n\nVinnik was arrested in July while on holiday with his family in Halkidiki, northern Greece.', 'Earlier today, on October 12, the Bitcoin price experienced a sudden surge in price, demonstrating an overnight increase in value of 8 percent, from $4,780 to $5,220.\n\nOn October 11, Cryptocoinsnews reported that the Bitcoin price had recorded a slight correction from $4,900 to $4,780, after increasing by over $530 in a span of three days. But, the report also noted that the minor correction had placed Bitcoin at a better position to gain momentum and establish new highs in the short-term.\n\n“Normally, when the price of Bitcoin increases by over 10 percent, it tends to correct its short-term surge, providing a more stable platform to build momentum and achieve new highs,” the report read.\n\nIn the past 10 hours, the Bitcoin price has done exactly that. It has picked up strong momentum, increasing from $4,780 to $4,950, and then rising by over 8 percent in a three-hour span.\n\nMajor Factors Behind the Increase in the Bitcoin Price\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint one single driving factor behind the Bitcoin Price surge because through the exit of the Chinese market, the global Bitcoin exchange market has restructured and the Japanese market has evolved into the largest Bitcoin market overtaking the US.\n\nThree major factors that have contributed to the recent price surge of Bitcoin most likely are the SegWit2x hard fork in November, introduction of national licensing program for cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, and the rise in demand for Bitcoin in the US market by institutional investors.\n\nAs Cryptocoinsnews previously reported, the SegWit2x hard fork in November is beneficial for the short-term price trend of Bitcoin because investors that do not believe SegWit2x will become the majority chain would in invest in Bitcoin and investors that do believe SegWit2x will become the majority chain would also invest in Bitcoin, as it is the only way to obtain SegWit2x coins upon its launch.\n\nWith major Chinese mining pools such as ViaBTC clarifying that they will allocate all of their hashrate to mining SegWit2x coin or B2X, it is likely that the Bitcoin community has gained confidence over the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAs predicted, and in contrast to what NYA promoters have been claiming, not even all NYA mining pools will dedicate all hash power to B2X. https://t.co/bJSGNJP8eX — Aaron van Wirdum (@AaronvanW) October 11, 2017\n\nMore importantly, as prominent Bitcoin investor and Atlanta Digital Currency Fund partner Alistair Milne mentioned, miners tend to follow more profitable Bitcoin blockchains and ViaBTC’s statement has demonstrated such tendency.\n\n“Miners follow the money, they do not lead the money. This has never been illustrated more clearly than by Bcash and the joke that is their difficulty adjustment algorithm.

The New Economics Foundation, a U.K.-based think tank, calls the South Pacific archipelago of some 80 islands the fourth-happiest country in the world. (It ranked No. 1 when the list was first published in 2006, but like the vagaries of the market, happiness can be a fleeting thing.)\n\nAs volatile as the cryptocurrency itself, so has the local reaction been to this idea, which was first reported by Investment Migration Insider, a website focused on investment citizenry.\n\n“The Citizenship Commission is only recognizing USD as prescribed under the Citizenship regulation and no other form,” said Samuel Garae, Acting Secretary General of the Vanuatu Citizenship Office, in an emailed statement on Oct. 20, correcting earlier reports that Vanuatu would accept payments directly.\n\n“This might be from the Agents but not Citizenship,” he continues, referring to a non-binding letter from Vanuatu’s Parliamentary Secretary that lent support to the idea of allowing bitcoin payments.

Vanuatu falls right below Panama and Paraguay (tied) and above Dominica; the U.K. is in a tie at third place, the U.S. at fourth, and Russia at 40th.\n\nThe country also has no income, inheritance, or corporate tax. It’s not even customary to tip there, according to the Vanuatu Tourism Office. The archipelago is relatively accessible: about a three-and-a-half-hour flight from Sydney to Port Vila, the capital.

It will be a disaster to recoganize it as a real currency. And the lack of a value anchroing inherently determines that bitcoin can never be a real one.""\n\nLaunched by China\'s central bank in June this year, the Digital Currency Research Institute focuses on R&D related to blockchain-based digital currency.

""A total cap of 21 million like bitcoin whose current supply also halves every four years is actually driving backward along the currency evolution,"" he said.\n\nYao went on to argue that a state-owned digital currency, however, creates tangible economic values and helps stabilize the market position of fiat currencies.\n\n""The nature of a state-owned digital currency is a government liability issued to the public,"" he said. ""And it\'s backed by the sovereign credibility.""\n\nYet, Yao takes a different approach from current trials of other central banks\' cryptocurrency projects that focus on the distributed ledger technology.\n\nCiting the RSCoin design concept by the Bank of England as a promising example, Yao argued that such state-owned digital currency should not be confined by the ideology of the blockchain and DLT.\n\n""RSCoin pictures a system that is controlled by the central bank,"" he said.

Blockchains are constantly growing as completed blocks are added in lines in chronological order.\n\nThey are the main technological innovation that made Bitcoins possible. Each Cryptocurrency has its own unique blockchain, buyers and sellers have their own unique codes; and like every piece of U.S. currency, every single Bitcoin has its own unique code (serial number).\n\nFractions of Bitcoins, called “Satoshi” are also traded.\n\nWhen a digital coin exchange takes place it is validated by a group of “Currency Miners” who use superpowerful computers, all competing to confirm and authenticate each transaction. When a given miner’s computer validates a transaction, he or she is rewarded with a fraction of that Cryptocurrency.\n\nToday, Cryptocurrencies have increasing value because unlike national currencies which have no limits in the amounts issued, Cryptocoins have ceilings on the total number to be minted. As of June 1, there were about 15 million Bitcoins in circulation, with only 6 million yet to be mined; after that no more Bitcoins will be produced.\n\nBut if you can’t hold a Bitcoin in your hand, where can they be stored?\n\nThirty-nine exchanges are listed on the Internet: Search for: The Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges, for websites providing “Wallets” in which coins can not only be stored, but also offer ways to purchase other Cryptocurrencies, sell them to individuals, companies, and other entities (such as colleges) that want or accept them.

Last month, it was discovered that The Pirate Bay had embedded multiple Monero miners on its website, which the company claimed was being trialed as an alternative revenue model to hosting ads.\n\nAlso Read: Pirate Bay Founder’s ‘Njalla’ Offers Anonymous Domain Registration for Bitcoin\n\nThe Pirate Bay Are Continuing to Host Ads Despite the Miner\n\nIt has been revealed that The Pirate Bay has again employed a javascript cryptocurrency miner, Coinhive, on its website. The script hijacks computing power from the website’s visitors and diverts such to mining Monero – which is then sent to a wallet owned by The Pirate Bay.\n\nLast month, the discovery of cryptocurrency mining scripts on The Pirate Bay’s website generated an uproar from many of their users. The company hastily abandoned the scripts, claiming that such comprised a short experiment with an alternative revenue model that would allow the website to abandon advertising as its primary source of income. The company stated “as you may have noticed we are testing a Monero javascript miner. This is only a test. We really want to get rid of all the ads. But we also need enough money to keep the site running… Let us know what you think in the comments. Do you want ads or do you want to give away a few of your CPU cycles every time you visit the site? Of course the mining can be blocked by a normal ad-blocker.”\n\nJavascript Cryptocurrency Miners Are Gaining Popularity\n\nTorrentfreak has reported that the Monero “miner is not directly embedded in the site’s core code but runs through an ad script.” As such, the website has conceded that it is possible that an advertiser could be responsible for the miner, however, The Pirate Bay’s recent actions suggest that the miner has likely been placed on the website intentionally. The Pirate Bay is yet to issue a statement addressing the newly discovered miner.\n\nSeveral torrenting websites have also experimented with cryptocurrency mining scripts as a source of revenue, including Proxybunker. In the case of Proxybunker, the move prompted content delivery provider, Cloudflare, to suspend the website’s account after flagging the miner as malware. Cloudflare chose to enforce the suspension even after Proxybunker allows visitors the option of disabling the script. As such, speculation has arisen that The Pirate Bay may also risk losing Cloudflare’s services – which protects the website against DDoS attacks, among other security concerns.\n\nLast month, a hacker embedded cryptocurrency miners on two websites in CBS’s Showtime network. Showtime.com, and Showtimeanytime.com, were discovered to be hosting javascript Monero miners that were consuming as much as 60 percent of the CPU capacity of visitors’ computers. The mining scripts were removed from Showtime’s websites by the end of the weekend on which they were discovered.\n\nDo you think that website’s running cryptocurrency mining scripts will become commonplace in the future?

The article delved into the role of institutional and retail traders in the mid-term surge in the Bitcoin price, but as Blockstream executive Samson Mow noted, the upcoming SegWit2x hard fork in November could play a vital role in the short-term price trend of Bitcoin.\n\nThroughout this week, an increasing number of communities, companies, and miners including the South Korean Bitcoin community and F2Pool have publicly denounced the SegWit2x hard fork, expressing their concerns toward the fork.\n\nAs BitGo lead engineer Jameson Lopp noted, F2Pool, one of the member companies behind the NYA Agreement and the SegWit2x proposal, stopped signaling for SegWit2x.\n\nWhile the majority of leading cryptocurrency exchanges and Bitcoin platforms such as Coinbase and Bitfinex have clarified that they will not list SegWit2x has the majority chain based on hashrate, several companies such as Xapo and Blockchain have revealed their intent to list the original Bitcoin blockchain as BC1 if it has less hashrate in comparison to the SegWit2x chain, despite the backlash and criticism from the community.\n\n“There is a significant possibility that the planned hard fork will result in two bitcoin block chains. In this case, we will follow the chain with the most accumulated difficulty and refer to that chain as Bitcoin. If the minority chain has significant value we will make that value available for customers to hold or exchange for a period of time, as we did with Bitcoin Cash. If the minority chain is the one with 1MB blocks, we plan to call it BC1. If the minority chain has 2MB blocks, we plan to call it BC2,” stated the Blockchain development team.\n\nExperts including Bitcoin investor and Atlanta Digital Currency Fund partner Alistair Milne have previously explained the flawed system of using hashrate as the sole indicator to justify the majority chain, as miners tend to follow profitable chains. For instance, upon the debut of Bitcoin Cash, most of the hashrate from Bitcoin migrated to Bitcoin Cash for a brief period of time before its difficulty adjustment. But, after the adjustment occurred, miners moved back to Bitcoin, as Bitcoin Cash was no longer as profitable as the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCommunities and Miner Speak Out Against SegWit2x, Major Factor For Short-Term Price Increase\n\nBecause of these issues, miners such as F2Pool and communities like the South Korean Bitcoin community have rejected the SegWit2x hard fork in November. The South Korean Bitcoin community released an official statement which read:\n\n“We, the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup, the largest bitcoin community in South Korea, founded in 2014 with more than 1600 members, would like to voice our staunch opposition to this November’s proposed hardfork. We are confident that BTC, the legacy chain, will not only survive this fork, but continue to flourish as the dominant Bitcoin network.”\n\nThe market’s confidence in the original Bitcoin blockchain and its long-term growth would likely position it for another strong rally, and a more stable platform to build upward momentum with the recent minor correction. More importantly, even if the SegWit2x hard fork occurs in November as planned, both supporters and critics of the hard fork would invest in Bitcoin to either express their support towards Bitcoin or to obtain the newly created SegWit2x coins (B2X) in October.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Ether prices are up 11 percent so far today, indicating increasing market confidence that ethereum may sail through its next big upgrade.\n\nThe ""Byzantium"" code, which is a part of the larger upgrade called ""Metropolis,"" will be enforced this Sunday via a hard fork of the ethereum blockchain. Though past hard forks have been mostly smooth, an emergency hard fork last year saw some continue to mine the old blockchain, creating a new asset, ethereum classic, and some users and firms lost funds in the event.\n\nSo far, however, developers have indicated that they are confident the hard fork will be activated without issue – and traders seem to agree.\n\nAt press time, ether is trading at around $340 levels.

Key factors boosting confidence in the cryptocurrency this year include Japan’s legislation of bitcoin as a legal method of payment in the country, a noteworthy acceptance of the decentralized digital currency from the third largest economy in the world. More recently, Japan issued 11 licenses to bitcoin exchanges to operate in the country.\n\nSimilarly, Australian authorities have also introduced cautiously embracive legislation to accommodate bitcoin activity as a part of the country’s wider FinTech-forward agenda. Less than a month ago, the Australian government introduced a bill to remove the double taxation of transactions involving cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Authorities vehemently stated they were “committed” to removing the double taxation in 2016, wherein bitcoin adopters had to pay the goods and services tax (GST) on the product before being taxed again for the GST levied on the digital currency used during the transaction.\n\nIn August, Australia’s justice minister announced regulation for the country’s digital currency exchanges for the first time. The regulatory work is “legitimizing” bitcoin for new investors, according to Adrian Przelozny, chief executive at Sydney-based bitcoin exchange Independent Reserve.\n\nSpeaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, the bitcoin executive stated:\n\nThe amount of regulatory work in Australia has people feeling much more confident in Bitcoin so we’re seeing all kinds of people investing. This is a global trend too.\n\nUnlike the hardline regulatory moves taken by China and Korea where initial coin offerings (ICOs) are banned outright, Australia’s securities regulator recognized the potential of the radical new form of fundraising and issued new guidelines for ICO organizers and startups in September.\n\nPrzelozny added:\n\nThese kinds of regulations give new investors confidence. It’s slowly legitimizing Bitcoin which gives the price support.\n\nThe Sydney-based exchange was also adding “between 100 and 200 new users everyday” the executive revealed, with a typical account opening with between AUD$20,000 and $50,000. Altogether, the exchange is handling up to $4 million in transactions on average every day.\n\nBitcoin has also gained a bipartisan rallying call urging the central bank to deem it a legal currency in Australia.

Using part of a computer’s CPU to mine bitcoin effects the machine’s overall performance and will slow it down by using up processing power.\n\nREUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nThe researchers found that bitcoin browser mining is mostly found on websites “with a shady reputation” due to the trouble such sites have with earning revenue through advertising. However, in the future it could become a legitimate and ethical way of making money if the website requests the permission of the visitor first.\n\n“220 sites may not seem like a lot,” the researchers wrote in a blogpost detailing their discovery. “But CoinHive was launched less than one month ago on September 14. The growth has been extremely rapid: from nearly zero to 2.2 percent of Alexa’s top 100,000 websites.\n\n“This analysis well illustrates the whole web, so it’s safe to say that one of every forty websites currently mines cryptocurrency (namely Monero) in the browsers their users employ.”\n\nAdGuard\n\nAdGuard estimates that the profit for the websites currently stands at around $43,000. This may not seem like a very high figure considering the number of computers affected, but it is still considerable given the timeframe and the fact it was done at almost zero cost.\n\nThe record-high price of bitcoin, which is $5,655 at the time of writing, is an incentive for websites and cyber criminals to profit from cryptocurrency mining software, such as Coinhive and JSEcoin.\n\nThe world's most valuable cryptocurrency now has a market capitalization of almost $100 billion and is currently being boosted by rumors China could reverse a recent ban on exchanges.\n\nMining bitcoin—the process of confirming bitcoin transactions and adding their record to bitcoin’s public ledger in order to generate new units of the currency—requires vast amounts of computing power, however newer cryptocurrencies like Monero with lower market value are easier to mine.\n\nSeparate research has previously found cryptocurrency mining software in websites including Showtime and the torrenting site The PirateBay."", 'Bitcoin’s seemingly unstoppable surge to record highs isn’t deterring competitors.\n\nFormer Silicon Valley developers are working on at least two new versions of the digital currency. Basecoin is seeking to solve bitcoin’s volatility with a team of former Google Inc. coders that are building what they hope will be a more stable version of the cryptocurrency. Cypherium has former Google, Amazon Inc. and Microsoft Corp. developers building a blockchain that aims to be able to handle an expanded workload more easily.\n\nCompetition isn’t new for bitcoin as there are over 1,000 different blockchains, the technology used for verifying and recording transactions that’s at the heart of bitcoin. While many rivals such as ethereum also provide applications, others like zCash and monero already say they’re trying to improve upon the first and biggest cryptocurrency.\n\nSo far they haven’t succeeded in dethroning bitcoin. After briefly dipping below 50 percent of the total cryptocurrency market, bitcoin is back at its dominant position.\n\n“When you have a whole new industry, competitors within that industry aren’t really competing with each other, they’re competing with the old industry and generally all boats rise together,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at Coin Center.\n\nBasecoin’s investors include venture-capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, PolyChain Capital, Pantera Capital and Mark Cuban-backed 1confirmation, among others. The team aims to develop a central bank that’s based on algorithms, performing similar money supply regulation functions done by the Federal Reserve, except it’s on the blockchain, requiring no human discretion. The hope is to have a stable currency that will make commerce more viable than can be conducted given bitcoin’s wild price swings.\n\nIn the Cypherium blockchain, developers write smart contracts and do governance work off-chain, so that all the power can be dedicated to transactions. The aim is for the cryptocurrency to handle thousands of transactions per second, compared with bitcoin’s fewer than 10.\n\nNewcomers will have a lot of catching up to do, as bitcoin continues to break new records, now towering above $5,000, as it shrugs off splits on its blockchain that stem from disagreements on fixing the very problems these new cryptocurrencies say they solve.\n\n— With assistance by Eric Lam']"
10/14/2017,"[""Bitcoin rose above $5,500 after bank earnings calls last week. More banks joined Goldman Sachs in stating they were examining the possibility of trading cryptocurrencies. Most notable was JP Morgan, whose CEO had publicly called Bitcoin and a 'fraud' just a few weeks before.\n\nThis helps support the view that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have the potential to go 'mainstream' despite ongoing setbacks in the ability to create a crypto ETF (I continue to believe that a crypto ETF is a requirement to really expand the adoption rate).\n\nThat banks are finally discussing what to do with cryptocurrencies is not surprising to me. As I have stated repeatedly, virtually every person I talk to, buy side or sell side, large or small, public or private, wants to talk about cryptocurrencies. Whether as an investment, what it might be doing to their business, or even, in some cases, what a bubble it is, Bitcoin and Crypto are part of most conversations. It is completely natural for Wall Street to finally embrace that demand - at least tentatively.\n\nAlso, in a world of low volatility, the bane of every trading desks' existence, it makes perfect sense for banks to explore trading a volatile and popular product where bid/offer spreads are wide and the ability to trade order flow could be large.\n\nBitcoin definitely gained a victory, as banks finally admitted to studying how to integrate it into their platforms. That should support prices in the near term as we all get to see what progress is made in terms of ETF launches.\n\nIt is important; however, to remember that banks study a lot of things - not all of which get put into action. Even if banks decide to trade cryptocurrencies, they won't create demand by owning large inventories - all they will do is facilitate trading for clients. That facilitation might be enough to move the needle on further price increases, but it is still a long way off, especially since the regulators have yet to weigh in on the subject.\n\nI would take the enthusiasm brought on by the bank announcements with a grain of salt."", 'The bitcoin battle has divided Wall Street recently, with seemingly bright people having differing opinions.\n\nUnderstand that when many bankers talk about bitcoin, they are generally referring to the blockchain technology that is underlying bitcoin transactions.\n\nWith bitcoin, there is no centralized clearing, settlement or oversight. Nor is there the ability to unmask the movers or holders of bitcoin, a code-based currency. That is all by design, and numerous people have gone to prison for drug-running and related money-laundering using the cryptocurrency.\n\nA few weeks ago, JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon referred to bitcoin as a mere “fraud.”\n\nIn September Dimon said, “My daughter bought bitcoin, it went up, now she thinks she is a genius” (and now the dumb money is flooding in, as the cryptocurrency hit a high for the day of $5,855 on Friday).\n\nOn Thursday he changed his tune during the bank’s conference call, when he said, “I wouldn’t put this high on the category of important things in the world. But I’m not going to talk about bitcoin anymore,” later adding, “I was reminded that we move trillions of dollars a day digitally. It’s not cash.”\n\nThen on Friday, he reneged and said, “If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day.”\n\nWhat Dimon probably will be talking about in the future is the blockchain technology as a benefit to the bank for transferring the trillions of dollars a day digitally.\n\nThe blockchain could turn out to be something great, like PayPal or Visa and MasterCard. It may also be just one of those cool “hip” technology investments that never pans out into something viable.\n\nThere are some smart people from Silicon Valley investing in the transaction technology, as well.\n\nIn the meantime, most Americans aren’t buying into bitcoin, but lots of mysterious foreigners — from far-away locations like Malaysia, Indonesia and other places where people go to disappear — are investing in it.\n\nI believe the play on bitcoin is its potential as a payment technology, if there is any at all.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Bitcoin may be trading at an all-time high, but the reasons why have experts wondering.\n\nDespite increased dialogue about the cryptocurrency\'s potential, and growing acknowledgment from the mainstream, there are some who believe now isn\'t the best time to buy the notoriously volatile asset. After all, in just weeks, bitcoin is likely to see not just a contentious split of its blockchain, but an adversarial one.\n\nLooking for context on what could happen if bitcoin splits and one version tries to destroy the value of the other? As developers freely admit, you\'re unlikely to find it – it\'s a first.\n\n""Bitcoin traders are some of the most irrational investors you\'ll come across,"" OpenBazaar developer Chris Pacia said in a Facebook post addressing the issue.\n\nThe brutal sentiment points to what has been the uptick in buying that appears to be taking place not just despite – but because of – the coming fork, now slated for November. In contrast to zealous investors, developers like Pacia are finding it hard to believe anyone would put big money into a protocol about to undergo a process even they\'re just beginning to understand.\n\nYet it seems, investors believe the momentum is warranted given the results of the last hard fork in August, which split the network in two, but did so in a way that fairly safely created a new asset called bitcoin cash.\n\nDistributed to all bitcoin owners at the time of the fork, investors were suddenly given an equal amount of valuable cryptocurrency (bitcoin cash has held relatively steady around $300 per coin, but has traded for as much as $1,000). Far from a risky proposition, investors see that extra value as just created out of thin air and delivered to existing investors for free.\n\nBut while developers are aware the mechanisms and politics of the coming fork are different, investors seem to be planning for the same results.\n\nHarry Yeh, managing partner at cryptocurrency investment firm Binary Financial, told CoinDesk:\n\n""Investors are just looking at it like, \'I\'m going to get more tokens right now.\' It\'s just that simple.""\n\nAnd these investors aren\'t new to cryptocurrency (or to trading in general), they\'re well-established investors.\n\nRonnie Moas, the founder of Wall Street firm Standpoint Research, for example, echoed Yeh\'s belief, saying, ""I don\'t see [investing in bitcoin as Segwit2x closes in] as risky – especially if you hold onto the spin-off [coins].""\n\nNot the same\n\nIs this merely a case of aggressive trading, or is it wishful thinking? Some would argue, that on this issue, the traditional finance guys are getting in over their heads.\n\nFor one, the bitcoin cash hard fork and the Segwit2x hard fork will be different in that the former\'s supporters were defined by their interest in creating a competing (and now seemingly complementary) cryptocurrency. With Segwit2x, the motivations aren\'t exactly that.\n\nStill, traders counter, cryptocurrency just doesn\'t function like more established markets, meaning that in the high-risk world of experimental assets, more risk is still just risk.\n\n""Historically, one would assume that if you have one token and it splits into two, your mindset would be that both tokens would be worthless,"" Yeh said. ""But, traditional rules of economics and finance don\'t really apply in the cryptocurrency world.""\n\nYeh points to last summer\'s ethereum hard fork, which led to a split and the creation of two competing assets as yet another sign forks have historically resulted in value creation.\n\nWhile the price of ethereum and ethereum classic (the new coin) dropped initially after the split, ethereum\'s market value recovered quite nicely, currently hovering around $32 billion, while ethereum classic continues to hold value at just over $1 billion.\n\n""History has shown that, any time there\'s been a hard fork, that people get more tokens – and those tokens become tradeable somewhere,"" Yeh said.\n\nAs a consequence, retail investors are betting that if they buy more bitcoin, another fork will drive prices higher, and that this will result in them holding a more diversified portfolio.\n\nMore about bitcoin\n\nHowever, some investors say the rally could be less about diversification and more about going all in on bitcoin with the expectation of even more long-term gain.\n\nAccording to Arthur Hayes, a former Citigroup trader who now heads a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, confidence is high that the existence of additional versions of the bitcoin protocol won\'t affect this long-term future. Further, with bitcoin holding steady, even though three of the world\'s largest exchanges in China closed down, there\'s confidence that nothing can quite derail its current trajectory.\n\nAs a result, investors aren\'t really worried about Segwit2x.\n\nYeh agreed with the bullish outlook on bitcoin broadly, saying he expects a run-up both before and after the hard fork.\n\nHe argued that ideological belief in bitcoin – even at its most uncertain, even at its lowest – is what will continue to push the price higher and new investors into the market.\n\nSumming up that investor optimism, James Altucher, a former hedge fund manager, popular business blogger and bitcoin bull, told CoinDesk:\n\n""When people say that bitcoin is like a penny stock, it\'s like a scam internet stock, no. Bitcoin actually has huge amounts of software and science behind it to make it the best store of value in the world.""\n\nAsh Bennington contributed reporting.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x proposal and has an ownership stake in OB1, the company that develops OpenBazaar.\n\nSkydiving image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The tweet was accompanied by a chart of the value of Bitcoin.\n\nMy deepest thanks to the US government, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCard, Payal, AmEx, Mooneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010.

Wikileaks and its founder represent the sort of non-governmental control that Bitcoin is founded upon.', 'The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, was bullish about Blockchain technology when he spoke with CNBC during an interview. However, while expressing his positive views of the technology, he was quick to point out that there are risks when it comes to Blockchain technology derivatives like Bitcoin. When asked if the Blockchain based currencies were viable, he said:\n\n""Blockchain technology is something that everyone is excited about, but we have to remember that Bitcoin is one of the very few instances [of Blockchain’s use in currency]. And the other times when Blockchain was used they were basically Ponzi schemes, so it’s very important that if we go forward with it, we\'re sure that it’s not going to be used to exploit.”\n\nThe World Bank functions as a lending house for national governments in order to provide needed capital. The institution has already been considering Blockchain technology solutions for some time, particularly in areas of financial transparency.\n\nAs the interview progressed, Kim’s views on Bitcoin became more clear, as he compared it with Chinese giant Alibaba, in terms of the speed and accuracy of transactions. He commented that with Alibaba, a transaction of $160,000 takes just ‘three seconds’ and that the company was able to assess the creditworthiness of the transaction in that amount of time. The implication being that Bitcoin is unnecessary when legacy models can do similar things.', 'BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, has recently adjusted his perspective on Bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency is just a money laundering scheme. Fink had previously made some relatively positive comments about Bitcoin, but has shifted his position.\n\nThe head man at the largest asset management firm in the world spoke out against Bitcoin during the same Institute of International Finance panel discussion in which Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin buyers ‘stupid.’ Fink said:\n\n""Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world. That’s all it is. It’s an index of money laundering.”\n\nThe comments were met with chuckles from the crowd, even as Fink looked at Dimon as he spoke.\n\nThese recent comments indicate the substantial divide there is in Wall Street between industry leaders like Tommy Lee at Fundstrat and others, who have supported Bitcoin as an asset, and Dimon and others who have denigrated it.', 'Bitcoin price is surging higher against the US Dollar.

And paradise on the mind? You could use it to buy a second passport.\n\nVanuatu, a South Pacific archipelago of some 80 islands, will now let outsiders use the volatile cryptocurrency to apply for so-called investment citizenship. Fork over the equivalent of about $280,000, and your family of up to four can receive passports from what the New Economics Foundation, a U.K.-based think tank, calls the fourth-happiest country in the world. (It ranked No. 1 when the list was first published in 2006, but like the vagaries of the market, happiness can be a fleeting thing. )\n\nWith bitcoin reaching a record price of $5,209 on Thursday, more than five times its value at the start of the year, passports for the whole clan cost about 53.8 bitcoin.\n\nVanuatu isn’t the only island that offers citizenship for a price—the list includes Antigua, Grenada, Malta, and St. Kitts and Nevis—but it’s the first to allow payments via bitcoin. The development was announced in a press release on Investment Migration Insider, a website focused on investment citizenry.\n\nVanuatu citizenship offers several advantages. The country has the 34th-most-“powerful” passport in the world, providing visa-free visits to 116 other countries, according to the Passport Index, a list of rankings maintained by Arton Capital, a company that facilitates foreign residence and citizenship applications. Vanuatu falls right below Panama and Paraguay (tied) and above Dominica; the U.K. is in a tie for third place, the U.S. at fourth, and Russia at 40th.\n\nThe country also has no income, inheritance, or corporate tax. It’s not even customary to tip there, according to the Vanuatu Tourism Office. The archipelago is relatively accessible: about a three-and-a-half-hour flight from Sydney to Port Vila, the capital. And scuba aficionados will appreciate that it’s home to the world’s largest diveable wreck—the SS President Coolidge, a luxury liner-turned-troop ship that sank during World War II.\n\nShould you really want a place to escape, Vanuatu’s abundance of islands and relatively small population (about 290,000) mean that your own private island may be within reach. The least expensive one currently on the market, according to real estate website Private Islands Online, is Lenur, priced at about $645,000. For that you get 84 acres including three sandy beaches, a handful of sleeping bungalows, and an open-plan kitchen. Most of the property is covered in coconut, fruit, and nut trees.\n\nStill, like investing in cryptocurrency in the first place, tropical life doesn’t come without risks. Earlier this month, residents had to be evacuated from the northern island of Ambae because its volcano, Manaro Voui, had rumbled to life and was spewing steam and rocks.\n\nThis article was written by Sara Clemence from Bloomberg and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network. Please direct all licensing questions to [email protected].', 'Earlier this month, the MIT Technology Review posted an article that asked “What the hell is an initial coin offering?”\n\nWhen befuddlement emanates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, arguably the world’s foremost grantor of geek cred, you know you are in truly new territory.\n\nHere’s what it is: An initial coin offering, or ICO, is a fundraising mechanism based on a “cryptocurrency,” such as bitcoin.\n\nAn ICO can launch a whole new cryptocurrency (there has been a proliferation of new flavors in recent months), or it can be used to create “tokens” used to fund a new business.\n\nFor instance, an ICO can allow a new data-storage company to pre-sell tokens to be used as a digital form of payment for distributed file storage.\n\nThat is the essential story behind the Filecoin ICO, which raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a presale to some of the biggest investors in Silicon Valley. The technology, which promises to enable the use of excess storage capacity on all kinds of computers — sort of an Airbnb of hard drives — is being built with funds from the token sale.\n\nAnd yet, nothing about an ICO is that simple. As the CEO of a new enterprise cloud platform planning to launch an ICO this year, I can tell you from the front lines that this market truly is a through-the-looking-glass experience.\n\nWith its own jargon, murky regulation, a gold-rush atmosphere and hundreds of millions of dollars in play for some of the bigger projects, it has become nothing short of its own financial subculture.\n\nImagine: More than $1.5 billion has been raised via ICOs to date.\n\nIn fact, blockchain-based businesses have so far this year raised more capital via ICOs than through traditional venture capital.\n\nMany say it’s a bubble. Maybe. But it’s also possible that — like the Internet boom of 20 years ago — valuations are beside the point.\n\nThe real story is the underlying innovation of crowdfunding through a sale of digital tokens, verified through a novel use of blockchain technology. It is refreshingly independent of our modern banking and fundraising mechanisms.\n\nICOs are such a new concept that the market is way ahead of policy. Governments are still wrestling with how or whether to oversee them. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has given only the most cursory of guidance about what types of ICOs should be regulated as securities.\n\nChina flat-out banned them earlier this month, no exceptions, sending cryptocurrency values into a tailspin. Estonian officials, meanwhile, were considering an ICO for the nation’s very own cryptocurrency until the EU got spooked and made them stop.\n\nIn theory, ICOs should be pretty vanilla: Entrepreneurs announce and promote their new idea online. The ICO customers who are excited about, and want to use the product, buy the tokens. Then the entrepreneur uses the funding to build the product using a token that has a value only on that system.\n\nA real world corollary would be an arcade that pre-sells tokens, using the funds to buy all of the best video games, and then opening its doors to its pre-sold community. Those tokens would only have the value of playing a game, no more no less.\n\nBut the ICO world doesn’t quite work like that. If the entrepreneurs succeed and there’s good demand for that product when it launches, then those pre-sold tokens become more valuable. And so speculators have stepped in, exchanges have been set up and everyone has pretty much lost their minds.\n\nAnd, as the bigger money has come in, just like the traditional investing world, the individual investor can be at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nGlobal crypto investors — the biggest ones are called “whales” — are sought for every ICO. New “institutional” crypto investment groups, and even self-styled hedge funds, get in early to buy tokens in bulk at a discount, to sell later to the community at a premium.\n\nDuring the gold rushes of the 1800s, the only ones guaranteed to make money were those selling tools, provisions, maps, etc. to the gold rushers. In this modern gold rush we see see their descendants: cottage industries of specialist crypto-investor relations and marketing companies sprouting up on the sidelines, looking to charge well over a hundred thousand dollars for a successful ICO launch.\n\nNew platforms have spawned to charge companies to rate their ICOs, and others charge thousands of dollars — in cryptocurrency of course — to list the upcoming sales.\n\nThere are actual registered broker-dealers offering some services. Finding the credible ones is still tough, as many are still cautious. Too many are the very questionable shops with the minimal licensing that are little more than boiler rooms. A true-utility token is going to be an asset class of its own, and will tap into the established financial market, but as of yet there is no system or credible player.\n\nIt’s become so important to create enthusiasm and demand for the product that a bounty program typically is organized around each. The tokens for sale in the ICO are intended for a community that will use the product itself, but nothing is stopping speculators from scooping them up. In fact, the momentum is part of what drives a successful ICO.\n\nWith every ICO come the folks who offer help in exchange for tokens. In this context those tokens are called a “bounty,” making them ... bounty hunters. This help comes in every imaginable form. ICOs generally involve the crafting of a white paper that’s given to investors. Swarms of bounty hunters appear offering translations into Mandarin and Russian but also Romanian, Turkish, etc.\n\nOverseeing this process is the bounty manager, someone hired by the company who by necessity is a strict taskmaster. He or she bans the shady bounty hunters, controls the purse strings and checks their work. You’ll want one who can read Romanian.\n\nThe future is unwritten. ICOs may complement venture capital and private equity and they may not. Regulatory crackdowns could slow things down. But so far ICOs continue apace.\n\nThe point is this a fundamentally new funding model, so there is no roadmap for growth and process. The road that is being paved has created its own subculture, and that’s an interesting thing to see in the what is usually a grey and stodgy world of finance.\n\nLucas Geiger is the founder and CEO of Wireline, a marketplace for business applications.

10/15/2017,"['When bitcoin price reaches new heights, the critics raise their voices. As the price approached the $6,000 benchmark Friday, it didn’t take long for critics to warn of impending doom.\n\nWall Street banker Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, unleashed another one of his diatribes against bitcoin Friday in response to a CNBC moderator question at an event hosted by the Institute of International Finance, reiterating that he believes blockchain technology is useful but that non-fiat cryptocurrency “has no value.”\n\nFinancial analyst Gary Shilling called bitcoin a ‘black box’ and that he won’t be investing in the digital currency. Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling & Company, said bitcoin is “too opaque and complicated for him to invest” in.\n\nBut many cryptocurrency observers believe the rise in bitcoin price is built on solid fundamentals and are optimistic about bitcoin’s future.\n\nPublicity Boosts Bitcoin\n\n“As bitcoin gets more attention in whatever form, positive or negative, the hard fact remains that there are only 17 million bitcoins in existence (with a 21 million limit in total),” said Sol Lederer, blockchain director at Loomia, a technology company creating smart products secured through blockchain technology. “So if everyone just wants a little if only to play with, the price needs to keep going up. We won’t see real change in price direction until there is a real scare to the security of the technology.”\n\nSerafin Lion Engel, founder and CEO of DataWallet, a blockchain technology-based data exchange that allows data producers to reclaim data they create from those who use it for their own profit, thinks critics like Dimon are drawing attention to bitcoin and ultimately contributing to its perceived importance.\n\n“Comments, such as Jamie Dimon’s, drive the bitcoin hormesis we are currently witnessing, where adversarial comments by renowned beneficiaries of the current centralized system simply add to the strength of the bitcoin ecosystem,” Engel said.\n\n“Furthermore, it also simply boils down to exposure: The more people hear that about bitcoin, the more people will adopt bitcoin since its benefits over the past financial system are so abundantly clear,” he said.\n\nEngel said bitcoin has proven to be an antifragile asset which, due to its characteristics of immutability, transparency, and disintermediation, thrives in a world of ever-increasing political and socio-economic uncertainty.\n\nProgress Expected To Continue\n\nYonatan Sela, senior vice president of business development at YouNow, which serves as an ecosystem for video applications, also expects bitcoin price to continue to rise.\n\n“The soar in the price of bitcoin isn’t surprising, and I expect that while price fluctuations will continue, in the long-term bitcoin will continue to rise in price far beyond $6,000, especially if you buy into the thesis that bitcoin could become the prominent digital reserve currency,” Sela said. “The main reserve currency in the world is gold, with a market cap of ~$7 trillion. Bitcoin is currently at ~$94 billion, which is less than 1.5% of that. Even if it stays just 2% of gold, it will surpass the $6,000 price point.”\n\nSimon Yu, CEO of StormX, a gamified micro-task platform, thinks there are several factors contributing to bitcoin’s growth.\n\n“Although this recent boom is largely caused by the October 25th Bitcoin Gold Fork, as users will receive a free Bitcoin Gold for every bitcoin held, 2017 has been a phenomenal year for cryptocurrency with the boom in ICOs,” said Yu. “I expect the industry to grow even further next year as institutional funds are only now starting to join the cryptocurrency boom.”\n\nDemand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also continues to gain momentum, Yu said, especially as more countries recognize it as a legitimate form of payment and acknowledge its value.\n\n“I expect the price of bitcoin to continue to rise as cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream,” Yu said.\n\nProgress on the scalability front also gives reason for optimism, observed Luis Cuende, co-founder and project lead at Aragon, a decentralized platform for building and managing organizations and companies. “I think the rise in bitcoin prices reflects the enthusiasm that the public has into bitcoin being a digital currency and new technical solutions like SegWit, that enable more scalability and new solutions for instant payments,” Cuende said.\n\nAlso read: Crypto executives see silver lining in China’s ban of bitcoin exchanges\n\nMainstream Acceptance Grows\n\nRob Viglione, co-founder of ZenCash, a privacy coin for borderless, decentralized communications and transactions, said there is no question bitcoin is becoming more mainstream.\n\n“It’s always tough to say what’s driving prices, but what we do know is that there’s more demand for bitcoin now than ever,” Viglione said. “A big part of that is due to the fact that it has steadily achieved more mainstream credibility and that there’s now a robust global conversation. For those of us who study cryptocurrency characteristics, there’s growing consensus that we’re witnessing the birth of a new asset class, and that’s huge.”\n\nFurther price fluctuations are to be expected, according to Bharath Rao, CEO of Leverj, a decentralized platform for cryptocurrency derivatives trading.\n\n“The price should certainly be expected to fluctuate quite a bit, both due to the uncertainty and promise of new technology,” Rao said. “We believe that bitcoin is not yet mainstream and will continue to grow in value as more financial use cases move to crypto. Buying and holding bitcoin has outpaced every single traditional investment since 2009 and is likely to continue to do so for several years.”\n\nBitcoin’s use in markets where the local currency is heavily controlled will also contribute to its growth, said David Henderson, founder of Sweetbridge, a blockchain alliance seeking to launch projects in industry ecosystems, including protocols for commerce, supply chains and interest-free loans.\n\n“A quick look at bitcoin’s price history (the two pizzas famously ordered by a developer for 10,000 BTC in 2010 would be worth about $30 million each today!) shows the challenges in using this as a transactional currency or as collateral, as the fluctuations are significant and frequent, unlike most fiat currencies,” he said. “That said, it can provide an alternative in countries where the local currency is heavily controlled, restricted and subject to very high inflation.”\n\nThe bitcoin price continued its meteoric rise on Friday, climbing as high as $5,840 to make $6,000 seem like a near-term possibility. The price was $5,756.11 Saturday morning.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As far as adoption goes, Bitcoin follows a familiar pattern. Populous, first world countries in North America, Europe and Asia were first to catch Bitcoin fever, the first to establish exchanges and the first to begin restricting them as well. While early Bitcoin trading in these countries was largely boundless, allowing for things like margin trading and high leverage, as more of each country’s fiat money moved into Bitcoin, governments and central banks began to draw lines.\n\nThe market witnessed a pointed example of such “no more nonsense” regulation as recently as a few days ago in South Korea. Following China’s example, the country decided to limit ICOs and no-fee exchanges, which had until that point been an enormously speculative influence in the altcoin markets. However, no matter the increasing rate of adoption and regulation around the world, Bitcoin always manages to find its “Wild West” somewhere new.\n\nBahrain\n\nBahrain wants to be known as more than a place of oil wealth. The country is moving quickly towards adopting Blockchain technology, which would naturally place it in an advantageous position regarding Bitcoin as well. The Chief Executive of the country’s Economic Development Board, Khalid Al Rumaihi, is working with Bahrain’s finance ministry to make it a “pioneer in the space.” They are even in process of proposing a joint venture with Saudi Arabia and other nearby countries to establish a healthy ecosystem for the area’s official exchanges and other infrastructure.\n\nSweden\n\nSweden is progressive when it comes to their finances. Today, five of the six major banks in the country do not operate with cash, and the vast majority of Swedes use their bank cards for everything. This puts them close to their goal of becoming the first cashless civilization, and they’re looking to Bitcoin to bring them the rest of the way there. They recognize that one of the biggest problems of a digital financial system over a cash one is privacy. Bitcoin fits this need suitably and provides an additional measure of anonymity over alternative cashless solutions.\n\nVenezuela\n\nAfter the tragic collapse of all civilization in Venezuela, the value of one Bolivar, the country’s currency, dropped to the same value as one satoshi (or about $0.00004 at current BTC price). Thanks to a scarcity of physical Bolivars and a harried financial system, people are finding themselves handing over buckets of cash just to pay for lunch. Many merchants have taken to accepting Bitcoin and other digital payment methods only. Though it may be out of a frightening necessity rather than voluntary adoption, this may be the first “Bitcoinization” of a sovereign state.\n\nIndia\n\nLike Venezuela and Sweden, India is a ripe target for Bitcoin. The country went through a rapid demonetization last year, largely to curb counterfeit operations of their 500 and 1,000 rupee bills and rampant graft, which were funding other illicit activities. The shortage of cash that followed saw Indians react flexibly by depositing their money in bank accounts, though counterfeit versions of the new notes appeared not long after. Bitcoin is a perfect fit, and is beginning to find its niche. As many as 2,500 Indians invest in Bitcoin each day, and there are new partnerships being forged between international cryptocurrency players and Indian platforms like Unocoin.\n\nSingapore\n\nThe Singapore Fintech Consortium is a powerhouse devoted to forming a cryptocurrency network with countries in the Middle East and abroad. To “pave the way for increased interaction between startups in the Middle East and those in Asian markets via Singapore,” the fintech leader has been cutting deals with places like the UAE, Abu Dhabi, and Bahrain to establish a cooperative fintech environment.\n\nJapan\n\nThough Japan is a major world power, and can hardly be considered an emerging market, the country’s progress in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency arenas must be praised. Not only has this small, influential island nation made Bitcoin legal tender, it has paved the way for Blockchain innovation more than any other country. Instead of outright bans, the government’s Financial Services Agency has instead created a strict yet fair environment for companies and individuals to trade, operate exchanges, and integrate Blockchain into Japan’s economy. Eleven exchanges, of the more than 50 who have thus far applied, are deemed compliant and are currently in operation.\n\nBitcoin Can’t Be Stopped\n\nThough countries with major influence have thus far proven hesitant to allow Bitcoin and Blockchain to upset the status quo, smaller countries with more to gain recognize a unique opportunity. Those who understand the technology know that given time, and a favorable environment, the adopters will prove all the naysayers wrong.', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially stated that Russia will issue its own ‘CryptoRuble’ at a closed door meeting in Moscow, according to local news sources. The news broke through Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov.\n\nAccording to the official, the state issued cryptocurrency cannot be mined and will be issued and controlled and maintained only by the authorities. The CryptoRubles can be exchanged for regular Rubles at any time, though if the holder is unable to explain where the CryptoRubles came from, a 13 percent tax will be levied. The same tax will be applied to any earned difference between the price of the purchase of the token and the price of the sale. Nikiforov said:\n\n“I confidently declare that we run CryptoRuble for one simple reason: if we do not, then after 2 months our neighbors in the EurAsEC will.”\n\nEmbracing and rejecting\n\nWhile the announcement means that Russia will enter the cryptocurrency world, it is in no way an affirmation or legalization of Bitcoin or any other decentralized cryptocurrency. On the contrary, Putin quite recently called for a complete ban on all cryptocurrencies within Russia.\n\nThe statement from Putin seemed apparently to contradict the earlier comments from other ministers who seemed pro-crypto, but only with regulations, as well as Putin’s recent meetings with Buterin and others. Now, with the issuance of the CryptoRuble, the apparent contradiction has been made clear.', 'With $30 billion on the line, all eyes are likely to be on ethereum tomorrow as it seeks to navigate one of its biggest-ever updates.\n\nWill all software users upgrade to the updated blockchain? Or will a new, competing token be created? That\'s exactly what the market is watching and waiting to see when etheruem hits block 4,370,000, scheduled to occur tomorrow at around 6:00 UTC at press time.\n\nThe first part of a larger, multi-part upgrade, the so-called ""Byzantium"" code will make the blockchain lighter and faster, paving the way for better decentralized applications (dapps), while also enhancing network privacy.\n\nNew features aside, however, ethereum developers are mostly optimistic about the upgrade. Although developers on the most popular clients have had to iron out a pair of bugs in the days leading up to change, there\'s confidence that the upgrade will be smooth.\n\nNew and seasoned investors won\'t likely want to take others\' word for it, however. So, if you\'re eager to see for yourself, here\'s how to monitor the update in real time:\n\nFork countdown\n\nAdding uncertainty to hard forks is their reliance on block numbers as a way to signal upgrades. Simply put, rather than have everyone change their software at a specific time, users rely on the numbered blocks in the blockchain itself as a means of coordinating.\n\nBecause of this, no one knows exactly when the hard fork will take place. Yet, that doesn\'t mean there\'s no way to keep an eye out.\n\nTo track when this block number will be hit, Singapore-based smart contract company CodeTract has released a fork countdown, showing how many blocks remain and roughly, how much time is left until the fork occurs.\n\nBy current projections, the hard fork looks like it will execute on early Monday.\n\nMining hashrate\n\nOnce the fork happens, users will want to track how much of the ethereum ecosystem moves over, and how quickly they do so.\n\nThis is a key metric to track. As long as miners are mining on the old version of ethereum, it will remain operational (and valuable). If that persists for long enough, it could lead to a split (although ethereum developers think this is unlikely due to specifics in the code).\n\nDevelopers aren\'t going in blind either – already, the Byzantium code has undergone testing to give an idea of how the fork would play out. For example, earlier this week, all miners on a test version of the network made the migration, a small (but encouraging) sign of what to expect.\n\nThe best way to watch this is on the Ethereum Foundation\'s website, which will show what percentage of ethereum miners that have moved over to the new blockchain when the fork happens.\n\nNodes\n\nBut, miners are not the only stakeholders in ethereum who need to upgrade; developers, users and companies running nodes, which store a full copy of the ledger, also need to download new software or risk falling behind.\n\nEther Nodes tracks how many node operators are running clients compatible with Byzantium.\n\nGeth, the most popular ethereum client, released fork-ready software in version 1.7.2. And Parity, the second most popular client, released 1.7.6, which is compatible and fixes some consensus bugs.\n\nRight now, 60 percent of Geth nodes and 27 percent of Parity nodes have upgraded to a hard fork-compatible version. With under a day left before the fork, most node operators still need to upgrade.\n\nPrice\n\nOf course, there may be more immediate reasons you\'re worried about a split.\n\nIf money\'s on the mind, you can always be sure to monitor the price of ether. For that, you can turn to our ethereum price page, which will update in real time as the fork happens.\n\nStadium seats via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But, Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo emphasized the resilience of Bitcoin towards various external factors that could have led the Bitcoin price to decrease significantly in the short-term.\n\n#Bitcoin has survived: ??Hackers\n\n??State attack\n\n??Corrupt bankers\n\n??Disgruntled devs\n\n??Hostile miners\n\n??Rogue CEOs#WeAreTheHoneyBadger — Eric Lombrozo (@eric_lombrozo) October 15, 2017\n\nHard Fork in November: How it Became a Positive Factor For Bitcoin Price\n\nAs Lombrozo noted in the statement above, Bitcoin has survived through various events that could have led to a short-term plunge in the price of Bitcoin. For instance, in September, the Chinese government imposed a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency exchanges to a market which handled approximately 10 to 13 percent of global Bitcoin trades.\n\nWithin two weeks, the global cryptocurrency and Bitcoin exchange markets successfully restructured, as trading volumes from China moved to overseas markets such as Japan, South Korea, and the US. The Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges, which could have turned out to be a negative mid and long-term factor for the Bitcoin price, ultimately provided a better platform for the price of Bitcoin to achieve new all-time highs because trading volumes have moved to more stable and efficient Bitcoin markets.\n\nApart from China, one of the major events the Bitcoin community has been anticipating is the SegWit2x hard fork in November. Earlier this month, prominent Bitcoin analysts and investors including Tuur Demeester explained that depending on the support for SegWit2x, the price of Bitcoin could vary.\n\nSpecifically, Demeester emphasized that if the support for the SegWit2x hard fork proposal declines, the price of Bitcoin will go up, as the market and investors express their confidence over the mid-term growth of Bitcoin. So far, Bitcoin has shown strong resilience towards the SegWit2x hard fork in November.\n\nMore to that, users and investors that do support the SegWit2x proposal would also have to invest in Bitcoin in order to obtain SegWit2x coins in November and as such, the demand for Bitcoin from SegWit2x supports could have likely caused the Bitcoin price to increase as well.\n\nOver the past month, Bitcoin has shown resilience towards negative indicators and factors that could have led the Bitcoin price to plunge below the $3,000 mark. Instead, due to increasing demand from institutional investors and strengthening of the Japanese and South Korean markets, the Bitcoin price has established a new all-time high and has positioned itself to lead another strong rally.\n\nAs large-scale investment firms and retail traders continue to engage in Bitcoin trading as suggested by key figures including billionaire hedge fund investor Mike Novogratz and Bitfury executive George Kikvadze, the Bitcoin price is likely to increase to $6,000 in the mid-term, to the interim target of most experts such as Blockstream executive Samson Mow, as NewsBTC previously reported.\n\nImage License: For commercial use', 'WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange posted a sardonic ‘thank you’ note addressing US authorities who forced the whistleblowing website into investing in Bitcoin in 2010.

It caused us to invest in Bitcoin -- with > 50000% return,” Assange tweeted.\n\nFor context, Bitcoin reached highs of up to $5,746.51 this week in yet another unprecedented surge in value, The Coin Telegraph reports.\n\nFollowing the release of sensitive documents regarding US interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, sanctions were imposed against WikiLeaks, which severely curtailed funding and forced the website to seek alternative methods of funding.\n\nIn his tweet, Assange called out current and former senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman, respectively, for forcing him into seeking alternative sources of funding which turned out to be a blessing in disguise.\n\nAt the time, Lieberman called for the Department of Justice to indict Assange under the 1917 Espionage Act and sought his extradition from the UK for leaking US Embassy cables.\n\n""I think this is the most serious violation of the Espionage Act in our history,"" Lieberman said at the time, as cited by The Guardian. ""It sure looks to me that Assange and WikiLeaks have violated the Espionage Act.""\n\nAssange has been exiled in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012.', 'Bitcoin price could be due for a pullback after its strong breakout move, with tech indicators confirming that the rally could resume.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price recently surged to new record highs, indicating that bullish momentum is strongly in play once more.\n\nPrice appears to be stalling from its rally so a pullback opportunity might present itself.\n\nTechnical indicators are mostly signaling that the uptrend could resume, and the Fib tool shows the potential correction levels.\n\nBitcoin price could be due for a pullback after its strong breakout move, with tech indicators confirming that the rally could resume.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside. In other words, the rally is more likely to resume than to reverse. The short-term moving average lines up with the broken resistance area at $4800-5000 while the 200 SMA is slightly above the 61.8% Fib at $4126.44.\n\nStochastic seems to be pulling up from the oversold area to indicate a return in bullish momentum. This could also mean that buyers are eager to hop back in and push for new highs with a very shallow pullback.\n\nHowever, RSI is still on the move down to show that bearish pressure is kicking in. In that case, a deeper pullback to the lower Fibs could be in the cards, and a breakdown could even spur a test of the range support at $3000.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nThe odds are looking against the dollar these days, especially since CPI readings came in below expectations for September. However, Yellen sounded hawkish in her testimony over the weekend so December hike expectations could stay supported while 2018 tightening forecasts appear to have been dampened.\n\nAs for bitcoin price, the attention is mostly on the next network upgrade in November and investors are hoping to see a similar reaction to the August upgrade that pushed the cryptocurrency to record highs.\n\nA rival version called bitcoin gold has emerged but it could suffer the same fate as bitcoin cash and render the original version stronger instead of splitting into separate cryptocurrencies.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

10/16/2017,"[""[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nI entered the cryptocurrency field in 2013 and watched the price of Bitcoin skyrocket from a low of $100 to over $1000. There was a rush to invest in Bitcoin companies, then in 2014 the price crashed back to $250. Investors that had become interested in the technology started to think, “OK, Bitcoin is dead, but the blockchain concept is an advance. How do we take that coin out and keep the blockchain?”.\n\nThree years of investment later, the world still doesn't have any major live applications of a private blockchain. But what if this was the wrong question? What if the real question was “how do we take the blockchain out of Bitcoin”? What if we could have cryptocurrency, secure/transparent data transfer and decentralized autonomous organizations without a blockchain? This is what the team behind IOTA, a cryptocurrency with a market cap of over $1.2bn USD at the time of writing this, set out to determine.\n\nIOTA\n\nWhy would the blockchain be seen as a problem? It all comes down to scalability and there are three hot button issues: the tiny maximum number of transactions per second, coupled with the cost of storing an entire blockchain and the power hungry cryptographic computing required that may be required to maintain it.\n\nBitcoin, the original blockchain, is a system that allows for people to exchange cryptocoins in a peer to peer fashion. There is no Federal Reserve issuing Bitcoin, there is no FDIC insuring online wallet systems, by their very nature peer to peer systems do not have a central authority.\n\nThe fundamental difference between Bitcoin and any other digital artifact is the fact that the blockchain means only one person can have possession at a time. If I use my cell phone to take a picture of a cute puppy I meet at the park, I can send you a copy of that picture, and then the world is a little brighter for both of us. If I send you some Bitcoin, it disappears from my wallet and appears in yours. There are no counterfeiters in the Bitcoin universe, which is another way of saying that there is no “double spend problem”. There is a fee structure for transactions, it's both linear and transparent, but that doesn't make sense for IoT devices for many reasons.\n\nhttps://iotasupport.com/foundation.shtml\n\nDavid Sønstebø, cofounder of IOTA and blockchain veteran, described a few problems with blockchain infrastructure.\n\nIn 2014 Serguei Popov and I started exploring the internet of things and convergence between the Internet of Things (IOT) and Distributed Ledgers. The Internet of Things will be made up of billions of sensors and actuators communicating with each other, as well as purchasing things like data and energy. The blockchain does not scale for this use case, nor is it built to do so. You need to build second layer ad hoc channels, which will be fine for local implementations but not for ecosystems with billions of transactions a day.\n\nThe blockchain scalability problem revolves around how the system enables peer to peer transactions without double spending. It is a complex system that requires a high number of decentralized miners and nodes to verify the transactions. In order to maintain node decentralization, the number of transactions directly input into a block of transactions, mined every 10 minutes, must be limited. Through the decentralization of nodes, miners, or both, no single verifier has monopolistic power, which is a good thing. However, it comes at the cost of either having a limited number of transactions per second or needing to rely on second layer protocols or services to scale."", 'I explain why this is not really the case both due to the situation with Ether as well as the better option out there (Ripple/XRP).\n\nMany people see the return BTC has offered in the last 5 years and are looking for the next big thing.\n\nMy History With CryptoCurrency\n\nIt seems as though everyone and their grandma\'s know about Bitcoin today. With a price around $5600 at the the time of writing, and a price of only $60 as recently as 2012, it is easy to see why people wishing to invest are curious about the technology. I have been an investor in the cryptocurrency space since 2013. I first bought BTC for $60 back in 2012, and sold it after a few weeks for $120, only to watch it escalate to $600 mere days later.\n\nDue to my interest in the space and active trading of the crypto, I was fortunate enough to meet someone I was buying BTC with who little to my knowledge was quite prominent in the crypto community, Joe Lubin. Joe Lubin is the Co-Founder of ConsenSys, a decentralized blockchain technology incubator. I was lucky enough to meet with Joe in the spring before the Ethereum presale began, and he was kind enough to tell me about his project.\n\nAs a result of this encounter, I have been following Ethereum and Ether pretty much since the first public information was available about it (find my initial coverage about it on SA in March 2016 here and here). I watched the pre-sale for .80 cents a share, and watched it climb to $16 before I bought in, and sold at various point between $50 and $350.\n\nI have seen BTC whales make waves in markets, I have witnessed several hard forks, and I have studied and used cryptocurrencies for over 5 years now. While I am fascinated by the technology and excited about the use cases of blockchain, I see people with fundamental misconceptions about cryptocurrencies, their differences, and why they can make great investments. In this article, I will attempt to dis-spell some of this misinformation, as well as explain why XRP, the token supporting the Ripple network (owned by the company of the same name) is where investors should be putting their money right now.\n\nTop ten cryptocurrencies by market cap (Source)\n\nImportant Things To Consider\n\nFirstly, I would like to make it abundantly clear that none of these cryptocurrencies are meant to be an investment vehicle. They are not like a bond, where you are able to receive interest on your investment, they are not like savings accounts, and they are not like stocks. In Bitcoins case, there is nobody even technically in charge of the technology, and nobody guaranteeing anything in relation to it\'s worth, usability, or security.\n\nThe reason crypto\'s can make a good investment is that as adoption increases and demand increases, if it outstrips supply it will cause an increase in price. Just like any monetary system, if you only have a certain number of tokens of exchange, as the value stored in the system increases, the value of each token must increase in a linear manner to support the new value between the total sum of units. In order to keep a price relatively the same, as the total value increases, so must the number of units in circulation.\n\nSo Why Has Bitcoin Seen Such Insane Returns?\n\nThe reason BTC in particular has performed so well over the last few years is simple: it has a fixed number of units that will ever be in it\'s system. Essentially, as more people use Bitcoin, if they all store $100 in their own holdings, the price will have to go up for the entire market cap by $100 each time a new person enters the market. Similarly, if someone double\'s the value they are storing in BTC from $100 to $200, the market cap will have to rise by that amount, despite the same number of units existing. This is known as a deflationary currency, and is the opposite of how the USD system works.\n\nThis is not too far off from a pyramid scheme in the sense that the sooner you buy in, and the higher up the chain you are, the more you stand to benefit.\n\nWhile I am not bearish on Bitcoin for this reason, I still find it hard to fathom generous returns when each unit costs almost $6000.\n\nIt is worth noting there are several fundamental differences between BTC and ETH, of which I will briefly explain now before arriving to the main topic of this article, Ripple/XRP.\n\nDifferences Between Ether and Bitcoin\n\nEthereum was the first crypto to really differentiate itself from Bitcoin, and the first I really gave any attention to for this reason. Litecoin, for example, was more of less just a clone of Bitcoin, and DogeCoin was literally started as a joke with no real purpose behind it.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is an entire platform. For a deeper inspection of it\'s differences to Bitcoin, please visit my blog posts linked above. What I will reitarate here, however, are a few key things:\n\nIt has a central organization behind it. It has created an entire platform that runs on the blockchain technology, allowing for ICO\'s (Initial Coin Offerings as a method of funding instead of IPO\'s), and it has great potential with it\'s upcoming fork to move away from a proof-of-work mining backed system like Bitcoin to a proof-of-stake system. Further, it created a framework for ""smart contracts"", agreements that will be executed when certain conditions are met. If Bitcoin is ""digital gold"", then Ethereum is reinventing the underlying way the internet works. The central organization has the right to increase the supply of total Ether in circulation at any point in time.\n\nIt is this third reason that Ether is not as sure-fire an investment as Bitcoin, because it is not deflationary in nature. Without devoting any more time to Ether in specific, I would think it suffices to say that while I certainly experienced massive returns with Ether, and while I think it still has room to grow, all-in-all if you are not in already, you missed the boat. Once this technology matures and advances, it will stop experiencing the massive volatility it has undergone in it\'s infancy.\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are the two largest crypto\'s by market cap today. We have seen that Bitcoin benefits as an investment vehicle from having a deflationary currency, and that Ethereum is poised to radically change the way businesses are funded, agreements are made and executed, and much more than we can really fathom. To borrow an analogy from one of my previous posts, Ethereum right now is like the internet before websites. It is hard to even fathom the implications of what this technology will transform over the next decade.\n\nAll this background now brings me to what we have all been waiting for: The next big thing.\n\n(Image Source)\n\nRipple/XRP\n\nThe third largest cryptocurrency by market cap is Ripple, which is traded under the XRP ticker, currently hovering around a mere .26 cents a unit. XRP is backed by a company, named Ripple, that was started by several Wall Street finance executives in 2012. Ripple does not appeal to people who follow Bitcoin or Ethereum for their ""revolutionary"" nature and the possibilities that it could upend the banking system. In fact, Ripple is working with the banks. What Ripple\'s initial implementation will be is as a payment network, like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Square, Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook Pay (NASDAQ:FB), or any other network you can think of. It works like Bitcoin by having a decentralized ledger to track and verify all transactions, and is backed by a central group held responsible. It is also capable of scaling exponentially larger in transaction volume than Bitcoin or Ethereum, and is capable of processing each transaction in mere seconds.\n\nOn top of it\'s design supporting many transactions both quickly and securely, it is able to do so at a lower cost than the existing methods banks use today. As a result of this combination of offerings, Ripple is poised to be the primary service used to send some of the $500,000,000,000 remittance payments made each year. Currently, XRP\'s market cap stands at $10.25 Billion, representing over a 48x increase if all the value of the remittance market value was stored in XRP at once.\n\nOne of Ripple\'s biggest advantages of over Bitcoin in gaining this market is it\'s distancing from the criminal black market that made Bitcoin it\'s name. By being backed by traditional Wall Street types (and real people in general as opposed to the notorious ""Sotoshi Nakamoto"") and not providing for a criminal use-case, banks are much more open to utilizing blockchain technology. Plus, banks are logical, bottom-line drive enterprises. If they can send money faster, more cheaply and with increased liquidity they would be crazy to say no.\n\n(Image Source)\n\nThe Tipping Point\n\nI believe we are at the tipping point for XRP. In recent weeks, Ripple has announced their 100th banking partner signed up with an intent to use their Ripple Network for sending payments, as well as the first official announcement of the first actual deployment of the network. Due to the fact that XRP, like Bitcoin, is deflationary in nature with a set amount ever going to be in circulation (100,000,000,000 units), as more value get\'s stored in or even transferred through the Ripple Network, the price per unit will naturally increase. We are at the start of a snowball effect, where once one bank starts using Ripple, the average transaction volume will increase tremendously, as currently only speculative traders are buying and selling (or holding) XRP. Once all 100 of these banking partners come online, and the network is proven to be superior, many more banks will begin clamoring to sign up.\n\nCoupled with a recent incentive program introduced by Ripple to expedite adoption, it seems as though the culmination of the last 5 years of progress by the company is poised to really take hold in the coming months.\n\nCombined with uncertainty in the upcoming forks of Bitcoin with Segwit2x, BitcoinGold, and Ethereum\'s aforementioned move from Proof-of-Work to Proof-Of-Stake, the perfect storm is brewing for Ripple to take off among speculative traders, institutional investors and bank clients.\n\nAdditionally, the law of large numbers dictates it is much easier for the price to appreciate from .25 to $1.00 than BTC to go from $6,000 to $12,000. With Bitcoin paving the way for blockchain, Ethereum paving the way for Enterprise use of blockchain, and Ripple taking the best components of each and combining it with connections to the finance industry, Ripple will surely provide at least 100% returns in the next 5 years for anybody buying in below .30 cents.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ether are likely to provide additional gains long-term for those willing to buy and hold, their tremendous run-up has limited upside potential remaining and huge downside risk. Ripple, on the other hand, has quietly poised itself as the main contender to grab an enormous market, with potential to expand into IoT applications or other similar value transfer opportunities down the line. The fact that everyday consumers will be using XRP without ever owning or touching it themselves illustrates just how fast adoption could increase in a relatively short time as the Ripple Network comes online. Ripple is extremely difficult to obtain for the average investor at this moment, with not very many exchanges supporting it. This is the most obvious long-term winner in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIf you wish to receive more information regarding cryptocurrencies such as Ether, XRP or Bitcoin, please take a second to follow me so you can be notified of future articles.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Unlike bitcoin, however, it will not be possible for people to mine the virtual currency—the process of confirming cryptocurrency transactions and adding their record to the blockchain in order to generate new units of the currency.\n\nLocal reports cited by cryptocurrency news website CoinTelegraph revealed that CryptoRubles can be exchanged for rubles, though a 13 percent tax will be levied if the holder is unable to explain where the CryptoRubles came from.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n“I confidently declare that we run CryptoRuble for one simple reason: If we don not, then after two months our neighbors in the EurAsEC [Eurasian Economic Community] will,” said Russia’s Minister of Communications Nikolai Nikiforov.\n\nA spokesperson for Nikiforov was not immediately available for comment.\n\nREUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\nRussia’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, said in an interview last week that cryptocurrencies are a “fact of life” and hinted at his country’s plan to become more involved in the digital currency space.\n\nSiluanov said Russia planned to regulate the circulation, trading and mining of digital currencies in order to generate tax revenues and protect people and investors.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies are a fact of life,” Siluanov told CNBC. “We need to create a legal framework for these operations, we need to control these operations if these operations contravene the law, including money laundering legislation.""\n\nArtyom KorotayevTASS via Getty Images\n\nHe added: “The state cannot remain on the sidelines. The states sees all the risks that might arise during the purchase and sale of these cryptocurrencies, especially for the general public, who do not always have the requisite level of education.”\n\nSiluanov’s comments came just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were used for criminal activity and would therefore be blocked by the country’s central bank.\n\n“The usage of cryptocurrencies carries serious risks,” Putin said. “I know the central bank’s position on that. Cryptocurrencies are issued by an unlimited number of anonymous bodies. Thus buyers of cryptocurrencies could be involved in unlawful activities.”\n\nThomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty\n\nThe price of bitcoin has been consistently hitting new record highs for the past month and currently sits at $5,615 at the time of writing. This puts the market capitalization of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency at almost $100 billion.\n\nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin are currently distributed via decentralized blockchain protocols, however some investors have expressed support for a state-backed cryptocurrency. Morgan McKenney, an executive at investment banking group Citi, said in August that a central bank issuance would enhance the liquidity of new assets and give rise to new markets.\n\n“If you had a digital dollar, if you had a digital pound, exactly fungible with the note in your wallet and the dollar in your bank account, then you’d be willing to use that digital currency much more throughout your ongoing daily transactions, McKenney told CoinDesk.', 'Since he’s been running from the U.S. government, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange says he was forced to become an early investor in bitcoin—resulting in returns of over 50,000%.\n\nHe took to Twitter to gloat.\n\n“My deepest thanks to the U.S. government, Senator McCain, and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCad, Paypal, AmEx, Moneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010. It caused us to invest in Bitcoin—with > 50,000% returns.”\n\nMy deepest thanks to the US government, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCard, Payal, AmEx, Mooneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010. It caused us to invest in Bitcoin — with > 50000% return. pic.twitter.com/9i8D69yxLC — Julian Assange ? (@JulianAssange) October 14, 2017\n\nMany banking institutions, including Paypal and Bank of America, refused to process transactions for Wikileaks starting in 2010, when the organization leaked documents that revealed friendly fire and civilian casualties at the hand of U.S. forces during the war in Afghanistan.\n\nAfter being locked out from the traditional banking institution, Wikileaks said its revenue slid by 95% between late 2010 and mid-2011, costing the organization “tens of millions of pounds in lost donations.” Wikileaks claimed that it received the equivalent of over 800,000 euros (or $944,000 based on today’s exchange rate) in December 2010 alone. That slid to nearly $0 by January 2011.\n\nAssuming Wikileaks invested in bitcoin and did indeed receive over 50,000% returns, Assange would have received about $500 for each dollar invested. So had he put that entire 800,000 euros into the cryptocurrency, it would be the equivalent of about 400 million euros, or $472 million, today.\n\nIt’s unclear when exactly Wikileaks began its bitcoin investments, though it would have likely been in early 2011, when the coin hit parity with the U.S. dollar before rapidly accelerating in price. That was just a year after the first bitcoin exchanges appeared.\n\nIn recent months, the cryptocurrency has picked up steam, with bitcoin prices surging to about $5,700 thanks to growing optimism in the coin’s scalability. Still, it is no easy investment, with bitcoin prices capable of swinging hundreds of dollars over the course of a few hours.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story misstated the return Assange would have received for each dollar he invested in bitcoin. He would have received $500 for each dollar invested, resulting in a return of 400 million euros, or $472 million, from an initial investment of 800,000 euro. He would not have received $50,000 for each dollar invested, resulting in a return of 3.9 billion euro from an 800,000 euro initial investment.', 'Initial coin offerings – or ICOs – have become enormously popular with investors. They have raised more than $1.8 billion so far in 2017 and one recent ICO raised $35 million in under 30 seconds.\n\nBut they are proving unpopular with governments around the world.\n\nThe Chinese and South Korean governments have shut them down, while US regulators have issued a warning that ICOs may be subject to securities laws.\n\nThis is all part and parcel of the rise in cryptocurrencies in recent years. Bitcoin is the most famous, as the original and still dominant iteration. It was created as a form of digital cash, with a unique property: it is not backed by any bank or government. And it was specifically designed not to be centralized.\n\nFor this reason it has always had a certain lawless aspect to it and has become the currency of online digital crime. But it is also having a real moment – one bitcoin is currently worth more than $5,000.\n\nWithin the cryptocurrency space ICOs have become the favored way to raise funds in a manner akin to venture capital funding – but without any of the oversight normally found in that process.\n\nAvoiding the middle men\n\nICOs are typically built on the technology of another cryptocurrency called Ethereum. Created by a programming prodigy, 23-year-old Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum was designed as a “world computer” rather than simply a form of money.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a decentralized payment network with its own cryptocurrency (technically called Ether) that allows anonymous transactions to be sent across the internet without the need for a bank or other middleman. Instead, transactions are stored on the blockchain, a decentralized ledger.\n\nWhere it differs from Bitcoin is that, as well as allowing currency to run on its network, Ethereum can run all sorts of things including “smart contracts”, which are a form of digital contract that executes automatically once a certain set of conditions is met.\n\nICOs are built on these contracts. An ICO involves creating a marketable token (or coin) that can be purchased with existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin or Ether).\n\nThe investor effectively purchases digital tokens that can be used within a specified ecosystem. Take this made-up example: an ICO for a new online betting venture, “Conversation Casinos”, might issue coins, “Conversation Coins”, which investors could buy and then use to make bets in Conversation Casinos (which would only accept and pay out Conversation Coins).\n\nInvestors could also decide to hold onto their coins, speculating that the business will be successful, which will increase the demand for the coins and their market value.\n\nIn many ways, these tokens are not unlike the virtual currencies found in computer games like World of Warcraft and Second Life. They have a utility value, in that they are the digital venture’s medium of exchange (the money). But, often what attracts investors is the speculative value of tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges, rather than the originally intended use.\n\nDangers inherent\n\nThe ICO model has attracted scammers who lure gullible investors into ICOs that are unlikely to ever generate a return. And, since ICOs are completely unregulated, investors have no recourse should the project not deliver or simply disappear.\n\nSome ICOs do not allow citizens from certain countries, specifically the United States, to participate, in order to avoid coming under the radar of law enforcement agencies.\n\nThey are also subject to the volatility that blights cryptocurrencies in general. All cryptocurrencies and tokens are tethered to the price of Bitcoin, the coin that acts as the crypto-economy’s reserve currency.\n\nWhile the Chinese regulators did not explain why they banned ICOs, they were probably most concerned about the danger to investors, given the prevalence of ICO scams. And they probably should be banned if they are merely schemes to avoid securities laws that exist for good reason.\n\nNevertheless, it is clear that ICOs are an interesting innovation. They allow people without access to traditional investment opportunities a chance to invest in companies that appeal to them, without the requirement of a broker (and broker fees). In turn, this allows companies to bypass the traditional venture capital scene and to get their projects in motion quicker.', 'Etheruem\'s blockchain may now be in the process of upgrading to new software – but that doesn\'t mean notable developers aren\'t reflecting on the process that was.\n\nFor example, while the update appears to have been successful, at least one provider of ethereum software notably struggled with preparations for the rollout. As reported by CoinDesk, UK-based Parity Technologies, used by nearly 25 percent of the network, was beset with bugs through the weekend, a development that spurred speculation about last-minute delays.\n\nBut while that specter has been avoided, Parity founder and CTO Gavin Wood is now speaking out on the issues, citing the upgrade process as one that is rife with ""lessons to be learnt"" for the community of developers working on the second-largest blockchain by total value.\n\nIn response to requests for comment, Wood outlined his belief that it is perhaps too early to deem the so-called Byzantium code upgrade a successful one, noting the danger zone around a hard fork can extend for several days. Looking ahead, he said he feels that more foresight should be put into whether client software providers are ready to make the shift.\n\nWood told CoinDesk:\n\n""There needs to be a more conservative approach to the specification, development, testing and deployment for major protocol alterations like Byzantium... It should be ascertained to as great a degree as possible that all major implementations are in consensus before any determination of a hard fork block.""\n\nWood went on to use this most recent fork as evidence, describing it as a situation in which most software users were asked to make big upgrades with little time to do so.\n\nAs continued bugs were discovered, he said developers ultimately had to make a difficult choice, one of the reasons it remains to be seen just how smooth the rollout will prove.\n\n""It was really a choice between requiring most users change their software within 48-72 hours to postpone the fork versus possibly or probably requiring a particular subset of the network to update their software at a much shorter notice should a problem be discovered,"" he explained.\n\nBuilding on this, Wood went on to propose a number of changes he might favor, including scheduling retreats with various software providers or using smart contracts to ""dynamically postpone"" a problematic hard fork.\n\nStill, as these steps weren\'t taken this time around, he advised caution for those using the network in the days and weeks ahead.\n\n""I\'m generally optimistic that even if further \'zero-day consensus\' problems are found by our auditors and tools, we can roll out the antidote upgrades before they become problematic,"" he said.\n\nRachel-Rose O\'Leary contributed reporting.\n\nGavin Wood image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The answer, unsurprisingly, is not much.\n\n“Bitcoin is an attempt to replace fiat currency and evade regulation and government intervention. I don’t think that’s going to be a success,” Bernanke said on Monday afternoon in Toronto.\n\nWhile addressing a conference hosted by the blockchain firm Ripple, Bernanke described bitcoin as a “mostly speculative venture” that “hasn’t shown itself to be a real transactional currency.”\n\nHe also dismissed the idea, espoused by some die-hard bitcoin advocates, that the digital currency could be a rival to traditional government-controlled money.\n\n“Eventually governments will take any action they need to prevent [that],” he said.\n\nHis comments can be seen as a rebuke to some crypto-currency enthusiasts, who are skeptical of central banks and who recently photo-bombed the current Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, with a “buy bitcoin” sign:\n\nThe good news for crypto-currency fans is that Bernanke, who helped steer the U.S. through the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, is not down on all digital money.\n\nHe praised Ripple, which provides blockchain software to banks and has its own native currency (known as XRP), for working with regulators.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nBernanke also acknowledged that blockchain technology, which relies on disparate computers to create a tamper-proof ledger of transactions, holds considerable promise for global banking systems.\n\n“The Fed, the Bank of England, and Japan are very supportive of these technologies because they’ll improve payment systems,” he said, adding blockchain will be especially effective in expediting cross-border payments.\n\nBernanke also observed that a blockchain-style system might have averted last year’s debacle in which hackers exploited the SWIFT money transfer system to rob over $80 million from the Central Bank of Bangladesh.\n\nBernanke’s comments came in the context of a larger discussion of banking and economics with Gene Sperling, a former director of the National Economic Council, and adviser to Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\n\nHis other notable remarks included a prediction that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to dramatically reduce its balance sheet (“monetary policy works better if the balance sheet is bigger”), and an observation that the Trump Administration is unlikely to deliver major economic stimulus through tax reform.\n\nMeanwhile, the skepticism of bitcoin by Bernanke and other prominent financial figures like Jamie Dimon has done little to dent its price: the currency broke new records last week and is up five-fold from the start of the year.

For more coverage, click here.', ""The OG Ticker: Bitcoin and Hard Forks\n\nBitcoin has recently hit a new all time high, shattering the $5,000 barrier climbing up to over $5800 before settling back in the $5500s. Only two months ago, bitcoin went through a fairly big hard fork, in which a second currency was created: Bitcoin Cash. If you held bitcoin before August 1st, then you technically also hold an equal number of bitcoin cash coins. Bitcoin Cash is an alternative currency, though, and does not share the same value nor market capitalization that bitcoin does.\n\nWhat was this Hype About?\n\nSince BCH hit the markets as it’s own currency less than a quarter ago, it quickly rose to an all time high over $900 USD, at a market capitalization of just over $15 billion dollars. The market cap is now a third of that, along with the individual coin value, but most importantly trading volume is down an entire order of magnitude from the all time high craze.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Cash came about because of core disagreement within the bitcoin community. Bitcoin has a somewhat fuzzy beginning, thought to have been invented in 2007 by a mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper that started the current white paper ICO trend was published by this Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008, describing bitcoin as a solution to the double spending problem such that digital currency could not be copied. The first transaction occurred on the network between Satoshi and Hal Finney in 2009, and the rest is history.\n\n\n\nWith the hard fork that occurred in August, the community had to deal with a problem fundamental to the original bitcoin code. It was locked into 1 megabyte blocks. When combined with the hash difficulty completion rate of 10 minutes per block, this makes for a slow network at scale.\n\n\n\nWhen considering that a 1 MB block on average holds 1500 to 2000 transactions, it’s immediately visible the problem Bitcoin Cash is attempting to solve. If at the high end of that range the network is handling 2000 transactions every 10 minutes, that comes out to only 3 transactions per second.\n\n\n\nWhen you compare that to Ripple’s network, and most importantly Visa’s current transaction volume, Bitcoin pales in comparison to the thousands of transactions per second XRP & Visa can handle. Bitcoin Cash, though, is a possible solution: it raises the block cap from 1 MB of transaction data to 8, essentially adding an order of magnitude to the number of transactions held per block.\n\n\n\nAt the peak of Bitcoin Cash on August 19th, the USD trading volume was $4.3 billion. To get a picture of this in the transaction per second metric, some more math (assuming an average daily price of $750 for the peak day):\n\n\n\nAt it’s peak, BCH saw about 65 transactions per second, a lot better than the 3 of BTC, but still a far cry from Ripple and the credit card giants of today. The hard fork was definitely successful in accomplishing it’s goal of increasing transaction resolution speed, but that was not necessarily ever part of the core purpose of bitcoin. Currently BCH is handling ~7 transactions a second as the volume has dwindled significantly since August.\n\n\n\nAny hard fork is a decision by the development community to not decide: instead, let markets decide. It seems pretty clear so far that BCH is not doing so hot marketwise, albeit accomplishing real goals. Those goals, though, are the problem. Bitcoin was never meant to be a replacement for Visa. Making that comparison is equivalent to comparing transactions handled by Ripple’s XRP to trading silver. Bitcoin has a finite total number of coins, unlike fiat currency.\n\n\n\nWhen a US dollar bill becomes too old to be used in circulation, it stops circulating. Our government’s treasury oversees this circulation, appropriately removing currency unfit for use, printing new bills in exchange. Printing money is a dangerous game, do it too much and the value of each note drops to nothing. This is often reasoned about in terms of the metric of inflation.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is different because there is a maximum amount of Bitcoin to be had. One day not too far from now, BTC will have 0% inflation, because it will have hit its cap of 21 million coins. Like silver or gold, there is a finite amount of it to be had, but it’s not all been had yet. Unlike raw physical materials like precious metals, however, there is a definite time at which we will know no more Bitcoin will be minted. We may always find more gold in various environments, albeit less and less since the gold rushes of our forefathers. Currently there are about 4 or 5 million Bitcoins left to be mined, with more than 15 million coins already in circulation. It'd be silly to ever expect instant gold transaction handling, but that is exactly what BCH tries to do for Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what is happening with the upcoming hard fork of Bitcoin, then? Why is it called contentious?\n\n\n\nAfter almost no time at all since Bitcoin Cash forked into it’s own currency, a consortium of organizations have decided to go for another hard fork of the core bitcoin blockchain in November. Again trying to increase the core maximum block size from 1MB to 8MB, this move is once again against the core principles of bitcoin, just like BCH.\n\n\n\nThe danger here is that this hasty second attempt at a hard fork has major risks. Many believe that such a hard fork needs at least a year to prepare, not only to properly verify the code that will be handling billions of dollars of transactions, but also to understand if the change is fundamentally going to work for the benefit of Bitcoin. As of right now, it seems like it will not, and that instead this hard fork would directly benefit those supporting it, and not many others. The proposed changes puts more power into big mining pools’ hands. This moves the currency away from its decentralized goals by centralizing control of the blockchain into these big mining operations.\n\nWithout going into more technical debate, I personally strongly side with the bitcoin core group, represented by the original bitcoin site at bitcoin.org. Published just over a week ago, they have publically denounced the Bitcoin Gold contentious hard fork, and explicitly listed its supporters. Instead, the SegWit2X upgrade fork, planned for November, is what is under current preparation. I have already begun the process of moving my Bitcoin away from those exchanges, since I do not want to be stuck with Bitcoin Gold (or Unlimited, whichever it ends up being named) if they choose to forcefully honor their own fork.\n\nCheck the blog post yourself, and see if your exchange is on the list. If it is, be warned.\n\n\n\nAsk around about the hard fork, and make sure you are protected. Cryptocurrencies are as secure as you are with your information, and it is unwise to blindly trust that cryptocurrency is by default safe since it has cryptography in the name. Keeping encryption keys secure is actually quite difficult to do robustly, much more so than password security which we already all struggle with.\n\n\n\nIn short, be wary, a new bitcoin ticker is coming to cause some confusion. The original ticker BTC is where I'll be placing my faith, where will you place yours?"", 'If Bitcoin’s adoption as a functioning currency can expand there is a belief that it will put enough pressure on companies that have a monopoly on money transfers, forcing the price right down.\n\nCathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, believes that cryptocurrencies will become so valuable and widespread in the future that it will lead to all money transfers becoming free.\n\nFunding disruption\n\nWood, and her company, are known for funding disruptive technologies, and thus it is unsurprising that Bitcoin is something that has caught their eye.\n\nARK Invest manages $1.7 bln of assets in funds focused on disruptive technology. Prior to ARK, Wood spent 12 years at Alliance Bernstein as chief investment officer of global thematic strategies, where she managed $5 bln\n\nThe CEO said that because the internet did not come with its own built in payment system, Bitcoin is becoming it, and this solving a lot of issues.\n\n“Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are helping to solve that problem and cut out a lot of friction,” she said.\n\nA big cut\n\nCurrently, services like Western Union and PayPal are profiting from large cuts of monies sent cross border, and it is because there is very little competition or disruption that this continues.\n\nWood sees Bitcoin’s disruption as a savior for instances like these where migrant workers are trying to send money home but losing upwards of eight percent off of every $100 sent.\n\n""That\'s a huge cut, right?"" argued Wood. But if Cryptocurrency transfers can put pressure on traditional companies, those expensive transmission fees may not be around for much longer, she believes.\n\n""Right now, you pay the conversion fee from fiat currencies into Crypto and back again and those rates are 2 to 3 percent. That\'s a lot better already,"" she continued. ""But we think that the data is going to be so valuable that money over IP is going to be free because the transactions will be the information that companies want to get after.""']"
10/17/2017,"['It has been a year of highs for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. After surpassing the $5,000 mark, bitcoin is poised to surpass $6,000 next. (See also: Bitcoin Prices Hit Record High.) As of this writing, bitcoin is trading at $5,592.56. Cumulatively, it is up by 546% since the start of this year.\n\nA bunch of cryptocurrencies, including ethereum and litecoin, have imitated bitcoin’s trajectory and racked up gains ranging from 4,000% to 1,325% respectively. Besides the inherent dynamics of cryptocurrencies (there is a limited number of them in the market), other factors are at work in raising their prices.\n\nHere are two factors influencing bitcoin’s price right now.\n\nInterest From Institutional Investors\n\nA recent Bank of America report attributes the increased value of cryptocurrencies to interest by institutional investors. As financial services companies begin offering cryptocurrencies in custom products, Bank of America predicts that it could affect the “liquidity and market capitalization for such currencies.”\n\nEuropean institutions have taken the lead in designing new products using cryptocurrencies. For example, investors can track ethereum’s price using exchange-traded notes in Nasdaq’s Sweden exchange. Switzerland’s financial regulation authority has approved a product from Falcon Bank that enables its clients to trade in bitcoin. U.S. banks are following suit. (See also: Bitcoin Gets A Boost From Swiss Regulator.)\n\nGoldman Sachs is said to be considering bitcoin trading while JP Morgan launched a payment network based on ethereum’s blockchain yesterday. (See also: Goldman Sachs Considering Bitcoin Trading.) These moves could translate into another price increase across the board.\n\nInterest From Asia\n\nSouth Korea and China may have clamped down on bitcoin, but that hasn’t tamped investor interest in the cryptocurrencies. (See also: After China, South Korea Bans ICOs). According to reports, investors in both countries are paying a premium to invest in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In fact, some bitcoin trades through China’s OKCoin exchange have already surpassed the $6,000 value.\n\nSouth Korea’s regulation has resulted in limited numbers of cryptocurrencies and high demand. The result is that the Asian country has become the largest market for ethereum. Demand from Japan, which recognized bitcoin as legal tender earlier this year, could also drive up prices for cryptocurrencies. (See also: Bitcoin Gets Boost From Japan.)', 'On October 17, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies in the market including Bitcoin and Ethereum have recorded slight corrections in price, as the price of Bitcoin fell below $5,600 and Ethereum price dropped to $320.\n\nPrice Drop of Ethereum, Despite Optimism Surrounding Hard Fork\n\nYesterday, on October 16, Cryptocoinsnews reported that the market has responded relatively well to the Ethereum hard fork, as the price of Ether, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, increased to over $340.\n\nThe latest Ethereum hard fork, better known as the Byzantium hard fork, is expected to drastically enhance the Ethereum network in various ways. Specifically, the Ethereum Foundation and the open-source Ethereum development community has focused on improving the privacy measures and efficiency of the network, enabling users to transact private transactions with ZK-SNARKs and settle faster payments by removing unnecessary transactional data. As Mohamed Abedelmalik, the Executive Director of Columbia Blockchain Lab, explained:\n\n“Previously, each transaction’s receipt included the root of the transaction state tree. That is, the root of the Merkle tree immediately after that transaction was added to the tree. The state tree root, is one of the only dependencies one transaction has to other transactions in the block. By removing this dependency and adding several optional parameters, transactions can now be processed in parallel.”\n\nThe market anticipated another strong rally after the release of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s statement on the seamless integration of the Byzantium hard fork and the stability of the Ethereum blockchain network thereafter.\n\nBut, subsequent to recording an increase of $30 from $310 to $340, the Ether price declined to $320, as the cryptocurrency market endured a minor correction. The correction was likely caused by the four-day rally of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Still, the Ether price is substantially higher than its previous monthly peak at $305, which was achieved on October 12.\n\nThe price of leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to correct themselves after a significant surge or a strong rally.\n\nBitcoin Price Stabilizes at the $5,600 Region\n\nOver the past seven days, the price of Bitcoin has increased from $4,700 to $5,600, demonstrating a truly impressive rally within a short period of time. But, earlier today, Bitfinex, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world in trading volume that accounts for 10 percent of all global Bitcoin trades, announced its closure in the US.\n\nThe Bitfinex team stated:\n\n“As indicated in the announcement, we are terminating trading, deposits, and withdrawal functionality for U.S. individual customers by no later than November 9, 2017. U.S. customers are already barred from receiving financing from other users on Bitfinex’s peer-to-peer financing platform. This restriction will remain and, in addition, U.S. individual customers will no longer be able to provide financing on Bitfinex effective November 9, 2017.”\n\nIn the mid and long term, the exit of the Bitfinex trading platform from the US market could be considered as a positive indicator of growth, as Bitfinex, Bithumb, and BitFlyer, three of the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, are now all based in Asia. Specifically, Bitfinex is based in Hong Kong, Bithumb is headquartered in South Korea, and BitFlyer is located in Japan, three regions that have arguably the most practical and efficient regulatory frameworks out of all major Bitcoin markets.\n\nIn the short term, until the US Bitcoin market restructures, the Bitcoin price could remain in the $5,600 region as a consequence.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Russia could evolve into the next major Bitcoin market, as the government continues to encourage Bitcoin mining and moves closer towards regulating its cryptocurrency exchange market.\n\nRussia’s plan\n\nEarlier this week, Cointelegraph revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the launch of CryptoRuble, a cryptographically-secured state-issued national digital currency.\n\nMinister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov said:\n\n“I confidently declare that we run CryptoRuble for one simple reason: if we do not, then after two months our neighbors in the EurAsEC will.”\n\nSeveral analysts have speculated that the launch of CryptoRuble would likely lead to a nationwide ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, according to Putin, that is not the case and the Russian central bank has plans to regulate Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin explained that similar to other countries such as the US, Japan, and South Korea, Russia needs regulatory frameworks to oversee cryptocurrency trading and activities. However, he has no interest in banning digital currencies. Putin stated:\n\n“As is known, many countries are looking for ways of regulating the circulation of cryptocurrencies and are beginning to create the necessary legislative framework, a legislative regulatory system. We need – based on international experience – to build a regulatory environment that will make it possible to codify relations in this sphere, reliably protect the interests of citizens, businesses and the state and provide legal guarantees for using innovative financial instruments.”\n\nThis is a big change from a week ago, when Putin condemned Bitcoin for its potential criminal uses.\n\nRussia is eyeing the regulation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies instead of an outright ban in order to retain some measure of control. If Russia bans cryptocurrencies, most trading activities will move to over-the-counter (OTC) markets and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platforms, which are extremely hard to censor and regulate. With trading platforms equipped with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems, the Russian government can prevent the usage of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in illegal activities.\n\nThe Chinese government also recently issued a statement which implied that it is planning to introduce a national licensing program for cryptocurrency exchanges, as it fears cryptocurrencies being associated with criminal activities.\n\n... and take measures such as record-keeping, licensing, AML processes, real-name, limiting large transactions (3/3)https://t.co/QS8bJWXdAZ — cnLedger (@cnLedger) October 4, 2017\n\nEncouraging mining\n\nIn September, Alexander Drozdenko, the governor of the Russian Leningrad region, encouraged Bitcoin miners and mining facility operators to establish digital currency mining centers in the region to promote and encourage others to participate in the global Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nLocal news publications including 47News reported:\n\n“Production sites that are being released during the construction of new power units of the Leningrad nuclear power plant will be available for new residents as early as 2018.”\n\nDrozdenko also told local reporters in a press conference covered by Bitcoin.com:\n\n“As you know, the construction of LNPP-2 is being completed in Sosnovy Bor, and large areas of the first nuclear power plant are being liberated, adding that this site may be of interest to cryptocurrency miners.”\n\nIf Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency exchange markets in Russia demonstrate an exponential rate of growth supported by regulatory frameworks released by the Russian government, Russia could evolve into the next major Bitcoin market in the long term.', 'The crypto markets have exhibited mixed performance during the early portion of the week. The bitcoin price continued to hover near its all-time high on Tuesday, climbing just enough to crack the $5,700 barrier. The ethereum price, meanwhile, lost ground following the successful deployment of its much-anticipated Byzantium hard fork.\n\nAltogether, the markets rose about $1.5 billion for the day, although the non-bitcoin market cap fell by about $1 billion. Yesterday, the total crypto market cap was $172.4 billion, This value declined throughout the day — along with the bitcoin price — briefly dipping as low as $169 billion. However, the markets saw a significant bump at 6:00 UTC on Tuesday, enabling them to climb to a present value of $174 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Cracks $5,700\n\nSince surpassing the $5,000 mark last week to set a new all-time high, investors have been watching the charts with anticipation to see whether the bitcoin price would hold above this historic level or contract to a lower threshold. Thus far, bitcoin has managed to avoid a pullback. Despite dipping below $5,500 on several occasions, the bitcoin price has consistently recovered to the $5,600 mark. On Tuesday, the bitcoin price extended this recovery a bit further, climbing above $5,700. At present, the bitcoin price is trading at a global average of $5,733, which translates into a $95.3 billion market cap.\n\nSeveral analysts predict bitcoin could rise into the $6,000 to $7,500 range by the end of the year, but its short-term trajectory will be heavily dependent on the outcome of the contentious SegWit2x hard fork.\n\nEthereum Price Wanes After Byzantium\n\nThe ethereum price broke out of its slump in the days immediately preceding the activation of Byzantium, a hard fork intended to upgrade the Ethereum protocol. After hovering near $300 for some time, the ethereum price rose as the hard fork approached and briefly spiked to $348 after it was activated. However, despite a seemingly-successful activation, the ethereum price has tapered off since the fork, perhaps indicating that traders had already priced it in.\n\nAt present, the ethereum price is trading at $327, which represents a daily decline of 4% and translates into a $31.1 billion market cap.\n\nAltcoin Markets Mixed\n\nThe altcoin markets were a mixed bag for investors, with most of the significant movement occurring at the top of the charts.\n\nThe ripple price declined 6% following the first day of “Swell”, a fintech conference hosted by Ripple. XRP investors are convinced the startup will make a major announcement that will cause the ripple price to increase, and they already priced in the expected news — at least to some extent. If the conference passes without an announcement of a major banking partnership, or something similar, the ripple price is likely to decline further.\n\nThe bitcoin cash price, in contrast, surged by 12% on Tuesday, making it the best performer of any top 30 cryptocurrency. Bitcoin cash is now trading at $350, which gives it a market cap of $5.8 billion.\n\nThe impetus for the rally appears to be Bitcoin.com’s announcement that it considers bitcoin cash to be the true “bitcoin” and may alter the name and ticker symbols it uses to refer to other chains. The website — which is owned by bitcoin cash proponent Roger Ver — is not an official source for bitcoin news or information, but some argue that it presents itself that way to new users, and it ranks well for the Google search term “bitcoin”.\n\nThe remaining top 10 cryptocurrencies exhibited little movement for the day. The litecoin price declined 3% to $62, while dash and monero each dipped a bit more than 1%. NEM and bitconnect held near their previous-day levels, and NEO rounded out the top 10 with a 3% increase to $28.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Backed by strong volumes out of Asia, the price of bitcoin cash jumped to a two-week high today.\n\nAt press time, the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate is $390 – up 25 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 24 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is still nursing a 5 percent loss.\n\nStill, today's move is a jolt for the cryptocurrency, created via a hard fork of the bitcoin blockchain in early August this year. As bitcoin cash was awarded to investors who owned bitcoin before the fork, its built-in investor base helped catapult it to big volumes out of the gate.\n\nHowever, bitcoin cash is arguably still in a period of price discovery – the digital asset clocked a record high above $970 on Aug. 19 before falling to $280 levels on Oct. 9.\n\nThe spike seen today is largely a volume driven. As per CoinMarketCap, the rally appears to have been fueled by Korean desks offering BCH/KRW pairs.\n\nVolumes on Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in South Korea, have jumped by 41%, a development that itself has become a notable trend as cryptocurrencies have seen big boons off listings in the region.\n\nLooking ahead, though, an open question is does this rally have legs?\n\nPrice action analysis suggests bitcoin cash could test the psychological level of $400 in the short-run.\n\nDaily chart\n\nThe chart above shows:\n\nA base building around $300 followed by a big move higher to $390 on the back of strong volumes.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) is sloping upwards in favor of the bulls.\n\nStochastic favors further upside in BCH prices as well.\n\nThe trend line sloping downwards from Aug. 20 high and Sep. 20 low is seen offering resistance around $400 levels.\n\nView\n\nA break above the descending trend line hurdle of $400 would mean the sell-off from the record high has found a bottom at $280 levels. The cryptocurrency could then revisit Sept. 19 high of $550.\n\nThe odds of a bullish break are high, given the prices have seen an upside move on the back of strong volumes following a long period of congestion around $300 levels.\n\nOn the downside, only a break below $300 would abort the bullish view on the daily chart.\n\nHorses running via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His pretext is the same, evading regulation and government intervention. It is surprising that after creating two bubbles that burst and one that we are currently sitting on, central bankers still believe that regulation is the way ahead.\n\nNevertheless, the unregulated WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange tweeted that his organization made a staggering 50,000% return on investments in bitcoin.\n\nThough it is difficult for us to match the returns generated by WikiLeaks, let’s try to at least make a beginning.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nTraders who had purchased bitcoin at $4150 on our earlier recommendation are sitting on about 36% gains within a few days. We suggest traders to sell another 25% of their positions at the current levels and hold only 25% with a stop loss of $5400.\n\nBut why not sell the complete position at the present levels?\n\nBitcoin has risen vertically from about $4816.31 to $5883.63 in four days. Since then, the cryptocurrency has traded in a small range of $5444.75 to $5883.63, forming a pennant, which is a bullish set up.\n\nIf bitcoin can breakout to new highs above $6000, it can rally to $6512 and thereafter to $7193. The target objective is a good 15% and 26% higher than the current levels.\n\nOn the other hand, if bitcoin corrects, it can fall to $5470.97, which is the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $4135.09 to $5883.63. Below this, a fall to $5215.69 is also possible.\n\nOur stop loss is just below the support at $5470. If the digital currency falls and hits our stop loss, it will result in a loss of 4.7% in profits from the current levels. In order to gain a possible 15% return, we are risking 4.7% of immediate gains, which is a good risk to reward ratio of 1:3. Hence, we believe that traders should keep some position to ride the next leg up, if it materializes.\n\nETH/USD\n\nEthereum has been swinging wildly in the past few days, making large intraday ranges in the build up to its hard fork. Now that the event is behind us, chances are that volatility will be back to normal.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we had recommended traders to go long on a breakout of $317. The first profit objective was $354.\n\nEthereum came within a whisker of our target, as it touched $353 on October 16. Hopefully, traders would have trailed their stops higher and would have gained from the above trade.\n\nPresently, the digital currency is retracing the breakout levels of $315. It also has a trendline support at the same level. Therefore, $315 is likely to act as a strong support. We expect ethereum to again bounce from the $315 levels. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions on a rebound from $315 and keep a stop loss of $295, which is below both the moving averages and below the low of the breakout bar on October 11. The first target objective remains $354.\n\nThe cryptocurrency will become negative once it falls and sustains below $295.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nWe had suggested a trade in litecoin on a breakout above $58. This also turned into a profit, as it came within a whisker of our target objective of $71. The digital currency reached a high of $70.466 on October 15.\n\nSince then, litecoin has been in a correction.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has a strong support between $57 to $59 levels from both the critical moving averages and the previous resistance of the range, which will now act as a support.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency bounces off this level, it is likely to again gain momentum and resume its uptrend. However, traders should wait for a confirmation of a resumption of the uptrend before entering long positions, as litecoin has been weak during the pullback. It has not even crossed above the 50% Fibonacci retracement levels of the falls from $93.649 to $32.681 in September.\n\n* All the market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has revealed it may consider tokens issued through initial coin offerings (ICOs) as commodities.\n\nA publication released today by LabCFTC, a fintech initiative within the US regulator, covers the basics of the technology as well as a number of use cases.

Without such a safeguard “any transaction sent on either of the chains may also be sent on the other chain (‘replayed’), leading to the high potential of users losing funds.”\n\nFor its wallet’s users, “an alert will be prominently displayed on the main screen,” the post continued. “The alert will prompt the user to apply replay protection to their [holdings].

Thanks."", ""Miles Johnson OCTOBER 17, 2017 63 Fear of missing out, or “fomo”, is often said to be one of the most powerful psychological forces in finance. As retail investor interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has surged, investment professionals have often cast confused and disapproving looks towards what many believe is a wild and speculative bubble. In a year when the price of bitcoin has risen almost fivefold to beyond $5,500, there are signs of tentative interest from mainstream finance. The question is whether cryptocurrencies are gradually being accepted as a legitimate asset class, a cynical attempt to cash in on a bubble or a mix of both. Ami Ben David, co-founder of venture capital fund Spice, argues that there has been a noticeable shift in the attitude of traditional finance towards cryptocurrencies in the past 12 months, driven by “fomo”. “A year ago they didn’t know about it, six months ago they thought it was a scam and now they realise they simply just don’t understand it and are starting to get nervous and want to learn about it,” he says. “There is definitely an element of fomo. People have been told by their advisers, ‘Don’t touch it! It’s a bubble!’, and now they are upset they might have already missed it.” Once met with bafflement in financial circles, bitcoin appears to have graduated to even being discussed as a fully fledged “asset” in some of the more rarefied offices of Wall Street and the City of London. Share this graphic Last week the bosses of both JPMorgan and Citigroup were asked questions about bitcoin, while the white-shoe law firm Davis Polk was moved enough by client demand for more information on cryptocurrencies to organise a telephone briefing on the topic. “In our practice we’ve seen fund managers busy looking for ways to satisfy growing investor demand for this asset,” Joe Hall, partner at Davis Polk, said on the call. One London-based private banker describes how they have been having a growing number of requests from ultra-high net worth clients who are curious about investing in cryptocurrencies who would never have considered it a year ago. “It is getting to a point where we can’t ignore the interest,” they say. “We don’t want our clients to go near this stuff, but we will have to find a way to make it available if they keep asking”. Bitcoin’s existential crisis Play video But debate continues between sceptics, often from traditional backgrounds in banking and money management who believe the new world of cryptocurrencies will come crashing back down to earth, and true believers who proclaim that bitcoin and associated technology will revolutionise finance. Regulators round the world are also taking a harder line over cryptocurrencies, a point underlined last week when Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink said governments would crush bitcoin before long. The finance chiefs also argued at a conference in Washington that the only real value in bitcoin is as a tool for criminals and money launderers. While many investors remain convinced that bitcoin is a mania that will end in tears (a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of investors concluded bitcoin was the most crowded trade in the world today) a growing number of better-known figures in finance have gone public to say they are at least dabbling in the area. Share this graphic Mike Novogratz, a former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress and a figure on Wall Street, recently announced that he had not only made what he appeared to suggest was at least a $250m profit from buying bitcoin and ether, but that he was also trying to launch a dedicated hedge fund to trade cryptocurrencies. However, Mr Novogratz also has displayed the opportunistic cynicism of a trader in his approach to bitcoin, happily predicting a speculative gold rush rather than the value of bitcoin would rise based on its justified fundamental value. “This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes,” he said in a recent television interview. “You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.” Recommended Big Read: Silicon Valley’s cryptocurrency boom Bears target ways to bet on bubble bursting Lex on bitcoin and tulips Kyle Bass, a well-followed hedge fund manager who made money betting against subprime mortgage, has also reversed his previous scepticism about bitcoin and now believed that it was now “here to stay”. In spite of growing acceptance that investors and bankers need at the very least to learn the basics of the wild world of cryptocurrencies and the block chain technology that underpins them, few are any closer to developing a plausible way in which to value these highly volatile coins. And many still remain far from convinced, in spite of growing curiosity they see around them. “Bubbles nearly always occur when there is something new, or relatively new in the economy,” UBS’s wealth management team wrote in a briefing to clients last week, invoking one of history’s most famous speculative manias. “Change, by definition, creates uncertainty about the future. The tulips of the 17th century were new and exotic”. ‘Crypto’ hedge funds spring up in crowded field Ari Lewis was a high school student in Long Island, New York, when he bought his first bitcoin in 2012. It cost less than $10, he recalls. This May, as the price of a single bitcoin climbed towards $2,000, Mr Lewis graduated from Ohio’s Case Western Reserve University with a business management degree and a new job: co-founder of a small cryptocurrency investment fund called Grasshopper Capital. Eight wealthy people invested a total of $2.2m, lured by the soaring value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Earlier this month, Mr Lewis was claiming a 90 per cent return between August and the start of September because of extreme short-term volatility. Since then bitcoin has dropped 15 per cent. He said he could not discuss his current returns but reiterated: “We are long-term investors.” According to Mr Lewis, there was not much competition six months ago. “Now\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it seems like everyone and their mother are starting a fund.” Many of the new cryptocurrency funds that have sprung up call themselves hedge funds, but few have the infrastructure or level of experience to qualify as such, neither have they attracted many sophisticated institutional investors or shown signs they are doing much to hedge their long positions. UK research outfit Autonomous NEXT has counted 68 crypto hedge funds. Their strategies range from investing in “initial coin offerings” — which raise money by selling investors digital tokens in exchange for cryptocurrencies — to holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Litecoin. According to a quarter of the 200 global fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently, bitcoin is also the world’s most crowded trade, leaving many vulnerable to a switch in the market. Vítor Constâncio, vice-president of the European Central Bank, last Friday called bitcoin “an instrument of speculation” and said its sharp rise in value was akin to the 17th-century tulip craze. Yet despite the uncertainty, new fund managers have piled in. “I feel like we’re in those Wells Fargo wagons travelling west,” said Zach Hamilton, an early investor in cryptocurrency Ripple. Mr Hamilton opened a long-only hedge fund, General Crypto, to outside money in early 2017. He declined to disclose assets under management, but said the fund was targeting $25m. Mr Hamilton said he and his California-based partner invest based on the companies behind the cryptocurrencies. “We’re trying to strip away all of the speculative value,” he said. “I love crashes. That’s great for me.” Some funds report returns that any hedge fund manager would dream of. The Altana Digital Currency Fund was up about 413 per cent this year to the end of August. In comparison, hedge funds of all strategies have returned about 5.5 per cent in the year to the end of August, according to the data provider eVestment. At the same time, some regulators now have their eye on whether the spiralling value of cryptocurrencies is entering bubble territory. There is also the question of whether swings in these volatile markets leave poorly hedged funds at risk. Olaf Carlson-Wee's Polychain Capital is one of the leading proponents of cryptocurrency potential, with a $250m hedge fund © Bloomberg China has already banned ICOs and its biggest bitcoin exchanges are closing. UK regulators have raised a warning flag and earlier this month Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, called bitcoin “a fraud”. A few cryptocurrency funds have been backed by institutional investors, lending some credibility to the sector. Polychain Capital, which invests in cryptocurrencies and ICOs, has a $250m hedge fund, according to founder and chief executive Olaf Carlson-Wee. Some of Silicon Valley’s best known venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia, have invested. Other Silicon Valley names include Meta Stable, a hedge fund originally opened in 2014 and worth $60m in gross assets, according to regulatory filings. It was co-founded by Naval Ravikant, chief executive of start-up website AngelList. Pantera Capital, an institutional bitcoin investor, set out to raise $100m for an ICO hedge fund earlier this year. Some of the smaller funds that have emerged cater to family offices and wealthy individuals, and are geographically diverse. Solidus Capital, a crypto hedge fund that holds funds offshore and currently has its headquarters in Mexico City, opened to family offices and high net-worth individuals from the Latin America region in May. It holds six types of cryptocurrency with third-party custodians, but also does some limited margin trading during major macroeconomic events, and plans to offer a vehicle for ICO investment. Carlos Mosquera Benatuil, a Solidus general partner originally from Venezuela, declined to disclose assets under management, but did say that the passive strategy offered to outside investors had returned some 25 per cent to date. The founders of BitSpread, a London-based fund with offices in Singapore and San Francisco that runs a market-neutral, arbitrage strategy in bitcoin, began trading their own money in 2014. It returned about 200 per cent over three years, according to chief executive Cedric Jeanson. Since opening to outside capital on May 9 this year, BitSpread manages about $20m and is up 27 per cent to the end of August, it said. The fund intends to expand from 15 to 25 staff by December, according to Mr Jeanson. But some of the biggest names in hedge funds remain unconvinced, from Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund Bridgewater, to legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson. Of bitcoin, Mr Robertson said: “I’ve never understood it and I don’t think I’m going to.”"", 'News\n\nHuobi the cryptocurrency exchange based in China announced its Segwit2x contingency plans for the firm’s trading platform Huobi Pro.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Traders waiting for a pullback in bitcoin’s price to rebuild positions in the world’s largest cryptocurrency may have the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to thank.\n\nIn a primer on the asset class published Tuesday, the agency said virtual “tokens” used in initial coin offerings can come under CFTC oversight, a message that a market averse to scrutiny did not take well.\n\nBitcoin fell as much as 8.4 percent, its biggest loss in almost a month, to as low as $5,109.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has already said tokens from some ICOs can be securities under its oversight. “There is no inconsistency between the SEC’s analysis and the CFTC’s determination” from 2015 that virtual currencies are commodities, the CFTC said.\n\nIf September’s price plunge is any guide, losses on bets that bitcoin will fall within U.S. regulatory jurisdiction could be short lived. Bitcoin was quick to shrug off China’s move to tighten its grip on trading, extending an eight-fold increase over the past year to a record high of $5,866 on Oct. 13.', 'Is Bitcoin benefiting from the recent crackdown on initial coin offerings (ICOs)?\n\nAccording to several analysts, the answer to this question is yes.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees, and for some, the situation is a bit more complicated than a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" reply.\n\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nICO Crackdown\n\nIn recent months, ICOs have become the target of growing scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including China, South Korea and the United States.\n\nChina banned these token sales in September, and later that month, the country\'s three largest exchanges announced that they would soon stop offering local trading.\n\nSouth Korea soon followed China\'s example, banning all ICOs and citing its concerns about fraud and ""speculative demand,"" according to Business Insider.\n\nBoth of these nations prohibited these token sales after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that sales of digital assets were subject to U.S. federal securities laws.\n\nBitcoin Benefits\n\nWhile these developments might create challenges for companies holding ICOs - or investors who have purchased their tokens - they are providing tailwinds for Bitcoin, according to several analysts.\n\nBecause these token sales are getting banned and/or regulated globally, it encourages people to hold Bitcoin instead of alternative protocol assets (altcoins), said digital currency trader Marius Rupsys.\n\nDue to the uncertainty that surrounds new ICOs, investors are selling altcoins and instead purchasing Bitcoin, he added.\n\nJonathan Johnson, president of Medici Ventures and Overstock.com board member, offered a similar point of view.\n\n""When China cracked down on ICOs and coin exchanges, investors that needed to get out of the exchanges had limited choices,"" he stated. ""Many saw Bitcoin as a good place to go.""\n\nSafe Haven\n\nInvestors often flock to Bitcoin as a safe haven, noted analysts, and the sharp increase in scrutiny surrounding ICOs is a perfect example of a situation that could motivate them to purchase the digital currency.\n\n""I think that any time there is a macro event in the blockchain instruments space, there will be a flight of capital to the more stable crypto currencies,"" said entrepreneur Marshall Swatt.\n\nAmid this broader trend, Bitcoin could easily benefit, as its use as a safe haven asset has been growing, Sean Walsh, partner at Redwood City Ventures, asserted.\n\n""The faith in this relatively young asset has grown at a breathtaking pace in recent months,"" he said.\n\n\'A Dynamic Market\'\n\nWhile some analysts contended that Bitcoin is benefiting from the crackdown in ICOs, others described the situation as being a bit more complex.\n\n""It\'s a dynamic market with several forces at work,"" stated Matthew Unger, founder and CEO of iComply Investor Services inc. As a result, it\'s not just a matter of Bitcoin vs. altcoins, he asserted.\n\n""I wouldn\'t say that market participants are flocking to Bitcoin, it appears that Bitcoin has just weathered this recent storm differently than other digital assets and currencies,"" said Unger.\n\nRobin Bloor, senior VP of strategy & communications for software provider Algebraix Data, stated that while Bitcoin is benefiting from the greater scrutiny of ICOs, this is only part of the story.\n\n""Some investors are running scared of some of the Altcoins, particularly coins whose utility is questionable,"" Bloor asserted. However, he emphasized that the broader digital currency market has recovered nicely since its total value hit a recent low in mid-September.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin\'s recent appreciation may largely be the result of new money entering the market, stated Bloor.\n\nICOs Still Going Strong\n\nWhile some analysts agreed that the ICO crackdown has helped provide tailwinds for Bitcoin, others disagreed with this premise.\n\nTim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, emphasized that investors can still participate in ICOs.\n\nIqbal Gandham, UK managing director of social trading platform eToro, provided similar input.\n\n""ICOs are still raising money,"" he stated. ""There is concern as with everything related to regulation."" The recent scrutiny of these sales might make ""a few people"" weary, but it is not preventing market participants from investing, said Gandham.\n\nGrowing Pains\n\nWhile the recent crackdown on ICOs may have caused some turmoil for the industry, several analysts have predicted that in the long run, digital currencies will benefit from more regulation.\n\nOliver Isaacs, a tech entrepreneur, is in this camp.\n\n""While in the short term the Chinese crackdown on ICOs has resulted in a fall in the price of Bitcoin, I think overall the crackdown will most definitely have a net positive effect on Bitcoin in the long run,"" he said.\n\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.', 'A group of Latin American Bitcoin businesses and entities has issued a joint letter expressing “deepest concerns” over SegWit2x.\n\nThe letter, signed by around 50 supporters from the Brazilian and Argentinian Bitcoin space, went live on Medium Wednesday.\n\nThe collective “opposition” to the forthcoming Bitcoin hard fork is the the latest to come from the industry, which has already seen exchanges and others signal public condemnation.\n\nLast week, South Korea’s largest Bitcoin meetup released a similar open statement denouncing SegWit2x.\n\n“We do believe the NYA signatories have the best of intentions in attempting to improve Bitcoin’s protocol, and we also recognize the invaluable service historically provided by the companies and the talented individuals associated with S2X,” the Brazilian-Argentinian letter reads.\n\n“We profoundly disagree, however, with the means chosen to carry out such a plan. And therein lie all the discord, controversy, feverish debates, and even resentment for some actors.”\n\nThe group provided what it calls a “non-exhaustive” list of eleven factors influencing its decision, many of which match with reasons given by both South Korea and exchanges confirming they will not support any Bitcoin chain split.\n\n“We believe sooner or later upgrades to the protocol will necessitate a hardfork,” the letter continues.\n\n“With due planning and preparation the network can smoothly coordinate to effectuate such changes with minimal chances of chain split and disruption. That, however, requires time, education and testing.”\n\nBitcoin was down 8% Wednesday as the market appeared to correct from the unanticipatedly large gains last week.', 'Bitcoin may have had a tough September, but it appears to be turning a corner and is demonstrating its resilience in the face of obstacles.\n\nThat’s according to Germany’s public international broadcaster.

Yet, while the market appears to be moving in the right direction, DW questions whether this period of uncertainty is over.\n\nAccording to Kenneth Rogoff, professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University, while governments are allowing the sector to grow he thinks that digital currencies will eventually be regulated.\n\nJapan is one example of where this could happen. In April, the country made changes to its legislation acknowledging cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a legal form of payment. However, Rogoff believes Japanese authorities could change those laws due to money laundering risks.\n\nHe added:\n\nGovernments cannot and will not tolerate large-scale anonymous transactions indefinitely through any virtual currency.\n\nInstead, he thinks that governments will issue their own digital currencies.\n\nRussia is one country that is considering its own national cryptocurrency. On Monday it was reported that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, had called for a state-issued digital currency, called the CryptoRuble. This comes at a time when Putin has said that the market poses ‘significant risks‘ and that Russia will regulate the mining and supply of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDubai has also revealed that it will be developing its own blockchain-based cryptocurrency, called emCash.\n\nWhere to Now?\n\nWith reports circulating that China will resume digital currency trading by licensing bitcoin exchanges, it’s possible the the currency’s value could rise to new heights.

In October 2012, one unit of Bitcoin cost just over $10. Today, the price is over $5000. Anybody who had several Bitcoins and hung onto them during this period will have big grins on their faces. Of course, the Bitcoin market is incredibly volatile, with several booms and busts during this time. Also, Bitcoin, in particular, has come under constant attack with regulators looking to put a lid on its growth. Meanwhile, the likes of JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have also hit out at Bitcoin, calling it a fraud. Bitcoin may be experiencing a massive bubble, but it’s becoming increasingly more difficult to ignore. And in this below piece, Dwaine van Vuuren interestingly looks at the kind of returns South Africans could have made in recent times if they put away 5% of their equity investments in Bitcoin. – Gareth van Zyl\n\nBy Dwaine van Vuuren*\n\n(NOTE: This is an excerpt of a module from the Sharenet Crypto Bootcamp seminars that have been running in Cape Town and Johannesburg.)\n\nQuite often we have referred to 1% to 5% exposure to Bitcoin (or Crypto) as being prudent for traditional equity investors. The value varies depending on what article you read, but this is typically the maximum exposure to any one mid-cap or large-cap share in a reasonably diversified share portfolio.\n\nThe argument is that the potential upside for Crypto (in an ideal world where everything goes right) far outweighs the maximum 1-5% downside to your investable assets (assuming your whole crypto investment goes to pot). Now of course there is the argument that Crypto is speculative and not an investable asset but there are strong arguments both for and against this, so we will not debate this point here. Instead let’s show how a small bit of Bitcoin could have boosted your investment portfolio.\n\nThe main response from many investors is why bother with a 5% exposure to Bitcoin (for example) when looking at one’s investable assets. This normally comes from people who do not understand the asymmetric nature of Bitcoin returns relative to traditional assets. The best way to demonstrate this is to look at the returns of two portfolios, one solely invested in the J200 (TOP40) via a SATRIX or equivalent ETF, and the other which is an initial investment of 95% J200 and 5% Bitcoin. The returns are shown below, taking daily closing LUNO exchange prices:\n\nSince May 2015 (the farthest date back we have been tracking LUNO prices) a JSE investment would have returned a frustrating 10.88% (excluding dividends) whereas if you had just allocated 5% of your initial holdings to Bitcoin, your total returns would have been a stunning 107%\n\nAnd there is the asymmetry in its full glory. A conservative 5% initial speculative crypto component to your portfolio delivered outsized overall returns. And if Bitcoin had completely blown up, at most your equity would be 5% poorer. This is a massive risk/reward ratio. The rewards are outsized compared to the potential maximum risk. What’s not to like about this?\n\nNow there is a valid argument that the investor who followed this strategy would be left sitting with a portfolio heavily weighted toward Bitcoin assets. In fact, the 95%/5% ratio would have migrated to 50%/50% as shown below:\n\nIf your objective was great risk-adjusted returns then this 50/50 weighting will not bother you. But the risk profile of the portfolio has obviously changed substantially given Bitcoins 50% weighting now. For those wanting the Crypto exposure not to deviate too far from 5%, a more prudent approach would be to regularly rebalance your assets to maintain that 95% stocks to 5% crypto balance. We have shown the results below based on annual rebalancing:\n\nWith annual rebalancing, to ensure Bitcoin doesn’t dominate more than 5% of your exposure, would have yielded a 45% return against the JSE’s 11% return. This is still a huge difference. You increased your returns 4-fold by risking 5% of your equity. Asymmetrical poetry.\n\nThe chart below shows how your percentage exposure to JSE stocks and Bitcoin would have fluctuated during this strategy, with rebalancing to bring stocks back in line with 95% exposure every June. You can see the rebalances when the JSE allocation spikes up sharply to rejoin the 95% mark, when you sell your Bitcoin profits and move them into more TOP40 exposure. Also, you can see that with the annual rebalancing strategy, your crypto exposure in the portfolio would not have exceeded more than 19%\n\nWhat about quarterly rebalances? An example is below where we can see returns drop slightly from 45% to 35% over the same period.\n\nRebalancing monthly hardly makes any changes to the quarterly rebalancing method’s returns in the above example, and given the higher transaction fees we do not see any merit in rebalancing more than quarterly. The chart below shows how your percentage exposure to JSE stocks and Bitcoin would have fluctuated during this strategy, with rebalancing to bring stocks back in line with 95% exposure every quarter (at the vertical lines.) You can see the rebalances when the JSE allocation spikes up sharply to rejoin the 95% mark, when you sell your Bitcoin profits and move them into more TOP40 exposure. Also, you can see that with the quarterly rebalancing strategy, your crypto exposure in the portfolio would not have exceeded more than 11% before being rebalanced back to 5%\n\nNow this strategy presumes Bitcoin will continue its rise. For the last year our regression forecasting model has held fast, and if it continues to hold fast we should finish up 2017 with $7,000 a Bitcoin, or North of R90,000 per coin.\n\nTo summarize, a little bit of Crypto exposure, 1-5%, coupled with quarterly or annual rebalancing can go a long way to supercharging your investment returns. On the assumption that the Crypto assets are appreciating much faster than the JSE assets, then your JSE account will be subject to continual purchases whilst your Crypto exchange account will be subject to continual disposals to realize profits and fund the JSE purchases. This isolates any tax events to your Crypto exchange account. And on that point, please note that tax deductions for profits realized on the Crypto assets disposals and dividends on your JSE portion were not taken into account on the above exercises.\n\nDwaine van Vuuren has a BSc (Hons) degree majoring in Computer Science and is a full-time trader, global investor and stock-market researcher.

As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has shed 7.37 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, BTC is up 9.9 percent, while month-on-month it is flashing 29 percent gains.\n\nStill, with prices having jumped above $5,000 (the previous all-time high) on Oct. 12, what we are witnessing today might be best considered a healthy correction, courtesy of overbought technical indicators.\n\nFor example, demand for bitcoin jumped last week, reportedly on speculation that the hard fork in November may benefit buyers with the creation of new cryptocurrency (as in August when investors were allotted newly created bitcoin cash).\n\nDip demand during this period, if observed, would add credence to the record rally and indicate that the base in bitcoin has shifted higher to $5,000.\n\nSo, will the cryptocurrency hold above $5,000 mark?\n\nThe price action analysis suggests bitcoin needs to regain the bid tone quickly, else the odds of a break below $5,000 would rise.\n\nDaily chart\n\nAs noted in the previous updates, a combination of an overbought relative strength index and stochastic indicators has yielded a technical correction.\n\nIn the previous four occasions (marked by red circles), bitcoin prices dropped well below the 10-day moving average.

10/19/2017,"[""Having witnessed a solid recovery from the low of $5,100 in the last 24 hours, bitcoin is once again trading on the front foot and looking northwards.\n\nAt press time, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate was roughly $5,700. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has gained 6.47 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, BTC is up 4.77 percent, and on a monthly basis, it is carrying 45.7 percent gains.\n\nSo, is the bitcoin price eyeing $6,000? Strong dip demand would seem to suggest so.\n\nThe drop to $5,100 witnessed yesterday turned out to be healthy correction as expected, and the subsequent 'V' shaped recovery could be taken as an indication cash is waiting on the sidelines for a good opportunity. Further, the potential (or perceived) benefits of holding bitcoin ahead of the hard fork in November could also bring in more buyers, leading to higher prices.\n\nHowever, short-term overbought technical conditions persist. Therefore, the price action analysis suggests there is merit in being 'cautiously bullish' on bitcoin.\n\nDaily chart\n\nThe above chart shows:\n\nWednesday's candle was a 'Dragonfly Doji.'\n\nThe relative strength index is still overbought.\n\nHigher lows pattern (as indicated by a rising trend line & Wednesday's sharp rebound from $5,100) is still intact.\n\nView\n\n'Dragonfly Doji' is candlestick pattern with a long lower shadow (also known as long wick or long tail or long leg) and without a real body and upper shadow. The long tail indicates dip demand, while the dragonfly doji indicates indecision among traders.\n\nIn this case, the price action on the following day generally decides the short-term outlook. The fact that bitcoin is well bid today indicates the bulls have been able to carry forward the strong move from the low of $5,100. Thus, prices may jump above $6,000 if the bid tone remains intact over the next few hours.\n\nOn the other hand, a negative price action today would confirm a bearish doji reversal. A bullish-to-bearish trend change is likely only below $5,000 (rising trend line support).\n\nSky ladder image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Additionally, bitcoin has rivals in digital currencies such as ethereum, monero and dash, whereas gold doesn’t have alternative competitors, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank also claims that gold ‘is clearly better at holding its purchasing power, and has much lower daily volatility.’\n\nThese comments come at a time when Goldman Sachs has said that it is considering launching a bitcoin trading operation. Earlier this month, it was reported that the bank was in the early stages of planning an entry into the cryptocurrency market. Such a move would make it the first major Wall Street bank to get involved with bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nHowever, Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, is still sitting on the fence as he’s yet to reach a point where he’ll endorse or reject the digital currency. According to the CEO, he’s ‘still thinking about bitcoin.’ Yet, while this is the case, the bank has admitted that cryptocurrencies are getting ‘harder to ignore.’\n\nThat’s certainly the case with current trading prices. The market has recently experienced a surge in trading with bitcoin currently valued over $5,700. Yet, despite this critics remain. Most notably, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who has called bitcoin ‘a fraud,’ in the past, claiming that it’s ‘worth nothing.’\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'So here is the thing that most people don’t understand is going on when it comes to crypto currencies, Bitcoin, Blockchain, and especially ICO’s.\n\nMany people are star-struck with the gains made in 2017 with $2 bln invested into ICOs and think this is a breakthrough moment. Let me tell you it is not. We haven’t seen anything yet as 2018 will dwarf 2017 advancements by a factor of x10 or x20.\n\nIn 2018 there will be $20 bln to $25 bln invested in ICOs and it won’t stop there as the major pieces start to fall into place as the real big game unfolds. Then kaaaaBOOM!\n\nHeading to trillion\n\nThe market cap if crypto will explode and pass $500 mln, and start to head to $1 tln. But how - I hear you say? Simply through institutional money, which is ready, willing, and able to pile in.\n\nSo what happens to the price of crypto, to BTC? Doubles, trebles and more…overnight. The crypto indexes will polarise into securities that tokenise assets as well as equities, and those that don’t, with app tokens that are products and services.\n\nHow do I know? All we have to do is create the conditions. We have done just that, a new approach to ICOs starting from the perspective of regulation and compliance where we are able to meet the needs of institutional investors, which opens the flood gates.\n\nNew factors now come into play\n\nFractional Reserve Banking will continue to fall apart aa QE further devalues fiat currency and erodes spending power. More and more people will buy into crypto as the people look for safe havens.\n\nRussia, Japan and other sovereign nations will issue a full central-backed cryptocurrency that will be fungible against BTC and the leading cryptos.\n\nA new range of Blockchain/crypto funds will offer investors the opportunity to buy the market and reduce underlying volatility. Market actors make it more attractive for investors to get involved in crypto, where even a small strip will boost any portfolio’s performance.\n\nThe planets are aligning very fast as all assets and especially equities will be tokenised which will displace the Ponzi scheme VC boys once and for all, and ICOs take over as the preferred method to raise capital.\n\nThe shift is coming sooner than you think… be ready!

We oppose NYA and support #Bitcoin — Whalepool (@whalepool) October 18, 2017\n\nSegWit2x is encountering more opposition as its network snapshot date nears. This week, both Korea’s largest Bitcoin meetup and a group of Latin American businesses and personalities also issued their formal opposition.\n\nBy contrast, some industry entities have openly embraced the hard fork, with Xapo confirming it was willing to rename the 2x chain ‘BTC’ should it receive suitable support.\n\nNOB2X currently includes close to 100 signatories including well-known exchanges such as Kraken and Localbitcoins, media outlets and scam alert resource Bad Bitcoin.\n\nThe latter of these caused a stir last month when it removed Roger Ver’s Bitcoin.com from its safelist of trusted sites, later pinning it to the top of its ‘Alerts’ due mainly to Ver’s strong advocacy of alternative Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash.\n\nMeanwhile, November’s second hard fork, known as Bitcoin Gold, has attracted barely any attention at all, its network snapshot due to take place around October 25.', 'Now collectors can bid in Bitcoin. Photo: Roslan Rahman/AFP\n\nItalian auction house Sant\'Agostino said on Wednesday that bidders at its next sale will be able to settle up in Bitcoin, a world first according to the auctioneers.\n\nEarly next week, around 600 Italian and foreign design objects, mostly pieces of furniture, will go under the hammer at Sant\'Agostino and ""Bitcoins will be accepted as payment"", the Turin auction house said in a statement.\n\nPaying with the crypto currency will also be allowed at the following auction at the end of November which will feature paintings, jewellery and watches.\n\nBitcoin is not generally recognised as a proper currency – lacking a home country, central bank or treasury – although its real world use is constantly increasing.\n\nIt is traded through blockchain technology, which publicly records transaction details including the unique alphanumeric strings that identify buyers and sellers – technology which is gaining increasing currency among banks and companies.\n\nSince its creation in 2009, the value of Bitcoin against traditional currencies has risen exponentially, although there have been periods of dizzying plunges, too.\n\nIt broke through the $5,000 level for the first time last week, having surged from $966 since the start of the year.', 'The crypto markets bounced back on Thursday following a significant contraction the previous day. The bitcoin price led the charge, rising more than 6% to put the $5,700 barrier within its sights, while the ethereum price ticked up 3% to $309. Unfortunately, the recovery was not comprehensive, and some cryptocurrencies — including ripple — continued to decline.\n\nThe downturn forced the total cryptocurrency market cap as far down as $156.5 million, which represented a one-week low. However, the markets began to recover Wednesday afternoon and quickly rose above $160 billion. They continued to climb leading into Thursday morning and have since risen to a present value of $169.7 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Bounces Back\n\nWednesday’s bitcoin price decline caught many investors by surprise, and it was difficult to ascertain what caused it, other than that traders were taking profits following last week’s rally. The pullback put severe downward pressure on the bitcoin price, which fell as low as $5,151. However, bitcoin held firm at this level, and support gradually began to return, enabling the flagship cryptocurrency to mount a successful recovery. Ultimately, the bitcoin price posted a single-day return of 6%, bringing it to a present value of $5,679, which translates into a $94.5 billion market cap.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Above $300\n\nThe ethereum price experienced a single-day recovery as well, although its performance was not quite as impressive as that of bitcoin. After dipping as low as $291, the ethereum price managed to fight its way back across the $300 threshold. Ethereum is currently trading at $309, which represents a 24-hour recovery of about 3%. Ethereum now has a market cap of $29.4 billion.\n\nAltcoins Eye Generally Recovery\n\nAltcoins lost ground to bitcoin on Thursday, which saw its dominant market share rise about 1% to 55.7%. However, the majority of altcoins experienced recoveries against the value of USD, adding about $2 billion to their combined market cap.\n\nBut there were some significant outliers. In fact, three of the top 10 cryptocurrencies posted negative movement for the day, and the worst performance belonged to ripple. XRP holders had expected Ripple to make a major announcement during “Swell”, a conference hosted by the fintech startup. However, nothing materialized — at least not of the caliber they were expecting — causing the ripple price to add to its losses from yesterday. At present, the ripple price is $0.212, which represents a 24-hour decline of 7%.\n\nFourth-ranked bitcoin cash also posted a minor decline, causing it to tick down to about $334. Several major bitcoin cash proponents — including Roger Ver and Calvin Ayre — intend to start a campaign to assert that “bitcoin cash is bitcoin”, so it will be interesting to see if this has any lasting effects on the trajectory of BCH.\n\nThe litecoin price, on the other hand, rose by 8%. This advance pushed it back over the $60 threshold, and litecoin is currently priced at $61. This translates into a market cap of $3.2 billion.\n\nDash added 3%, but it was unable to climb past the $300 mark, while NEM surged by just under 10%. NEO declined 3% after weathering the Wednesday downturn quite respectably, and bitconnect rose by 8% to $201. Monero rounds out the top 10 with a 1% increase, which was just enough to inch above the $90 barrier.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin exchange-traded funds are coming, helped by the emergence of derivatives on the digital currency, according to industry executives.\n\nDon Wilson, founder of Chicago-based trading powerhouse DRW Holdings LLC, said on a panel at the Futures Industry Association annual conference in Chicago that it seemed obvious that futures and options will lead to an ETF. His view was echoed by others who spoke at the event Thursday.\n\n“Once a derivative is launched, a bitcoin ETF will follow,” Wilson said in an interview after the panel discussion. “That’s the common wisdom.”\n\nRead More: With No ‘JPMorgan of Bitcoin,’ Exchanges Struggle to Win Trades\n\nThere are plans for bitcoin derivatives. LedgerX won U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission approval in July to offer options, while Cboe Global Markets Inc. wants to create futures this year or early in 2018, pending CFTC approval. There is currently no way to trade derivatives on bitcoin or other digital currencies in the U.S. right now, a roadblock for traders who want to hedge positions.\n\nCreating an ETF on bitcoin has been a much harder task. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a bitcoin ETF proposed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in March, saying the exchange that wanted to list it couldn’t enter into necessary surveillance-sharing agreements given that “significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated,” according to the agency. The exchange was owned by Bats Global Markets Inc., which has since been acquired by Cboe -- meaning Cboe might one day offer both futures and an ETF on the currency.\n\n‘Reasonable Assumption’\n\n“It’s a pretty reasonable assumption” that a bitcoin ETF is coming, said Michael Mollet, managing director of product development at the Cboe Futures Exchange. “People are looking for something fresh and new in the ETF space,” he said. “Whether there’s huge demand for it, we would find out. Certainly people are going to try it.”\n\nAn ETF would give retail investors as well as institutions an easy way to get exposure to bitcoin, compared with buying or selling it on digital exchanges and holding it on a wallet secured to the blockchain, the software ledger that powers bitcoin and its cousins.\n\nBobby Cho, a trader at DRW’s Cumberland Mining unit, said that within the next 12 months, “We can confidently say an ETF will come to market.”\n\nEven though LedgerX has received the go-ahead from the CFTC, it’s not clear if they have begun to offer options trading. Asked if the exchange had started, Juthica Chou, a co-founder and chief risk officer, said, “I’m not authorized to talk about it.”\n\nCFTC’s View\n\nWhile the CFTC has signed off on bitcoin options, its views are a bit more nuanced regarding its role in regulating spot trading in bitcoin. The SEC said earlier this year that many new cryptocurrencies, known as ICOs or initial coin offerings, appear to be securities that must be registered with the agency. Investors have poured more than $3 billion into ICOs this year.\n\nCFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz said Wednesday that ICOs may also be considered a commodity. He spoke a day after the CFTC issued a primer on digital assets and the blockchains that support them. The regulator classified bitcoin as a commodity in 2015, but hasn’t done much on the topic since, Quintenz said.\n\n“It was right to classify it as a commodity, but we still have a lot of work to do,” he said yesterday to reporters at the FIA conference. “ICOs, these things can transform. They may start their life as a security from a capital-raising perspective but then at some point -- maybe possibly quickly or even immediately -- turn into a commodity.” His comments were some of the most specific from the CFTC on the nature of ICOs.\n\n“There are new challenges all over the place with virtual currencies and commodities,” Quintenz said.\n\n— With assistance by Benjamin Bain', 'From next year, Australians will no longer have to pay goods and services tax (GST) on cryptocurrency purchases.\n\nFollowing the passing of new legislation in the country\'s parliament today, the long controversial ""double taxation"" of cryptocurrencies – first when buying it, then later when buying items subject to the tax – is finally coming to an end.\n\nThe situation arose from the previous law, enacted in 2014, which treated cryptocurrencies as bartered goods for GST purposes – legislation that quickly received criticism from technology advocates, and last year saw pledges from government officials to rectify the issue.\n\nThe Australian Senate Economics References Committee proposed a review of the situation this August, and the Treasury Department first set out new legislation to resolve the issue in May\'s budget.\n\nWith the passing of the new bill, as of July 1, 2018, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will now get the same GST treatment as foreign currencies, The Australian reports.\n\nThe move comes amidst a larger, international conversation about the tax treatment of blockchain-enabled assets, and the various approaches regulators can (or should) take.\n\nAs recently as this summer, advocacy groups have taken aim at U.S. tax law for its application of property law in a 2014 ruling, though individual states appear to be proving more progressive on the matter.\n\nAustralian parliament image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'The Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high Friday, breaking $6,000 for the first time on all the major cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAs of 4 p.m. Friday, Bitcoin was up about 7% over a 24-hour period, trading at as much as $6,060. At that level, Bitcoin’s total market value is now more than $100 billion, easily exceeding the market cap of Goldman Sachs (gs).\n\nThe surge comes just a week after Bitcoin reached a record price for the first time in more than a month, surpassing $5,800 after rising as much as $1,000 in less than 48 hours. Until then, Bitcoin had traded well below its previous high of $5,000, which it briefly touched in early September before retreating 20% over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin initially breached the $6,000 threshold Friday morning at only one exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, where investors can buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. After remaining just a few dollars shy of the mark at other digital currency exchanges such as Coinbase, which is headquartered in San Francisco, Bitcoin officially crossed the milestone on all trading venues just as U.S. stock markets closed Friday.\n\nThe bounce comes just two days after a Russian economic official derided Bitcoin as “worse than casinos,” prompting its price to drop as low as $5,174 on Wednesday. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has risen 16%. Over the past 10 days, it has gained more than 24%.\n\nThe cryptocurrency’s rally comes despite other disparaging comments by influential figures including former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke (who suggested this week that Bitcoin would fail) as well as criticism by J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nStill, Bitcoin bulls are setting their sights on the potential release of a Bitcoin exchange traded fund, a product that would trade on the regular stock market, opening up the digital asset to a broader array of investors. One attempt to launch a Bitcoin ETF was rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year, but plans for others are in the works. A representative for Digital Currency Group, the investment firm backed by entrepreneur (and Bitcoin advocate) Barry Silbert, said last week it was currently in talks with the SEC about launching its own publicly traded product, despite withdrawing its application for a listing last month.\n\nAlso, cryptocurrency investors are preparing for another Bitcoin hard fork next week, in which enthusiasts are planning to split off a second version of the digital currency known as Bitcoin Gold. The last time a Bitcoin hard fork occurred was in August, when a new currency called Bitcoin Cash was created from the original Bitcoin blockchain. In the wake of the fork, both the price of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash soared, making some investors see the next split as a buying opportunity to end up with two currencies for the price of one.\n\nThe Ledger is a Fortune project focused on the intersection of tech and finance.', 'For the first time, Mastercard is offering the ability to send money over a blockchain rather than by swiping a credit card.\n\nAfter developing its own version of the bitcoin technology over the past couple of years, Mastercard (ma) announced Friday that it is now opening up its blockchain to certain banks and merchants as an alternative—and potentially more efficient—method of paying for goods and services.\n\nIn a sign that mainstream adoption of the technology underpinning cryptocurrency is increasing, Mastercard is the second Fortune 500 company this week to begin facilitating blockchain payments. On Monday, IBM (ibm) revealed that it had also begun processing payments over its own proprietary blockchain between banks in the South Pacific.\n\nLike IBM, Mastercard is also targeting cross-border payments between businesses as the primary purpose for its blockchain, which can only be used by invitation. The Mastercard blockchain, however, differs from the tech giant’s in an important way: While the IBM blockchain only transmits money in the form of Lumens, a virtual currency created by the non-profit Stellar, Mastercard’s blockchain operates independently of a cryptocurrency, and instead accepts payments in traditional local money.\n\n“We are not using a cryptocurrency, and we are not introducing a new cryptocurrency, because that introduces other challenges—regulatory, legal challenges,” says Justin Pinkham, a senior vice president at Mastercard Labs, who leads the credit card company’s blockchain initiatives. “If you do a payment, then what we can do is move those funds in the way that we do today in fiat currency.”\n\nThat also stands in contrast to the normal ways blockchains have typically been used until now—where they act as a ledger of transactions in the specific cryptocurrency to which they were tied, such as bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOn the other hand, Pinkham says, Mastercard has one advantage that the bitcoin blockchain doesn’t have: A settlement network that includes 22,000 banks and financial institutions around the world. (IBM has announced 13 banks that it plans to include in its network.) After all, Pinkham adds, companies still predominantly rely on government-issued currency to do business, making it impractical to convert cash into cryptocurrency, or vice versa, for each blockchain payment. “Even in the bitcoin system you need a bitcoin exchange that could exchange bitcoin for euro, so it creates some complications,” Pinkham says.\n\nMastercard hopes to provide the benefits of blockchain technology—including a more secure and transparent way of making and tracking payments—within the existing financial system, without the hassle of digital currency. “What Mastercard brings to the table here is a unique combination of that blockchain capability and Mastercard’s settlement network,” Pinkham says. (Rival credit card provider Visa, for its part, has partnered with the blockchain startup Chain to develop its own system for similar business-to-business payments.)\n\nFor one, businesses could cut costs by using the blockchain to send cross-border payments, which usually pass through several foreign banks on their way overseas, racking up fees along the way. Mastercard’s blockchain, however, could cut out those middlemen and connect a purchaser’s bank directly to that of the supplier, remitting the payment more efficiently and possibly faster, Pinkham says. (Although the transaction itself will register on the blockchain instantaneously, the funds are still moving through the same system Mastercard uses now, meaning there won’t necessarily be an improvement in speed, he cautions.)\n\nA number of corporations have already signed up to use Mastercard’s blockchain, Pinkham says, though he declined to name any of them. Besides payments, Mastercard envisions that companies could use its blockchain to track the movement of pharmaceuticals as well as luxury goods such as handbags and diamonds, thereby reducing fraud by providing “proof of provenance.”\n\nBut consumers won’t be able to pay with the Mastercard blockchain instead of plastic, at least not anytime soon, he says. Nor does he see bitcoin as a threat to Mastercard in general. “Quite frankly, we feel that card payments are simple, safe and easier to use—and better meet the needs of consumers—than, let’s say, a cryptocurrency payment,” Pinkham adds.\n\nSo far, the evidence suggests that’s true. Despite the surge in the bitcoin price, which hit a new record surpassing $5800 last week, the number of major online retailers accepting payment in bitcoin dropped to just three this year, compared to 483 who accept Mastercard and Visa, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThis article is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance.

All he wanted to do, he said, was create “cutting edge technology” and build something “that would make me exceptional.”\n\n“I got carried away,” Lebedev said, adding he realizes now “there are no shortcuts.”\n\nLess Time\n\nNathan gave Lebedev considerably less time than the maximum of 10 years recommended by U.S. sentencing guidelines, finding he was neither a leader nor a mastermind, and noting he had no criminal history.\n\n""He did what he was told to do,"" Nathan said.\n\nThe man giving the orders was Coin.mx’s operator, Anthony Murgio, who was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in June. He pleaded guilty in January and said he ran Coin.mx for the hacking scheme’s main Israeli architect, Gery Shalon, the self-described founder of a criminal enterprise that stunned Wall Street.\n\nProsecutors said the unregistered exchange sold bitcoins that were used in illegal online transactions and as payment in ransomware attacks. Lebedev’s role was to set up an array of servers that Coin.mx used to process its transactions, a critical element of the scheme that required constant attention to avoid detection by the banks, the U.S. said.\n\nTo help dodge regulators, Lebedev also conspired with his boss to bribe a New Jersey pastor to let them take over a credit union that was run out of a church, and use it to help legitimize the exchange’s operations. The scam eventually ruined the business, which is liquidating.\n\nBetter Life\n\nIt’s all a far cry from Lebedev’s goal of creating a better life for himself in the U.S., according to court papers. Born in Russia and raised in Ukraine, he was abandoned by his alcoholic father when he was 8 and raised by his scientist mother. After winning awards in biology, math and physics, he was selected to move to the U.S. as an exchange student at age 16.\n\n""America has been given a genius from the Ukraine,"" his math teacher said at the time, according to defense filings.\n\n""Yuri, with his mother’s support, made the brave decision to move to the United States -- without having a single relative or acquaintance in America -- in order to improve his life,"" his lawyer said.\n\nLebedev moved in with a host family in Georgia, according to court papers. After high school he double-majored in physics and computer science at Valdosta State University, and obtained post-graduate degrees including a Masters of Science and Physics from Florida State University, court papers show. He met his wife at college. They have three children.\n\nComplex Web\n\nLebedev’s attorney, Eric Creizman, cited the wide-ranging nature of the scheme to portray his client as a husband and doting father who got caught up in something too big for him to recognize. In court papers, he described Lebedev as an ""unlikely criminal defendant.""\n\nBut prosecutors used the idyllic life Lebedev had built against him in seeking a tough sentence, saying he wasn’t like criminals who needed money or had other such motivation to break the law.\n\n""He basically could have ridden out the script for his life,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Won S. Shin said at the sentencing. People in Lebedev’s position ""are even more culpable.""\n\nFamily and friends sent letters to the court supporting Lebedev, all of which described him as a man devoted to hard work and to his children. His host family said Lebedev tutored their child in math, while a college pal relayed how Lebedev washed dishes to avoid using a credit card for living expenses.\n\nShalon’s global network allegedly stole information on more than 100 million customers of banks and publishing firms and generated hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds from pump-and-dump stock scams and online gambling.\n\nMurgio operated the exchange with Lebedev from about 2013 to 2015 through a front company, the Collectables Club Private Member Association, which lists Murgio’s West Palm Beach address, court papers show. At Murgio’s sentencing hearing, he wept and said he’d ""screwed up badly.""\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Murgio, 15-cr-00769, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).', 'Gold/Silver vs. Bitcoin Comparisons: A No-Brainer... or Brainless?\n\nBy David Smith: For most of the year, as Bitcoin soared, crashed, and soared again, cryptocurrency vs. physical gold-silver talking heads engaged each other in heated rhetoric about which of these venues is here to stay.\n\nSome of the biggest names in finance, government, and the newsletter analyst space have made comments that – to be charitable – appear less-than-fully informed. Comments like ""Even though bitcoin could rise to $100,000, it\'s still going to zero!"" don\'t offer much insight. Some other questionable assumptions:\n\n2017 percent price change comparisons: Relating this year\'s gold and silver\'s price range to that of bitcoin misses an important point. Yes, bitcoin (BTC) has risen by a much greater percent, but it\'s also fallen more. I don\'t recall gold dropping 40% this year, which bitcoin has... on a couple of occasions.\n\nTrash-talking gold and silver as ""antiquated"": Bitcoin is now considered legal tender in Japan, but at this time, its primary function is for use in the purchase and sale of the 900+ ""alt coins"" currently available.\n\nMost of these exchange entries in the crypto-space are not really ""currencies"" at all and will never trade as such.\n\nRather they are ""coins"" or ""tokens"" digitally created and circulated to raise seed money, via initial coin offerings (ICOs) in order to solve some business application in a blockchain-connected manner. Many have no trading volume – possibly because the market is skeptical of their business plan – and have become more or less ""dead"" coins.\n\nAt present, a relative few have an actively trading market. Investors have dropped literally millions of dollars into scores, if not hundreds of entrants which have appeared on the scene like dragon\'s teeth, in many cases only to see volume dry up soon thereafter.\n\nAt present, digital apparitions can be created and marketed by just about anyone. The following example demonstrates how easy it is (for now), and how gullible some people really are.\n\nCan I interest you in a “Useless Ethereum Token”?\n\nEarlier this year, the ""Useless Ethereum Token"" (UET) was ""announced"" online. The ""Issuer"" wrote:\n\nYou are literally giving your money to someone on the Internet and getting completely useless tokens in return. There are no \'whitepapers,\' no \'products\', and no \'experts\'. It\'s just you, me, your hard-earned Ether, and my shopping list.\n\nYou would think this blatantly-stated scam would elicit exactly zero response, yet reportedly, the UET \'Project"" was able to raise more than $60,000!\n\nBy the same token, it\'s a safe bet that many Venezuelans wish they had traded some of their bolivares fuertes (""strong Bolivar"") notes, rendered worthless over the last few years, for a few ounces of silver – or a single ounce of gold – which could now purchase respectively, six months of food, or a house.\n\nBecoming a victim of ""default bias"": We all have a tendency to operate through a lens which uses the past as a default setting.\n\nWe keep doing what we know, avoid taking new risks, and resist changing the way we think.\n\nDefault bias can cause lost opportunities – whether it involves learning about the blockchain or being hesitant to buy precious metals when they\'re in boring ""wear you out or scare you out"" sideways action (another David Morgan homily) ... as they\'ve been lately.\n\nDismissing Bitcoin as ""just digital"": Kim Iskyan (Stansberry Churchouse Research) addresses the criticisms leveled at bitcoin and the blockchain. Responding to the charge that it\'s “purely digital,” he notes that fully 90% of all the money – or as David Morgan refers to it, ""paper promises"" – that exist around the world today are not physical either!\n\nDoug Casey is always one to see beyond the next investment valley (or country), and he pegs what most people miss when they argue that bitcoin is ""bad"" for the future of precious metals. As he said,\n\nWhen people buy these cryptocurrencies, even if they know nothing about hard money, economics, or monetary theory, they inevitably ask themselves, “Hmm, Bitcoin or the dollar?” They’re both currencies. Then they start asking questions about the nature of the dollar…the nature of inflation… and whether the dollar has any real value, what’s going to happen to it, and why.\n\nPeople start asking themselves these questions – which wouldn’t have occurred to them otherwise... and it\'s going to make them very suspicious of the dollar. It’s going to get a lot of people thinking about money and economics in a way they never thought about it before. And this will inevitably lead them to gold...\n\nWhat I am doing: In addition to staying very active in metals and miners, I have placed ""small money"" into several coins and tokens having viable business models in hopes of making an asymmetric profit.\n\nIn spite of the current turmoil, I remain steadfast in the belief that the next few years will see gold and silver trading several times higher than their nominal 2011 prices of $1,900 and near $50 respectively. The blockchain is here to stay. As for bitcoin, only time will tell.\n\nWe may even see digital coins and tokens backed by precious metal. But these changes in the crypto space will not replace them. Indeed, gold and silver will almost certainly – to the surprise of many bitcoin bulls – markedly increase demand.\n\nI plan to continue holding the majority of my investible funds in gold and silver.

But there\'s no inherent right or wrong price for bitcoin. You could say, \'What\'s the fair value?\' You know: \'I\'m an investor; I like to think about the fair value of stocks of bonds.\' I can\'t answer what\'s the fair value for bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. For that reason, I\'m not an owner.""\n\nThis is not the first time Turnill has expressed concern with cryptocurrencies. In July, he referred to the cryptocurrency market as ""scary"" based on then-recent market moves.\n\nDespite his concerns about cryptocurrencies, however, Turnill praised blockchain technology in general, saying the tool will likely be increasingly used.\n\nBlackRock has already begun ""starting to use blockchain,"" according to BI.\n\nImage via YouTube / Bloomberg TV\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nGrowing Interest\n\nBitcoin has managed to enjoy these continued gains as the broader digital currency space continues to draw interest from a wide range of players.\n\n""Bitcoin and crypto space is getting a lot of interest from people and institutions,"" stated digital currency trader Marius Rupsys.\n\nRyan Rabagalia, head trader for Octagon Strategy, also weighed in on this growing visibility.\n\nHe asserted that while ""Bitcoin\'s recent surge can be attributed to a multitude of factors,"" ""none are quite as evident as the astounding amount of attention it\'s getting in the media.""\n\n""Big names continue to pour in and positive sentiment has never been higher,"" Rabaglia emphasized.\n\nA Major Milestone\n\nSurpassing $100 billion in total value represents a major milestone for Bitcoin, and this development could both fuel greater media attention and also motivate more investors to consider digital assets.\n\nRising above this milestone ""is definitely something to report,"" said Rupsys.\n\n""I would agree that it would encourage more investments into the space for particular investors,"" he stated.\n\n""Many people heard of bitcoin but did not get in, so hearing that crypto space grown this much will likely to catch their attention.""\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, described Bitcoin\'s $100 billion market cap as a very good validator, emphasizing that ""Anyone who sat on the sideline deliberating an investment in Bitcoin will FOMO into the space.""\n\nOptimistic Outlook\n\nGoing forward, several analysts offered positive outlooks on the digital currency space.\n\nLucas Geiger, founder and CEO of Wireline, emphasized that when considered relative to many other assets out there, $100 billion is a small figure.\n\n""When we consider how many business processes could incorporate crypto tokens, we see how much potential there is,"" he stated.\n\nGeiger emphasized that while we should celebrate Bitcoin crossing the $100 billion market, we should keep in mind all the new applications that will be enabled by more widespread adoption of digital currencies.\n\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.', ""The price of bitcoin may have hit a new all-time high above $6,000 today, but it's already showing signs it may be primed to push higher.\n\nAt press time, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate was roughly $5,950, down slightly from the day's high, but up 9 percent on the week amidst what proved to be strong demand for bitcoin in the $5,000-to-$5,500 range.\n\nWeek-on-week, bitcoin is up 9 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is up a staggering 53.66%.\n\nLooking ahead, however, at least two underlying trends suggest it may trace higher in the days or weeks ahead.\n\nSearch volumes rise\n\nOn the back of the all-time high, Google search volume has notably shot up in the last 4 hours.\n\nLong an indicator of potential buying (the internet-based asset is bought online mostly after all), this trend suggests the rally has attracted the attention of the investor community.\n\nAccording to data from Google Trends, bitcoin search volume is near all-time highs.\n\nThe situation could easily devolve into a self-feeding cycle – i.e. more investors enter the market for its stellar returns, and end up pushing prices higher.\n\nVolumes on exchanges so far show that they've risen to match. At press time, 24-hour volumes were up across all major exchanges, with British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex showing the highest increase at just over 14 percent.\n\nLikewise, volumes on Bithumb (BTC/KRW) and bitFlyer (BTC/JPY), two other large regional exchanges, have jumped 7 percent and 6 percent, respectively.\n\nWeekly chart - Charting the uncharted territory\n\nAs for price action analysis, there is little reason to worry except for the overbought technical indicators.

""Progress since July has fallen short of our expectations, and the community has understandably expressed concerns over the lack of communication around this sudden change of pace,"" said Tezos co-founders Arthur and Kathleen Breitman ominously in a Medium post this week, and derivatives on Tezos tokens -- ""Tezzies"" -- ""fell as much as 31 percent."" Also back when Tezos was doing the ICO, its public-relations company claimed that its technology had been adopted by Ernst & Young, Deloitte, and LexiFi, none of which was true. Oops!\n\nTezos\'s big headline problem right now is a governance battle between the Breitmans, who founded and control the company that is building the project, and Johann Gevers, ""the president of a Swiss foundation the couple helped establish to handle the coin offering and promote and develop the Tezos computer network."" But maybe a bigger problem is ... let us say, some varying conceptions about what an initial coin offering even is. Here is the founders\' perspective:\n\nKathleen Breitman told Reuters that participating in the Tezos fundraiser was like contributing to a public television station and receiving “a tote bag” in return. “That’s kind of the same thing here,” she said. The fundraiser’s terms called the contributions “a non-refundable donation” and not a “speculative investment.”\n\nYes, right, clear enough, if you participated in the Tezos ICO, you were giving a charity a non-refundable donation. Reuters went to a Silicon Valley venture-capital investor who invested in the Breitmans\' company and was a big donor in the ICO, and ran that interpretation by him in a glorious deadpan. He was not amused:\n\nDraper told Reuters that cryptocurrencies are commodities like pork bellies, and characterized acquiring Tezzies as a purchase rather than a donation. Asked this month how much he donated during the Tezos fundraiser, he replied via email, “You mean how much I bought? A lot.”\n\nHi yes look I am sure that the dispute with the foundation guy is taking up a lot of time and attention, but this is your real governance problem, no? If you think that your investors gave you money as a ""donation,"" and they think that they gave you the money as an ""investment,"" then you have some conflicting expectations! Also, though, if you can convince prominent venture capitalists to give you money that you think is a ""donation"" and that they think is an ""investment,"" and if you are right, then that is in some ways the ideal approach to fundraising. You can raise a lot of money, because sophisticated investors think they will make a profit, but you can also keep all of it, because they weren\'t quite sophisticated enough to realize it was a donation.\n\nShould index funds be illegal?\n\nI dunno, on the one hand, this story about United Continental Holdings Inc. suggests that the rise in common ownership in the airline industry -- in which the same investors own shares in all the big airlines, and so in theory don\'t want them to compete against each other by slashing margins -- hasn\'t had that much effect. United has been engaged in ""aggressive growth and a price war with discounters,"" lowering its fares.\n\nOn the other hand, investors strenuously object. ""Analysts faulted it for endangering its profit goals by implementing a no-frills \'basic economy\' offering too widely."" On the earnings call, ""analysts pressed Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby on how they planned to deal with rising costs and falling pricing power. Would they rein in growth in the face of fare weakness?"" And now investors are talking about getting rid of the CEO:\n\nBefore the call, “we had heard rumblings from the investment community about another potential management change at United Continental,” Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said in a note to clients. After the call, “they aren’t rumblings, but full-fledged screams.”\n\nIf United\'s shareholders -- who also tend to be American Airlines shareholders, and Delta shareholders -- actually fire United\'s management for cutting fares and growing too aggressively, then I suppose that will be taken an anecdote in favor of the common-ownership-is-an-antitrust-problem thesis.\n\nElsewhere in criticism of passive investing, Bernstein Research -- which famously called passive investing ""Worse Than Marxism"" -- is launching two exchange-traded funds. The funds will invest based on Bernstein\'s research calls, though (""It’s technically a passive ETF, because it follows a given set of rules, but those rules are based on very active ingredients in the form of Bernstein Research""), so there\'s really no inconsistency. Bernstein worries that Marxism involves allocating capital based on a single central decision-maker, while passive investing lacks even that. Allocating capital based on Bernstein research is fine.\n\nBitcoin ETF.\n\nWhat is the point of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund?\n\nAn ETF would give retail investors as well as institutions an easy way to get exposure to bitcoin, compared with buying or selling it on digital exchanges and holding it on a wallet secured to the blockchain, the software ledger that powers bitcoin and its cousins.\n\nThat is from this story about how people are confident that there will eventually be a bitcoin ETF, and they\'re excited for it. (""People are looking for something fresh and new in the ETF space,"" says a product developer.) At some level I get the point that there are regulatory uses for a bitcoin ETF. If you are an investor with a mandate limited to holding securities -- like some mutual funds or retirement accounts -- then you can\'t buy bitcoins, but you can buy shares of a bitcoin ETF. Now whether you should be able to do that is an open question -- presumably you are restricted to buying securities for a reason -- but I assume that some mandate-limited investors want to buy bitcoins, and regulatory arbitrage is one of the great main streams of financial innovation, and who am I to question it.\n\nBut I suspect that the main explanation is the one I quoted above: An ETF is ""an easy way to get exposure to bitcoin, compared with"" the insurmountable garbage that one goes through to acquire bitcoins directly and hold them securely. (Remember all the bitcoin enthusiasts who hold their private keys on paper in bank vaults.) The main reason many people don\'t acquire bitcoins directly is not that they are mandate-limited to holding securities -- most people don\'t have a problem holding dollars, which are not securities -- but that it is not especially easy to acquire and hold bitcoins. As a currency, bitcoin is frustratingly difficult -- so much so that it may be easier to go to a broker and buy shares of an ETF to get exposure to bitcoin, rather than to hold it directly.\n\nOf course if you are buying shares in a bitcoin ETF it is to bet that the price of bitcoin will go up. If you are betting that the price of bitcoin will go up, it might be because you think that bitcoin will see further adoption as a currency. But the fact that you are buying shares of the ETF, rather than buying bitcoin directly, undermines that thesis. The need for a bitcoin ETF is an argument against buying it.\n\nHedge funds.\n\nOne aspect of the hedge fund business is investing clients\' money so that they make more money. Another aspect is raising money from clients to invest. There is an obvious linkage between those aspects -- the more money you make for clients, the more likely they are to keep giving you money -- but they are not the same thing. And there is a sense in which the latter is more important: If you are good at investing but have no client money, you have no hedge fund; if you are bad at investing but raise lots of client money, you have a very lucrative hedge fund. Anyway here\'s a story about Maverick Capital Ltd., which is fundraising on the basis of losses:\n\nMaverick’s flagship stock-picking hedge fund is down 2% this year through September after losing roughly 10% last year, missing out on the rally this year that has propelled U.S. stocks to record highs. Maverick’s new “recovery share” class would let existing clients invest more money in its hedge funds at 1% management fees and no performance fees, compared with the 1.75% and 17.5% fees, respectively, its clients most often pay.\n\nI mean, one-and-zero isn\'t actually lucrative -- it really is client accommodation -- but still I admire the approach. If you lose 10 percent a year and nonetheless have net inflows of client money -- as Maverick did last year -- then I think it is fair to say that you are good at running a hedge fund. Any criticism of your investing returns rather misses the point.\n\nElsewhere, Bloomberg News ""analyzed five years of calls—2013 through 2017—from three of the largest hedge fund events: Robin Hood, the Sohn Investment Conference in New York and the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, or SALT,"" and found that their influence is declining.\n\nBlockchain diplomas.\n\nHow can I tell if you have a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology? One way would be for me to ask MIT. If they say yes, then you have a degree from MIT. If they say no, then you don\'t. That is what having a degree from MIT, customarily, means: that MIT acknowledges you as a graduate. MIT is an important credentialing institution because a lot of people trust its degree-granting process. It is, to use the term of art, a trusted intermediary. It is thus well suited to keep the ledger of who has degrees. MIT\'s list of people who have MIT degrees defines the set of people who have MIT degrees.\n\nBut you know whatever this is fine sure:\n\nThis summer, as part of a pilot program, a cohort of 111 graduates became the first to have the option to receive their diplomas on their smartphones via an app, in addition to the traditional format. The pilot resulted from a partnership between the MIT Registrar’s Office and Learning Machine, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based software development company. The app is called Blockcerts Wallet, and it enables students to quickly and easily get a verifiable, tamper-proof version of their diploma that they can share with employers, schools, family, and friends. To ensure the security of the diploma, the pilot utilizes the same blockchain technology that powers the digital currency Bitcoin.\n\n""MIT has issued official records in a format that can exist even if the institution goes away,"" says the Learning Machine guy. I guess that is an advantage! What happens if a job candidate shows a potential employer her MIT degree on a smartphone app, and the employer calls up MIT to check and MIT says ""we have never heard of her, she is not an MIT graduate""? Does the employer trust MIT, or the app?\n\nNo no no no no, look, this is cute, and there is a real thing here. It is possible to imagine a future in which ""identity"" lives on ""the blockchain"" (a blockchain? several blockchains?). Instead of giving a landlord your Social Security number so he can run a credit check, and giving an employer your MIT transcript so it can confirm you have a degree, you could accumulate your credentials and endorsements and creditworthiness and whatever in a blockchain wallet. Your identity could be your blockchain public key, and when someone wants to endorse you for something -- when MIT wants to give you a degree, when your landlord wants to acknowledge receipt of your rent payment -- they could all do it there. It might all be more secure and efficient and open and useful than our current disorganized system of identification and credentialing. In that world, of course MIT would give out degrees on the blockchain, and calling up MIT to check on a degree would be a weird archaism.\n\nBut it is hard to be a first mover. What if I started my own app -- powered by the blockchain or whatever -- that gave out MIT degrees? You could whip out your phone and show an employer your MIT degree, that I gave you. In the imagined future of blockchain-based identity, employers would be accustomed to using in-blockchain methods of confirming that an MIT degree was actually conferred by MIT; my app would lack the requisite cryptographic proof, and would be ignored. In 2017, though, employers will just call up MIT to check, same as they would if you gave them a photocopied paper transcript. All the blockchain stuff, for now, is just for show.\n\nFIZZ GROWS STRONGER!\n\nThat -- complete with the capitalization and exclamation point -- is the headline of this press release from National Beverage Corp. (ticker: FIZZ), the maker of LaCroix seltzer, whose stock has been down 19 percent this month. Why is that, if results are so strong? Well, bots:\n\nAnalyst pens headline that FIZZ is weak . . . what the writer advocated was to induce short sellers to stampede aboard the passive BOT trading wagon. Why? With passive investment accounting for over one-third of the market, which does not question logic if prices are equitable, BUT merely accepts the stampede-induced results! There is no governor or regulatory convenience that accesses the reasonableness of the market behavior. Where is the SEC watchdog?\n\nI don\'t really know what it means either, but I always enjoy market structure folklore, and you might too.\n\nPeople are worried that people aren\'t worried enough.\n\nHere is an Artemis Capital Management research note warning about ""the Global Short Volatility trade."" You can think of it largely as a Minskyan analysis of the current market situation -- a lack of fear leading to strategies that rely on that continuing lack of fear, which are very fragile if conditions change -- but with a snake:\n\nMore financial concepts should be illustrated with ouroboroi, since deep down that\'s what most of them are.

It is sometimes hard to tell, with a private buzzy tech unicorn, how much of its valuation premium is based on being private and not fully subject to market forces, and how much of it is based on structural features in its securities that make it worth less than its headline valuation, and how much of it is based on genuinely convincing investors that it is a different and more valuable business model from whatever came before.

10/21/2017,"['If you thought you missed your chance to buy Bitcoin when the price broke $6,000 for the first time Friday, there’s one argument that might convince you otherwise.\n\nIt’s not for the faint of heart. But with the Bitcoin price up more than 42% this month alone, and up 20% from its low just three days ago, the cryptocurrency’s returns have beaten just about everything available on the stock market, defying repeated warnings from the likes of J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and former Fed chair Ben Bernanke. As of midday Saturday, Bitcoin was trading at nearly $6,200. Now, investors are fretting they’ll miss out on the windfall of a lifetime if they wait any longer.\n\nHistorically, of course, legendary investors such as Warren Buffett have advised against buying assets when their price is high, arguing that the best way to make money is to buy low, and, ideally, sell high. Yet a chart created by an influential analyst and investor illustrates why he predicts the Bitcoin price could go higher still — and in fact, may reach as high as $7,400 before its next significant dip.\n\nThe Bitcoin price chart mirrors a near-perfect Fibonacci sequence, a sign that the cryptocurrency could rise higher still, according to technical analysis. Chart by JC Parets, All Star Charts\n\nThe Bitcoin chart relies on technical analysis, a field of investing that is somewhat controversial because buying decisions are based on the movement of a particular stock or other asset, rather than on the fundamental valuation or future opportunity of the underlying company or security. While some investors reject this approach as trying to time the market — a notoriously difficult task — there is evidence that it can sometimes pay off.\n\nAnd if there were ever a time to use technical analysis, it might be with Bitcoin, whose price is not tied to any company, nor pegged to any other currency or asset, nor even related to an actual use case. What’s more, the Bitcoin price, which largely trades on hype and abstract visions of its long-term potential, is not only exceptionally volatile, but tends to trade in an unusual undulating formation that enthusiasts have come to call “waves” — where a correction of as much as 30% is common between new highs.\n\nIn this case, JC Parets, a chartered market technician who is the president and founder of All Star Charts, observed that the price of Bitcoin has moved upward at intervals resembling the Fibonacci sequence, a famous mathematical pattern that also occurs in nature in everything from the inner spiral of a seashell to pinecones.\n\n“Talk about Fibonacci—I mean, dude, does it get any cleaner than this?” Parets said last week in a presentation at the Stocktoberfest conference, hosted by the financial social media site Stocktwits in Coronado, Calif. With Fibonacci, the length of the next segment is equal to the sum of the two preceding segments. In Parets’ chart above, he shows that Bitcoin’s rallies, since the price surpassed its 2013 high, have followed a similar pattern, where each new leg up corresponds to a percentage increase as predicted by the Fibonacci series.\n\n“I mean, guys, this is like to the penny,” Parets added. He breaks it down further in the chart below.\n\nWith each new Bitcoin rally, its price has moved up in predictable increments corresponding to the Fibonacci sequence, a famous mathematical pattern.\n\nThe prediction only holds, Parets maintains, if the Bitcoin price remains above roughly $4,700. But as long as it does, he believes Bitcoin could rise to at least about $7,400, as indicated in the chart. For now, though, Parets is giving Bitcoin a more conservative price target: $6,500.\n\n“I don’t care if Bitcoin triples or goes to zero, I really don’t care at all, but from a risk-reward standpoint, I love it long,” he said. “If we’re above $4,700, we want to be long with a target of $6,500 — that’s a great risk-reward, let it go to zero after that!”\n\nOne caveat: Parets’ Bitcoin price prediction does not have any timeline attached, which means it could happen imminently, or not for years — as long as it continues to mirror the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n“Yes, theoretically, it can hit our targets tonight,” he told Fortune after Bitcoin passed the $6,000 mark. “Who knows?”', 'Earlier today, on October 21, the Bitcoin price achieved a new all-time high at $6,199. The market is confident that the price of Bitcoin could reach $10,000 in the mid-term if major markets such as Japan and the US continue to strengthen.\n\nFor third time this week, #bitcoin achieves new all-time high again at $6,199. When China resumes bitcoin trading, $8k realistic target? pic.twitter.com/HQrU1oUBNq — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) October 21, 2017\n\nChina’s Resumption of Cryptocurrency Trading Could Lead Bitcoin Price to $10,000\n\nSeveral financial analysts including Holger Zschäpitz, the senior editor of the financial desk and market maniac at Welt, attributed the recent increase in the price of Bitcoin to the US market’s optimism around the potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn March, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected the Bitcoin ETF proposal submitted by the Winklevoss twins, who have been operating one of the US market’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, due to lack of regulations in overseas markets and trade surveillance.\n\nEarlier this week, LedgerX, a digital currency-focused trading platform and clearing house approved by the US financial regulators, launched its derivatives exchange, processing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin trades in its first week. LedgerX demonstrated the possibility of clearing Bitcoin traders and swaps in a strictly regulated environment, imposing trade surveillance and investor protection.\n\nChina Could Spur Bitcoin Demand in Mid-Term\n\nSome analysts also believe that the Chinese government and its central bank could very likely resume cryptocurrency trading in the near future for two main reasons. First, the Chinese government and its state-owned news publication Xinhua have already expressed their concerns in regards to cryptocurrency trading migrating to over-the-counter (OTC) markets and underground economies.\n\nGovernments like the US and Japan have opted to provide regulatory frameworks for cyrptocurrency exchnage and legalize Bitcoin trading to prevent cryptocurrency trading activities from shifting towards peer to peer (P2P) and OTC markets, which are nearly impossible to regulate and restrict.\n\nAs CnLedger, a trusted news source within the Chinese cryptocurrency industry, revealed:\n\n… and take measures such as record-keeping, licensing, AML processes, real-name, limiting large transactions (3/3)https://t.co/QS8bJWXdAZ — cnLedger (@cnLedger) October 4, 2017\n\nMore to that, Bitcoin researcher Jon Creasy explained that the reelection of Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year will highly likely lead to the resumption of cryptocurrency trading, as Xi has always been a strong advocate for free markets.\n\nCreasy wrote:\n\n“President Xi Jinping is preparing for his October 18th reelection, and wants to appeal to his Communist voting bloc. My prediction is this: as soon as President Xi Jinping is reelected — and he will be — conservative, free(er)-trade legislation will be put in place, and Bitcoin exchanges will be reinstated. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Chinese government encouraging certain exchanges and cryptocurrencies, once this legislation hits. NEO already seems to be in their good graces.”\n\nIt has been quite evident for the past month that trading volumes in China have migrated to Japan and South Korea. Consequently, Japan has evolved into a cryptocurrency powerhouse, overtaking the US to become the largest Bitcoin market with around 60 percent in market share. Analysts have described the movement in trading volumes from China to Japan as a positive indicator for the long-term growth of Bitcoin, as Japan is efficiently regulated with practical policies and laws surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut, it is likely that if the Chinese government does resume cryptocurrency trading by the end of this year, the price of Bitcoin could likely enter the $10,000 region.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Optimistically, the Bitcoin market has demonstrated stability throughout the day, as the Bitcoin price remained relatively stable in the $6,105 region for nearly 13 hours.\n\nMarket Gains Confidence Over Bitcoin’s Mid-Term Growth\n\nOn October 20, Cryptocoinsnews reported that the demand for Bitcoin major markets such as the US and Japan have increased rapidly due to the entrance of institutional and retail traders. Specifically, the US market has started to anticipate the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the upcoming months, which were rejected in March.\n\nAs CoinCenter Executive Director Jerry Brito explained at the time, the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the ETF application of the Winklevoss twins, citing lack of regulations in overseas markets. Brito stated:\n\n“The Winklevoss ETF proposal was rejected because the SEC found that the significant markets for Bitcoin tend to be unregulated overseas markets that are potentially subject to price manipulation. But this creates a chicken and egg problem. How do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the US and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?”\n\nHowever, since then, overseas Bitcoin market such as Japan and South Korea have significantly matured, with more efficient and practical regulatory frameworks imposed by the two governments. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan has especially focused on providing a transparent and fair market for both businesses and investors, creating a national licensing program for cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nHence, the SEC’s concern in regards to the depth of the Bitcoin market and the lack of regulations on overseas cryptocurrency markets is a non-issue, and analysts have started to suggest the strong probability of Bitcoin ETFs being approved at least by early 2018.\n\nCriticism From Naysayers and Public Figures Good For Bitcoin: Analyst\n\nMore to that, prominent investors such as Ari Paul, the co-founder at Blocktower Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund established by former Goldman Sachs Vice President Matthew Goetz, emphasized that the baseless criticism on Bitcoin by public figures such as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have brought more attention to Bitcoin and the JPMorgan market, which is important for a market like Bitcoin that is still at its early stage. Paul stated:\n\n“One reason for the current Bitcoin rally: naysaying by Dimon, El-Arian, Shiller etc. Less than 1% of Americans own BTC. Of the small number of current BTC holders, very few sell on the statements of naysayers. But those naysayers bring general attention. If the naysayers introduce 1 million people to BTC who were previously unaware, and just 5% end up buying, it’s hugely bullish. ‘All attention is good attention’ when you’re so early on the adoption curve.\n\nAlso, it is important to acknowledge that many analysts have suggested the strong probability of cryptocurrency trading resumption in China after the reelection of current Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has been an advocate for free markets. Already, the Chinese government and its state-owned news publication Caixin have hinted the possibility of introducing national licensing program for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'MasterCard recently announced a way for businesses to make direct business to business (B2B) payments over their Blockchain technology-based network. The company has dubbed its offering “MasterCard Blockchain API,” and it will be debuted at the Money 20/20 Hackathon in Las Vegas in a few days.\n\nTesting and validation have been completed, and the tech will officially be ready for customers’ use beginning next week. The announcement is a bit ironic after the company’s wholesale rejection of Bitcoin. I guess as the old saying goes, “monkey see, monkey do.”\n\nAdvantage Blockchain\n\nBlockchain technology has been raised as an excellent option for B2B transfers for a multitude of reasons. Blockchain transfers are fully private and secure, while at the same time offering flexibility and scalability for business transactions. According to one executive:\n\n“By combining Mastercard Blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable and easy to scale.”\n\nWhile the solution is a major coup for Blockchain technology in general, the credit giant’s announcement may be seen as copycatting the technology of other systems and platforms. Blockchain technology has, until the past couple of years, been relegated to the fringes of the tech conversation. The sudden interest and application from enterprise-level corporations shows an awareness of the power of the systems already designed by other companies.', 'BitGo chief executive and SegWit2x project lead Mike Belshe says that, despite contention within the bitcoin community related to the block size debate, “things are looking good” for the SegWit2x hard fork.\n\nBitcoin is now approximately one month out from the scheduled date for the activation of SegWit2x, a controversial hard fork intended to increase the blocksize to improve the network’s scalability. Since the New York Agreement (NYA) was struck in May, a number of signatories have rescinded their support for SegWit2x, citing various concerns including the lack of opt-out replay protection, a dearth of community consensus, and the absence of support from Bitcoin Core developers.\n\nHowever, SegWit2x proponents continued to point to the fact that roughly 95% of miners were signaling for the hard fork, alleging that the incumbent blockchain would not be able to survive without support from miners. However, F2Pool recently became the first mining pool to officially withdraw support for SegWit2x, placing a 10% dent in the hashrate consensus.\n\nSome analysts even attribute the recent bitcoin price rally to skepticism among traders that the SegWit2x blockchain will garner much support — even from miners who continue to signal their support for the fork.\n\nDespite these setbacks, SegWit2x project lead Mike Belshe is optimistic about the prospects for the SegWit2x blockchain following the fork. On Wednesday, he published a blog post titled “Keeping the Community Together”, in which he stated that although the “debate rages on” within the community, “things are looking good” for the activation of SegWit2x in November.\n\n“Segwit2x is a very small, surgical fix to address one issue: scalability. While the debate rages on about process and politics, the facts are simple,” he says, “we can keep the community together and we can increase the blocksize.”\n\nHowever, it’s not quite clear who Belshe means when he says “we can keep the community together” because a significant portion of the bitcoin ecosystem has expressed its intention to remain on the incumbent blockchain following the fork.\n\n“While we don’t know exactly how things will play out in November, things are looking good”, he adds. “This is a simple change and we will all benefit.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Inside a locked room in an office building in Caracas, 20 humming computers use their data-crunching power to mine bitcoins, an increasingly popular tool in the fight against Venezuela\'s hyperinflation.\n\nIn warehouses, offices and homes, miners are using modified computers to perform complex computations, essentially book-keeping for digital transactions worldwide, for which they earn a commission in bitcoins.\n\nWhile practiced worldwide, Bitcoin mining is part of a growing, underground effort in Venezuela to escape the worst effects of a crippling economic and political crisis and runaway inflation that the IMF says could reach 720 percent this year.\n\nHaving no confidence in the bolivar and struggling to find dollars, many Venezuelans, who are neither computer geeks nor financial wizards, are relying on the bitcoin -- currently valued around $6,050, or other virtual currencies.\n\nCaracas office worker Veronica says her boss installed the 20 machines in early 2015.\n\n""These are machines that bring in $800 a month (more than 26 million bolivars),"" says Veronica, who refused to give her full name because of fears of arrest.\n\nBitcoin mining consultant Randy Brito estimates that about 100,000 Venezuelans are ""mining,"" although it is impossible to have an exact figure because many are protecting themselves by using servers in foreign countries.\n\nBrito said the boom in these virtual transactions began in 2014, when Venezuela\'s economic crisis intensified as a result of the collapse in the price of oil, which accounts for 96 percent of the country\'s revenue.\n\n""Whoever buys bitcoins with bolivars earns money by increasing the price of the bitcoin against the dollar, and escapes inflation,"" Brito told AFP.\n\n- Not without risk -\n\nVenezuela is something of a mining hotspot because the electricity needed to run the power-hungry computers is so heavily subsidized as to be almost free.\n\nThus ""it is very profitable to \'produce\' bitcoins,"" said economist Asdrubal Oliveros.\n\nTempted by the money made by her boss, Veronica has taken the plunge at home, buying a machine for $2,280 online from China.\n\n""A friend took another and a boy I know bought 20,"" said Veronica. ""People are buying machines like crazy.""\n\nThey set the machines up in another woman\'s house, as many miners do to spread the power consumption and avoid attracting the attention of the state intelligence service Sebin, whose agents regularly raid buildings when they notice a suspicious surge.\n\n""If they find machines, they arrest the owners or they try to extort money,"" said Veronica. ""In electricity, we spend barely 15,000 bolivars a month (less than 50 cents at the black market rate).""\n\nLawyer Jesus Ollarves said that while bitcoin mining is legal in Venezuela, which does not have cryptocurrency laws, ""those who practice it are often liable to arrest by the police for energy theft.""\n\nAccording to the LocalBitcoins portal, transactions in bitcoins amounted to $1.1 million in Venezuela in the last week of September.\n\nCommissions, paid in bitcoin, help buy food and medicine that are currently in acutely short supply because of the crisis, said Eugenia Alcala, founder of Dash Caracas, which provides courses in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nDescription of how bitcoins function Sophie RAMIS, AFP\n\nVeronica said her machine is producing 20 to 25 Litecoins -- another virtual currency -- per month.\n\n""Each Litecoin is worth $46, that\'s $920 a month,"" said Veronica -- a fortune in a country where the minimum monthly salary is 135,543 bolivars ($40), supplemented by a voucher of 189,000 bolivars ($56).', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Now Bitcoin alone has crossed the $100 bln mark.\n\nIn doing so, it has increased its dominance to 58.5 percent, a level last seen in May this year. This shows that money is pouring into Bitcoin, whereas altcoins are getting hammered.\n\nAt some point in the near future, once the leader tires out, other popular coins are likely to offer an excellent buying opportunity.\n\nIs Bitcoin nearing a top? Are altcoins ready to follow the leader? Let’s find out.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nBitcoin is on fire. It has been consistently rising for the past two days. Can this rally continue? We don’t have any existing positions in Bitcoin, should we establish one at the current levels?\n\nBitcoin has reached a critical resistance level from the channel line. It has not been able to breakout of this channel since June of this year. A breakout of the ascending channel gives it a target of $8000, equal to the depth of the channel. However, this level is unlikely to be reached in the short-term. Therefore, we have to work with intermediate targets.\n\nThe breakout from the range of $5391.4 to $5875 gives the cryptocurrency a minimum target objective of $6359. If this level is crossed, then the next possible level is $6845.\n\nOur higher targets will be invalidated if the virtual currency turns down from the current levels.\n\nAs the risk to reward ratio is not attractive, we don’t recommend any fresh trade. However, investors carrying positions from lower levels should keep a stop loss of $5600.\n\nOnce Bitcoin breaks out and sustains above the channel, the stops can be raised to about $5800 levels and then trailed higher.\n\nOn the downside, $5875, the earlier resistance, will act as a strong support.\n\nETH/USD\n\nEthereum has been falling for the past six days. However, we expect it to hold the $275 to $286 zone, which has served as a strong support for the past month and a half.\n\nWe don’t recommend buying on the way down. We should wait for the next day or two to confirm that the support zone is holding, because a break of this support can sink Ethereum to $252 levels.\n\nIf, however, the support holds, the digital currency is likely to trade in a range for a few days, then attempt to start a new uptrend.\n\nPresently, we don’t find any buy setup, therefore we don’t suggest any trade on Ethereum at the moment.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nWhile Bitcoin is roaring ahead to new highs, Bitcoin Cash has not found any buying support from the bulls. However, selling has subsided, which has resulted in small range days.\n\nPresently, the digital currency is attempting to hold the $282 to $300 support zone. If Bitcoin Cash breaks this level, it will sink towards lows of $190.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakout of $400 will signal a change in trend. Therefore, we recommend a long position only at $410, with a stop loss of $350. The target objective is $530.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nWe don’t hold any positions in Ripple. The digital currency is currently attempting to hold the $0.20 levels. However, buying interest has declined following the sharp reversal from $0.3 levels.\n\nIf Ripple breaks below $0.2, it’s likely to fall towards $0.15 levels, where we recommend to initiate long positions because it has not broken down of $0.145 on a closing basis since June this year. However, this trade should be taken on the way up, after Ripple confirms a bottom. Please don’t try to catch a falling knife and enter when the cryptocurrency is falling. The stop loss can be kept $0.126.\n\nOn the other hand, if the virtual currency holds the $0.2 levels, it will again attempt to rally towards $0.3. But, we don’t find a reliable set up to trade this. Hence we don’t recommend a long position until Ripple falls to $0.15 levels and holds it.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nOn Oct. 18, though Litecoin fell to $53 levels, it quickly climbed back higher and closed above $57.7. It has since then managed to stay above this support level. However, presently the cryptocurrency is threatening to fall into the range once again.\n\nIf Litecoin breaks below $57 and is unable to climb back quickly, it will invalidate the current bullish setup.\n\nHowever, if the cryptocurrency finds support at the current levels and turns up, a long position can be initiated at $63. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $55 and the profit objective is $71.', '', 'The world’s most prominent digital currency was on track to mark a fresh milestone on Friday, with bitcoin rallying and putting the cyber currency in position to hit a total market value of around $100bn.\n\nAn online business journal, Marketwatch.com, reported that such a valuation would place the number one cryptographic currency above or on par with blue-chip companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.57 per cent like United Technologies Corp UTX, +1.00 per cent with a market value at $96bn, American Express Co AXP, +0.43 per cent at $82bn, Caterpillar Inc CAT, +0.44 per cent at $77bn and Travelers Cos Inc TRV, -0.29 per cent at $36bn.\n\nThe report stated that it was questionable to draw value parallels between the asset and more traditional companies, but it highlighted the stratospheric rise of bitcoin BTCUSD, +4.49 per cent, which did not exist a decade ago.\n\nA single bitcoin also broke above a milestone of $6,000, reaching an intraday high of $6,003.81 on Friday afternoon, according to research and data site CoinDesk.com.\n\nBitcoin also boasted a market value of roughly $99.7bn, according to data site Coinmarketcap.com.\n\nThe move came just as the Dow cleared its own psychologically important level of 23,000 on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow has enjoyed an impressive run-up of 17 per cent year to date, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.45 per cent has climbed nearly 15 per cent so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.40 per cent has charged up more than 23 per cent thus far in 2017.\n\nHowever, those paper gains pale in comparison with bitcoin’s run-up.

In other words, they can’t just choose one fork and ignore the other fork. Choosing to support only one fork (whichever that is) would cause a lot of confusion for users and open them up to lawsuits. So Coinbase is forced to support both forks at the time of the hardfork and need to let the market decide which is the real Bitcoin,” said Lee.\n\nBut, exchanges do have the freedom to either delay the integration of BCG trading or simply not implement Bitcoin Gold onto their trading platforms. Earlier this week, Bittrex, the third largest cryptocurrency exchange by user base and trading volume behind Bithumb and Bitfinex, revealed that it will not provide Bitcoin Gold trading.\n\nIt is likely that the community and industry’s decline in support for SegWit2x and Bitcoin Gold could lead to an increase in demand for Bitcoin, as the market gains confidence in Bitcoin’s mid-term performance.\n\nIn the short-term, investors should focus on the development of SegWit2x or Bitcoin Gold hard fork, emergence of bitcoin derivatives and options trading platforms in the US such as LedgerX, and the increase in adoption rate of bitcoin in major markets like Japan, because these three factors could trigger the interests of institutional and retail traders.\n\nAlready, LedgerX, the first government-approved bitcoin derivatives and options trading platform or clearing house in the US, has processed $1 million in trades in its first week of operations. As Ledgerx stated:\n\n“As a new exchange and clearing house with technology built entirely from scratch, we were hoping for a quiet first week with minimal volumes to test the pipes. We ended up completing swaps and options trades worth over $1,000,000 USD. Crucially, these trades were cleared through LedgerX, which is the only institutional grade, US federally regulated exchange and clearing house for digital currencies. And we are literally just getting started.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Ben McLannahan in New York OCTOBER 22, 2017 192 Jordan Belfort, the former penny-stock broker immortalised in the film The Wolf of Wall Street has dismissed the current craze for initial coin offerings as “the biggest scam ever” that is bound to “blow up in\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009people’s faces”. The warning comes after ICOs — which raise funds online by selling investors digital tokens in exchange for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum — have soared in popularity. So far this year, 202 ICOs have raised just over $3bn, according to Coinschedule.com, mostly for ventures promising to improve the experience of trading and investing in digital currencies. But the market has drawn scrutiny from regulators that are worried that small investors are being duped by promises of outsized returns. China’s central bank last month banned ICO funding, saying it had “seriously disrupted the economic and financial order”, while UK regulators have said that investors should be prepared for the value of their tokens to drop to zero.  Mr Belfort, who spent 22 months in prison after pleading guilty to securities fraud and money-laundering, drew parallels to the fashion for “blind pools” in the 1970s and 80s, when companies raised funds from investors without specifying how the money would be spent. Many pools were dissolved without making a single investment — but not before brokers made off with big fees. “Promoters [of ICOs] are perpetuating a massive scam of the highest order on everyone,” he said. “Probably 85 per cent of people out there don’t have bad intentions, but the problem is, if five or 10 per cent are trying to scam you, it’s a f**king disaster.” Jordan Belfort is portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' © AP Start-ups argue that ICOs are a legitimate mode of raising money, part of a broad, grassroots movement to disrupt big banks and venture funds. Buyers of the tokens typically receive access to a future service once it is launched, or rights to the profits generated. But Mr Belfort, who was played onscreen by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2013 movie, said the techniques employed by ICO salespeople appeared to be similar to the “pump and dump” tactics used by boiler-rooms: get supply, promote aggressively, leak a little into the market, stir interest — perhaps via celebrity endorsements — then sell the rest before the price collapses.

It’s the people who will then get involved and bastardise the idea.” Since being freed from jail in 2005 Mr Belfort, 55, has carved out a career as an author and motivational speaker. He is due to appear in New York this week at an event hosted by Synergy Global Forum, at which he will promote his new book, Way of the Wolf. In the meantime, Mr Belfort is advising friends and family to steer well clear of ICOs. “It is the biggest scam ever, such a huge gigantic scam that’s going to blow up in so many people’s faces. It’s far worse than anything I was ever doing,” he said."", 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has started to issue diplomas through its Blockcerts platform, a Bitcoin Blockchain-based application which provides a tamper-resistant and immutable ledger for the distribution of academic credentials.\n\nBlockcerts, which was first introduced in 2016, was developed by Learning Machine in collaboration with the MIT Registrar’s Office, with the vision of creating an open infrastructure wherein graduates can receive diplomas that are easily accessible and verifiable. The Blockcerts development team explained:\n\n“Blockcerts provides a decentralized credentialing system. The Bitcoin Blockchain acts as the provider of trust, and credentials are tamper-resistant and verifiable. Blockcerts can be used in the context of academic, professional, and workforce credentialing.”\n\nMerit of Using the Bitcoin Blockchain\n\nPermissioned or centralized Blockchains are being employed by large-scale conglomerates and corporations such as Pfizer and Genentech, pharmaceutical giants with a combined market cap of $300 bln, because they require flexibility and the settlement of thousands of data points every second.\n\nBut, for documents like academic credentials and diplomas, the immutable and public Bitcoin Blockchain network can be used, as it does not demand high flexibility and high counts of data points to process.\n\nHence, by creating academic credentials and diplomas at MIT and embedding them into Bitcoin transactions which are eventually sent to the Bitcoin public Blockchain, the Blockcerts app and MIT can allow both students and companies in the future to utilize the Bitcoin Blockchain to verify diplomas and credentials.\n\nMIT Registrar and Senior Associate Dean Mary Callahan, stated:\n\n“From the beginning, one of our primary motivations has been to empower students to be the curators of their own credentials. This pilot makes it possible for them to have ownership of their records and be able to share them in a secure way, with whomever they choose.”\n\nChris Jagers, co-founder and CEO of Learning Machine, the software development firm behind Blockcerts, further emphasized that platforms like Blockcerts are particularly important because even if the issuers of credentials, in this case MIT, terminate their operations or shut down, students and organizations can verify their credentials on the Bitcoin Blockchain, which is unalterable in nature.\n\n“MIT has issued official records in a format that can exist even if the institution goes away, even if we go away as a vendor. People can own and use their official records, which is a fundamental shift.”\n\nPermissioned Blockchain is Not Needed\n\nBlockcerts has also proven the commercial applicability of the Bitcoin Blockchain as an infrastructure for applications. Permissioned and centralized Blockchains are not necessary to process small amounts of data, especially if security is of the utmost importance for the clients.\n\nFor MIT, the security and immutability of Bitcoin is especially crucial because academic credentials and diplomas are extremely valuable and important information for students and professionals. More importantly, the usage of a public Blockchain network allows the application to operate as open-source software. The Blockcerts team said:', 'The price of Bitcoin rose by another $US500 this week after breaching $US5000 last week, making investors huge fortunes. But market experts who\'ve seen their fair share of booms and busts are scratching their heads.\n\nThe volatility is particularly high. Bitcoin reached almost $5000 on September 1 this year and fell to $3200 over the following two weeks. But just like in previous set-backs, the cryptocurrency went on to more than recover from the fall.\n\nThe big bubbles of recent decades – US house prices that came crashing down and triggering the global financial crisis or the dotcom crash of 2000 – took years to rise by less than 10 times.\n\nThe US dollar price of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has risen almost six times since just the start of this year.\n\nAlthough it may be bonkers, the run in Bitcoin likely has some way to go. That\'s because it usually takes fairly widespread participation in a speculative bubble before it bursts.\n\nAt this stage, the users and investors in Bitcoin tend to be younger and tech savvy. However, the recent emergence of investment seminars promoting cryptocurrencies may change that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Sydney alone in November there is Break Into Bitcoin and the USI-Tech Aussie Tour that promise to show attendees how to make fortunes from virtual currencies.\n\nAnd there are e-books that promise to turn just a few dollars into a fortune, very quickly, with just a few simple steps.\n\nSHARE\n\nShare on Facebook SHARE\n\nShare on Twitter TWEET\n\nLink Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are on an incredible tear but how long will it last?

""There are plenty of scams and ponzi-like schemes in the crypto space, but Bitcoin isn\'t one of them.""\n\nWhile Mylonas has done well from investing in Bitcoin, he does not invest in the virtual currency now. That\'s because there are other virtual currencies whose technologies have surpassed Bitcoin.\n\nHe\'s making good money from rival Ethereum, which is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralised applications.\n\nThere are hundreds of cryptocurrencies with new ones appearing all the time.\n\nSome of them promise total anonymity, providing payments systems for nefarious activities like the buying and selling of illegal drugs and of guns, among other things. They are also outside the tax net.\n\nSome virtual currencies are designed to target specific markets rather than general ecommerce.\n\nSexcoin, for example, promises totally anonymous payments for the purveyors and consumers of the ""adult"" entertainment industry.\n\nMylonas is very selective about which crypto he picks, as he reckons most of them will fail. He believes they will be regulated eventually, after which time some players will be knocked-out – if they get that far.\n\nHe thinks what is happening with virtual currencies and blockchain is a bit like what happened in the tech stock mania of the late 1990s, where some really good companies that survived tech wreck of early 2000 went on to thrive.\n\nApart from making money, there\'s a warning for our big banks in Mylonas\'s enthusiasm for virtual currencies and blockchain.\n\n""My generation doesn\'t have trust in financial institutions,"" he says. ""We are the generation who have grown-up in a financial crisis where the people responsible were not held accountable.\n\n""Bitcoin doesn\'t have a building or a company, it\'s decentralised and trust is built into the technology, and people don\'t have that trust in big banks any more.\n\nThe music industry student and record label director is also a user of Bitcoin.\n\nHe can pay for almost everything with Bitcoin as he has a Bitcoin debit card and an app that converts the crypto currency to dollars so that it can be used everywhere.\n\nAnother appealing feature of cryptocurrency for Mylonas is that it cuts out the middle people in financial transactions and their fees.\n\nFitness instructor\n\nDee Heath is also making a killing out of crypto. The small businesswoman owns a pole dancing fitness business in Sydney\'s western suburbs.\n\nShe\'s tech savvy and has been following the rise of crypto-currency for some time.\n\nThree months ago she invested $5000 in Bitcoin, which is now worth $14,000, at least on paper, as she has yet to convert it to Australian dollars.\n\nShe is so impressed with the return that she\'s considering becoming a full-time investor in virtual currencies.\n\n""My friends were getting involved in it and I asked them about it,"" Heath says. ""I really love the idea of online currencies and I think that everything is shifting so online now that I see a lot of potential in it. A lot of younger people are willing to take risks and there is an element of risk with how Bitcoin will perform.\n\n""But you need to be a long-term investor who doesn\'t stress out if there is big dip. I only invest what I am willing to lose.""\n\nHeath says also taken some positions in ICOs (initial coin offerings), but of only a couple of hundred dollars in each because the risk is even higher than for established virtual currencies.\n\nICOs are where investors buy the virtual currency before if goes live on hopes of big gains once it does.\n\nEach ICO has to bring something to market if it is to get support and one of her ICOs, Electroneum, which goes live on November 1, is the only virtual currency that can be ""mined"" on a smartphone.\n\n""I am happy to stay with crypto as I feel we are still in the early stages and that there will be a lot of further growth,"" she says.\n\nNew Bitcoins are created only very slowly and no more will be created after 2041. Blockchains need to have their accounts verified.\n\nThis verification is carried out by ""miners"". These are people around the world who have spare capacity on their computers or run banks of computers and allow the blockchain to use their computer to do the calculations.\n\nAs a reward, the miner receives a fraction of a Bitcoin, or whatever virtual currency the blockchain supports.\n\nAs long as the miner is paid more than the cost of electricity to run their computers, they are ahead.\n\nWhile blockchains are practically impossible to hack, the weakness in the chain is with the exchanges.\n\nIf you to want to buy Bitcoin with Australian dollars you will have to use one of the handful of exchanges like CoinJar, which has a virtual ""wallet"" that stores the Bitcoins and provides an ATM card to allow the user spend their Bitcoins. There\'s also Bitcoin Australia, CoinTree, BitTrade and about half a dozen other exchanges.\n\nExtreme risk\n\nThose that have seen more than their fair share of speculative markets are scratching their heads over the massive run-up in virtual currencies.\n\nMichael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, says the risks are considerable. He says such investments are nowhere near ""investment grade"".\n\n""When people are making 200 times their money that attracts attention and other people want a piece of that,"" he says. And this is certainly at the more speculative end of the spectrum, he says. ""They are a punt,"" he says.\n\nShane Oliver, the chief economist at AMP Capital Investors, says Bitcoin\'s price looks very bubbly.\n\n""I still struggle to fully understand how they work and one big lesson from the GFC is that if you don\'t fully understand something you shouldn\'t invest,"" he says. ""Cryptocurrencies are popping up like mushrooms.""\n\nIt reminds him of the Wild West in the United States when the big banks had their own currencies, which led to financial instability.\n\n""That could happen here as cryptocurrencies keep popping up and we will have blow-ups,"" he says.\n\nHe sees the appeal of virtual currencies but the advantages could be whittled away as banks lower their fees and regulators seek greater control over them.\n\nWhat\'s next in crypto\n\nBitcoin leads the pack with Ethereum and Ripple the next-most popular. Virtual currencies are here to stay but how many of them will emerge as leaders amid the hundreds of cryptocurrencies is anybody\'s guess. Approach with extreme care.\n\nRipple: a real-time global settlement network that offers instant, certain and low-cost international payments. Ripple ""enables banks to settle cross-border payments in real time, with end-to-end transparency, and at lower costs"".\n\nEthereum: launched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralised software platform that according to Ethereum can be used to ""codify, decentralise, secure and trade just about anything"". Following a hack attack in 2016, Ethereum was split into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum (ETH) is probably the largest crypto after Bitcoin.\n\nZcash: it is a decentralised and open-source cryptocurrency launched in the latter part of 2016. Zcash claims to provide extra security or privacy where all transactions are recorded and published on a blockchain, but details such as the sender, recipient and amount remain private.\n\nDash: launched in January 2014, Dash (originally known as Darkcoin) is a more secretive version of Bitcoin. Dash offers more anonymity as it works on a decentralised mastercode network that makes transactions almost untraceable\n\nSource: Edited extract from Investopedia\n\nReal revolution is blockchain – it\'s a bigger deal than crypto\n\nWhen thinking about the astonishing returns that investors have been making (and losing) on crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, the real revolution is ""blockchain"" of which crypto-currencies are just one its earliest applications.\n\nIn fact, it is blockchain that\'s probably the biggest thing since the advent of the internet.\n\nA blockchain is a decentralised and distributed digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers.\n\nInformation held on a blockchain is shared – and is continually reconciled.\n\nAs the blockchain database isn\'t stored in any one location, there\'s no centralised version of this information that a hacker can disrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet. No one owns it.\n\nBlockchains can cut out the middle people in financial transactions, and their fees, but also presents plenty of other opportunities for new ways of record keeping.\n\nBig businesses around the world are looking at how to use blockchains. Goldman Sachs produced a report last year that gave some examples of how blockchain could be used.\n\nSome of these applications include using blockchain to store property records, so that prospective buyers can quickly and cheaply verify that the owner of the property really owns it.\n\nThere have been well-publicised ""fat finger"" errors with share trades, which have disrupted markets, but by settling share trades with blockchain not only would the risks of errors be reduced, but the costs of trading could come down.\n\nGoldman reckons identity data stored on a blockchain could help finance firms easily and quickly check new customers as part of ""know your customer"" rules— a bit like a digital passport.\n\nThe real power of blockchain to change the world is only just starting.', ""Digital Record Silent on Bitcoin\n\nIt's the digital currency that everyone is talking about, just not in Germany. As Bitcoin hits a new record, it's time for German regulators to take note.\n\nBy Handelsblatt Staff Published on October 22, 2017 7:11 pm\n\nAudio Audio LISTEN\n\nPdf\n\nBitcoins are on the rise - even if German regulators are doing their best to ignore it. Source: DPA\n\nFor Germany’s top financial regulator BaFin, the matter is clear: Virtual currencies like Bitcoin are not legal tender. Therefore, they don’t need to be centrally regulated.\n\nIn other words, use Bitcoins at your own risk in Germany. Sure, you can treat them as a method of exchange, just like farmers might have traded apples for oranges in the old days. Just don’t expect much legal recourse if things go wrong. For banks, regulators treat them like stocks – any bank that has a license to trade stocks can also trade virtual currencies if they wish. But like any individual who invests in the stock market, they shouldn’t complain if they suddenly find their investment is worth nothing.\n\nThis for a currency that has seen a meteoric rise in its value over the past year. On Friday, Bitcoin passed the $6,000 mark. On Saturday it hit a record high of $6,178 for just one Bitcoin, though it has fallen back slightly since. At the start of this year, it was trading at just $1,000 and back in 2015 at just $250. That dizzying surge has led to strong demand and forced other regulators around the world to take a much closer look at what is driving the currency’s rise – and whether it needs to be reined in.\n\nGermany risks missing the boat, just like it did with the rise of Silicon Valley technology companies.\n\nThe jury on these digital currencies is still out. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has said he is open and is reportedly considering entering the Bitcoin trade. Jamie Dimon, head of rival JPMorgan, has called it “a fraud,” though he is investing in the so-called blockchain technology that drives digital currencies behind the scenes.\n\nThat same uncertainty goes for regulators, though many have started getting involved. Japan, where much of the currency and its trading orginated, in April became the first major country to make it legal tender and it has since become a method of payment in hundreds of stores around the country. New minimum standards for Bitcoin exchanges have been imposed by regulators since October to boost trust. That has allowed banks to start investing massively in financial-technology startups.\n\nChina, which has more investors in digital currencies than any other country, has gone in the other direction. Authorities in September declared public offerings in the currency, so-called ICO’s, illegal and soon after closed down existing trading platforms, though they didn’t ban holding Bitcoin outright and kept open the possibility of reopening trading platforms under strict oversight.\n\nThe United States has staked out a more cautious middle-ground. In the state of New York, the country’s financial center, any financial firm that trades in the currency must secure a license, though individuals and retailers that simply buy and sell the currency are exempt. State authorities can also impose capital requirements on companies using the currency. By contrast, national regulators have so far kept their distance, but are monitoring closely. The Securities and Exchange Commission has a department of 25 people keeping an eye on Bitcoin and blockchain developments – and another 90 people on call.\n\nThat brings us back to Germany, where virtually none of this is happening. Unlike the SEC, the financial regulator BaFin doesn’t have a dedicated department overseeing the rise of digital currencies. Perhaps a little counter-intuitively, supporters of the industry actually want to be regulated. Though BaFin’s hands-off approach may give them freer rein, they also yearn for credibility – as has happened in Japan since regulators stepped in. Otherwise they warn that Germany risks missing the boat, just like it did with the rise of Silicon Valley technology companies.\n\n“Germany missed the Web 2.0 revolution, which is why the global players haven’t come out of Germany. The Blockchain revolution offers the possibility of a second chance,” reads a position paper issued last week by a Berlin-based association for blockchain and digital currency providers, which was created only last June. The group last week presented a 16-chapter list of suggestions for how the newest sector could be regulated. Among other things, it called on polticians to sanction “digital securities” and rules to govern taxation in the digital sphere.\n\nUnlike other countries, the association complains that BaFin to date has only one dedicated specialist on the subject. Nina Siedler, a Berlin lawyer who works with startups in the field, said it’s time for politicians and regulators to set more specific legal guidelines for the sector, “even if that means more concrete oversight.” That’s a trade-off the industry is willing to accept.\n\nRegulators here aren’t sure they’re ready to lend Bitcoin that kind of credence just yet. Germany’s central bank has advised against buying into the currency, while even consumer groups essentially treat Bitcoin like any other derivative – and a particularly volatile one at that. The top consumer organization in the country says investing in Bitcoin is “not to be recommended.” Anyone who does invest should be clear that they are speculating – and accept that they could lose their entire investment if things go wrong.\n\nThat may still prove true. Britain’s financial regulator FCA issued a similar warning to private investors last week. But if things do go wrong and investors are left holding the bag, they might blame the regulators who refused to help prevent the crisis from coming.\n\nHandelsblatt staff in Frankfurt, Berlin, New York, Beijing and Tokyo contributed to this story.

The gap is even widening to reflect strengthening bullish pressure. The 100 SMA is also close to the ascending trend line connecting the latest lows of bitcoin price action, adding to its strength as a floor.\n\nIn addition, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level lines up with this trend line around the $5500 levels. This is also a short-term area of interest or former resistance that might hold as support.\n\nIf so, bitcoin price could bounce right back up to the $6214 highs and beyond. Stochastic has been on the move down but is pulling higher without even hitting oversold levels, which means that bulls are eager to charge. RSI, on the other hand, has plenty of room to fall so the correction could still materialize.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nDollar strength came into play late in the week but bitcoin price has been able to hold its ground on strengthening expectations that the November upgrade could turn out well. Apart from that, political risks all over the globe like in New Zealand and Europe could continue to keep investors interested in digital gold.\n\nReports that bitcoin is about to get regulated in Australia gave the cryptocurrency a boost as this could mean better infrastructure for firms in that area. Apart from that, there have been rumors that China could reverse its recent bitcoin ban, reviving demand and volumes for the cryptocurrency. Some predict that this could send bitcoin price up to $10,000 in the next six to 10 months.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

In the near term, it struck me that Bitcoin is behaving as a Giffen good.\n\nGiffen goods are defined as ""those goods whose demand rises as their price rises."" This is the opposite of how most goods behave - as prices rise, demand falls off. In the case of Bitcoin, it seems clear to me that we are in a stage where rising prices fuels further demand - like a Giffen good.\n\nThis makes sense, because as I have said, so many people I talk to are examining bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) to see if they fit in their portfolio or not. As they search for information, they constantly run into the bitcoin \'evangelists\' who adore cryptocurrencies and never have a bad word to say about them. Even problem is only a minor setback on the path to widespread acceptance and new highs. At the other end of the spectrum, they come across the \'bitcoin is a bubble\' writing that is also prevalent. So they are torn whether we are still in the early stages of a brand new system that will revolutionize money as we know it, or we are creating values that will make the Tulip Mania seem reasonable.\n\nI think higher prices, for now, will attract more interest. As prices rise, more people who question the validity, will decide it is worth a shot to invest. I currently think that behavior is how a Giffen good works, the detractors will quickly point out that a Giffen good and what makes a bubble occur is nonexistent. The detractors may be correct (I continue to believe that blockchain will be important over the long run - I am less convinced that Bitcoin will be viable in the long run - but that doesn\'t stop me from attempting to trade it).\n\nThe creation of a Bitcoin ETF would accelerate the price rise in the near term. Many of the potential buyers who I speak to, who are becoming more convinced that they are missing out on something as they see the price rise, would much prefer to invest (speculate) using more traditional vehicles - like an ETF in their brokerage account. Until that occurs, there will be some pool of potential buyers who just aren\'t willing to spend the time and effort to create wallets and truly join the crypto world (though that group is shrinking as prices rise).\n\nSo for now, rising prices will likely lead to more buyers, as doubters and skeptics become converted. The danger, is that falling prices will tend illicit more sellers, as fears that the \'bubble theory\' is correct will resonate. For that to occur, I think we need to see another concerted attempt by governments or central banks to push back.\n\nSome will say that the stock market behaves as a Giffen good - especially for momentum investors, but I disagree. Stocks have some long term metrics that investors understand. They may be willing to enter into new territory relative to that metric - but many investors will not buy merely because price is higher. Sellers will emerge as valuations become stretched. Something like Bitcoin, with no traditional valuation metrics is very different from the stock market.', ""The Bitcoin market cap reached US$100 billion on Friday with the digital currency pushing through the US$6,000 mark to just over US$6,100 and it has since settled to around US$5,900.

The most recent edition of Charlie Rose, the PBS interview show that has endured since 1993, features Cathie Wood, CEO and CIO of Ark Investment Management, along with reporters from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.\n\nEarly in the interview, Wood compares the overall market cap of Bitcoin (in which she includes BCH) to the cap of companies such as Apple or Amazon. She says:\n\n“The network value of Bitcoin when you include Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is little over $100 bln. So it’s come up and it’s come very fast. But it’s at a fraction of Apple’s valuation, of Amazon’s valuation, and we think its a much bigger idea than either of those.”\n\nBankers and the changing financial world\n\nDuring the interview, the discussion turns to the ways that Bitcoin will disrupt the banking industry. Because it circumvents bankers, all three participants in the interview agree that the banking industry is very much not pro-Bitcoin. However, according to Wood:\n\n“This actually is increasing the public’s interest in [Bitcoin]. So you have Jamie Dimon - very public figure, very well known - along with Howard Marks of Oaktree…all negative. Interestingly, the following week after Jamie’s comment, James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley…speaking about it in very different tones.

10/23/2017,"[""After rallying to a new record high, bitcoin is once again trending down.\n\nAccording to Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin prices dipped below $5,800 this morning – prices first passed the $6,000 mark on Friday and set the new all-time high (of $6,148) at 15:00 UTC on Saturday. That figure takes the cumulative returns from the September low of $2,980 to more than 100 percent.\n\nThe record rally indicates that the regulatory crackdown in China, and subsequent fears of similar restrictions across the globe, have failed to dampen investor sentiment. Meanwhile, the potential benefits of holding bitcoin ahead of another hard fork (in November) – which promises the creation of a new cryptocurrency – have only boosted its appeal.\n\nHowever, price action analysis suggests BTC could be setting up for a deeper pullback.\n\nIt's worth noting that bitcoin has rallied close to 500 percent since the start of 2017. In light of the stellar gains, a pullback of more than 20 percent will qualify as healthy correction and not a bear market as widely believed. (A drop of 20 percent or more is considered an entry into a bear market.)\n\nPotential bearish divergence\n\nThe daily chart shows:\n\nPrices stuck at channel resistance\n\nRelative strength index (RSI) is overbought\n\nMoney flow index (MFI) has breached the rising trend line and has turned downwards from the overbought region\n\nLower highs on the RSI and MFI\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI), also known as volume-weighted RSI, is an oscillator that uses both price and volume to indicate overbought and oversold conditions.\n\nView\n\nPotential bearish reversal pattern : A negative close below $5,755 (Sunday's low) would confirm the bearish doji reversal and bearish RSI & MFI divergence.

But in the past few weeks, several major money movers have come out against the hot cryptocurrency.\n\nNow, Saudi billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has thrown in his skeptical two cents, joining a crowd of establishment investment professionals that include JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock investment group CEO Larry Fink.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmbed What is Bitcoin & How is it used 1:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\n""It just doesn\'t make sense.

The coin\'s allowance for virtually anonymous transactions and minimal to zero fees have turned it into a favorite haven for those looking to move money around internationally and avoid their country\'s currency controls.\n\nJust days ago his chief investment strategist Richard Turnill told Business Insider that ""there\'s no inherent right or wrong price for Bitcoin"" and since he\'s incapable of assigning it any value he\'s not an owner.\n\nAs the price of the digital currency rises, so does the hype, with everyone from school bus drivers to celebrities jumping on board.\n\nHowever, with the inability to value the coins under classic models, and the lack of regulation or consumer protection from insider trading and market manipulating, these big name financiers are hitting the brakes hard.\n\nSome see that as a bit of sour grapes.\n\nSelf-preservation?\n\n""I believe they are speaking out, at least partially, out of self-interest in the sense that if bitcoin takes off, their respective institutions stand to suffer as it offers an alternative method of payment that bypasses the traditional banking system,"" Dr. Chen, an associate professor of finance at the University of Texas, told NBC News.\n\nOthers think it\'s sound investment advice, and that hating on Bitcoin might simply be a generational issue.\n\nPatrick Lach, an investment adviser with Lach Financial and an associate professor of finance at Bellarmine University in Kentucky said that he\'s had only two clients ask about it as an investment vehicle — but gets several questions each semester from his students.\n\n""Like baseball cards, comic books, and collectible stamps, Bitcoin does not produce any cash flows other than the terminal value that someone will receive after selling Bitcoin,"" Lach told NBC News. Just as with collectibles, someone who purchases Bitcoin is a speculator, not an investor, he said.\n\n""There is nothing wrong with speculating in a particular asset class, but one needs to be sure that they will have enough income generated from their other investments and social security to support their needs in retirement before speculating in an asset class,"" he added.\n\nSign of the times\n\nAnd then there\'s the ""any press is good press"" mentality. Just the fact that these big names feel compelled to give an opinion, negative or not, may be a sign of the cryptocoins\' growing maturity.\n\n""It is a testament to the growing importance of cryptocurrency and Blockchain that financial services industry leaders are forming views,"" said Salil Patroda, Executive Director of Trinity Lane Capital, a tech and cryptocurrency investor.', ""The price of ether fell to a one-month low today.\n\nThe ether-US dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate slid to $275, its lowest level since Sept. 23, according to available market data.

Still, the development is notable in that it contrasts with ether's meteoric performance during the first half of the year, during which time it was speculated that it could even pass bitcoin in terms of total market capitalization.\n\nEther prices hit a record high of $400 before China moved to ban the initial coin offering (ICO) funding model in early September. Markets have perhaps yet to recover from that blow, given that ethereum serves as a platform for decentralized application development and funding through ICOs.\n\nWhile bitcoin prices took a hit on ICO ban and exchange shutdowns in China, it eventually rallied more than 100 percent from the Sep. 15 low of $2,980 to fresh record highs above $6,100.\n\nPrice charts via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Startups that want to raise money for their cryptocurrency are using Initial Coin Offerings. Instead of offering shares to investors like a traditional Initial Public Offering on the stock market, the company offers digital currency tokens. They claim that when - or if - the currency takes off, the early investors could see huge rewards. It\'s hoped these fledgeling currencies will reach the value of Bitcoin, once worthless and now valued at one Bitcoin for £4,000. There are currently around 16 million in circulation. Transactions are made without middlemen, so there are no transaction fees and no need to give your real name.

That\'s one of the key ways that this is self-governing, for the first time, you\'re not tied to a single blockchain, you can run metronome contracts on any EVM compatible blockchain.""\n\nAs for how it will impact the Bloq business model, today focused on enterprise services, Garzik and co-founder Matt Roszak indicated they believe the project is consistent with the firm\'s ""multi-token, multi-network"" vision for blockchain development.\n\nLaunched in 2016 with the goal of bringing Red Hat-inspired services to bitcoin, Garzik echoed a familiar refrain in an interview, voicing his belief bitcoin is still destined to form the ""root of an Internet of blockchains,"" others of which may have different use cases and attributes.\n\nIn this light, Garzik framed metronome as seeking to offer a utility to those who want a more reliable store of value and foundation for distributed applications.\n\n""We feel that there is a consistent demand for a cross-chain option. I point to the major uncertainty of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work, where the proof-of-stake system is going to change the money supply, but [ethereum] hasn\'t stated how much it will change,"" he said.\n\nThat said, Garzik said metronome isn\'t exactly a bid to replace the prevailing public blockchains available on the market, so much as to tailor them to a different audience.\n\n""You can expect the bitcoin maximalists\' from the ethereum maximalists\' reactions, but it\'s building on the strength of existing blockchains, it\'s not trying to elbow them aside,"" he said.\n\nNo \'existential risks\'\n\nBut if some of the more acrimonious debates in the cryptocurrency world seem besides the point, Garzik\'s involvement appears to have left him with inspiration for his latest work.\n\nAs outlined in the metronome white paper, one of the chief selling points of the token is that it boasts ""zero founder control"" after its launch, and as such, is resistant ""to the whims of individual or community discord"" by functioning as a series of smart contracts.\n\nAll told, metronome is comprised of four types of smart contracts, which allocate the distribution of new tokens, regulate supply and liquidity and move funds between accounts.\n\nPraised as a feature by the Bloq team, Roszak believes this sophisticated automation will encourage large investors who have yet to put money into public cryptocurrencies for fear of the seemingly erratic decision-making by developer groups to do so.\n\n""When they analyze cryptocurrency, the analysts engineers and economists sitting at the committee, they\'re saying they pick the top two – bitcoin and ether. Then they say, well there\'s forks, \'civil wars,\' \'proof of Vitalik,\'"" Roszak posited. ""They\'re cryptographically secure but these components create surprise and risk.""\n\nIn contrast, Roszak framed the Metronome token as ""fixed and locked in stone,"" attributes he suggested should counter these concerns.\n\nHowever, Roszak seemed to shirk the idea that the nascent state of blockchain technology could pose problems given the fixed nature of the distribution system of the cryptocurrency. Rather, he sought to stress that while the monetary network is set, flexibility will be provided in the ability of the token to port the system between blockchains.\n\n""Having that rigidity of knowing exactly what the token does and behaves, that certainty, seeing that mintage curve, is not available in any other cryptocurrency,"" he said.\n\nMonetary network\n\nEqually unique, however, is how the token will seek to operate on launch.\n\nAs described in its announcement materials, metronome is opening with an initial auction of 10 million MTN, with 8 million MTN being made available to the public and 2 million being set aside for Bloq as the principal development team.\n\nAny proceeds of the sale will be sent to smart contracts that will manage the distribution of the funds, which Garzik said will distribute the proceeds ""over decades"" to metronome users.\n\nAs an example, there will be a stable allocation of new metronome tokens daily, with about 2,880 MTN created during the first 40 years.\n\nHere, too, Garzik sees metronome as offering an innovation in a market where most cryptocurrencies are scheduled to reduce their supplies to zero.\n\n""That\'s one of the worries about the bitcoin-type supply curves, and it\'s assumed and hoped that that will pay to sustain the system. But, that\'s just a hope,"" Garzik said.\n\nStill, it\'s here where metronome perhaps could run into issues similar to the ones it\'s seeking to avoid in its design. Noted in the white paper is how certain groups could take steps to alter the supply rate.\n\n""A consortium could agree to fork the MTN supply with a new MTN contract on the same or different chains, by exporting funds they control to the new fork,"" the white paper reads.\n\nThat such decisions could also form the subject of infighting is not addressed in the paper.\n\nSale details\n\nArmed with this roadmap, Bloq is moving ahead on the launch of the token, setting a date for the first week of December for its token sale.\n\nAccording to Roszak, the Metronome code has undergone three audits since it was first written, from Ethereum Foundation member Gustav Simonson; Demian Brener, CEO of smart contract review services provider Zeppelin; and Martin Swende, security lead at the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nOn release to the public, Bloq will aim to use a descending price auction model by which tokens become less expensive to purchase as the sale progresses.\n\nYet, it was the current state of the code that was perhaps the biggest selling point of a sale.\n\n""Today, you can raise money with a good idea, but as some of these things get pressure-tested, you\'ll have to launch with code, then you\'ll have to launch with users,"" Roszak said.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""We\'re launching with code that\'s ready.""\n\nMetronome Media Kit FAQ by CoinDesk on Scribd\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Bloq.\n\nMetronome image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The conversation was around artificial intelligence, but the topic of Bitcoin emerged as well.\n\nWozniak feels a currency is more “stable” when it cannot be diluted and, while Bitcoin has a fixed future supply (only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined), the same cannot be said about government-backed fiat currencies.\n\n“There is a certain finite amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” Wozniak said in explaining that the U.S. government could wind up printing more dollars for political reasons. He described the U.S. dollar as “kind of phony” in that sense, while describing Bitcoin as more “genuine and real.”\n\nSimilarly, he said, gold does not necessarily have a fixed supply either, because humans will continue to find more efficient ways to dig it out of the earth.\n\n“Gold gets mined and mined and mined,” Wozniak said. “Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but Bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.”\n\nHe compared owning Bitcoin to owning a house. “Your house has value. And if it is a house today, 40 years from now, it still is a house in value,” he said, even if the price goes up and the government draws more taxes out of it.\n\nMathematical Appreciation\n\nWozniak said he “admired” Bitcoin when the digital currency was first presented.\n\n“I looked at it as a form of currency,” he said, adding that initially he did not understand the underlying blockchain technology but now he does.\n\nHe said, initially, he had a tough time buying bitcoin because that required setting up a special bank account. The process, he said was “so awkward, it kept me from getting early bitcoin.” When he finally was able to buy bitcoin, he said the price immediately dropped in half.\n\nBut those kind of numbers don’t mean so much to Wozniak. “I am not financial,” he told the crowd, admitting he never followed the price of bitcoin, nor the price of Apple stock but said he was drawn to bitcoin because it was based on mathematics.\n\n“My wife and I, we judge a hotel room more by the number on the door than what is inside the room. We are both mathematicians,” he said.\n\nCountless Opportunities for Blockchain Technology\n\nWozniak also touched on Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology, and its importance in allowing people to transparently track things, like minerals.\n\n“Right now, there is conflict with minerals in the world, and you don’t want to buy conflict minerals. Well, how do you avoid it?” He continued by explaining how companies will usually buy gold from different countries and smelt it together, so there is no way of knowing where it all comes from. With blockchain-based solutions, however, tracking where that gold comes from is now possible.\n\n“They are applying the technology where all the payment can only go to the good, legitimate sources that don’t have conflict minerals,” he added.\n\nWozniak pointed out that, currently, there are so many applications popping up using blockchain technology that are so different than what people initially imagined, and it will take time to get used to.\n\nHe also likened the introduction of smart contract platforms, like Ethereum, to when computers first came out and suddenly people were writing “tens of thousands of programs” nobody had ever thought of before. Smart contract platforms open those same doors of opportunity.\n\n“There is a lot more to this cryptocurrency than just the Bitcoin,” he said.', 'Zimbabwe continues its fight for Bitcoin security, as US dollar scarcity sees exchanges demand $9,500 per coin Monday.\n\nAnalysis of local platform Golix.io reveals Bitcoin buy and sell rates which topped $10,000 in previous days.\n\nCurrently, traders can buy BTC for $9,500 and sell at $9,380.\n\nZimbabwe’s nascent cryptoeconomy\n\nThe troubled state of Zimbabwe’s nascent cryptoeconomy reveals the economic difficulties facing the country’s population, as inflation soars again and dollar cash shortages become ever more present.\n\nVince Musewe, a Harare-based economist, told local news publication The National:\n\n“The problem is the exact opposite of what it was during hyperinflation. Then, there was plenty of cash money, but no goods in the shops. Now, there are goods on the shelves but no money to buy them with.”\n\nIn May, the government admitted it was importing $10 mln worth of the greenback every week to shore up availability.\n\nVenezuela’s advanced testbed\n\nIn more advanced Bitcoin ‘testbed’ Venezuela meanwhile, it’s Bitcoin mining that’s hitting unprecedented levels, with reports suggesting over 100,000 citizens are now involved in the practice.\n\nWhile the subject of a state crackdown earlier this year, using the national grid to squeeze extra profit out of the comparatively stable Bitcoin has proven too good an opportunity to miss for those whose national fiat currency is practically worthless.\n\nElectrum contributor Randy Brito, who named the figure, explained to the AFP at the weekend:', 'Cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX has told users to dump SegWit2x Bitcoins “immediately” following November’s hard fork.\n\nIn a dedicated trading strategy blog post, BitMEX, which earlier this month signaled its opposition to all hard forks, described SegWit2x as a “shitcoin.”\n\n“He who sells first, sells best,” the post advises in reference to divesting oneself of non-Core chain coins.\n\n“On the ex-date (expected to be on or around Nov. 20), you will receive B2X in a 1:1 ratio. These B2X coins should be immediately sold for USD.

10/24/2017,"['The price of bitcoin fell to a five-day low today, though the reasons why are perhaps complex to unpack.\n\nAt press time, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is $5,710, up from a daily low of $5,560. As per CoinMarketCap, week-on-week, BTC is up 3.3 percent, while on a monthly basis, it\'s up 55 percent.\n\nHowever, if you\'re looking for a culprit for the dip, industry observers are so far pointing to the creation of bitcoin gold yesterday.\n\nA new cryptocurrency cloned from bitcoin, bitcoin gold is now in the process of ""forking"" to a new blockchain (with new rules), a process by which the bitcoin blockchain is copied and new digital assets are distributed to existing bitcoin owners.\n\nAs put forward by analysts including Blockchain Capital\'s Spencer Bogart, a former head of research and Needham and Co., the decline could be a sign investors are moving money to alternatives now that bitcoin gold has initiated the fork. Bogart\'s argument is that bitcoin rallied ahead of the launch in anticipation that holders would be credited with bitcoin gold.\n\nHowever, it\'s unclear whether this could be the case. As the new cryptocurrency was not yet distributed, investors may have simply switched out of bitcoin positions on the basis further sell pressure is ahead on the distribution.\n\nBut, while it\'s too early to tell, the next question is simply, is the pullback in bitcoin over?\n\nPrice action analysis suggests a potential for further losses.\n\nDaily chart\n\nBitcoin gold aside, the retreat from the record highs above $6,100 can also be credited to overbought technical conditions, and in this light, considered to qualify as a healthy correction.\n\nThe chart above shows:\n\nBearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence\n\nBearish price-money flow index (MFI) divergence\n\nRising trend line (dotted blue line) support is seen around $5,280 levels\n\nView\n\nThe doors are open for a drop to $5,280 levels.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'A new cryptocurrency called bitcoin gold (BTG) officially separated from the bitcoin blockchain this morning – and the project\'s website has been under denial-of-service attacks ever since.\n\nAiming to be a more egalitarian derivative of the popular cryptocurrency, one able to be mined with less specialized hardware, the first step on the bitcoin gold roadmap was to take a ""snap shot"" of the blockchain as a means of a creating a replica with new rules. As detailed in CoinDesk\'s explainer, BTG now plans to distribute free cryptocurrency in such a way that it is available to anyone holding bitcoin at the time of the fork.\n\nNot long after this process initiated, however, the developer team began reporting challenges:\n\n""Massive DDoS attack on our cloud site. 10M requests per minute. We are working with the providers to ban all the IPs. We will be up soon!""\n\nBut hours later, it seems like the website is still being bombarded, preventing those who wish to keep track of the cryptocurrency\'s progress. Complicating matters is that the new blockchain is not yet public, and block explorers or other common tracking tools have yet to be released.\n\nStill, denial-of-service attacks are a common occurrence in the launch of cryptocurrency projects, especially those that prove controversial or divisive, and bitcoin gold meets this definition. Behind the project is Hong Kong-based LightningAsic CEO Jack Liao, who is openly critical about bitcoin mining in its current form, and the companies that profit from the activity.\n\nIt\'s probable that his opinions could make bitcoin gold a target for attacks, but as well as this point of contention, the project has been the cause of some other criticism.\n\nNamely, BTG uses a process by which cryptocurrency will be privately created before it is open-sourced to the public. This process has been the cause of volatile discussion on developer channels, and has caused some to distrust the cryptocurrency.\n\nThere\'s a few other sources of outrage – including that bitcoin gold hasn\'t quite solved the risk of ""replay attack"" – which refers to transaction complications that may arise when two incompatible versions of the bitcoin blockchain are unable to distinguish each other.\n\nThat said, the cryptocurrency is still under development, and there has yet to be official word from the project on the cause of the outage.\n\nBroken keyboard via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

I just don’t believe in this Bitcoin thing. I think it’s just going to implode one day. I think this is Enron in the making.”\n\nThe Saudi billionaire was referring to the 2001 bankruptcy of Enron, which resulted from widespread accounting fraud, CNBC noted.\n\nBitcoin is available for trade in Saudi Arabia, the CNBC article reported. The Saudi Monetary Ministry, however, warned in a Twitter post that trading in the currency may have “negative consequences” for the finances of those who choose to invest.\n\nThe value of the cryptocurrency has risen more than 500 percent in 2017, hitting a record high of $6,100 on Saturday, Oct. 21. Coindesk reports prices fell to $5,718 on Monday (Oct. 23). This comes in spite of a split of the cryptocurrency into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in August and a Chinese crackdown on digital coins in September, according to CNBC.\n\nCNBC also reported that Bitcoin prices surges are due, in part, to interest among Japanese investors. According to CryptoCompare, Japanese yen accounted for 62 percent of total trading volume on Monday, while U.S. dollars accounted for approximately 20 percent.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian billionaire investor joins a chorus of voices maintaining skepticism of Bitcoin, with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon calling the cryptcurrency a “fraud” last month and Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, referring to Bitcoin an “index of money laundering.”\n\nDespite skepticism regarding unregulated cryptocurrencies, financial institutions — including JPMorgan — have shown interest in the blockchain technology that supports them.', 'Anzeige\n\nDer Online-Riese Amazon könnte schon bald die Kryptowährung Bitcoin als Zahlungsmittel zulassen. Entsprechende Gerüchte verdichteten sich in den vergangenen Wochen im kalifornischen Silicon Valley. Stimmen aus dem Umfeld innovativer Finanz-Firmen, sogenannter Fintechs, stützen nach Informationen der WELT eine frühere Aussage des Investors, Buchautors und Start-up-Gründers James Altucher.\n\nDer oft gut informierte Großanleger hatte bereits vor Wochen in seinem „Altucher Report“ die Erwartung geäußert, dass Amazon den Schritt bereits zur Vorlage von Bilanzzahlen am Donnerstag dieser Woche ankündigen könnte. Amazon wäre damit der erste Weltkonzern, der eine auf Software basierende virtuelle Währung als Zahlungsmittel akzeptiert.\n\nFintech-Kreise im amerikanischen Silicon Valley stützten jetzt diese Spekulation. Selbst wenn das Datum 26. Oktober nicht gehalten werden könne, sei die Bitcoin-Einführung vermutlich zeitnah zu erwarten, hieß es. Es wäre ein Meilenstein, nicht nur für Bitcoin, sondern für digitales Geld insgesamt. Die Ausbreitung von Kryptowährungen in großem Stil könnte weitreichende Folgen auf den Banken-Sektor und die Finanzbranche allgemein haben.\n\nAmazon könnte sich als Innovationsführer positionieren\n\nAnzeige\n\nAuf Nachfrage der WELT blieb Amazon ein eindeutiges Dementi schuldig: Man habe „zum Thema Ihrer Anfrage keine Ankündigung gemacht“, erklärte ein Konzernsprecher lediglich. Es sei bei Amazon üblich, „sich erst dann zu neuen Produkten oder Services zu äußern, wenn sie für unsere Kunden nutzbar sind – und uns bis dahin an etwaigen Spekulationen nicht zu beteiligen“.\n\nBranchenkenner halten die Gerüchte gleichwohl für stichhaltig. „Ich sehe sind keinen Grund, warum Amazon Bitcoins nicht als Zahlungsmittel zulassen sollte“, sagt Oliver Flaskämper, Chef von Bitcoin Deutschland. Der US-Technologieriese könne sich damit als Innovationsführer positionieren, zugleich bleibe das Wechselkursrisiko beim Käufer. „Bereits jetzt ist es über Dienstleister möglich, bei Amazon einzukaufen und mit Bitcoins zu zahlen“, erklärt Flaskämper, der den größten deutschen Handelsplatz für Kryptowährungen betreibt.\n\nQuelle: Infografik Die Welt\n\nDienstleister wie all4btc.com nehmen Bitcoins, tauschen sie ihrerseits in Euro oder Dollar und bezahlen damit die bestellten Waren bei dem Online-Händler. Über kurz oder lang könnte Amazon sich entscheiden, den Umweg über Dienstleister überflüssig zu machen.\n\nBitcoin ist die bekannteste digitale Währung\n\nAnzeige\n\nDer Bitcoin (englisch für „digitale Münze“) ist die bekannteste der mehr als 900 digitalen Währungen, die in den vergangenen Monaten einen teilweise rapiden Wertzuwachs verzeichnet haben. Zu Jahresbeginn noch rund 1000 Euro wert, wurde ein „BTC“ zuletzt für mehr als das Fünffache gehandelt.\n\nAndere Kryptowährungen wie Ether konnten ihren Kurs sogar vervierzigfachen. Selbst Kennern fällt es zuweilen schwer, den Überblick zu behalten, zumal die unterschiedlichen digitalen Münzen mit ganz speziellen Eigenschaften ausgestattet sein können und zusätzlich durch Verzweigungen („Forks“) immer neue Abspaltungen entstehen können. So ist aus dem 2009 eingeführten Bitcoin bereits Bitcoin Cash hervorgegangen. Noch diese Woche soll ein Bitcoin Gold hinzukommen.\n\nQuelle: Infografik Die Welt\n\nPolitiker, Notenbanker und Finanzexperten beobachten das Treiben mit Argusaugen. An Warnungen herrscht kein Mangel. Der Chef des US-Geldhauses JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, verglich Bitcoins mit der holländischen Tulpenmanie, an deren Ende viele Spekulanten ihr letztes Hemd verloren.\n\nEx-IWF-Chefökonom Kenneth Rogoff warnte ebenfalls vor einer Spekulationsblase, und jüngst blies auch der saudische Milliardär und Großinvestor Prinz al-Walid ibn Talal ins gleiche Horn: Kryptowährungen erinnerten ihn an das Betrugsunternehmen Enron, das Anleger mit getürkten Zahlen angelockt hatte und schließlich implodierte. So werde es auch Bitcoin ergehen.\n\nLesen Sie auch Kryptowährungen Was Paris Hilton mit dem Bitcoin-Crash zu tun hat\n\nEs gebe keine Regulierung und keine Zentralbank, und das heiße auch, dass niemand über die Stabilität der digitalen Münzen wache. Umgekehrt hatte Goldman-Sachs-Chef Lloyd Blankfein jüngst Interesse an Bitcoin bekundet. Als Papiergeld Gold ersetzt habe, seien die Leute ebenfalls skeptisch gewesen, schrieb er in Anspielung auf vergangene Innovationswellen. Sollten sich Kryptowährungen durchsetzen, wäre das in der Tat nicht mehr und nicht weniger als eine monetäre Revolution.\n\nQuelle: Infografik Die Welt\n\nGenau als eine solche war der Bitcoin ursprünglich auch in die Welt gesetzt worden. Der Bitcoin sollte die Macht der Banken brechen. Die Identität des Bitcoin-Schöpfers, der unter dem Pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto bekannt ist, wurde bis heute nicht gelüftet. Die Grundidee des Bitcoin ist es, einen sicheren und bei Bedarf anonymen Zahlungsverkehr zu ermöglichen, ohne dabei auf Banken als „Mittler“ angewiesen zu sein. Die Währung wird mit Hilfe einer dezentralen Datenbank, der sogenannten Blockchain, aufbewahrt und transferiert. Das Datenpaket trägt dabei gewissermaßen seine eigene „Geburtsurkunde“ sowie die Liste aller vorherigen Transaktionen stets mit sich, so dass Fälschungen und Manipulationen ausgeschlossen sind.\n\nGeldschöpfung wird durch Rechenleistung begrenzt\n\nAufgrund der zugrunde liegenden Verschlüsselungstechnologie oder Kryptografie ist auch von einer „Kryptowährung“ die Rede. Die Menge ausgegebener Bitcoins ist begrenzt. Die Geldschöpfung („Mining“) wird durch Algorithmen und die nötigen Menge an Rechnerkapazität begrenzt. Bis ungefähr 2130 können maximal 21 Millionen Einheiten geschaffen werden. Dadurch ist eine Inflationierung der Geldmenge anders als bei Papierwährungen ausgeschlossen.\n\nNeben dem Bitcoin und der Abspaltung Bitcoin Cash haben sich die alternativen Währungen Ethereum, Ripple und Litecoin an die Spitze des Kryptokosmos gesetzt. Insgesamt ist der Bitcoin aber führend. Als erster seiner Art steht er trotz mancher Mängel seiner ursprünglichen Blockchain, zum Beispiel ihrer großen Daten- und Energie-Intensität, für fast 60 Prozent der Krypto-Marktkapitalisierung.\n\nStaatlich gelenkte Volkswirtschaften wie Russland und China wollen die Bitcoin-Nutzung beschränken, um nicht die Kontrolle und Übersicht über Finanztransfers zu verlieren. China hat eine bereits eine eigene, staatliche kontrollierte Krypto-Währung namens „Neo“ ausgerollt, in Russland ist ein „CryptoRubel“ geplant.\n\nAmazon könnte konzerneigene Kryptowährung einführen\n\nWegen der großen Kursschwankungen des Bitcoin gilt die Währung im Handel bislang als wenig praktikabel. Fintech-Kreise spekulieren daher, dass Amazon einen „Amazon-Token“, also eine mit einem Zahlungsversprechen hinterlegte, konzerneigene Kryptowährung einführen könnte. Bitcoins könnten dann nach bestimmten Regeln in „Amazon-Coins“ oder „Token“ getauscht werden.\n\nLesen Sie auch Währungsspekulation Die kühne Wette auf den nächsten Höhenflug des Bitcoin\n\nSollte sich Amazon dazu durchringen, Bitcoin zu akzeptieren, rechnen Beobachter mit weiterem Preisauftrieb für die digitalen Münzen. „Das wird den Kurs sicherlich positiv beeinflussen“, sagt Flaskämper von Bitcoin Deutschland. Eine solche Nachricht könnte für weitere fünf bis zehn Prozent Kurssteigerung gut sein.', 'Jeff Garzik, one of a handful of key developers who helped build the underlying software for bitcoin that is known as blockchain, has seen its shortcomings firsthand. So he decided to create a better digital currency.\n\nHe’s calling it Metronome and says it will be the first that can jump between different blockchains. For example, coins that are used for applications on the Ethereum blockchain will be able to move to Ethereum Classic before jumping onto Qtum or Rootstock, which connects with the bitcoin blockchain, said Mr Garzik.\n\nThe mobility means that if one blockchain dies out as the result of infighting among developers or slackened use, metronome owners can move their holdings elsewhere. That should help the coins retain value, and ensure their longevity, Mr Garzik, co-founder of startup Bloq that created metronome, said in a phone interview. It will be unveiled on Tuesday at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas.\n\n“Institutional investors should be very excited to see something like this,” Matthew Roszak, the other co-founder of Bloq and chairman of industry advocate Chamber of Digital Commerce, said in a phone interview. “We’ve built a thousand-year cryptocurrency, something that’s built to last.”\n\nThat’s a concern for many digital currencies. Infighting among developers and various supporters, and the slow pace of enhancements on the bitcoin blockchain have helped to limit use. Both bitcoin and its main rival, ethereum, have split into several versions.\n\nNew blockchains are also being launched every month, creating uncertainty for investors and leading to wild swings in many cryptocurrencies’ prices. While bitcoin’s price has increased nearly sixfold this year, a split-off version, bitcoin cash, is down 23 per cent since its inception in July, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhile seeking to side-step some of these challenges, metronome will have some of its own. It’s starting out with zero users, compared with 35 million active bitcoin users a month. There are more than 1,100 tokens and currencies competing for users, according to CoinMarketCap. The token will first be issued on ethereum, and support for ethereum classic and other blockchains is expected within months.\n\nMetronome’s coins will be produced and supported by autonomous distributed software that isn’t controlled by anyone, and can’t be changed. This software will auction off metronome, beginning in December, and keep and use the proceeds to boost the currency’s price. The rest of the project will be open sourced, so anyone will be able to build applications with metronome in mind.\n\nBloq will provide developer tools for corporate users. The company and others that helped create and promote the cryptocurrency will retain 2 million metronome coins, out of an initial trove of 10 million to be auctioned off in December. Every 24 hours, 2,880 new coins will be added to the supply.\n\nMetronome sidesteps a problem that’s common for consumers that want to jump from one blockchain — say, bitcoin — to another. They have to go to an online exchange, and sell their bitcoins and buy another cryptocurrency. That includes exchange fees, plus the risk of losing out on any appreciation of the currency they dump. With metronome, they won’t have to do either.\n\nBusiness picture of the day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 show all Business picture of the day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/7 Bitcoin saw a volatile week in which it reached highs of $11,000 before dropping down by more than a fifth on Wednesday.\n\n2/7 Jeremy Corbyn told investment bank Morgan Stanley that it is right to regard him as a threat.\n\n3/7 RBS announced plans to close 259 branches, costing 680 jobs, in response to customers migrating towards online and mobile-banking services.

Now, the stock picker has hedged his bet on the cryptocurrency market to hit $2 trillion in the coming years that will effectively see bitcoin rise to 12x its price today above $50,000\n\nAppearing in a media interview with CNBC’s “Capital Connection” today, Moas put the spotlight on $200 trillion in the combined global markets of gold, stocks, bonds and cash. All of which he would be shunning, for bitcoin.\n\nHe stated:\n\nI’m not excited about putting my money in any four of those options right now. If 1% of that $200 trillion finds its way into cryptocurrency in the next 10 years, you will be looking at a $2 trillion valuation, 12x what it is today, and that will drive bitcoin price above $50,000.\n\n“You have a supply-demand equation here that is mind-boggling. There will be a situation in a couple of years where there are 200 million people around the world trying to get their hands on a few million bitcoins,” he explained. “That is going to drive price to $50,000 – a $1 trillion dollar valuation [of bitcoin] which is less than 15% of what gold is at today.”\n\nMoas was asked about his take on recent criticism from JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon who labeled bitcoin a ‘fraud’ and billionaire Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who said bitcoin will ‘implode’ like Enron.\n\nThe stock analyst said these critics are “heavily invested in publicly-traded US banks”, banks which are “threatened” by bitcoin.\n\nHe added:\n\nSo, I don’t expect those people to come out and recommend [anyone] to buy bitcoin, because that hurts their business.\n\nMoas went on to add that 95% of the 1000+ cryptocurrencies are pump-and-dump scam operations, similar to the dot-com bubble from the 90s. His focus only extends to the top 20 cryptocurrencies which make up over 90% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. At the time of publishing, the total crypto market cap stands at $170 billion, according to data from Coinmarketcap.\n\nMoas went on to add, bullishly:\n\nPeople need to start taking this seriously because today bitcoin caught up with Goldman Sachs.

The cryptocurrency fell from a record high after the so-called hard fork, just as stocks typically drop after going ex-dividend. Other major digital currencies including ethereum gained, as investors sold bitcoin and moved the cash to alternatives, said Gavin Yeung, chief executive officer at investment company Cryptomover.\n\n“It’s very healthy for the ecosystem to be able to say, I am an investor, I collect my dividend, and then I can do what I want with my investment,” Yeung said on Tuesday.\n\nThere are, of course, differences. Unlike a stock payout, in order to get the additional bitcoin gold, investors have to be using a wallet or exchange that supports the new asset. Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges, has said it won’t.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoin gold and an earlier offshoot called bitcoin cash arose from conflicting visions within the decentralized community -- as opposed to a conscious decision to boost investor returns.

10/25/2017,"['Bitcoin Gold came into existence on Tuesday as a new iteration of the original Bitcoin Blockchain forked off. This fork comes less than three months after the controversial Bitcoin Cash fork and its effects are being felt.\n\nIt should be noted that the use of the word “fork” is done lightly. As Bitcoin Gold has essentially zero chance of replacing Bitcoin in the marketplace, it’s more of an air-drop than a chain split. However, there has been some market turbulence.\n\nThe aim of Bitcoin Gold\n\nBitcoin Gold is “an adjustment” of the Bitcoin Blockchain that claims to try and once again make mining accessible to the general public. Miners and major mining operations and pools have presumably annexed this aspect of the cryptocurrency marketplace, and some tout Bitcoin Gold as the solution.\n\n“This is what will be required to make fair mining accessible to the general public once again,” said Robert Khune, a strategist at the Bitcoin Gold project. “A successful fork will prove that Bitcoin always has the ability to escape from any potential abusive mining hardware manufacturers,” who he blamed for “unnecessary stalling” this year.\n\nWhy the downturn?\n\nBitcoin dropped 4.4 percent to $5,652 as of 8:55 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, paring a decline of as much as 5.9 percent. The cryptocurrency is still up 36 percent this month and about six-fold percent this year.\n\n“Bitcoin’s recent downturn has been driven by the traders’ anticipation of minor disarray in the wake of the upcoming hard forks,” said Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin. “The Bitcoin exchange and wallet community have been divided over their decisions to support or reject these contentious hard forks.”\n\nMany are also speculating that Bitcoin rallied ahead of this fork as there is the opportunity to essentially double your coins. Holders of Bitcoin would also be credited with equal amounts of Bitcoin Gold. However, not many exchanges have offered support of Bitcoin Gold.\n\nFurther splits on the way\n\nFurther splits may be imminent. One faction of the community wants to increase Bitcoin’s block size to shorten transaction times, while another is opposed. The first phase of this plan, called SegWit2x, was implemented in August and took some of the data off the main network.\n\nAgain, this next fork is being met with more opposition as cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX has told users to dump SegWit2x Bitcoins “immediately” following November’s hard fork - labeling them ‘ShitCoin2x.’', 'Singapore has no plans of regulating cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and the central bank will keep “an open mind”, the authority’s chief has revealed.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s central bank and financial regulator, will not regulate cryptocurrencies but will “expect” intermediaries to implement anti-money laundering controls, according to MAS managing director Ravi Menon.\n\nSpeaking an interview with Bloomberg, the central banker was asked if cryptocurrencies like bitcoin require regulation if Singapore became hotbed for ICOs, a popular new form of fundraising enabled by cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn response, Menon said “very few jurisdictions regulate cryptocurrencies” before revealing the authority’s take on exerting control, if any.\n\nHe stated:\n\nWe’ve taken the approach that the currency itself does not pose the risk that warrants regulation. Our approach is to look at the activity around the cryptocurrency and then make an assessment of what regulation would be suitable.\n\nAs an example, Menon pointed to the expectation upon an intermediary dealing with cryptocurrencies, like a bitcoin exchange or trading platform, to establish anti-money laundering controls.\n\nRefreshingly, the central banker went against the usual narrative of an authority undermining cryptocurrencies, by stating:\n\n[I]t is a known fact that cryptocurrencies are quite often abused for illicit financing purposes, so we do want to have AML/CFT controls in place. So those requirements apply to the activity around cryptocurrency, rather than the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nMenon also expressed noteworthy comments for a central banker when he was asked to offer his views on the advent of cryptocurrencies into societies. Bitcoin has captured the mainstream’s attention this year, growing from $1,000 at the turn of 2017 to a recent all-time high near $6,200. The official pointed to the “hype” surrounding the value gains as a misguided approach to tapping into cryptocurrencies’ potential beyond a store of value.\n\nHe stated:\n\nPeople see it merely as an investment vehicle that’s going to rise in value. I think that’s a rather misguided approach to the use of cryptocurrencies. They can have potentially good applications in particular use cases…the cryptocurrency value isn’t important, it is the application in which they are used.\n\n‘Can they make cross-border inter-banking payments cheaper, faster and more efficient for migrant workers to send money back to their villages?” Menon asked, raising the question for the wider application of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe went on to add:\n\nIf it [cross-border remittance] was going through a blockchain using cryptocurrencies, it could yield benefits. That ought to be the question, rather than whether bitcoins or ether are going up in value or not.\n\nOne of the early adopters of blockchain technology among central banks globally, the MAS is heavily invested in testing and developing its own digital currency under the ‘Project Ubin’ banner – an initiative by the central bank to develop and deploy digitized Singaporean dollars on a blockchain. The MAS issued digital tokens of the Singaporean dollar over a private Ethereum blockchain in a trial earlier this year.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Regulation\n\nSingapore has no plans to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, according to the head of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. However, some laws are being formalized that could apply to some cryptocurrency activities and initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nAlso read: Putin Mandates Crypto and ICO Regulation Be Finalized by July 2018\n\nNo Plans to Regulate Bitcoin\n\nThe managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Ravi Menon, expressed in an interview on Tuesday that “Singapore doesn’t plan to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,” Bloomberg reported. However, he added that it “will remain alert to money laundering and other potential risks stemming from their use.” He was quoted saying:\n\nAs of now I see no basis for wanting to regulate cryptocurrencies.\n\nInstead, the central bank will focus on looking at “the activities surrounding the cryptocurrency and asking ourselves what kinds of risks they pose, which risks would require a regulatory response, and then proceed from there,” he detailed.\n\nRamon’s stance confirmed a statement by Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister, Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Responding to a parliamentary question regarding cryptocurrency regulation, he said, “we regulate the activities that surround them [cryptocurrencies], if those activities fall within our more general ambit as financial regulator.”\n\nSingapore’s Approach to Crypto Regulation\n\nMenon noted that Singapore already requires digital currency intermediaries such as bitcoin exchange operators to comply with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. “This will be formalized in the coming payment services regulation which we are working on,” he added.\n\nIn a different interview with Bloomberg Television, he shared, “very few jurisdictions regulate cryptocurrencies per se. Most have taken the approach that the currency itself does not pose a risk that warrants regulation.”\n\nLast month, a few banks in the country ceased doing business with several cryptocurrency startups. According to the local Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Industry Association, over ten companies have had issues with local banks, which provided no explanations for the account closures.\n\nSingapore’s Law for ICOs\n\n“If ICOs include the promise of a dividend or other economic benefits, they can resemble regular securities offerings and would, therefore, be covered by Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act [SFA],” Bloomberg conveyed Menon’s explanation on Tuesday.\n\nHis position reiterates the statement issued by MAS in August on ICOs, stating that:\n\nMAS’ position of not regulating virtual currencies is similar to that of most jurisdictions. However, MAS has observed that the function of digital tokens has evolved beyond just being a virtual currency.\n\nThe central bank further explained in its statement that digital tokens “may represent ownership or a security interest over an issuer’s assets or property,” which could make them “an offer of shares or units in a collective investment scheme under the SFA.” In addition, “digital tokens may also represent a debt owed by an issuer and be considered a debenture under the SFA.”\n\n“So we just have to look at them case by case to see which ones we will need to bring into the regulatory ambit, and which ones can stay outside,” Menon concluded.\n\nWhat do you think of Singapore’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies?

It’s biomimicry, finally, in the technology industry. A proper structure for maintaining encryption and security. But because of the nature of blockchain it’s also an asset class.\n\n“And I think this year has proven that Bitcoin is uncorrelated to equities, gold, interest rates, commodities. It’s an important security, I think, for investors to own.”\n\nTom Lee outlined his view on Bitcoin at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit on Wednesday. (Source: Yahoo Finance) More\n\nLee also outlined how Bitcoin is following Metcalfe’s Law, which essentially sketches out the value of a network based on how many users it has.\n\n“If you modeled something as simple as square the number of users plus transaction value, it’s explained 94% of [Bitcoin’s price appreciation] this year,” Lee said.\n\nAnd this chart from an earlier research note published by Fundstrat outlines this dynamic of the Bitcoin network’s usage and the increase in its price.\n\nThe rise in Bitcoin’s price this year has closely tracked the number of people using the network. (Source: Fundstrat) More\n\nLee put a $25,000 price target for Bitcoin by 2022 in a note to clients published earlier this year. This view is predicated on cryptocurrencies displacing gold in portfolios with Bitcoin serving a “digital store of value.”\n\nAfter starting 2017 near $1,000, Bitcoin prices have surged to nearly $6,000 as the cryptocurrency has become the most talked-about asset right now. This meteoric rise has of course brought out skeptics.\n\nBut to Lee, Bitcoin and the blockchain technology that underwrites it “represents an enhancement of digital trust.” And even a flattening of Bitcoin’s popularity, or a waning in support for Bitcoin among investors, will see the cryptocurrency’s value hold up.\n\n“Using a 90% deceleration of both factors [in Metcalfe’s Law] next year gets you to $6,000 by mid-2018,” Lee said Wednesday.\n\n“So basically we’re saying Bitcoin is going to hit a wall and Bitcoin is still going to be at $6,000.”\n\n—\n\nMyles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

Everybody seems to have an opinion on cryptocurrencies these days, and NYU finance professor Aswath Damoradan, known in trading circles as the “Dean of Valuations,” offered up his latest this week.\n\nHe defies categorization as a bull or bear because he finds himself disagreeing with bitcoin’s biting critics as well as its fervent backers.\n\n‘If you lose millions, please don’t let paranoia lead you to blame the establishment, banks and governments for why you lost.’ Aswath Damodaran\n\n“Unlike Jamie Dimon, I don’t believe that bitcoin is a fraud and that people who are ‘stupid enough to buy it’ will pay a price for that stupidity,” Damodaran wrote in a blog post. “Unlike its biggest cheerleaders, I don’t believe that cryptocurrencies are now or ever will be an asset class or that these currencies can change fundamental truths about risk, investing and management.”\n\nHe explained that the reason for the gaping divide is that the two sides disagree fundamentally on what bitcoin BTCUSD, +8.25% is. For his part, Damodaran argues bitcoin is not an asset, but a currency, “and as such, you cannot value it or invest in it. You can only price it and trade it.”\n\nSo where does it go from here? Damodaran sees three ultimate paths for bitcoin, as a currency, to take in the long term.\n\nWidespread acceptance in transactions globally\n\n“For this to happen,” he said, “it has to become more stable (relative to other currencies), central banks and governments around the world have to accept its use (or at least not actively try to impede it) and the aura of mystery around it has to fade.”\n\nShould this take place and it competes with fiat currencies, the high price will become justified, given there’s a finite amount available.\n\nGold for millennials\n\n“In this scenario, bitcoin becomes a haven for those who don’t trust central banks, governments and fiat currencies,” Damodaran said. “In short, it takes on the role that gold has, historically, for those who have lost trust in or fear centralized authority.”\n\nIf this happens, expect it to behave like gold: rising during crises and dropping during the good times.\n\nThe 21st Century tulip bulb\n\nThis is the one bitcoin enthusiasts hope — and believe — never happens.\n\n“In this, the worst case scenario, Bitcoin is like a shooting star, attracting more money as it soars, from those who see it as a source of easy profits,” Damodaran wrote. “But just as quickly flares out as these traders move on to something new and different (which could be a different and better designed digital currency), leaving Bitcoin holders with memories of what might have been.”\n\nHe admits he has no idea which way it goes from here, but those are the most realistic scenarios.\n\n“If you are trading in bitcoin, you may very well not care, since your time horizon may be in minutes and hours, not weeks, months or years,” Damodaran said. “If you have a longer term interest in Bitcoin, though, your focus should be less on the noise of day-to-day price movements and more on advancements on its use as a currency.”\n\nHe said he wouldn’t buy any bitcoin at these levels, but only because he’s not, and never has been, a good trader. Don’t let that stop you, though.\n\n“If you have good trading instincts, you should play the pricing game, as long as you recognize that it is a game, where you can win millions or lose millions, based upon your calls on momentum,” he said. “If you win millions, I wish you the best!

10/26/2017,"[""In Brief Today marks the launch of Bitcoin Gold, a hard fork from Bitcoin. The new cryptocurrency aims to make it more difficult for large companies to seize the lion's share of mining efforts.\n\nBitcoin Gold Standard\n\nIt seems that Bitcoin will experience another hard fork, much like the situation earlier this year that resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BTC). As of block 491,407, we’ll see another permutation of the cryptocurrency — dubbed Bitcoin Gold (BTG).\n\nThe idea behind Bitcoin Gold is a desire to make the cryptocurrency truly decentralized once again, as its creators believe that larger companies now have too much control over the network. To this end, the use of powerful mining systems known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) will be prohibited.\n\nThe team behind the project claims that a total of twenty exchanges and wallets have pledged their support for Bitcoin Gold. However, Coinbase – one of the most popular exchanges based in the US – has already stated that it won’t yet support the cryptocurrency, citing a lack of transparency.\n\nBitcoin Gold is set to be created before its source code is made available to the public. Coinbase has referred to this decision as a “major security risk” and, as such, the exchange is holding off on supporting the currency for the time being. Of course, this could change at a later date if it proves to be a success.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Coinbase tends to err on the side of caution when it comes to hard forks. The exchange has yet to provide official support for Bitcoin Cash, which launched in August 2017, though it plans to offer this capability by January 1, 2018.\n\nForking Off\n\nAnyone that is in possession of bitcoin will be issued Bitcoin Gold at a rate of one BTC to one BTG. The launch of this fork was marred by a distributed denial-of-service attack that took its website offline.\n\nOpinions are split over whether a hard fork is a good idea. While there are some that feel that Bitcoin can be improved upon, others feel that this kind of activity only serves to dilute the market, potentially stifling cryptocurrency as a whole.\n\nBitcoin Gold is the brainchild of LightningAsic CEO Jack Liao, who has made no secret of his thoughts on the bitcoin mining landscape. His company sells GPUs and other hardware that can be used to mine Bitcoin Gold which could perhaps explain his desire to pursue a hard fork of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the first few hours of trading, the price of Bitcoin Gold fell harshly, but it’s obviously far too early to tell if it will be a success in the long run. The cryptocurrency market is constantly changing as it grows, but it remains to be seen whether or not upstarts will be able to compete with the more established players in the industry.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets.

The market is likely to remain flat until then, provided there is no important news.\n\nMoreover, market participants are wondering how events will unfold regarding the upcoming and much more serious SegWit2x hard fork. November promises to be ‘hot’.\n\nBTC/USD 26.10.2017\n\nThis week, Bitcoin switched from an uptrend to a downtrend, plummeting to $5,315;\n\nAs of now, BTC/USD is being traded at the $5,900 level, just above the strong $5,800-$5,850 pivot level;\n\nIt remains to be seen whether today’s rally will continue, or if the sudden surge in price will not have enough strength to continue upward to test all time highs\n\nETH/USD 26.10.2017\n\nEthereum prices have recently dropped to a local minimum of $270 and remained at the $272 level until first major purchases. Getting back to the levels above $300 was a good sign for bulls. As of now, Ethereum is being traded at the $295 level.\n\nA local maximum was recorded at $311. During the upward movement, the bearish trend continuing since mid-October was breached at the $296 resistance level. It seems that the price might be slightly corrected again, because the previous $315 resistance level was not even tested;\n\nFurther development of the situation for Ethereum depends on the general state of the market.

I acquired Bitcoins in a completely legal way,"" said her client, identified only as Mr. Bischop.\n\nWhere did the Bitcoin come from?\n\nThe issue and attraction of Bitcoin is that it does not leave much of a paper trail and helps people remain anonymous in their transactions.\n\nProsecutors, however, said the defense ""was unable to explain the origins of the astronomical sum of money"" earned by the accused, stressing that money-laundering posed ""a serious threat to our society.""', 'Wall Street strategist Tom Lee predicts that the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC) could triple in value by 2022 if his bitcoin price predictions prove to be correct.\n\nLee, who co-founded market strategy firm FundStrat Global Advisors, has earned a reputation both as a stock market bear and bitcoin bull. He has famously set a “conservative” 2022 bitcoin price target of $25,000, and he maintained that price target even during the severe market correction that was initiated by China’s ban on initial coin offerings and bitcoin exchanges.\n\nNow, Bloomberg reports that Lee is advising FundStrat clients that the share price of the publicly-traded Bitcoin Investment Trust has the potential to triple if his bitcoin forecast is accurate. At present, the Bitcoin Investment Trust — the flagship product of Barry Silbert’s Grayscale Investments — is the only publicly-quoted bitcoin investment vehicle in the U.S. market available to institutional investors. Unlike most of the firms that have applied for bitcoin ETFs (none have been approved so far), GBTC holds the underlying assets directly instead of trading in derivatives contracts.\n\nThe trust’s value to investors has been subject to debate in recent months, as its shares have traded at a significant premium over the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying asset. At one point during August, GBTC shares leaped to double the NAV, although the spread has settled down to about 20% in October.\n\nDespite the premium price, Lee wrote in a report that “GBTC at $688 and with 20% NAV premium is an attractive way to gain exposure to bitcoin,” stating that the NAV spread is inaccurate because it does not factor in the value of the airdropped coins from bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold, altcoins that were created from bitcoin forks. When Lee wrote his report, those assets added a combined $53 to the NAV of GBTC shares.\n\nHowever, Lee advises investors to be aware that GBTC could face liquidity problems if there is a market panic.\n\n“What could go wrong?” Lee wrote. “The biggest risk, in our view, is the GBTC, as an ETN [exchange-traded note], could face a liquidity problem -— if there is an all out panic. But given the highly audited custody of GBTC and its underlying bitcoin holdings, we see this as a short-term issue.”\n\nAt the time of writing, GBTC shares were trading at $704, while bitcoin was priced at a global average of $5,953 following a single-day increase of 8%.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin presents a $1.6 billion revenue opportunity for exchanges, according to a wide-ranging report on cryptocurrencies by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nCboe, a first mover in cryptocurrencies among exchanges, appears the best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity, according to the bank.\n\nCboe has partnered with Gemini, a digital currency exchange, to roll out bitcoin-linked products as early as this year.\n\nBitcoin represents a $1.6 billion revenue opportunity for Wall Street\'s exchanges.\n\nThat\'s according to a wide-ranging report on cryptocurrencies by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which said exchanges could benefit from a ""significant revenue stream"" from bitcoin. And one exchange group has moved to the front of the queue to take advantage of this potential opportunity.\n\nCboe, the Chicago-based exchange operator that\'s home to the largest options exchange in the US, recently partnered with Gemini, a digital assets exchange started by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, to roll out bitcoin futures by this year or early next. Futures are contracts that allow two parties to exchange an asset at a specified price at an agreed upon date in the future.\n\nThat followed an earlier attempt by Bats Global Markets, which was acquired by Cboe earlier this year, to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund from the Winklevoss twins. That attempt was rejected by regulators, with the Securities and Exchange Commission citing the lack of ""surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity.""\n\nThe Cboe deal with Gemini on bitcoin futures might help address that.\n\n""The ETF and futures contracts do not depend on each other, but clearly, they would be reinforcing,"" Bank of America said. ""If these efforts to apply existing exchange technology to [bitcoin] work, then this creates a new revenue pool for the exchange industry.""\n\nCboe\'s chairman and CEO, Edward Tilly, has taken a position on bitcoin that is contrary to that of his peers in the space. At a recent conference he said, ""like it or not, people want exposure to bitcoin.""\n\nMeanwhile, rivals have shied away from cryptocurrencies. For instance, Adena Friedman, the CEO of Nasdaq, referred to initial coin offerings, a red-hot cryptocurrency-based fundraising method, as ""bleeding edge"" and CME president Bryan Durkin told Bloomberg his firm wasn\'t looking at bitcoin futures.\n\nThat\'s despite bitcoin soaring more than 400% this year. The market for cryptocurrencies has exploded from $17 billion to $170 billion since January. Volumes per day for bitcoin are up from $57 million at the beginning of the year to $628 million, according to Blockchain.info.\n\nCboe is positioning itself to capitalize on this explosive growth. Here\'s John Deters, chief strategy officer of Cboe:\n\n""It has now evolved to a point that its utility as both a payment vehicle and a store of value is clear, while the overall popularity of digital assets has proven to be pretty resilient.""\n\nDeters told Business Insider that the exchange is exploring a broader family of cryptocurrency products in addition to the bitcoin futures product.\n\n$1.6 billion opportunity\n\nThe $1.6 billion bitcoin revenue figure is a bull case scenario, according to Bank of America, and is based on the assumption that cryptocurrency volumes end up at about 10% of current fiat currency trading volumes.\n\nHere\'s the bank:\n\n""The FX market is highly liquid. For example, spot FX volumes were $1.65tr as of the most recent BIT Triennial survey in April 2016. If these volumes were to materialize, with the same relationship between spot market and futures, and the same revenue per contract, the revenue pool would be about $1.6bn.""\n\nThe estimate also assumes ""there is no substitution of coin volumes for other contracts.""\n\nJust because Cboe is best positioned to take advantage of this opportunity, Bank of America doesn\'t think it will be the only firm to benefit from it. The bank expects other exchanges and market structure companies to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon if Cboe\'s futures or ETF products are successful.\n\n""We would assume that other major derivative players like DB1’s Eurex and the CME would try to become involved,"" the bank said.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Jeff Garzik, a bitcoin pioneer known for his contributions to the digital currency\'s underlying code, has created a rival to the asset whose value he helped push into the stratosphere.\n\nBitcoin is being held back not only by its own limitations, as he sees it, but by the infighting that has become a permanent feature of the contentious community surrounding the digital currency.\n\nFed up with the politics and brinkmanship that ultimately, this past July, saw bitcoin split into two separate versions, Garzik decided to create a brand-new cryptocurrency, which he calls Metronome. Now, six months later, he is bringing it into the public spotlight.\n\n""We\'ve really been beating this up on the economic-model side, the engineering side, the legal and tax side,"" said Garzik, who serves as CEO of Bloq, a blockchain startup that focuses on enterprise applications. ""When it\'s launched, it\'s launched; Bloq doesn\'t have any control over it at that point. So we\'ve got to front-load all this work.""\n\nA case in point: Bloq spent more than $1 million on legal and tax review for Metronome, says Garzik. The company hired not one but three auditors to assess its software.\n\nWhat could be worth so much trouble and expense? Potentially a better cryptocurrency.\n\nAs new coins and blockchain technologies proliferate, the need for them to be able to interact with each other has become a pressing issue. But Garzik thinks he has a better solution: Rather than merely making various blockchains interoperable, he wants to give them a common asset.\n\nMetronome\'s MTN token doesn\'t have its own blockchain, as the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and Ethereum, do. The new cryptocurrency can jump from one blockchain to another. Instead of switching assets — selling bitcoin and buying Ethereum\'s ether currency, for instance — in order to escape the drama or risks associated with a particular network, people can simply move their assets to a new network.\n\nThat means Metronome could potentially be attractive to banks and payments companies, which have lately been investigating cryptocurrencies as a means of improving cross-border transactions. A cross-chain asset seems a natural fit.\n\nWhat\'s more, MTN transactions settle in 15 seconds, according to Garzik, whereas bitcoin transactions can sometimes take an hour or more, owing to congestion in the network. Metronome also has a “mass pay” feature allowing users to send money to multiple recipients at once.\n\nYou can even authorize someone else to withdraw from your MTN account within a certain timeframe and up to a set amount, allowing it to work as a joint checking account with better security features.\n\n""This is what results if you take years and years of experience and lessons learned and take a [clean] sheet of paper and design a new cryptocurrency,"" Garzik said.\n\n\'Consciously a cryptocurrency\'\n\nMetronome is planned for launch in early December. Bloq settled on a descending-price auction, open to all, as the fairest means of distributing the initial batch of eight million tokens. In this, Bloq is bucking the trend.\n\nNew tokens are typically distributed through an unregulated crowdfunding method known as an initial coin offering. But as the big money in blockchain tokens has begun attracting interest from big venture capital firms and angel investors, it has become relatively common for hot token projects to hold a pre-sale, at a preferred buy-in rate, for major investors.\n\n""We\'re not letting Sequoia [Capital] in at a special price from everyone else,"" Garzik said, referring to one of the top venture capital firms in the world.\n\nAn additional two million tokens will be allocated to Bloq as compensation for developing the cryptocurrency, though Garzik says his company will receive none of the auction proceeds. Instead, automated software called a smart contract will use those funds, while they last, to buy MTN on the open market, thus buoying the new cryptocurrency\'s price.\n\nBitcoin pioneer Jeff Garzik said Metronome is the result of ""years of experience and lessons learned and a [clean] sheet of paper.""\n\nThere is no telling just how much money the token sale could capture. From January through September 2017, ICOs raised a total of $2.2 billion for blockchain projects, according to Novum Insights. Yet many token creators, even while attracting investors, are striving not to have their creations seen by authorities as financial instruments.\n\nBy classifying them as ""utility tokens"" — something like paid API keys or memberships that grant their holder privileges on a given software platform — some token issuers hope both to navigate past the Scylla of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has declared that bitcoin and its ilk should be considered commodities, and to avoid the Charybdis of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which in July announced its intention to enforce regulations against tokens that function like securities.\n\nLast month, the SEC charged two ICOs with selling unregistered securities and defrauding investors.\n\nGarzik, however, is adamant that Metronome is designed to be money, like bitcoin. ""It\'s very consciously a cryptocurrency, not a utility token for a future service,"" he said.\n\nFierce criticism\n\nThe chief obstacle is obvious: how to attract users and overcome bitcoin\'s immense head start?\n\nThe answer, if there is one, lies as much in Metronome\'s economics as in its technical features. Whereas bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, Metronome\'s software is designed to mint new coins ad infinitum. Every day, 2,880 new coins will be the added to the initial supply of 10 million.\n\nIn the first year, that will mean an inflation rate of about 10%, in the second year about 5%, and diminishing thereafter until, in year 35, the annual inflation rate is only 2%, where it will stay ""for the next thousand years,"" Garzik said.\n\nBut, unlike at a central bank, there won\'t be anyone with the authority to change the rules governing Metronome\'s issuance of new coins. ""We won\'t have [quantitative easing],"" Garzik said. ""It\'s QE-impervious."" Not even Bloq has a back door.\n\nNot everyone is impressed. Online, in some corners of the cryptocurrency community, criticism of Metronome has been fierce.\n\nMichael Goldstein, a longtime bitcoiner and president of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, described Metronome as ""another shitcoin"" — the vulgar, colloquial term for a worthless token. Another critic labeled Garzik ""an ICO scammer.""\n\nGoldstein is one of many so-called bitcoin maximalists, who believe the unique properties of bitcoin, including its limited supply, make it ideally suited to be a global currency or digital gold that will continue to grow in value over time.\n\nOn Tuesday, he resurfaced one of Garzik\'s old tweets from August 2014, in which the developer seems to be down on the whole notion of ICOs: ""Just learned a new term from the #altcoin world: ICO. Initial Coin Offering. (IMO: signalling the \'dump\' of \'pump-n-dump.\' ""\n\nIn 2017, though, others think the future lies in a multicoin, multichain ecosystem, even if bitcoin remains at its center. And despite the growing popularity of digital currency — the number of users worldwide now rivals the population of small countries — there may still be time for a new winner to emerge.\n\n""We\'re in this Cambrian explosion kind of moment,"" said Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the Linux Foundation\'s Hyperledger Project. ""We\'re still mapping out the landscape.""\n\nNo drama\n\nICOs have drawn criticism for their lack of oversight and in some cases for the perceived greed and overblown promises of the unproven teams behind them. Cryptocurrency insiders often say that most new coins will eventually become worthless — ""go to zero,"" in crypto parlance.\n\nEven technically sound projects with smart founders can struggle. One high-profile blockchain, Tezos, raised $232 million this past summer in what was then the biggest ICO ever, but is now mired in backroom politics that have delayed the launch of the network.\n\n""Bear with me,"" Tezos co-creator Arthur Breitman asked an audience at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\n\nFewer than one in 10 tokens are actively used once their ICO is over, according to Token Report. In part, this statistic merely reflects the fact that the software platforms associated with many tokens have yet to launch. But, clearly, hundreds of tokens are being bought and sold on speculation alone.\n\nMetronome, said Garzik, is ""not going to be drama-driven."" Rather than lock users into a single blockchain, with all of the risk that entails, Metronome treats each individual blockchain ""as sort of a railroad."" Moving MTN tokens from one to another is ""kind of like taking a boxcar off of one railroad and putting it on a different railroad,"" Garzik said.\n\nWhile the MTN token will launch on Ethereum, it will soon be compatible with Ethereum Classic, Rootstock (a ""sidechain"" of bitcoin) and Qtum, another cryptocurrency network, according to a press release.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Metronome can attract users, but Garzik is confident it will prove to be a more elegant solution than mere blockchain interoperability.\n\n""If you want to make two chains talk to each other, that\'s still two [different] economic animals. You\'ve still got some friction and some cost, possibly a middleman involved in going from a litecoin to a bitcoin, or a bitcoin to an ether,"" Garzik said. ""It\'s one thing to be technically compatible, but you still have to consider the economics.""']"
10/27/2017,"['After failing to breach $6,000, bitcoin prices have again taken a downturn.\n\nAt press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is $5,850, but of greater interest to traders is what this means for the ongoing rally, which has pushed bitcoin up from an Oct. 25 low of $5,376.\n\nPrices on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) have twice neared the $6,000 mark in the last 24 hours, yet both attempts have stalled.\n\nThe first attempt ran out of steam at $5,978 yesterday at 13:00 UTC, while a second fell apart at 01:00 UTC today.\n\nAs of writing, the BPI is down 0.90 percent at $5,834.\n\nWhile the reasons for the exhaustion are unknown, it may simply be the case of the formation of a new psychological level, with traders unsure of whether higher prices above $6,000 will hold.\n\nWhatever the reason, the price action analysis calls for vigilance.\n\nDaily chart\n\nThe above chart shows:\n\nBearish price-money flow index (MFI) divergence, indicating the rally ended with the Oct. 21 record highs above $6,100.\n\nBearish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA crossover (i.e. 5-day MA cuts 10-day MA from above).\n\nExhaustion near $6,000 adds credence to the bearish price-MFI divergence and indicates potential for a drop below the 5-day MA of $5,786.\n\nA break below $5,786 would validate the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and could open doors for a drop to head-and-shoulders neckline (red line) support of $5,440.\n\nThe rising trend line (blue dotted line) is also likely to offer support around $5,440 levels.\n\nView\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap, total bitcoin trading volume dropped 28 percent on Wednesday, and decreased by another 3 percent on Thursday.\n\nThis further suggests the rally from $5,376 lacked substance (weak volumes), thus the exhaustion near $6,000 is perhaps to be expected.\n\nLooking ahead to today:\n\nThe odds of a break below $5,786 and a drop to $5,440 levels are high.\n\nOn the higher side, only a convincing move above $6,000 would open doors for new record highs above $6,200.\n\nTired runner image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'A Kansas state government commission has ruled that candidates running for office in state and local elections will be prohibited from accepting bitcoin campaign contributions.\n\nAs reported by the Lawrence Journal-World, a local media outlet, the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission has decided to bar Kansas politicians from accepting bitcoin donations when running for public office in state or local elections, citing concerns about bitcoin’s pseudonymity.\n\nMark Skoglund, the commission’s executive director, stated that the ruling was prompted by a candidate who inquired about the legality of accepting bitcoin donations.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission allows candidates running for national office to accept bitcoin campaign contributions and even stated that campaigns could invest in bitcoin under limited circumstances. A variety of candidates have taken advantage of this opportunity, most recently Austin Petersen, a Republican who is running to represent Missouri in the U.S. Senate.\n\nPetersen told CCN that cryptocurrency “represents the future of American creativity and American liberty,” which is why his campaign accepts bitcoin donations:\n\nBitcoin’s disruptive influence is just what our financial system needs at this time….Cryptocurrency represents the future of American creativity and American liberty, and I’m delighted to accept campaign donations in this form.\n\nHowever, Kansas does not have a law governing cryptocurrency campaign donations, and Commissioner Jerome Hellmer explained that the commission is concerned that it is too risky to allow campaigns to accept bitcoin donations without standardized reporting procedures. He argued that lobbyists would be able to take advantage of bitcoin’s pseudonymity to influence local elections. He also suggested that bitcoin could have a more detrimental effect on elections than alleged Russian interference had on the 2016 U.S. presidential election:\n\n“The greatest problem would be the strong probability of the influencing of local elections by totally unidentifiable lobbyists trying to come in,” he said. “If you think the Russians affected the presidential elections, just wait. This is what’s going to happen.”\n\nHellmer added that bitcoin’s opacity is antithetical to the “transparency” that elections commissions are supposed to ensure. “It’s totally contrary to the transparency we’re asking for our political system to provide to the public,” he concluded.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Billionaire Peter Thiel says he's optimistic about bitcoin but skeptical of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe says he views bitcoin as reserve form of money, like gold.\n\nPeter Thiel is the latest big name from the world of tech and finance to offer commentary on bitcoin, and he’s optimistic about the future of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, rather than discuss bitcoin’s potential uses as a means of exchange, Thiel focused on its effectiveness as a store of value.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Thiel compared bitcoin to gold and said that due to the difficulty of the digital mining process, it’s actually harder to mine bitcoin than it is to mine the precious metal.\n\n“If bitcoin ends up being the cyber equivalent of gold it has a great potential left,” Thiel said.\n\nThiel was speaking from Saudi Arabia, where he’s attending the Saudi government’s Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh.\n\nHis comments are interesting in the context of what bitcoin and other digital currencies actually represent, amid the explosion in popularity of initial coin offerings.\n\nEarlier this week, a research report from Bank of America Merril Lynch (BAML) outlined why bitcoin may struggle as a payments system.\n\nBAML’s argument was based around cost and speed — that transactions on the bitcoin network are too slow and expensive to compete with traditional payment processing companies such as Visa and Mastercard.\n\n“The most important technical issue, we think, is to do with the coin’s capacity to scale,” the analysts said.\n\nTransaction speed is a key point of contention in the bitcoin development community.\n\nCurrently, two competing camps are in dispute about whether to increase the size of transaction blocks to two megabytes from the current maximum of one megabyte.\n\nThe disagreement means bitcoin is on track for yet another split in the currency, which is expected to take place around mid-November.\n\nEven if transaction speeds double, bitcoin’s processing ability would still be far slower than existing platforms.\n\nBut it highlights an interesting debate around how various interest groups are considering the use-case for bitcoin within the financial landscape.\n\nFor his part, Thiel was quite direct in how he views the currency.\n\n“You don’t need to use it to make payments,” Thiel said, according to CNBC.\n\n“I’m skeptical of most of them (cryptocurrencies), I do think people are a little bit…underestimating bitcoin especially because…it’s like a reserve form of money, it’s like gold, and it’s just a store of value,” he added.\n\n“Bitcoin is mineable like gold, it’s hard to mine, it’s actually harder to mine than gold. And so in that sense it’s more constrained.”\n\nBitcoin prices fell from record highs this week following a second hard fork which saw the establishment of a second bitcoin off-shoot called — as it happens — bitcoin gold.\n\nAdvocates of bitcoin gold want to further decentralise the process for mining new bitcoin, which they said will make the cryptocurrency more resistant to future shocks or manipulation.\n\nHowever, as it has throughout 2017 in the face of trading bans in China and the bitcoin cash hard fork in August, bitcoin has again proved resilient.

He argues that the bitcoin price is a “real bubble”, and he is not optimistic about the potential of initial coin offerings, either.\n\nWarren Buffett: Bitcoin Price a ‘Real Bubble’\n\nAs reported in MarketWatch, the Berkshire Hathaway CEO — known as the “Oracle of Omaha” — made these comments earlier this month during an “Ask Me Anything”-style question-and-answer session with business students. At least one student asked Buffett about cryptocurrency, and — unsurprisingly — he replied that he is not enthused about bitcoin or other digital currencies.\n\n“You can’t value bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset,” he warned, casting shade on strategists and hedge fund managers who believe Metcalfe’s law — a principle that states the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its user base — provides an effective metric for deciphering bitcoin’s value.\n\nThere’s a “real bubble in that sort of thing,” he added, echoing comments made by UBS earlier this month.\n\nNot Impressed by ICO Hype\n\nBuffett also reportedly addressed the growing hype over initial coin offerings (ICOs), fundraising events through which blockchain startups can crowdfund projects by selling their users crypto tokens that could represent any number of things, ranging from access to a product or service to an entitlement to a percentage of a platform’s profits.\n\nHe expressed concern that ICOs — which have raised more than $3.2 billion in 2017 alone according to ICO tracker CoinSchedule — will not prove beneficial to the investment industry. “People get excited from big price movements, and Wall Street accommodates,” he commented.\n\nThis skeptical stance on cryptocurrency is consistent with past statements Buffett has made about bitcoin. Several years ago, he called it a “mirage”, arguing that it was a “joke” to assign a value to something just because it can be used to transmit money. “Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money?,” he asked at the time.\n\nClearly, Buffett is not acquainted with how bitcoin works — much less the concept of “fat protocols” — but then again, he didn’t turn Berkshire Hathaway into a $465 billion empire by positioning himself at the forefront of technological innovation. Indeed, Berkshire Hathaway’s website has undergone virtually no modifications since the year 2000.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin \'to da moon!\' is slaying Google searches to \'buy silver\'...\n\nQUICK!

Here in 2017, yes – crypto currencies rock.\n\nBut roll back a bit, even as recently as 2016, and this was a different thing altogether.\n\nNo, not gold. Not quite, and not even with a decade of gains from 2001-2011 plus forecasts of $5,000 to $10,000 per ounce from there.\n\nNo, the one-time crypto currency...at least as far as the bug-o-sphere of ""to da moon!"" claims and promises would say...used to be silver.\n\nWhich might help explain why silver investment demand has sunk as Bitcoin has swamped financial headlines, blogs, click bait and junk mail this year.\n\nWhatever Goldman Sachs thinks , gold could be next. Google searches for \'buy bitcoin\' just overtook \'buy gold\' after crushing \' buy silver \' earlier this year.\n\nBut somehow we doubt it. First because gold is boring anyway...a hedge against the risk and runaway dreams of your other investments. Second because gold never quite got the extra retail investment push which silver\'s ""stunning...outrageous"" forecasters promoted.\n\nTrumping anything silver ever enjoyed, Bitcoin ""to the moon!"" forecasts have broken out of the specialist forums online and gone mainstream.\n\n""People are underestimating Bitcoin ,"" reckons PayPal founder, early Facebook investor and all-round internet squillionaire Peter Thiel. ""Bitcoin is better than gold ,"" reckons Apple Inc\'s co-founder Steve Wozniak.\n\nSilver\'s narrative in contrast – on solar panels, Chinese demand and the looming currency \'reset\' – has all moved on since silver doubled inside 6 months and then slipped and fell over 70% from Spring 2011.\n\nEven then it found new cheerleaders to tell potential investors just how soon silver would make them rich, if only they bought today, right now, this instant.\n\nClaims of price suppression (aka manipulation) are still with us, of course, plus the bug-o-sphere\'s gloomy end-times outlook for a collapse of the almighty Dollar. That will see precious metals surge, any day now...just you watch...led by the always volatile, fast-moving silver.\n\nLong term it\'s hard to argue. Too much debt creating too much money has led to too much stuff, trapping us all between default and devaluation. One day central banks will exhaust the trust and faith they need to keep the game running. Physical gold will prove the ultimate redoubt for investors and savers. Silver will do what gold does, with bells on.\n\nBut why wait for that untimeable moon-shot in precious metals? Crypto-currency buyers have made 7 times their money in the last 12 months alone. And right alongside, private investors have cooled on silver, if not yet capitulated, 6 years after its surge back to the 1980 peak of $50 per ounce.\n\nDemand for newly minted silver coins has sunk 40% and worse so far this year from last.\n\nSilver\'s biggest ETF – the iShares Silver Trust (NYSEArca:SLV) – has also ignored bullion\'s small year-to-date price rise and seen its number of shares outstanding shrink by more than 6% so far in 2017.\n\nUnlike listed corporate stocks, that has nothing to do with management raising cash to buy back and cancel shares so their own holdings gain value, and everything to do with investors losing interest in tracking the silver price.\n\nIt\'s also got nothing to do with gold. The yellow metal\'s single largest ETF – the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEArca:GLD) – has swollen by 5% so far in 2017. That lags the global growth-rate for ETF gold products, now running at nearly 8% since New Year.\n\nThe share price of Sprott\'s closed-end Physical Silver Trust (PSLV) has meantime gone and stayed negative to net asset value...throwing January 2012\'s 30% premium into yet sharper relief for buyers then believing that silver was running out worldwide and you had to grab yours while you could (or get some securitized price exposure, at least).\n\nEven customers of BullionVault – the smartest and most cost-conscious of precious metals investors – have tempered their demand for silver in 2017. Year-to-date additions to client holdings , net of client sales, are the weakest since 2014 and the second-weakest since we added low-cost wholesale silver bullion bar access to our world-leading gold offer in 2009. Over the first 10 months of 2017 it\'s running some 43% below last year\'s level.\n\nIndeed, only hedge fund managers and other Comex paper speculators are showing real faith. Net of bearish bets, the so-called \'Managed Money\' category has grown its bullish betting on silver futures and options by nearly two-thirds since New Year. Last week it stood at 3 times the historic average.\n\nBut these \'professional\' investors are only now catching the Bitcoin bug. Whereas private investor interest in digital currencies has leapt...swamping Google searches for silver investing and even overtaking gold in recent weeks.\n\nWhy the switch? It\'s not the metal that changed. It\'s simply that, as always in financial promotion, the narrative has switched to a different future of shocking, stunning gains...\n\nWho could forget the ""Outrageous Silver Speculation [of] $200 or $400?!?"" from late 2015? (The metal was then bottoming around $14 per ounce. It\'s just below $17 today.)\n\nOr what about ""The Silver Chart Predicting $200 Silver by 2018"" from February 2013? (It was then falling through $30 per ounce.) ""Parabolic Up-trend Channel Suggests Massive Silver Move is Imminent."" (Not quite. Silver was about to sink faster than gold in the crash of April-June 2013, down by one-third in 3 months.)\n\nOr better yet, how about ""$200 an Ounce Silver? Can it Happen?"" from June 2004? (Silver was then breaking up through $6 per ounce.)\n\nFast forward to late 2017, and these life-changing forecasts now apply to the bits of code known as crypto currency.\n\n""Bitcoin bulls had a lot of explaining to do in the early years. [We] will skip over some of the arguments early bitcoin evangelists had to make...because these arguments are boring. The panel will [instead] debate outlooks for the asset class, what’s behind the current bull run, and the existing obstacles that could keep bitcoin from rocketing to the moon.""\n\nSo says the agenda for a crypto convention meeting in New York next month.\n\nKnowing its audience almost as well as the "" 100x leverage for dummies"" crowd now touting Bitcoin derivatives trading accounts, the same flyer says ""Digital assets have attracted nearly one hundred thousand new users a day through much of 2017.\n\n""Many of these new participants are still learning.""\n\nThey\'ll get schooled good and hard in due course according to history. Maybe for Bitcoin – now here above $6,000 – next year will prove as ugly as 2012-2015 did for silver. But maybe it won\'t.\n\nTo match silver\'s bubblicious boom of Spring 2011, the price of Bitcoin would need to reach somewhere around $300,000 by this time in autumn 2018.\n\nThat\'s according to the Z-score measure of an asset\'s 12-month rate of gain, comparing it against the asset\'s typical historic price moves. The denominator in that equation was blown sky-high by Bitcoin\'s previous multi-magnitude gains of 2012-2014 – back when its use case of enabling anonymous online retail of illegal goods preceded a 12-month crash costing buyers at the top some 77% in fiat currency terms.\n\nUp at 2013\'s then-nosebleed high, Bitcoin\'s Z-score was twice the level silver achieved at its 2011 peak of $50 per ounce. Yet the crypto-currency has since recovered, and much more on top, and all before the 9th birthday of its mystery founder\'s thesis paper\n\nWizened old silver, in contrast, is still just sitting there, with 5,000 years of monetary use worldwide, thousands of irreplaceable and growing industrial uses , and a global (if price-sensitive) fanbase of jewelry buyers . Unlike crypto, it\'s hard to imagine silver ever going to zero. But with no floor, Bitcoin maybe has no ceiling either, people seem happy to think. It can go to infinity.\n\nAt the margin, yes – it\'s likely the Bitcoin bubble has pulled some private-investor money away from gold. But everyone lining up to explain why ""Bitcoin isn\'t gold"" is missing the point for the precious metals market.\n\nFor momentum lovers, internet shills and new true believers alike, Bitcoin is silver right now. Only more so.', 'Emerging Markets\n\nTo Wall Streeters, Bitcoin may look like tulip bulbs for millennials, but for long-suffering citizens of Venezuela or Zimbabwe, the cryptocurrency...', ""The Bitcoin boom is well and truly underway, and investors are constantly looking for new ways to gain an advantage in this space. The best way to do this, it seems, is by cutting the energy costs of mining this precious commodity.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining industry consumes 22.5 TWh of energy annually, which amounts to 13,239,916 barrels of oil equivalent. With 12.5 bitcoins being mined every 10 minutes, that means the average energy cost of one bitcoin would equate to 20 barrels of oil equivalent.\n\nMining Bitcoin has the potential to be a wildly lucrative business, with a single Bitcoin now valued at more than 100 barrels of oil. That kind of price makes it one of the most valuable commodities on the planet and, just like oil, this commodity is increasingly valuable to mine if the energy costs can be kept down.\n\nBitcoin transactions are secured by computer miners, who are competing for rewards in the form of coins from the network. The more computation power they use, the better their chances. The drill rig is a computer, and hydraulic fracturing is done with the tip of your fingers. It’s a phenomenally energy-intensive process\n\nTo put this in perspective, the total energy consumption of the world’s Bitcoin mining activities is more than 40 times greater than that required to power the entire Visa network.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nCheap electricity is exactly what made China the Bitcoin mining king. The yearly cost of the energy necessary to mine Bitcoin determines its economics. But to get in on that you risk reputation because you’re either siphoning off surplus energy from somewhere else, or you’re partnering with the government. No matter how you look at it, it’s a very gray area. No one wants dirty coal fueling such a sophisticated endeavor, for example.\n\nThat’s why HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd.—a gold-miner-turned-Bitcoin-miner—has set up in Iceland.\n\nAs one of the first public companies that lets you participate in the build-up and infrastructure of crypto mining, HIVE is taking advantage of Bitcoin’s favorite element: Ice.\n\nIt’s freezing in Iceland, so the relative energy cost of mining there is lower. Mining hardware requires enormous power and creates tons of heat, and natural temperature is key: Iceland saves on cooling costs, making it one of the most potentially profitable placesto mine Bitcoin.\n\nIceland: New Ground (Below) Zero for Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is all about digital infrastructure. In this burgeoning industry that offers a chance at significant profits, just about any computer can be used, but companies dedicated to ether mining are the latest thing, and this is where things can really get lucrative.\n\nThis is industrial-scale bitcoin mining, and some of these companies are worth tens of millions of dollars, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAnd for all of them, the Great Bitcoin Game is to keep energy costs down to make ether mining more cost-effective.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nRight now, about 85 percent of the world’s Bitcoin trading volume comes from China. Countries with heavily subsidized energy are obvious ether mining haunts, but now the colder countries have something to offer that has nothing to do with the government, and doesn’t involve any legal gray areas that will come under scrutiny.\n\nIt’s 100 percent Mother Nature, and as long as she keeps Icelandic temperatures … Icelandic, then natural cooling should be a boon for Bitcoin. The cold countries are now the home of what is being dubbed ‘geothermal gold’.\n\nGiant ether mining start-up, BitFury Group, is there. BitFury, out of the Netherlands, generated over $90 million in revenue this year, and predicts it will be generating $585 million in revenue by 2021. While its flagship data center is in the Republic of Georgia, it’s also now tapping into the cool temperatures of Iceland.\n\nEmmanuel Abiodun, founder of Cloud Hashing, a company which owns a computing facility in Iceland, chose Iceland because of its cheap and plentiful geothermal and hydroelectric energy, and the “free Arctic air” that is piped in to cool the machines.\n\nIceland is also ground zero for Hong-Kong-based Genesis Mining Ltd, which is building the largest ether mining facility in the world in Iceland. Alphabet (NYSE:GOOG) and Facebook are there, too, taking advantage of the cold.\n\nAnd HIVE has recently acquired a new data center from Genesis for $9 million and a 30 percent equity stake in HIVE, according to Bloomberg, which says HIVE shares have “Bitcoin investors buzzing”.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nRight next door to this landmark Bitcoin facility in Reykajanes, Iceland, HIVE has just acquired a second data center from Genesis.\n\nBillionaire Money Pouring into Big Bitcoin\n\nAn internet advisor for Russian President Vladimir Putin is eyeing entrance into this great game, planning to raise $100 million in cryptocurrency to help Russia challenge China’s hegemony in Bitcoin mining.\n\n“Russia has the potential to reach up to 30 percent share in global cryptocurrency mining in the future,” Putin’s internet ombudsman, Dmitry Marinichev, was quoted as saying, adding that $10 million from the proceeds of the Russian Miner Coin ICO may be spent developing processors.\n\nJapanese billionaire Masatoshi Kumagai, co-founder of giant GMO Internet Inc., announced plans last month to invest over $90 million in a new Bitcoin mining business that will operate as a fund, partially, by soliciting capital from investors and repaying them in cryptocurrency.\n\nIn North America, all the buzz is about HIVE and Genesis, and two legendary billionaire backers known for their early-in investment intuition.\n\nHIVE’s backers include mining mavericks Frank Giustra and Frank Holmes. Giustra built up Goldcorp (NYSE:GG) in 2000 and today it trades at a market cap of nearly $11 billion, and is one of the largest gold-mining companies in the world. He was also behind Silver Wheaton, which is now Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), the biggest silver and gold streaming company in the world. Giustra’s 20-oscar-winning entertainment behemoth, Lion’s Gate, also took in $2.4 billion in revenue in 2015. And these are just a few of his multi-billion-dollar hits.\n\nHolmes is the CEO of San Antonio-based U.S. Global Investors, which has $2.6 billion in assets under management and is one of the definitive top precious metals funds in.\n\nBoth have backed HIVE, and Holmes is now its chairman.\n\nBoth still love gold because gold will always be gold, but they’re not old-fashioned. Bitcoin is huge, and they won’t be left out of the wave.\n\nBlockchain technology is like the Internet before everyone realized its explosive potential as a revolutionary information distribution channel. Email, like AOL, was that catalyst. Now, Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing for blockchain what email did for the Internet.\n\n“There's a huge scramble to be able to apply this so that you'll be able to trade stocks 24/7” Holmes said in a recent interview.\n\nBut if you want to successfully mine cryptocurrency, you need cheap energy, ideally around 2 cents a kilowatt hour.\n\nMathematics Rules the Day\n\nSpeaking at the Money20/20 event in Las Vegas on 22 October, Apple Computers co-founder Steve Wozniak definitively sided with the Bitcoin camp, calling the U.S. dollar “phony” because more can always be printed. Bitcoin, he told CNBC, is “stable” because it can’t be diluted, and its future supply is fixed at 21 million bitcoins. “Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but Bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics,” Wozniak said.\n\nWith Bitcoin hitting $6,000 per coin on 21 October, and breaking new records as its adoption surges, this is no longer just a game for individual miners with fast computers. It’s now about industrial-scale mining and billionaire backing.\n\nEven though cryptocurrency inhabits an unearthly geography in virtual time and space, where it is mined is just as important as it is for oil, gas, gold, or any other resource we mine.\n\nThe crypto sphere is everywhere, but mining its bounty means tapping into the cheapest sources of energy to keep costs down. The race now is to find the best venue with cheap energy and few reputational risks. Right now, that’s Iceland, the Genesis of the new wave of Bitcoin.\n\nBy James Stafford of Oilprice.com\n\n**IMPORTANT! BY READING OUR CONTENT YOU EXPLICITLY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING.

There is a risk.”\n\nThe central banker stressed that any new financial innovation must get Bank Indonesia’s approval – dependent on a number of requirements – before it is used or adopted as a payment method in the country. Further, the official doubled down with threat to those defy the central bank’s order.\n\nHe said:\n\nWhen the BI has asserted Bitcoin is not a valid payment instrument, those who use it will be dealt with. I do not want any violations in Indonesia.\n\nMissing the Cue\n\nThe Indonesian monetary authority’s hardline stance against bitcoin comes despite regulatory acceptance of bitcoin among its regional neighbors. Earlier this year, the Philippines’ central bank issued regulations for bitcoin exchanges in a legislative move that has effectively acknowledged and legalized bitcoin in the country. Just this month, the deputy director of Philippines’ central bank heralded the move as a “pioneering regulation’.\n\nIn his embracive approach to bitcoin, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) deputy director Melchor Plabasan :\n\nIt’s like any other monetary instrument [and even] an investment instrument. There are risks but essentially, it can be managed. If you want something that is fast, near real-time and convenient then there’s the benefit of using virtual currencies like bitcoin.\n\nIn August, the Australian government regulated the bitcoin industry for the first time. This week, new draft laws that offer an easier path for FinTech startups and initial coin offerings (ICOs) into the market has been proclaimed as a “game changer” by Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison.\n\nDisclaimer: Some statements have been unofficially translated from Indonesian.\n\nBank Indonesia image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'China’s Bitcoin-to-fiat exchange and ICO ban is producing a record number of “desperate” refugees, Quoine’s CEO Mike Kayamori has said.\n\nIn comments to Bloomberg, the Japanese exchange head said the fallout from the Chinese rules means the country’s exchange operators are fervently looking for alternatives, including in Japan.\n\n“We’re talking to almost all of those guys. They’re all desperate now,” he told the publication.\n\nJapan offers a ‘friendlier’ licensed environment for crypto exchange businesses, while China’s household names such as OKCoin and Binance are eyeing up Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.\n\nKayamori said that such is the scale of demand, Quoine alone is unable to service Chinese requirements.\n\n“There’s a lot of Chinese retail people reaching out to us, but we can’t handle it. So if a Chinese partner can handle all of those and they connect to us, that will be much easier,” he added.\n\nAs China’s flagship exchange BTCChina shuts its doors in the coming days, the Bitcoin sphere is buzzing with speculation as to if and when the situation will change once again.\n\nIn the meantime, international scaling is something OKCoin is considering in light of current demand.\n\n“China used to account for a significant share of the cryptocurrency market, so we think the demand is there,"" Lennix Lai, financial market director for its subsidiary OKEx said.\n\n“As formerly one of the biggest operators in China, we think we have a good chance of competing globally.”', ""Bitcoin cash price caught a fresh bid wave today, reaching a nine-day high of $373.\n\nAt press time, the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate is trading at $346 levels. The relatively new cryptocurrency has gained 4.12 percent in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nStill, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrow range around $330 in the last two weeks, with only occasional spikes above $350. Meanwhile, the downside was capped below $300 levels.\n\nHowever, today's price gains look sustainable as trading volumes are on the rise. Notably, the rally to $350 levels on Thursday was backed by a 54 percent boost in volume, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nOnce again, it seems gains are being fueled by a surge in South Korean trading – volumes on Bithumb (which offers a BCH/KRW pair) are up 42 percent.\n\nDaily chart\n\nSo, will BCH build momentum to retake $400? The price action analysis puts the odds of a rally to $400 and beyond above 50 percent.\n\nThe above chart shows:\n\nPrices formed a base around $300 and are currently trading at the descending trend line.\n\nRepeated failure on the part of the bears to keep prices below $300 yielded a rally to $370 levels.\n\nThe money flow index (MFI) is bullish and sloping upwards, adding credence to the bullish price action.\n\nView\n\nAn end-of-day close above the descending trend line is likely and would signal that the sell-off from the record high of $970 has ended near $300.\n\nIf the bullish trend line break is confirmed, prices could rise to $484 (Sep. 28 high) in the short-run.\n\nOn the downside, only a move below $300 would signal bullish-to-bearish trend change.\n\nClock image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

10/28/2017,"['The number of hedge funds which exclusively trade digital currencies has grown to 120, with about $2.3 bln in total assets under management, according to the financial research firm Autonomous Next.\n\nWhile it sounds like a large number, it pales in comparison to the $3.15 tln managed by the hedge fund industry in the third quarter.\n\nCryptocurrencies have attracted only a small number of institutional investors because most still remain skeptical. The latest criticism comes from legendary investor Warren Buffet, who has said that Bitcoin is in bubble territory.\n\nWell, a correction after such a stupendous rally is certainly possible. Therefore, we always recommend a stop loss to our readers. Even if the digital currencies correct sharply, our losses will be limited and our capital will be preserved. We can again reinvest at lower levels.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nWe had recommended long positions in Bitcoin in our previous analysis, with our target objective being $6000. On Oct. 27, the digital currency hit a high of $5986, where hopefully traders would have booked partial profits as suggested. Where is Bitcoin headed next?\n\nBitcoin is currently correcting towards the trendline support at $5600. Just below this support is the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $5513. We expect buying to emerge at these levels, however, we are not certain that this level will hold this time.\n\nOur stops at $5650 have been hit. We would like to sit back and wait, because if the support zone of $5513 to $5600 breaks, the digital currency will slide to $4975 levels.\n\nOn the other hand, if the support zone holds then Bitcoin is likely to remain range-bound between $5600 to $6000. However, the next buy on the virtual currency will only be triggered if it breaks out to new highs and crosses the resistance line of the ascending channel.\n\nPresently, we don’t find any buy setups, therefore, we don’t not recommend any fresh trade on Bitcoin.\n\nETH/USD\n\nWe don’t have any existing positions or recommendations on Ethereum. The bulls and the bears are taking a break after the hugely volatile day on Oct. 22.\n\nEthereum has a slew of resistances from $300 to $315 levels. Therefore we recommend a long position only on a breakout, and close above $315 with a close stop loss. The first target is $353.\n\nOn the downside, it has support from the trendline at $280, below which it is likely to fall to $272 and thereafter to $252 levels.\n\nAt current levels we don’t find any buy setups on Ethereum, hence we do not suggest to trade on it.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nWe had observed some buying in Bitcoin Cash but we did not recommend any trade because the risk to reward ratio was not favorable. Do we see a trade on it now?\n\nThe cryptocurrency is currently returning from the upper end of the range at $400. The 50-day simple moving average is also at $398. Therefore, we expect a stiff resistance at $400 levels.\n\nHowever, if the digital currency breaks out of this overhead resistance, it has a pattern target of $518.\n\nHence, we can buy on a breakout and close above $400. We shall limit our risk by keeping a stop loss of $350. We don’t want to hang on to the trade if it falls back into the range.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin Cash fails to breakout and close above $400, it is likely to remain range bound for a few more days.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nBoth the buyers and the sellers seem to have deserted the digital currency in the past three days, as a result of which, the volatility has shrunk. However, this period of low volatility is unlikely to sustain for a long time. We should soon see an expansion in volatility.\n\nIf Ripple breaks out of the moving averages, it should attempt a pullback to at least $0.23955 levels, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $0.29699 to $0.18211. If the virtual currency breaks out of this level, then a rally to $0.25311 and $0.27241 is also possible.\n\nTherefore, we recommend a long position at $0.22 with a stop loss of $0.19650. As this is a risky trade, we suggest using only about 30 percent of the usual allocation.\n\nHowever, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout on the upside, it can drift down to $1.8211 levels.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nLitecoin has not been able to breakout of the range of $44 to $57.7. Therefore, our buy levels were not triggered.\n\nThe 50-day SMA is situated at $55.59, while the 20-day EMA is at $56.57. Just above the moving averages is the upper end of the range at $57.729. If the digital currency breaks out of all these resistances, chances are that it will start a new uptrend.\n\nTherefore, we retain our buy recommendation provided in our previous analysis. Please buy on a breakout and close above $57.7. The stop loss is $51, whereas the target objective is $71.\n\nIf Litecoin fails to breakout of the overhead resistance, it will fall back towards the $52 levels.', ""Prior to the Bitcoin Gold fork two days ago, the market made some interesting moves.\n\nBitcoin price reached a new all time high on Oct. 20, 2017 - five days before the Bitcoin Gold fork -surpassing $6,000 for the first time and eventually climbing to nearly $6,200.\n\nThose of you who have endured past chain splits are aware of what usually happens when there’s a split from the Bitcoin network. Ordinarily, the community complains, reddit.com, medium.com, and twitter.com become platforms for soapbox speeches, and a lot of trash is talked by factions within the community.\n\nHowever, have you noticed the other events that are correlated with a chain split? Once a chain splits, you suddenly own a number of split tokens equivalent to the number of tokens you had on the Bitcoin network. This is because the new chain will be an exact copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain up until the point where the fork occurs.\n\nIf the wallet you use supports the forked chain’s software, you will be the owner of two digital tokens: Bitcoin and the Forked Chain Token. In our example we will use Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as the forked token. When the Bitcoin Cash chain forked off of the main chain, owners of Bitcoin became owners of an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. This is because the chains were identical until the fork occurred. If you owned 10 BTC before the split, then you owned 10 BTC and 10 BCH after the split.\n\nThis is where the slope becomes slippery. People or organizations with unfathomable amounts of money can use forks as an opportunity to extort both the Bitcoin network and the forked network for enticing capital gains when a fork occurs.\n\n#CT_questions How important is the impact of #Bitcoin forks on Bitcoin price? — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) October 28, 2017\n\nPreparing for the fork\n\nLet's say Randy owns 35,000 Bitcoins; at a value of $5,000 per Bitcoin, Randy’s digital assets are worth $175,000,000. Just like anybody with large amounts of money invested in a market, Randy pays attention to news that may affect his position (wealth) in that market. Randy learns that there will be a hardfork in the Bitcoin network and that the hardfork will create a new token, Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nOn top of this, Randy learns that his Bitcoin wallet provider will support the forked software, so he knows that he will own Bitcoin Cash as well as Bitcoin once the fork occurs. Now, Randy expects to have 35,000 Bitcoin Cash tokens in addition to his 35,000 BTC after the fork. If Randy was to increase his position by millions of USD worth of Bitcoin, he would be the owner of more Bitcoin than he previously owned.\n\nHowever, he would also create a buy wall that drives the Bitcoin price up since he is such a large player in the Bitcoin market. When Randy increases the amount of Bitcoin he owns, he also increases the amount of Bitcoin Cash he will own once the fork occurs.\n\nBecause Randy is an educated investor, Randy decides to increase his position in Bitcoin so that he owns 50,000 Bitcoin the day before the fork. Randy did this because he would like to own even more Bitcoin Cash than the 35,000 he would have had if he did not increase his position in Bitcoin. Now when the fork occurs, Randy expects to have 50,000 BCH in addition to his 50,000 BTC.\n\nWhat happens when a chain forks\n\nWhen the Bitcoin Network forks, some of the value that was in the Bitcoin network splits into the forked chain. When Bitcoin Cash forked from the Bitcoin network, the value of Bitcoin went from $2800 to $2700 (July 23,2017).\n\nAs a result of the fork, Bitcoin Cash was created and was valued around $555 at the time of it’s launch. (July 23, 2017).\n\nNow what does that mean for Randy?\n\nWhen Bitcoin dropped from $2,800 to $2,700, Randy's digital assets (wealth in Bitcoin) dropped from $140,000,000 to $135,000,000, a $5 mln loss. However, because of the fork, Randy now has 50,000 BCH worth $555 a piece. Because Randy is an educated investor and has no plans to use the Bitcoin Cash (BCH), he immediately sells his BCH for a profit the moment the option to sell BCH becomes available to him on his preferred exchange.\n\nRandy sells all 50,000 of his BCH for a profit of $27,750,000. A nice $28 mln gain (rounded number) to make up for the $5 mln loss that he suffered due to the decline in the price of Bitcoin. At the end of the day, Randy profits around $23,000,000 from the chain split.\n\nKeep in mind, there are other investors like Randy who are highly educated and extremely skilled at what they do. Furthermore, they may be executing a similar or even more efficient strategy as Randy regarding the hardfork; buy a lot of Bitcoin, anticipate a chain split where you are left with a number of new altcoins equivalent to the number of Bitcoin you own, quickly sell off the altcoin for a profit and then decrease your position in Bitcoin because it is overvalued.\n\nIndividuals like Randy are referred to as whales: individuals who hold positions so large in the Bitcoin market, that their bid and ask orders are capable of shaking up the market. Since it only takes a few big players using a similar strategy to drive the value of Bitcoin up or down, when an opportunity like this presents itself (a hardfork), the price of Bitcoin may not reflect the true value of Bitcoin.\n\nSince educated investors know that the Bitcoin price may be artificially high due to big players like themselves implementing a hardfork strategy, the big investor(s) have an incentive to lower their position in Bitcoin once they have executed their hard-fork gameplan. This is because they expect the Bitcoin price to correct to a value that is closer to its true value once all the hard-fork affiliated nonsense subsides.\n\nBecause there are multiple people like Randy who have a relatively large position in the Bitcoin market, when these people decrease their position in Bitcoin to an amount that they are comfortable owning during a bear period (and that number may be zero) their collective ask offers are capable of creating a sell-wall that drives down the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAfter the big sell off of both the altcoin - because investors find it virtually worthless for them to hold for the long term - and Bitcoin - because investors know the price is artificially high for the short term due to their market strategy - investors capitalize on the low price of Bitcoin from the massive sell-wall and they buy back the Bitcoin that they previously unloaded.\n\nOn top of the profit investors make from selling-off all of their altcoin, investors will experience capital gains from selling their Bitcoin at an artificially high price and then purchasing Bitcoin back once the price is lower. During the period where investors buy back Bitcoin, we tend to see the price stabilize for a short period of time.\n\nBoom and bust\n\nInvestors may have stockpiled Bitcoin anticipating an equal amount of altcoin and then sold off a significant amount of both Bitcoin and altcoin - in our example Bitcoin Cash - to reap the massive capital gains available to them.\n\nI can’t rule out the possibility that several other market factors had an effect on the Bitcoin price surge and subsequent plummet, but that being said, how plausible do you think it is that the whales set off the surge and fall of Bitcoin?"", 'Bitcoin price remains is placed well above the $5500-5600 support against the US Dollar.

The price remained supported above $5500 and even attempted a break above $6000 once. However, sellers appeared and prevented gains above $6000.

Combined, they increase the risk profile for Blockchain asset investors.\n\nBut with increased risk, the potential for reward should increase as well. In this post we explore one method professional traders use to handle volatility and liquidity issues and explore ways to profit from these inefficiencies.\n\nIntroducing mean-reversion strategies\n\nVolatility is driven by uncertainty. Some strategies, however, profit from volatility and even illiquidity. At the same time these strategies help mitigate market inefficiencies and should be rewarded for that.\n\nMean-reversion is the assumption that a stock's price will tend to move toward its average price over time. In other words, deviations from the average price could be exploited for profit, based on the knowledge that the price should tend to revert to the mean in time.\n\nA simple implementation of this strategy is to quote both a sell and a buy price, like a market maker. If the market is in fact mean reverting, then the strategy profits from the difference between the buy and sell price. The difference is also called the quoted spread.\n\nMean-reversion strategies trade the market as if the market oscillates around a fair price for an asset. The swings are driven by the uncertainty of other market participants or illiquidity at different market levels. Mean-reversion strategies bridge the gap between buyers and sellers and can expect to generate a profit from that.\n\nThis strategy is most effective in markets that are both high in volatility and are mean reverting. Volatility measures the size of the market’s swings. With high volatility, market swings are large and the mean-reversion strategy has a high probability of generating a profit. In markets with low volatility only small spreads are possible and the strategy is less profitable.\n\nThe best market scenario for mean-reversion is a sideways market with large volatility or market swings. This market scenario is damaging for trend-following strategies but profitable for market making or mean-reversion strategies.\n\nSimple example\n\nThe figure below shows an example of a profitable trading day using a mean-reversion strategy. At the beginning of the day, both buy and sell orders are placed in the market. The day develops and volatility drives a random walk of the price.\n\nThroughout the day, the strategy buys one Bitcoin at $4377.70. At some point later during the day, you sell this Bitcoin at $4421.48 and generate a profit of 1%. From this profit, fees have to be added or deducted. Some exchanges charge as little as 2.5 basis points for providing liquidity using such passive strategies.\n\nSource: Kraken, 02/10/17, Buy: $4377.70, Sell: $4421.48\n\nImplementing mean-reversion?\n\nAs we have already learned, mean-reversion strategies capitalize on the spread between buy and sell prices. These are usually placed around a mid price. The mid price incorporates all assumptions about the true price. For example, if the market exhibits large trends, these would be considered to adjust the mid price.\n\nIn general, buy and sell orders are determined by\n\nBuy/Sell = Mid Price +/- Spread\n\nThe spread is determined largely by the market’s volatility and the skew of the its returns. The skew is determined by the probability of up or down moves of the market. Such moves are usually not equally probable and therefore the spread is adjusted.\n\nThe volatility determines the size of the spread. With a high volatility, buy and sell orders are executed with a higher probability because the market shows larger price swings. On the other hand, if the volatility is small, the buy and sell might not be hit and the strategy keeps a long or short position, i.e. either ends up holding the underlying asset or holding cash and being short the asset.\n\nTo measure the volatility ? of cryptocurrency markets, usually an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) is applied with:\n\nThe recursion is usually initiated with the variance over the first 10 days. ? determines the half-life of the EWMA system. The half-life is the time required for the system to forget half of its former value. With daily data, the half-life is usually set to 10 days and therefore ? set to 0.93.\n\nThe figure below shows the annualized volatility for Bitcoin prices as estimated by the EWMA model. Bitcoin is fluctuating around an annualized volatility of 116%.\n\nStrategy’s performance\n\nTo test the mean-reversion strategy we explored to quote buy and sell prices every day since the inception of Bitcoin through the end of September 2017.. All data is taken from Cryptocompare. Given a 116% average volatility, we chose the quoted spread as 1% between buy and sell prices. If returns would be normally distributed this spread would be hit with a probability of 99.6% over, for example, 10 days.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin returns do not follow a normal distribution. So what is the likelihood that a trader could both buy and sell Bitcoin over the course of 10 days and earn 1% each day?\n\nBased on our data, this strategy would have been successful in 2297 out of 2615 days, or 87.84% of the time.\n\nFor this backtest, we calculated the buy and sell orders on +/- 0.5% of the last closing price and compared this price with the highs and lows over the course of the next 10 days. Of course, this strategy would result in some large long or short positions in Bitcoin. In fact, for 189 of the days, the strategy would have sold Bitcoin, but not bought. And for 129 of the days, the strategy bought Bitcoin, but did not sell it. The main reason for this is the large upward trend in Bitcoin prices.\n\nTo account for the trend in Bitcoin prices, we use the moving average return as an estimate and arbitrarily chose the look-back as 60 days, based on a previously published strategy. We also tested other look-back periods which produced similar results, and the look-back of 60 days is in the range of general trend-following strategies.\n\nAdding the moving average to shift the spread increases the number of days the mean-reversion strategies buys Bitcoins and reduces the number of days that it only sells Bitcoins. Therefore the strategy ends up with a long position in Bitcoin rather than a short position.\n\nIn total, this strategy would have made 1% profit on 2288 days out of 2615. On 327 days, the strategy either only sold Bitcoin or only bought Bitcoin. Adjusting the mid-price for trend resulted in more days that the strategy only bought Bitcoin and therefore accumulated Bitcoin over time. As an additional rule, the strategy could sell the additional Bitcoin at the end of each month or even keep them as a market position.\n\nA trader can improve this strategy by considering the volatility estimate and adjusting the spread. With higher volatility estimates, the strategy would aim to profit from a larger spread and vice versa.\n\nOther models use more sophisticated supervised learning algorithms to predict market movements. While some search for trading signals in order books, others use market news as an input to make directional predictions (Li et al., 2014; Kanagal et al., 2017).\n\nWhen trading a mean-reversion strategy, the liquidity of the market has to be considered. Here we did not consider any limitations to the ability to trade at the quoted prices. Obviously, that is not always the case and largely depends on the deployed capital.\n\nBroader market benefits\n\nTrading a mean-reversion strategy also plays a crucial role to establish efficient market mechanisms. While efficiency has already improved dramatically over the recent years, cryptocurrency markets still face fundamental issues that are typical for any new market.\n\nIlliquidity, matching inefficiencies and unstable spreads are frequent symptoms that can be observed across all currently available exchanges. Mean-reversion strategies provide additional liquidity to the market and therefore resolve these frictions. They bridge the liquidity gap, for which they get paid.\n\nMarket making strategies extend mean-reversion strategies, in that they trade on the spread many times a day with relatively large volumes on both sides of the trade. Market making strategies provide the liquidity that is essential for any well-functioning financial system. Abrupt spikes of demand or supply, like when traders either buy or sell large volumes, are absorbed by market makers.\n\nAny successful Bitcoin buy order requires a seller who is willing to take the opposite side and sell the particular volume of coins to the quoted price. The exchange (broker) matches both parties to make the trade happen.\n\nThis frequently leads to order delays and varying fulfilment prices, at the cost of traders. By placing orders at each side of the trade, market makers have the capacity to make more trades happen and thereby eliminate fulfillment delays. Bitcoin markets still observe very unstable spreads, which are absorbed by the market makers.\n\nBy fixing bid and ask prices for other traders, market makers profit from keeping spreads low and stable. The more liquidity they provide, the narrower and more stable the spread becomes.\n\nConclusion\n\nMean-reversion strategies are very profitable in high volatility markets and can be adjusted for trends. This strategy can be easily applied to Bitcoin trading and improve the performance of a buy-and-hold strategy. The mean-reversion strategy would post buy and sell quotes around the current market level and earn the spread.\n\nSince the strategy is independent of the market level, it can add an independent performance to a buy-and-hold strategy. As an example, the strategy could use 1% of the portfolio assets and then aim to earn an additional 1% per day on this part of the portfolio. Historically, this strategy would have added 24% per year to the portfolio performance.\n\nMean-reversion strategies are providing liquidity to the market. On the other hand, these strategies might end up long or short the asset, if the market does not revert to the mean. In that case they are taking a market position. On the other hand, providing liquidity should earn these strategies a potential profit that rewards the trader for his risk. Market making strategies extend mean-reversion strategies by quoting bid-ask spreads more frequently.\n\nThanks to Bosse Rothe for his valuable contribution to this article."", 'Rather than waiting until it’s too late, law firms are opening up bitcoin wallets to pay ransoms in case their data is stolen, according to a cybersecurity expert.\n\nJohn Sweeney, president of IT and cybersecurity advisors LogicForce, said that law firms are taking proactive steps rather than reactive steps. However, while he doesn’t necessarily agree with paying ransoms, he said that it ‘makes sense’ to be prepared, reports Business Insider.\n\nThis year has seen several data breaches where hackers have demanded ransoms to be paid in bitcoin. At the beginning of the year, an Austrian hotel was ordered to pay a bitcoin ransom to regain access to its rooms; in May, Disney’s Pirates film was held for ransom by hackers; and in June a South Korean firm paid a $1 million bitcoin ransom in order to retrieve its data.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Financial Supervisory Service of South Korea has told local banks not to cave into threats by DDoS attackers, following the million-dollar ransom paid by the South Korean firm.\n\nYet, while countless individuals have paid ransom demands to hackers to regain access to their files that’s not always the case. One example is the NotPetya hack, which occurred this summer. Even though victims paid the ransom, it was reported that they were unlikely to have received the decryption keys to access their files.\n\nSweeney believes, though, that firms must do more to protect themselves. According to him, the chances of the hacker being caught is slim and the probability of them being prosecuted is even smaller.\n\nHe said:\n\nWe are predicting there are going to be more sophisticated attempts to intrude at firms that work with highly visible clients whose IP or business information is extremely valuable.\n\nLogicForce is reportedly going to be opening up its own bitcoin account in the next few weeks in order to assist with client ‘disaster recovery.’\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Wallets\n\nAirbitz, a popular bitcoin wallet, announced under an embargoed press release undone as of this writing, it is rebranding itself ‘Edge’. “Airbitz is now Edge,” the release begins before explaining why the San Diego-based company is moving forward in such a manner.\n\nAlso read: A Look at Five Different Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallets and Prices\n\nAirbitz is Now Edge\n\nSan Diego-based Airbitz announced that it is overhauling its popular wallet, and while doing so is rebranding anew as well. Airbitz is now Edge. Bitcoiners are no doubt familiar with its “focusing on client side security that is not only incredibly private, but also familiar and accessible,” the company notes. At its foundation is the concept of decentralization, one crucial to Satoshi’s vision of Bitcoin as a network as well as a currency.\n\n“This is what we call security at the ‘edges’ of the network,” Edge began. “We have all seen the consequences of the over-centralization of data security with hack after hack after hack.”\n\nEdge Wallet\n\n“Written from the ground up, Edge Wallet employs a modular architecture that allows it to secure and transact with any blockchain or token,” the press release continued.\n\n“Developers of other blockchains are welcome to contribute support for their blockchain through a simple plugin which enables Edge to transact their digital currency.”\n\nWith Segwit transaction support for bitcoin and litecoin, the new wallet “will ship with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Augur REP, Wings, and Matryx tokens,” Edge claims. Another purported feature is allowing users to “seamlessly convert funds between the various digital currencies and tokens” with “tightly integrated support for Shapeshift.”\n\nEdge also plans to exploit decentralized applications (dapps). Users will be able “to authenticate and see the funds used in dapps that utilize our Edge Security SDK.”\n\nThis will help in the new company’s efforts to eliminate users “having to copy and paste addresses to send and receive funds between a blockchain app and a wallet.” Edge Wallet, the company insists, will allow users “to login to partner apps such as Augur and Wings with just the scan of a bar code. After authenticating with the dapp, users will be able to see and transact the same Ether, REP, and Wings funds.”\n\nIn its previous incarnation as Airbitz, the company’s claims to fame included one-touch two factor authentication, first ever bitcoin Cuba transaction, and the invention of Bluetooth low energy bitcoin transactions.\n\nIts new website concludes how historically data security has been “left to large organizations which act as trusted custodians of valuable information. This model of security has created large ‘honey pots’ of data that make these organizations very attractive targets for hackers and attackers.”\n\nEdge wants to be an answer to that problem, as “data security must happen at the edges of our networks.”\n\n“Once widely deployed, our Edge Security platform will make large scale data breaches a relic of the past,” the new company proclaims.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on mainstreaming bitcoin among such exchanges?

Their initiative, Batavia, focuses primarily on trade and trade finance. Earlier this month, UBS and IBM announced new FI partners joining the effort, including Commerzbank.\n\n“Our strategy there is very simple,” Sergio Ermotti said of the Batavia project. “We try to initiate and get as many other financial institutions and clients into teams, like trade finance, with other banks, and IBM was a successful venture.” The executive added that efforts to deploy blockchain in financial services are aimed at helping FIs “operate and transact at a cheaper, more efficient level.”\n\nThe remarks were made after UBS Group released its latest earnings report.\n\nDespite hitting a 14 percent increase in net profits for the quarter, the FI still missed estimates.\n\n“I’m very pleased with the good results we saw across all our business divisions and particularly pleased with the fact that our investments in the last three years in the Asia-Pacific region, despite the very challenging environment, are paying off,” Ermotti told CNBC. “There’s a new billionaire in Asia every two to three days, so Asia continues to be a fantastic opportunity for us.”', 'APPLE Inc co-founder Steve Wozniak recently declared that bitcoin is “better than gold and the United States dollar”.\n\nBY TATIRA ZWINOIRA\n\nWozniak even went a step further to compare having a bitcoin to owning a house due to its surge in value.\n\nBill Gates, the world’s richest man and Microsoft co-founder three years ago also described the bitcoin as “better than a currency”.\n\nThe world’s crypto market cap stands at $170 billion, with analysts predicting it to hit $2 trillion in the coming years.\n\nThe bitcoin’s value against the dollar had grown 239,46% to $5 896,21 per bitcoin as of Friday from a May 14 figure of $1 736,91 when Standardbusiness first uncovered a small, but vibrant bitcoin community in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis has triggered an interest from locals.\n\n“In general, Zimbabweans could have bought bitcoins in various ways, which makes it difficult to know the trend at the broad local level.\n\n“With regards to trades on Golix, kindly refer to our homepage for the monthly and daily statistics.\n\n“The general trend shows an increase in interest in the bitcoin,” said Yeukai Kusangaya who co-ordinates trades at the Golix bitcoin exchange.\n\n“It is not necessary to have cash to buy bitcoin. Most people just use the generally available electronic means.\n\n“As such, the buying of bitcoin is not affected by the prevailing cash shortages… in the event that a seller wants cash for bitcoin, they will have to identify such a buyer with cash on their own and do a peer to peer trade.”\n\nWhile most locals are involved in the bitcoin trade through what is known as bitcoin mining, a process of adding transaction records to bitcoin’s public ledger of transactions or blockchain done in a singular network, bitcoin trading has risen.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the most common bitcoin exchanges are Golix and Spectrocoin. Golix was formerly Bitfundi under start-up company Bitfinance Zimbabwe\n\n“Over time, however, the interest [in bitcoin] has been increasing. It is important to note that this is normal upward-growth trajectory of most innovations,” Kusangaya said.\n\nOn why locals were becoming more interested apart from the obvious rise in value of bitcoin, Kusangaya said the reasons generally varied from person to person, and with its use.\n\n“Some use it to pay for services provided outside the country, such as software,” she said.\n\n“For example, a local software engineer developing an app can use bitcoin to pay for necessary software tools. Others use bitcoin to say, import a car they can use to run a small business.\n\n“The good news with using bitcoin for such purposes is that no foreign currency leaves the country, unlike a situation where the same person was to ask their bank to do a telegraphic transfer.\n\n“This reduces the country’s pressure on nostro balances.”\n\nKusangaya said it was impossible to know the number of local bitcoin users because bitcoin was essentially a peer to peer instrument run by a block chain — a decentralised ledger, meaning that the cryptocurrency operates in a very secure system.\n\nSpectrocoin did not respond to enquiries made last week.\n\nTo use bitcoin for either buying or selling, individuals have to first create a bitcoin wallet where they intend to keep bitcoins.\n\nThese wallets are on a blockchain, which is used to record transactions across many computers and used for cryptocurrency transactions due to the level of security associated with them.\n\nOnce the wallet has been created, the person proceeds to register on a crypto currency exchange or in the case of bitcoins, a “bitcoin exchange”.\n\nOn the exchange, a person must provide personal details similar to that of opening a bank account in order to start buying and selling.\n\nOnce the process has been approved, a person can start buying or selling and placing the bitcoins in the wallet.\n\nHowever, people have to buy or sell bitcoin on a local exchange or send the bitcoin from their wallets to another user to do it for them outside the country.\n\nBitcoins have surpassed other investment alternatives such as gold. According to United States Apmex Inc, the world’s largest online retailer of precious metals, the price of gold per ounce was $1 269,4 on Friday from $1 229,58 as at May 12.\n\nWhat is driving the growth of bitcoin?\n\nFounder of South Africa-based Liquid Crypto-Money, Shireen Ramjoo said it was due to more countries regulating the crypto-currency.\n\n“More countries have regulated bitcoin and as a result, more people are starting to use it,” she said.\n\n“As more regulations happen worldwide, it creates opportunity for bitcoin to become more ingrained in our societies. Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Philippines as well as recently Australia have regulated it,” she said.\n\n“Russia, Malta, India and Malaysia are some of the few who have set their eye on creating regulatory frameworks as well for cryptocurrencies by 2018.”\n\nShe said the growth in the value of bitcoin could also be explained by “forks” which is a change in the software of digital currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history.\n\nDue to forks creating more versions of these blockchains, thus securing a bitcoin network, free bitcoin cash is created but at a much lesser value than the actual bitcoin.\n\n“In August we saw bitcoin cash fork, and recently bitcoin gold. We anticipate the third fork on bitcoin to happen in November. Usually before such forks happen, there is a rush of people buying into bitcoin that will increase the value as people are trying to accumulate “free-coins”.\n\n“You automatically get the same equivalent of the new coin as a result.”\n\nOn the Golix Exchange, the bitcoin is trading significantly higher than the global prices at about $9 800 for one bitcoin on Friday but that is due to the billions of dollars in real time gross settlement (RTGS) balances.\n\nHowever, despite the value being more locally, outside bitcoin users have remained sceptical as the RTGS balances themselves are not backed by anything.\n\nBitcoin is one of 800 cryptocurrencies in use.\n\nIn May, central bank governor John Mangudya warned against the usage of bitcoin due to the high levels of externalisation, laundering of money and financial cybercrimes.']"

You should also pay careful attention to suspicious solicitation of ICOs.\n\nTwo Existing Laws May Apply\n\nAlthough Japan has no specific laws for ICOs, they may be regulated by two existing laws. For businesses launching an ICO, the FSA emphasized:\n\nICOs may fall within the scope of the Payment Services Act and/or the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act depending on how they are structured.\n\nIf a token issued in an ICO falls under the virtual currency provisions of the Payment Services Act, then businesses providing digital currency exchange services regularly “must be registered with each Local Finance Bureau that is the delegated authority to the Prime Minister,” the FSA wrote. So far, eleven cryptocurrency exchanges have been approved by the agency.\n\nHowever, “if an ICO has the characteristics of an investment, and the purchase of a token by a virtual currency is practically deemed equivalent to that of legal tender, the ICO becomes subject to regulations under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act,” the agency described.\n\nICOs in Japan\n\nThe ICO market in Japan is growing. Small companies, as well as large corporations, are using token sales to raise money. Recently, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the country’s internet giant, GMO, planning to use an ICO to sell its 7nm bitcoin mining boards. Japanese financial services company SBI Group is also launching two ICO businesses: a financing business and a rating information business through Morningstar Japan.\n\nTech Bureau, which operates the Japanese bitcoin exchange Zaif, launched a platform called Comsa in August. The company described Comsa as a “one-stop solution that includes a creation of multi-language whitepaper, pre-configured token sale dashboard, blockchain integration services and PR services, dedicated for your own ICO.”\n\nSingaporean bitcoin exchange Quoine, which has a strong presence in Japan, announced early this month the launch of a global ICO known as the Qash. Both Quoine and Zaif were among the eleven bitcoin exchanges approved by the FSA in September.\n\nFurthermore, Chinese bitcoin exchanges are reportedly trying to move their ICO businesses to Japan. According to theleading Japanese bitcoin exchange Coincheck, the company has received “hundreds of requests from Chinese startups and startups around the world asking us to list their tokens, after the Chinese government banned ICOs,” the exchange revealed.\n\nWhat do you think of Japan’s position on ICOs?

But when it’s hedge funds, the phrase takes on a different meaning.\n\nCNBC was able to access data that shows that more than 120 hedge funds re now focused solely on cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the most part, these funds were just launched this year.\n\nThe rapid rise of hedge funds focused solely on cryptocurrencies is credited to the impressive increase in the rise of Bitcoin’s price. It hit an all-time high of $6,100 earlier this month.\n\nLet’s look closer at the data CNBC obtained.\n\nFunds focused solely on cryptos have roughly $2.3 billion in assets under management. These funds, referred to as crypto-funds, total 124. More than 90 of these funds focus specifically on digital assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThe following are included in that figure.\n\nMost of the funds, or 37%, based their funds’ strategies on the same as what are used by venture capitalists. They’ve managed to accumulate $1.1 billion in managed assets.\n\nThose hedge funds that focus specifically on trading digital assets made up 32% of the bunch, with roughly $700 million in managed assets.\n\nThen there are funds that are structured to specifically hold assets related to machine learning, data science or statistical arbitrage on digital currencies. They made up 10% of the group, with $100 million in assets under management.\n\nICOs of interest too\n\nMany in the mainstream financial sector may have accepted Bitcoin and Ethereum, but they are still squeamish when it comes to other cryptos. However, the findings show they are increasingly warming to them.\n\nFor example, ICOs don’t appear to be as off putting to those forming hedge funds. Noted in the report is that $3 billion has been raised through ICOs this year. That kind of number has many market players taking note of them.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAs we continue to see the rise in prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the attractive rise in other digital tokens, expect to see more hedge funds open their doors and be dedicated strictly to cryptos.\n\nThe data collected by CNBC comes from a research firm called Autonomous Next.', ""19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the most important conference in China this year, ended on Oct. 24. With the end of the conference, some temporary regulations and policies are canceled as well. Among the regulations, the shutdown of Bitcoin trading in China might be one.\n\nOn Oct. 28 ZB.com, which is a new cryptocurrency trading platform, announced that all trading functionality will be available from Nov. 1. Users can sign up for accounts and deposit now.\n\nThe platform claims that people all over the world, including those in mainland China, can exchange and trade on the platform. The languages of the website are Chinese and English. However, it’s too soon to state that the regulation toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is invalid. Maybe the platform will be closed by the government soon. Nevertheless, there are also people saying that the Chinese government is behind the platform.\n\nOffline trades become popular after regulation\n\nFor now, nobody knows exactly what’s going to happen after Nov. 1. It's good news if Chinese Bitcoin traders may operate more easily. Since the shutdown of Bitcoin trading platforms in China, people have started to trade Bitcoin through Taobao, which is the Chinese version of eBay which belongs to Alibaba Group, Wechat chatting group, and QQ chatting group. Offline trades have become popular between Chinese Bitcoin traders."", 'Bitcoin cash price is currently correcting lower from $518 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD might find support near $400 for the next move.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin cash price after a monstrous upside move towards $500 against the US Dollar started a downside correction.\n\nThere is a bullish trend line forming with support at $405 on the hourly chart of BCH/USD (data feed from Kraken).\n\nThe price remains supported on the downside near $405 and $400 levels in the short term.\n\nBitcoin cash price is currently correcting lower from $518 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD might find support near $400 for the next move.\n\nBitcoin Cash Price Support\n\nFinally, there was a major upside break in Bitcoin cash price above $350 against the US Dollar. The price rocketed higher and broke many resistance levels such as $350, $400 and $450. There was even a break above the $500 handle and the price traded as high as $518.9. Later, sellers appeared and the price started a downside correction. It moved down and traded below the $450 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $375 low to $518 high.\n\nHowever, the price is approaching a major support area near $400, which was a resistance earlier. There is also a bullish trend line forming with support at $405 on the hourly chart of BCH/USD. Moreover, the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $375 low to $518 high is also close to $405. Therefore, the $405-400 levels are likely to act as a strong support for buyers in the near term.\n\nOn the upside, an initial resistance is again $450. A break above it could push the pair back towards $500.

However it seems that despite it being considered old, it looks like there could still be a ton of use left for the phone, especially for bitcoin mining in which you can see in the photo above.\n\nAs part of Samsung’s “Upcycling” initiative, the company has thrown together a bitcoin mining rig that repurposes 40 old Galaxy S5 handsets that is powered by a new custom operating system designed for their initiative. Clearly this isn’t really something that Samsung plans to sell or encourage users to do, but it is more of Samsung showing that not all our old devices have to sit in our drawers collecting dust, nor do they have to be thrown away or disposed of when you can find a new use for them.\n\nUnfortunately details about the rig are scarce as according to Motherboard, Samsung declined to answer specific questions about the rig. However they do note that it seems that eight Galaxy S5 handsets are capable of mining at a greater power efficiency than a standard desktop computer.\n\nHowever like we said, the goal of this demonstration is to prove that your old devices don’t necessarily have to turn to junk. Speaking to Motherboard, Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit said, “The best thing for the planet is for your old devices to be worth as much as possible. There’s a direct correlation between secondary market value and environmental longevity. [Samsung] wants to maintain the value of their devices long term. If they know they’re going to justify a new price of a thousand dollars for a new Note, it’s easier to get people to spend that thousand dollars if they can resell it for five hundred.”\n\nFiled in .

The governor, however, claimed that the central bank will not be launching the regulation very soon.\n\nDuring the audit of BOK by the National Assembly, Lee claimed that digital currencies like Bitcoin cannot be regarded as money based on the definition of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS).\n\n“It is difficult to look at [virtual currencies] as money by [the definition] of Bank of International Settlements (BIS). Regulation (of virtual currencies) is appropriate because it is regarded as a commodity. It [cannot be] regulated at the level of a currency.”\n\nThe latest actions by South Korea on virtual currencies\n\nTo promptly tackle the issues involving cryptocurrencies, the South Korean government created in 2016 a digital currency task force to study the regulatory and licensing parameters for Bitcoin and Bitcoin exchanges. In early June 2017, a CNN report stated that the participants in the study ‘failed to agree on whether cryptocurrencies should be included in systems right now and how the systems work if they are included.”\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea’s financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has issued a ban on initial coin offerings (ICO) guided by the task force. The aim of the ban is to protect investors from possible fraud. This move has led to worries of a campaign against the local digital currency trading market in the country that is similar to the crackdown recently launched by the Chinese government.\n\nFSS vice chairman Kim Yong-bum was quoted at the time that ICOs increase the risk of fraud, so a ban will be implemented.', 'Famous Wall Street investor Bill Miller has a bullish 30 percent of his fund’s assets in Bitcoin according to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, based on a letter to investors. The letter made it clear that Miller’s fund put 30 percent into Bitcoin back in early 2016 when Bitcoin prices were a fraction of the current level.\n\nMiller’s fund is up for the year more than 70 percent, far outperforming even the most publicly known hedge funds like Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC, which has only posted 14 percent gains on the year.\n\nMiller had already indicated that one percent of his personal net worth was invested into Bitcoin early in 2016 as well, causing a stir among Wall Street professionals like Dimon, Fink, and Buffet who have rejected Bitcoin as a bubble or fraud. Miller, however, remains undeterred, being widely known as an excellent judge of value. While not strictly bullish on Bitcoin, Miller sees it as an opportunity, saying:', 'Earlier today, on October 29, the price of Bitcoin Cash surged by over 20 percent within a 24-hour span. Several major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum’s native currency Ether also demonstrated an increase in their values, as the price of Ether rose by another six percent.\n\nBitcoin Cash Records a Significant Daily Increase in Price\n\nFor many months since its launch in August, Bitcoin Cash has substantially declined in value, dipping below $320 at one point. Within the past 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) increased from $400 to $522, demonstrating a staggering $122 daily gain. The BCH price has endured a slight correction since reaching its monthly peak and has stabilized at around $460.\n\nIn analyzing the factors for the increase in the value of Bitcoin Cash, it is important to acknowledge some of its major exchange markets. Currently, more than 50 percent of global BCH trades are concentrated in one exchange, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb.\n\nAccording to various cryptocurrency market data providers including CoinMarketCap, three largest exchange markets in the BCH market are Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit, which are all based in South Korea. To put it simply, at the time of reporting, the South Korean cryptocurrency market has accounted for over 65 percent of global BCH trades.\n\nBithumb has been an important factor in the rapid growth rate of Bitcoin Cash. As the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world behind Bitfinex, the integration of Bithumb provides significant liquidity to a cryptocurrency. The importance of the integration of Bithumb has recently been demonstrated by Qtum. Within five days of integrating Qtum, Bithumb became the largest Qtum exchange market with around 51 percent in market share.\n\n“In less than five days since the integration of Qtum, Bithumb evolved into the largest Qtum exchange in the global market. In the upcoming years, Bithumb will continue to focus on providing support for leading cryptocurrencies with innovative vision and competition,” said Bithumb.\n\nHence, the increase in demand for Bitcoin Cash from the South Korean market and specifically by Bithumb users, traders, and investors has been a driving factor in the upward momentum of BItcoin Cash.\n\nEthereum Finally Enters the $300 Region\n\nAfter struggling to rebound from a previous major correction on October 4, the price of Ether has finally recovered beyond the $300 mark. In the past 24 hours, the price of Ether increased from $297 to $307, by around $20.\n\nUsually, the price trend of Ether tends to correlate with that of bitcoin. However, today, Ether recorded a major daily gain while the price of bitcoin struggled to rebound back to $5,900.\n\nEarlier this week, CCN reported that Blockchain, the world’s most widely utilized mobile bitcoin wallet, integrated Ethereum to allow its users to send, receive, and store Ether.\n\n“Adoption of Ethereum is an important indicator for the mid and long-term price trend of Ether. Earlier this week, Blockchain, the second most popular bitcoin wallet behind Coinbase, announced the integration of Ethereum into its mobile wallet, the most widely utilized bitcoin mobile wallet in the market.”\n\nIn the mid-term, the growing adoption of cryptocurrency platforms like Blockchain and the strong performance of Ether in major regions such as South Korea will allow the cryptocurrency to surge in value.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Lebanese central bank Banque du Liban (BDL) Governor Riad Salameh has claimed that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are “unregulated” commodities whose use should be prohibited. He also said that digital currencies will be ineffective as national currencies because they are just “commodities.”\n\nAt the opening ceremony of the 7th Corporate Social Responsibility Lebanon Forum in late October 2017, Salameh told participants that the BDL prohibited the use of the cryptocurrencies across Lebanon due to their nature resembling that of commodities. He further claimed that money will eventually be digitized in the future.\n\n""These [Bitcoin] are not currencies but rather a commodity whose prices rise and fall without any justification. For this reason, BDL has banned the use of this currency in the Lebanese market. We understand that electronic currency will play a prominent role in the future. But BDL must first make the necessary arrangements before taking this step and develop [a] protection system from cybercrime.”\n\nLebanon launches own digital currency\n\nAt the forum, Salameh also announced the plan by the central bank to introduce its own digital currency. He, however, did not reveal whether the currency will be based on Blockchain technology, which is behind Bitcoin and the other virtual currencies. It is possible that BDL will utilize other forms of technology to create a centralized digital currency in Lebanon as is being done by other countries.\n\nIndependent countries such as Ecuador and Sweden are studying the possible use of other technologies in creating their own digital money.

10/30/2017,"[""Bitcoin's rally is showing no signs of abating.\n\nPrices surged to record levels on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) yesterday, with the world's largest cryptocurrency clocking a new all-time high of $6,306.58. With the push, bitcoin passed its previous high of $6,183 set on Oct. 21. At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is $6,218.\n\nAs for why the price is trending higher, it seems there was an absence of strong news drivers.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'The Securities and Exchange Commission Investor Advisory Committee held a public meeting regarding blockchain and distributed ledger technology earlier this month, and one of the individuals who was invited to participate in the meeting was Chain CEO Adam Ludwin. During his opening remarks, Ludwin shared his perspective on the entire blockchain ecosystem (both public and private models), but the most compelling part of his appearance may have been when he shared his views on the current price mania around cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICO).\n\n“I think you have to look at it from the perspective of the buyer and the seller mentality,” Ludwin said of the current digital asset market. “In essence, it is currently rational to be irrational as a buyer [or] a seller in this market.”\n\nIf you’re not aware, more than $3 billion has been raised through ICOs since the beginning of 2017 (according to Coinschedule). For those who don’t know the first thing about ICOs, check out Laura Shin’s in-depth piece about this new financial phenomenon from earlier in the year.\n\nThe Buyers of ICOs\n\nWhen discussing the kinds of people who are participating in ICOs and token crowdsales during his appearance at the public meeting, Ludwin was quick to point to those who have already made large sums of cash by speculating on the prices of bitcoin and ether over the past few years.\n\n“On the buyer side, there are many, many people who invested early in bitcoin, made a tremendous amount of money and now have, effectively, a house money effect weighing on them where it’s found money — it’s a windfall — and they’re diversifying into every new project that comes along because: Why not?” explained Ludwin. “If you’ve made money, you might as well say, ‘I’ll keep going.’”\n\nLudwin also pointed to those who sat on the sidelines while bitcoin and ether went up a hundredfold or more because they didn’t understand the technology as probable buyers of new digital assets.\n\n“Now, you almost have this inverted mindset where you tell yourself, ‘Alright, I have to look for things I don’t understand, and the more confusing it is, the better investment it probably is,’” said Ludwin. “It’s a very perverse mentality, obviously.”\n\nAs The New York Times recently reported, some ICOs are also obtaining the services of celebrities like Floyd Mayweather and Paris Hilton to promote their projects to those who have no basic understanding of cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology.\n\nThe Sellers of ICOs\n\nFrom Ludwin’s perspective, the irrational exuberance from the buy side of the market has led to the creation of many new projects willing to meet that demand. The Chain CEO shared three reasons as to why it’s extremely tempting for individuals and teams to create, issue, and sell new cryptocurrencies.\n\n“Number one, there’s no dilution (it’s not equity in the traditional sense) and there’s no debt — you don’t have to pay it back,” said Ludwin. “People are buying for the appreciation expectations. It’s really free financing; it’s a remarkable instrument. [Secondly], there’s a belief out there that, by selling tokens, you’re creating evangelists for your project and they will tell their friends [about it]. And the truth is that’s probably right. People are interested in spreading the news about a new token in order for their tokens to go up in price and the sellers do have a kind of product/market fit. Of course, the thing that people are buying is a dream of making money, not interest in the underlying service usually. Finally, there’s an ability now by issuing these tokens to actually exit before you start. Normally, when you build a company, the exit comes at the end (and that’s why it’s called the exit). Here, if you issue a token and you can clear tens of millions of dollars before your project even launches, it’s an even better deal than we had in the 90s [dotcom bubble].”', 'What does the constitution and fiat currencies have in common?\n\nIt’s very difficult to effect a change in a constitution. In most cases, a constitutional amendment is only ratified after two-thirds of the House and Senate approve the amendment proposal. After that, lawmakers send the proposal to the states for a vote. Three-fourths of the states must support the proposed amendment before it actually makes it into the constitution. That’s a long and tedious process.\n\nIt also requires a long and tedious process to stimulate the foreign exchange market. Here’s how.\n\nA recent study conducted by Bank of America Corp.’s Alice Leng revealed that foreign exchange trading — or forex, which essentially means the exchange or conversion of one fiat currency for another based on the values of each participating currency — now responds to shocks in the market less meaningfully. Even when the forex market responds meaningfully to shocks, it’s usually not sustained for a long period. It’ll potentially take six times the effort it took 15 years ago to stir volatility in the forex market today, Leng wrote in a note published Monday, Oct. 9. The low volatility in the forex market is obvious in that the JPMorgan FX volatility index is 12 percent lower than its five-average, according to a Bloomberg.\n\nThe recent low volatility of fiat currencies stands in stack contrast to Bitcoin, which has been criticized for its high volatility. Central bank or securities administration agencies globally have warned that people should be cautious of Bitcoin and other digital currencies mainly because of their volatility. But fiat currencies haven’t always been stable. Let’s dig a little into the volatility history of the U.S. dollar as a case study.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar\n\nA good way to check the volatility history of the U.S. dollar is by checking the U.S. Dollar Index. The U.S. Dollar index tracks the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the values of a basket of six international currencies. Maintained by the ICE Futures U.S., Inc., the U.S. Dollar Index is geometrically averaged and tracks the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nChart of the U.S. Dollar Index since November 1985. Source: tradingview.com\n\nOf course, that’s a huge chart and it’s difficult to make out anything from it. We’ll break the chart down into three different charts, each representing a decade to see the volatility history of the U.S. dollar. First, I would like to point out that for the purpose of this article we’ll be associating volatility to major, steep falls in the value of the U.S. dollar, since that’s typically the major focus when discussing the volatility of Bitcoin.\n\n1985-1995\n\nThe chart above represents the decade between 1985 and 1995. The major sign of volatility in the U.S. dollar during this decade was the overall drop in the value of the dollar between 1985 and 1987 — around the period that the Latin America debt crisis hit. Within those years, the U.S. Dollar Index fell from about 124.99 to 85.42, a 31.7 percent decline. The value of the dollar didn’t quite rise in value for the remainder of the decade, on an overall basis.\n\n1995-2005\n\nThe chart above represents the movement of the U.S. dollar index between 1995 and 2005. The U.S. dollar, once again, showed signs of volatility during the period between Jan. 1, 2002 and Dec. 1, 2004, with the U.S. dollar index dropping from roughly 120.28 to 80.85, a 32.8 percent drop. This period coincided with the dotcom bubble.\n\n2005-2015\n\nFinally, we’ll look at the decade between 2005 and 2015 as shown in the chart above. The biggest sign of volatility during this decade occurred between November 2005 and March 2008 — around the time that the last global financial crisis got serious. During this period, the U.S. Dollar Index dropped from about 91.57 to about 70.53, a 23 percent decline.\n\nPlease note that I’ve only looked into the cases of the largest volatilities in the decades we’re considering here. As the charts show, the U.S. dollar showed several signs of volatility during these decades. This is especially the case during the decade between 2005 and 2015.\n\nComparing it to Bitcoin volatility\n\nYes, I agree, this is an insane thing to do. But who knows what we might find. Again, for the purpose of this article, we’ll be associating volatility to major, steep falls in price.\n\nChart showing the Bitcoin price movement since 2013\n\nSince it was created in 2009, Bitcoin has risen from about $4.89 to record an all-time high of over $6,200, as of the time of writing. This dramatic rise is one of the reasons the digital currency is unpopular within most of the traditional investing community. Hello, Jamie Dimon!\n\nBitcoin rose on the back of a string of events, a major highlight being the approval of Bitcoin by the People’s Bank of China in November 2013. After the approval by the Chinese central bank, Bitcoin went on to record a then all-time high of about $1,242 just before the close of November 2013.\n\nHowever, two major events — the struggles of the then-largest Bitcoin exchange MT Gox and the Chinese central bank banning financial institutions from using Bitcoin — started the first highly volatile Bitcoin price movement. Between Nov. 29, 2013, when Bitcoin recorded the $1,242 high, and Dec. 18, 2013, Bitcoin shed about 54.8 percent in value. Although it recouped some of the losses at the start of 2014, the digital currency reached another low of $386.20 in April 2014 — declining by 60 percent from a $958 high in January 2014. Over the next year Bitcoin would continue its downward trend to record a three-year low of under $200.\n\nBitcoin started rallying again in 2016, rising above 138 percent in 2016. The highest drop witnessed in 2016 was a 19 percent drop between June 19 and June 23. By the standards of previous volatility signs, it’s safe to say 2016 was quite a stable year for Bitcoin.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Bitcoin had risen by nearly 500 percent in value since Jan. 1, 2017. Despite the huge gain, the largest major drop in the price of Bitcoin was 33 percent — between Sept. 1 and Sept. 14, the period when the Chinese government cracked down on Bitcoin.\n\nWhat can we infer?\n\nThe short answer is that Bitcoin’s biggest volatility moves are more intense than the dollar’s volatility moves historically. And that shouldn’t be surprising. Here’s a bit more detail.\n\nFirst, the longest overall downward streak in the U.S. Dollar Index that led to the highest decline in the value of the U.S. dollar was between January 2002 and December 2004. That’s nearly three years. The index dropped by about 32.8 percent during that period.\n\nBy comparison, Bitcoin’s sharpest downward streak that led to the highest decline in price was between January 2014 and April 2014 — about three months. The digital currency lost about 60 percent of its value during that period. There was no time over the last three decades that the U.S. dollar lost so much of its value within months. In addition, Bitcoin’s longest downward streak lasted between November 2013 when it reached a high of about $1,242 and January 2015 when Bitcoin reached a low of about $192 — an 85 percent drop.\n\nA bright spot for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin trading volume\n\nYes, Bitcoin has been volatile and it still is.The bright spot, however, is that stability is gradually becoming a part of Bitcoin. As mentioned earlier, the steepest decline in the price of Bitcoin in 2016 resulted in a mere 19 percent drop. In addition, the largest major drop in the price of Bitcoin so far in 2017 has been the 33 percent drop in September with the news of Chinese regulations on ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges. This was a bigger event than in 2013 when the price of Bitcoin dropped by roughly 55 percent after the Chinese government banned financial institutions from using Bitcoin. The increased stability is mainly due to the fact that Bitcoin’s trading volume has increased considerably compared to 2013 — as shown in the Bitcoin volume chart above.\n\nVerdict\n\nFor all the publicity of Bitcoin’s volatility, little has been said about how it’s gaining stability. As its trading volume increased over the years, elements of stability have kicked in. It’s safe to say, the more stable Bitcoin’s trading volume becomes, the more stable its price will be.', 'Samsung also repurposed an S3 into a fishtank monitor and a Galaxy tablet into an Ubuntu laptop among other experiments.

The information nonetheless comes only in the form of implication. Li continued:\n\n“In the past, Huobi brand in China has been a significant symbol in the industry of digital assets. In the future [...] Huobi team will continue to actively and globally participate in the development of the industry.”\n\nAn interim measure has seen Chinese traders return en masse to p2p platforms, principally LocalBitcoins, the use of which has ballooned for a second time this year.\n\nLi concluded by thanking users and reiterating a desire to leverage benefits of the Chinese regulatory crackdown. He wrote:', 'While the price of Bitcoin Cash was on the rise over the weekend, plans were consolidated to repair the broken difficulty adjustment with a hard fork on November 13. If the cryptocurrency aims to be taken seriously, this is needed badly.\n\nOn the weekend the price of Bitcoin Cash jumped from $320 to more than $460, or from 0.054 to 0.071 BTC. The massive rise was orchestrated by the growing likelihood of the SegWit2x hard fork to fail and the idea of Bitcoin.com that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin.\n\nAll of this ignores that the difficulty algorithm of Bitcoin Cash is terribly broken. To understand why, we need to reach back a bit; Bitcoin adjusts the difficulty of mining for each sequence of 2016 blocks – which is about every two weeks – so that a new block is generated every ten minutes. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, if two coins have the same mining algorithm, they compete for the same hash power. This has terrible implications for the weaker, and usually, cheaper coin; while the miners migrate to the more profitable coin, the difficulty remains the same for 2016 blocks, and the network needs more and more time to add new blocks. The blockchain freezes, and, as a final consequence, completely grind to a halt.\n\nBitcoin Cash Survived but Paid a High Price\n\nTo protect Bitcoin Cash against the risk of dying by chain stagnation, the developers implemented a so-called EDA – an Emergency Difficulty Adjustment. Whenever the miners have needed more than 12 hours to find six blocks, mining difficulty is reduced by 20 percent.\n\nThe EDA has been successful in helping Bitcoin Cash to survive as a minority chain of Bitcoin’s SHA 256 mining algorithm. However, it was a complete failure to stabilize the block intervals. Since the birth of Bitcoin Cash on August 1, there is a constant switch between periods of ice ages, in which only one block is found in some hours, and periods of rapid block productions, which are induced by a series of EDAs. These adjustments drastically reduce difficulty and result in up to 90 blocks per hour. As an unwanted side effect, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain has added nearly 8,000 blocks more than the Bitcoin blockchain, increasing the production of monetary units by 100,000. Hence, Bitcoin Cash has a significantly higher inflation schedule than Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nA Hard Fork to Fix the EDA\n\nTo fix this disaster, the Bitcoin Cash developers have planned to do another hard fork on November 13 to change the difficulty algorithm. At the time of writing, they have not decided which proposal will be implemented. There are proposals from Tom Zander (Bitcoin Classic), Amaury Séchet (Bitcoin ABC), Neil Booth (Bitcoin Unlimited), and Tom Harding (Bitcoin XT), representing each team involved in Bitcoin Cash’s development.\n\nThe concrete proposals consist mostly of mathematical formulas. Their goal is to reach a stable block interval of 600 seconds, which is flexibly adjusted to hash rate fluctuations, but not too complex to be understood by SPV wallets. The basic problem is to find a good tradeoff between flexibility and stability. Detailed explanations of the proposals of Amaury Séchet, Neil Booth, and Tom Harding are available. Simulations conducted with different software developed by Tom Zander, Tom Harding, and Neil Booth have also been presented. They indicate that Tom Harding’s proposal provides the best results, combining the flexibility of Séchets proposal and the stability of Booth’s algorithm.\n\nThe same conclusion found the developer Scott Roberts. He already worked with flexible difficulty algorithms of altcoins and was asked by Tom Harding (Degnr8) to examine his proposal. Roberts wanted to explain that the world’s best flexible difficulty algorithm is an adjusted version of Digishield v3 – but realized that Harding’s algorithm is even better. “Degnr8 has struck gold. I hope all the devs will agree ‘this is it.’”\n\nAfter being tested by nChain and BitPrim, Bitcoin ABC decided to implement Séchet’s proposal. “We acknowledge that D601 (proposal from Amaury Sechet) may not necessarily have the highest performance, but since all three had similar performance, D601 was selected because it appears to have the least risk.” The software implementing the new algorithm is planned to be released on November 1, 2017.\n\nIf Bitcoin Cash succeeds with this – if the developers manage to implement a working flexible new difficulty adjustment algorithm in November – the currency has good chances to benefit from the chaos and disruption induced by a failed SegWit2x hard fork.', 'Tuesday marks nine years since Satoshi Nakamoto announced the creation of the Bitcoin “Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper, still available on the same Bitcoin.org domain as it was in October 2008, offers an increasingly fascinating view into the niche project which in October 2017 has a market cap of over $100 bln. The document famously begins:\n\n“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\n“Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.”\n\nThose networks are now used by three mln users every day, with that number expected to increase to 200 mln within just seven years projections state.\n\nThere are currently 3 million daily users of #Cryptocurrencies, by 2024 this number is expected to exceed 200 million. #Cryptocurrency $BTC pic.twitter.com/VpqKHQ034Y — Blockchainlife (@Blockchainlife) October 29, 2017\n\nThis year’s anniversary is especially timely as Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs without a hint of serious price corrections.\n\nOct. 31 this year is also significant for other reasons, the date marking the deadline by which China’s domestic market exchanges must cease providing Bitcoin-to-fiat trading.\n\nWhile those traders have since migrated to alternatives, the mood both inside and outside the multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry is that Bitcoin is here to stay and will come out stronger as a result of competition from copies - Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Silver and SegWit2x.', 'Another day. Another record for bitcoin.\n\nThe most widely used digital currency will now cost you about $6,125 apiece after blowing past the $5,000 and $6,000 price levels for the first time earlier this month. Bitcoin’s total value is just over $100 billion, meaning it makes up more than half of the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nCryptocurrency prices have been unfazed by recent regulatory crackdowns across the world and skepticism from Wall Street stalwarts including Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

""We think this creates a large hole for the company next year.""', 'On this week\'s Rule Breakers podcast, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner takes on a topic that he\'s never hit before, but that plenty of his listeners want to hear about from him: cryptocurrencies. To answer their questions about bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain technology, and more, he\'s enlisted the help of Fool analyst Aaron Bush.\n\nIn this segment, they discuss the three biggest reasons that blockchain changes everything: its power to create vast decentralized networks of people, its ability to transform information into value, and the way it makes open protocols work so much better. There\'s a lot to unpack there -- along with a sidetrack into what exactly a cryptocurrency miner is -- so let\'s get to it.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on Oct. 18, 2017.\n\nDavid Gardner: What is this technology enabling? I think a lot of us think of bitcoin, first and foremost, and I think a lot of the reason that people think about that is because the value of bitcoin over the last couple of years has skyrocketed. There are a finite number of bitcoin, right?\n\nIt is a new asset class, but like real estate, there\'s only so much Earth. So it\'s defined, and therefore this moving price of the commodity is just how much, within this finite class of a commodity, this new asset class, how much people value it or want it. And roughly, I think, these days, I think it\'s around $6,000 or something like that, for a bitcoin.\n\nAaron Bush: I think it\'s about fifty-five...\n\nGardner: Fifty-five. It\'s changed $500 since I last looked ...\n\nBush: ... but still a $93 billion market cap, which is phenomenal.\n\nGardner: A $93 billion market cap. That\'s a number I didn\'t know. Now I\'m going to say two years ago, and I\'m not looking at a chart right now, Aaron, but bitcoin was maybe worth about one-tenth? I mean, we\'re talking about a 10-bagger in the last couple of years.\n\nBush: It might not be quite a 10-bagger, but it\'s still pretty phenomenal.\n\nGardner: So a $93 billion value to this asset class. That implies to me, Aaron, that there\'s some real value here. And even if bitcoin is zooming up and down on a daily basis and is somewhat speculative, there\'s real value being created out there. In what is that value centered? Why do we care so much? What\'s happening out there?\n\nBush: I think this entire movement is really groundbreaking for three or so reasons. The first one, and one significant reason why humans have stood out as a species, is simply because we can organize behavior at a larger and larger scale. In some ways that is the story of our history, our evolution from small tribes to superpowers. And the result of that is more centralization, because as we create more value as a species, we also have to build structures into existence, like governments and multinational corporations, to protect it.\n\nWhat blockchains and cryptocurrencies bring us are a new way to organize networks of humans in a bigger and sometimes more efficient way, but it completely reverses that trend of centralization for maybe the first time in thousands of years. And I think we\'re only starting to scratch the surface of what that really means.\n\nGardner: So that\'s No. 1.\n\nBush: That\'s No. 1.\n\nGardner: A new way to organize human productivity.\n\nBush: Absolutely.\n\nGardner: You and me.\n\nBush: Second, this movement is transforming the internet of information into an internet of value. This new money, through tokens and coins, literally lives on the internet and, importantly, these currencies hold real utility. They provide access to networks that do real things, and as you mentioned, it\'s really the supply versus demand of that that gives these currencies, these tokens, value.\n\nAnd what\'s a breakthrough about this is that the incentives are actually built into the network. For example, with bitcoin it\'s the miners who uphold the network that verify the transactions. That create the new coins. Produce the supply. They get paid in bitcoins to make it possible.\n\nWhen the incentive structures are built into the code, not only does it allow it to be a stand-alone type of service, but it also encourages people to jump on early, and the early users are the people who sometimes are rewarded the most, unlike other internet applications. Maybe I was an early Facebook user, but I didn\'t gain any monetary incentive from that. So this is a new way to incentivize networks to grow rapidly.\n\nGardner: We\'re going to get to No. 3 in a sec, but I want to zoom up high level and then come back to where we are. We started by saying that blockchain is the big technology. That\'s the life changer. That\'s what started with bitcoin in 2008 -- the first blockchain.\n\nWithin blockchain, one subset is cryptocurrencies ...\n\nBush: Yes.\n\nGardner: ... and within that subset are bitcoin. So we can see the big picture. I want to drill down because you just used two terms in that last explanation that I think deserves a little bit more understanding. I\'ve got questions about them. The two terms I\'m thinking of are tokens and miners. Now, you referred to both, and you broke down miners a little bit, but can you give us the dictionary definition or the Fool\'s guide to understanding what a token is and again, what exactly is a miner?\n\nBush: I\'ll start with miner, because I think that might be a little bit easier. The miners are simply the people who have installed the software, whether it\'s bitcoin or Ethereum or another cryptocurrency, and they\'re the ones who are verifying the transactions. They\'re the ones who are competing to bring a new block of bitcoin, or whatever the currency is, into existence or whatever the specific currency dictates. So they\'re the ones that are really making the network work.\n\nGardner: Aaron, are you a miner?\n\nBush: I am not a miner, actually.\n\nGardner: But you or I could become a miner. Inspired by this podcast, we could download the software and we could start helping. Mining and hoping to get value for our mining.\n\nBush: I think you could. I would say with bitcoin, specifically, it has become increasingly competitive as the number, or as the supply, of bitcoins has grown. The mathematical difficulty in which the computers running the bitcoin software have to calculate, that difficulty has significantly increased. So right now what we\'re seeing, the people who are competing ...\n\nGardner: Highly sophisticated.\n\nBush: Yeah, they\'re highly sophisticated. They\'re running a warehouse of supercomputers to compete, to win the next block of bitcoin.\n\nGardner: So if you and I are going to mine, that\'s probably not the place to go. It\'s at the outset of a new idea. A new form of blockchain. A new cryptocurrency where it might be more doable or interesting to actually mine.\n\nBush: Yeah. And I think what\'s becoming increasingly interesting is that becoming a user is actually a way to get these tokens, and by joining the network, becoming a user, you have just as much of an opportunity to reap the rewards and the gains of whatever the underlying currency is just by using it, because at the end of the day, these systems are worthless if there aren\'t people using them. So the early adopters, in this case, are incentivized to help spur that value creation.\n\nGardner: And now tokens.\n\nBush: What\'s important about tokens inside this blockchain revolution is that scarcity is a key determinant in making this work. In a lot of open protocols that exist out there, that\'s not really a factor, so there isn\'t a way to retain value without scarcity. Tokens introduce the idea of scarcity. It\'s sort of baked into the definition.\n\nIf you have a service that\'s worth a certain amount of money, the tokens are what divide the value. So if I were to create, let\'s just say ...\n\nGardner: Aaron Bush currency.\n\nBush: Absolutely. And I wanted to build an Uber competitor that\'s decentralized. I don\'t know why I would do that, but just say I was.\n\nGardner: Right. There\'s Lyft, there\'s Uber, and then there\'s Aaron Bush Taxi ...\n\nBush: Right.\n\nGardner: ...with Aaron Bush currency.\n\nBush: So I would have Aaron tokens, let\'s say. And what you would do is buy Aaron tokens and then spend them to use in the network. To pay for a ride, essentially.\n\nGardner: Understood.\n\nBush: And as the value of the service increases -- and as more people realize, ""Oh, if I can join this network and get paid in Aaron tokens, that sounds great, so I\'ll join"" -- then all of a sudden you\'ll see that these tokens are now worth this amount versus what they were before.\n\nGardner: Because more people are using them. They\'re getting away from Uber these days. Getting away from Lyft. And Aaron Bush Taxi, solely driven by one guy, is somehow managing to compete, thanks in part to your own unique tokens that as more people use your business, whatever your business is, they become more real, and scarce, and valuable.\n\nBush: Absolutely. So there\'s always going to be a limited supply, or generally there will be a limited supply of these tokens, and as the value of the service increases, more people pour on to the network. The early adopters who have those tokens -- just say you\'re paying $10 in tokens, so one token was worth $10 to pay for a ride. Maybe that\'s now worth $100. Now you can pay for 10 rides.\n\nThat\'s sort of what we\'re seeing. Tokens are really just the vehicle that measures the scarcity that changes over time as the value of the entire system changes.\n\nGardner: Nice job, Aaron. I realize these are complex topics. It can go really deep and shoot off in different directions, so it\'s hard to nail it all down. Really, the technology is evolving and changing as we speak, and new things are popping up, so thank you. You did a good job breaking those down.\n\nYou were talking about why this is such a big deal. You were giving three reasons. Just to summarize, No. 1 is a new way to organize humanity. Human productivity. Ourselves. And second, you said we\'re transforming information into value, and we talked some about mining and tokens. What is a third big deal to what\'s happening with blockchain?\n\nBush: I would say that this is game changing for open-source projects. Venture capitalist Chris Dixon put this very well. He said that this breakthrough combines the societal benefits of open protocols with the financial and architectural benefits of proprietary networks.\n\nIf we think about it, open protocols built the internet. This is things like HTTP and HTTPS. That provides tremendous value for everyone who uses the internet, but it doesn\'t actually capture any value itself. Instead we see companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon build on top of that protocol layer of the internet, and they are the ones who capture all the value.\n\nWhat is changing here is that, through allowing value to live on the internet and to create monetary scarcity for some underlying utility, we\'re now seeing these protocols, now being called fat protocols, be able to capture value themselves. They are the ones that are creating this tremendous value as people start using them more and more, and not necessarily, although sometimes, what is built on top of it.\n\nBitcoin is a protocol, for example. Ethereum is another protocol. Those are the two big ...\n\nGardner: Those are the best-known cryptocurrencies.', 'Canadian online lender Mogo Finance Technology Inc. rose the most in eight months after moving a step closer to giving customers the ability to hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in digital wallets.\n\nMogo shares rose as much as 35 percent, the most since the company’s initial public offering in June 2015, and closed at C$5.15, up 31 percent. The move gives the company a market value of C$94.4 million ($73.6 million).\n\nThe Vancouver-based firm said Monday it added dedicated blockchain capabilities to accelerate plans to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into its digital account. Mogo also said it hired Wayne Chen as senior product manager to lead development of the blockchain initiatives.\n\n“Mogo should be able to offer consumers the ability to own and use cryptocurrencies in a simple, transparent and trusted way,” Nikhil Thadani, an analyst at Mackie Research Capital Corp. said in a research note. He increased his target price to C$9 from C$7, saying the “crypto rollout should offer more upside as details emerge.”\n\nWatch Next: Five Reasons \'Bitcoin Jesus\' Loves the Digital Currency\n\nMogo already offers Canadians a digital account that gives access to personal loans, prepaid Visa cards and mortgages through mobile apps or computer.

10/31/2017,"['Bitcoin is spiking to a record after CME Group Inc. said it’s planning to launch bitcoin futures as the move could open the floodgates of investors who have been standing on the sidelines as bitcoin soared over 500 percent this year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency jumped as much as 5.2 percent to $6,416.39 after the CME said it will start offering trading the derivatives in the fourth quarter. Futures will be settled in cash based on a bitcoin index that CME started calculating in November.\n\nThe move comes after the Chicago Board Options Exchange said in August it’s exploring bitcoin derivatives opportunities, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in July registered cryptocurrency trading platform LedgerX as the first federally regulated cryptocurrency derivatives exchange and clearinghouse.\n\nWith bitcoin futures becoming mainstream, the next logical step seems to be a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, as the Securities and Exchange Commission had cited the lack of derivatives as one of the reasons for rejecting approval of the funds. ETFs and derivatives are likely to make bitcoin trading a lot more palatable for hedge funds and mutual funds, as the instruments will allow them to hedge for the digital asset’s volatility and avoid some of the hassles of investing in bitcoin directly.', 'At the recent Delivering Alpha conference, hosted by Institutional Investor and CNBC, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon tore into Bitcoin. “It’s worse than tulip bulbs,” he said. “It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.” He added that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general “are not a real thing.”\n\nDimon’s rant, which was one of many banking titan rants against Bitcoin in recent weeks, was not so much a disavowal of Bitcoin as a strident public defense of the existing investment industrial complex. Frankly, he couldn’t care less about the price of Bitcoin; what he does care about is the continued hegemony of intermediaries.\n\nThe raison d’être of asset managers, custodians, banks, transition managers, consultants, and other services providers is to create “value” by inserting themselves into every function or service an asset owner needs.\n\nThey must maintain this model to ensure survival. Disruptive innovations built on the idea of disintermediation and decentralization are viewed as an existential threat that must be confronted.\n\nBitcoin is clearly one such innovation. While the value of Dimon’s “real” currencies comes from a trusted central authority, Bitcoin’s value comes from trust in its decentralized, peer-to-peer structure.\n\nIntentionally or not, the proclamations of Dimon and others of a Bitcoin bubble hide what the banks and other intermediaries are doing to protect their turf.\n\nIn their eyes, the way to neutralize this and similar threats is to appropriate it in a way that dilutes it into a palatable, intermediated, nonthreatening form. The obvious example of this defense by misappropriation is Deloitte’s efforts to create “state-sponsored cryptocurrencies,” a notion completely anathema to the fundamental nature of cryptocurrencies but consistent with an intermediary-based model.\n\nBlockchain, the technology at the heart of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, is another real threat to the intermediation model. Harvard professors Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani describe the blockchain as “an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. . . . With blockchain, we can imagine a world in which contracts are embedded in digital code and stored in transparent, shared databases, where they are protected from deletion, tampering, and revision. In this world every agreement, every process, every task, and every payment would have a digital record and signature that could be identified, validated, stored, and shared. Intermediaries like lawyers, brokers, and bankers might no longer be necessary.”\n\nTraditional institutions have responded to this risk by building proprietary, closed blockchains. JPMorgan is building its own blockchain, Quorum, which it describes as “an enterprise-focused version of Ethereum.” The misappropriation is obvious when we consider that Ethereum is itself “a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts . . . without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference.” As AngelList founder and CEO Naval Ravikant tweeted: “It’s nonsensical to have a blockchain controlled by a sovereign, a corporation, an elite, or a mob.” But mission accomplished: The blockchain’s threat to centralized, exclusionary systems has been nullified; its functionality restricted.\n\nDefenders of the orthodoxy use other means to impede the adoption of disruptive disintermediating ideas. For example, initial coin offerings (ICOs) are being successfully used by blockchain and technology startups to raise money directly from users. According to Goldman Sachs, ICOs raised more than $1.2 billion in funding for internet-based companies in the first half of 2017.\n\nWhile Richard Kastelein, publisher of Blockchain News, describes ICOs as “a win-win” for entrepreneurs and investors, it’s important to note that there is a loser in this deal: Venture capitalists, the traditional middlemen of startup funding, are losing their influence and revenues. Goldman reports that in June the amount raised via ICOs for internet companies exceeded the amount raised by early-stage VCs.\n\nBecause ICOs are too difficult for intermediaries to directly appropriate, VCs instead must count on other defenders of the status quo — regulators — to disarm the threat. Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission said that securities trading laws might apply to ICOs; China also announced an immediate ban on ICO funding. This is reminiscent of the regulatory saber rattling when Uber challenged the need for a taxi medallion.\n\nOther evidence of the defusing of the disintermediating innovations via misappropriation can be seen in the misapplication of advanced artificial intelligence techniques to investing. When Paul Tudor Jones says, “No man is better than a machine and no machine is better than a man with a machine,” he is claiming that the future of investing is augmented AI, deep learning be damned.\n\nIt’s critical that investors, especially fiduciaries, be aware of the vested interests embedded in the intermediary model and, more importantly, how this model has manipulated the relationships and outcomes in the investment industry.\n\nWhen it comes to disruptive innovations, asset owners should expect asset managers and other intermediaries to attack them with hypocritical remarks while at the same time working to misappropriate them to ensure the perpetuation of the status quo.\n\nAfter all, while Dimon was bashing Bitcoin, his San Francisco office was hosting a group of Bitcoin and blockchain investors.', ""The price of bitcoin has hit an all-time high, crossing $6,400 for the first time.\n\nAccording to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the price reached an average of $6,415.28 across global exchanges at roughly 14:00 UTC today.

He disagreed with the process by which the decision to hard fork was made: “There is no discussion. As Mike said, this New York agreement [to do the SegWit2x hard fork] was pretty much a declaration. It said this change is happening. … This is fundamentally incompatible with the process that is Bitcoin core.”\n\nCourtesy of Mike Belshe and Matt Corallo\n\nPlus, some exchanges are offering so-called chain split tokens, which function as futures markets, and those indicate the vast majority of community support is against the hard fork as well. Across multiple exchanges, the 2x tokens are trading at around 15% of the current value of a Bitcoin, while the 1x tokens are trading at around 85%.\n\nDespite the seeming lack of community support, Belshe would not name any particular threshold at which his side would call off the hard fork. In fact, because the change his faction is working on contains two technical changes — one called SegWit, and the other an increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 2MB — and because the first part of the plan already occurred in August, he said, “it’s already activated.”\n\nHe also noted that the volume on the chain split tokens is a very thin $2 million a day and so dismissed the idea that they were representative of the community. Corallo rebutted that any hesitation people feel about putting their Bitcoins on exchanges should afflict both sides equally, and so the difference may still indicate how little support the 2x side has.\n\nOne place where the 2x chain is likely to have a lot of support, however, is from the miners who run the network. Their support has been north of 75% since last July. Assuming that the 2x chain begins with a majority of the current hash power, the 1x chain will be vulnerable to attack.\n\nHowever, Corallo shrugged off the idea that a miner would find it worth it to attack the minority chain. In the hypothetical scenario that the 1x chain begins with 15% of current hash power, he said, “You have to take 15% of the hash power globally that you have and attack this chain instead of mining something useful, and if your attack works, all this money you spent on mining these blocks is useless, and that is a ton of money to throw down the drain to make your voice heard.”\n\nHe also noted that a previous fork of Bitcoin created in August called Bitcoin Cash had not yet been attacked.\n\nTune in to the episode (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio, web) to hear how the potential hard fork has opened up a number of questions around what the true definition is of Bitcoin — whether the definition of the white paper is best or whether price determines what is the true Bitcoin — whether or not Bitcoin Cash is going to be the ultimate winner, and whether or not censorship on the Bitcoin subreddits has influenced people’s views on the matter.\n\nPlus, they give their best post-hard fork predictions and discuss whether or not having more women involved in the process would have prevented this incredibly expensive game of chicken.', ""The race to regulate the cryptocurrency and the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) market has hit full stride. It’s more of a marathon than a sprint, with hurdles. In recent months over 30 global regulators announced their various approaches to token sales and ICOs. This emerging space is full of promise and potential pitfalls. What happens next?\n\nWhat is evident in this race is Bitcoin, digital currencies and ICO token sales have created very vocal supporters and detractors from the world of high finance and government.\n\nThere is Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund telling us that we are about to see massive disruption in FinTech and that it is time to get serious about digital currency, while Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan says Bitcoin is a fraud that will eventually blow up.\n\nThere is Japan with 11 regulated Bitcoin exchanges controlling over 60% of the global Bitcoin market, while China has banned the sale of crypto currencies and tokens outright.\n\nAnd there are others in the race, to name a few: Abu Dhabi has offered guidance on regulating cryptocurrencies and ICOs on an individual case basis; the US SEC has declared that ICO tokens are subject to federal security laws - The CFTC has announced that crypto assets may also be commodities; and, Switzerland and Singapore are leading the ICO market and are popular destinations for startups seeking to raise funds using tokens.\n\nThe UK's FCA has just published a report highlighting the difficulty that blockchain businesses have in getting basic banking services. Many are refused outright making it difficult for crypto asset businesses to get started. It also contradicts the UK government's pro innovation stance.\n\nSimon Taylor, a crypto asset and blockchain specialist at UK based 11FS thinks the trend for ICO token sales is going to continue. “The growth in crypto assets in recent years has been massive and it’s not going to stop. ICO token sales have become an attractive alternative source of funding for startups”, says Taylor."", 'How can a single Bitcoin, which was trading at only a few hundred dollars two years ago, now be trading at over $6,400? Is there a big Bitcoin bubble? Are skeptics from Russian President Vladimir Putin to JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon correct that Bitcoin is a fraud and or pyramid scheme?\n\nThose are important queries, but the biggest boost to Bitcoin actually derives from something not discussed, and a rather unlikely source: its competition -- other digital currencies and their related Initial Coin Offering (ICOs).\n\nHundreds of digital currencies have raised funds through ICOs. Like their regulated IPO (Initial Public Offering) cousins, ICOs seek to raise money to build a digital token and the ecosystem surrounding it.\n\nDigital lake of liquidity\n\nThrough the first three quarters of this year alone, in excess of $1.2 billion has been raised for over 100 ICOs. When the funds are actually invested in the ICOs, the currency used is -- by and large -- Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin serves as the predominant liquid asset behind all these ICOs. And of all the cryptocurrencies out there, Bitcoin is the most widely traded and can easily be converted into cash. As a result, the price of Bitcoin has continued to grow exponentially. A similar, but less pronounced phenomena, has occurred with Ether, the second most traded digital currency after Bitcoin. (Ether itself, raised $18 million for their ICO in 2014, much of it in Bitcoin.)\n\nNot only are most ICOs funded using Bitcoin, they continue to use Bitcoin and the ""Digital Lake of Liquidity"" in their transactions once actual digital currencies or coins are up and running. Don’t get me wrong, the rubber has not hit the road for many of these ICOs, and the majority of actual currencies have not entered circulation. Unfortunately for investors, they may never do so and there are scant regulations to protect investors from such a circumstance. That said, for those ICOs that do have an actual digital currency in circulation (and there are over 100 of them) they also use the ""Digital Lake of Liquidity"" to accept funds and to perform payout services. When they do so, they primarily use Bitcoin.\n\nThese other currencies trade their denominations with Bitcoin not only because Bitcoins are so widely held by so many investors, but because of the volume of trading on digital currency exchanges. Such large volume is part and parcel to the ""Digital Lake of Liquidity,"" which when trading affords traders the best-executed prices (since there is so much competition within the marketplace). There are currently more than 1,100 other currencies. Not all of them participate in trade.\n\nThe bottom line is that as the digital currency universe continues to expand to accommodate new currencies, Bitcoin (and to a lesser extent Ether) prices will likely continue to increase.\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to break down and quantify this liquidity phenomena. In large part, the difficulty is due to the lack of regulation over ICOs and digital currencies in the U.S. and abroad. There is little reporting or transparency to inform investors of what is taking place.\n\nWhile the ""Digital Lake of Liquidity"" phenomena is not something commonly discussed among digital currency enthusiasts, or anyone else, it certainly does not explain the recent volatility of Bitcoin, nor other concerns, such as the following;\n\nA pyramid shape?\n\nThere’s little doubt that if the originators of the digital currency intended Bitcoin to be a fraud, the mechanics of it would work out wonderfully. New investors (including ICO investors) could keep the endeavour afloat as older investors cash out. As long as new money keeps coming in and redemptions aren\'t excessive, it could operate like a traditional pyramid ponzi scam.\n\nAt the same time, there is certainly no evidence that when Bitcoin was established there was any intent to be involved in a fraud. Heck, we don\'t even know the inventor(s)!\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin and other digital currencies are increasingly being used in commerce. If an individual purchases or invests in such a currency and then actually buys something -- a hotel room or a car, for example -- it is certainly something of value. Nobody is getting ripped off there. That\'s not a fraud. That\'s not a ponzi scheme.\n\nTangible ties\n\nBitcoin isn\'t tied to anything tangible or real we can touch and feel. That fact further decreases price stability. If a digital currency were to be tied to a tangible asset, it would even out price fluctuations, not to mention open up the possibility of backing up investor claims. This innovation in digital currency is something that has been discussed, and tried, but not put into popular practical use.\n\nManipulation\n\nRecent wild price swings for Bitcoin are suspect. Amid negative news, including but not limited to ICO and digital currency bans in China, South Korea and Russia, prices have -- after initially dropping -- soared to record highs. Such should be a clarion call for a deep dive look from financial enforcement officials to determine if prices have been manipulated.\n\nFast Forwarding\n\nBitcoin and the digital currency ecosystem have been fast forwarding at incredible speeds. A week of watching what’s taking place might seems equal to several months in other markets.\n\nI don\'t think any of the developers of these current currencies or the related exchange trading platforms have it quite right. That said, the digital ecosystem isn’t going away. The extent of its continued rapid growth is ultimately tied to greater innovation coupled with the adoption of basic rudimentary regulations for investor protections.\n\nTo date, amid all the incredible innovations, there are no existing digital white knights. At some point, however, some will get it right.', ""The Winklevoss twins could be the world’s richest celebrity Bitcoin holders, with their 1% BTC share now worth over 1 Billion USD.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins, infamous for their legal feud with Mark Zuckerberg over his alleged stealing of their original idea for the Facebook social network, could rank as the world’s richest Bitcoin investors.\n\nAs Bitcoin touches $100 billion in value, don't forget that the Winklevoss twins are officially Bitcoin billionaires (1% BTC supply) — Sid Kalla (@sidkal) October 30, 2017\n\n$1 Billion\n\nIf the Winklevoss twins have kept all of their initial investment since buying what they claimed was to be 1% of the total supply (120,000 BTC) of Bitcoin back in 2013, then their investment could now be worth north of $1 billion USD. During an interview at the end of 2013, they stated that they have not sold any of their Bitcoins and that they keep their wallets in various safes around the world on USB drives.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins announced in a Reddit AMA:\n\nWe first learned about Bitcoin in 2012. Perhaps where you’d least expect — on an island off the coast of Spain in the middle of August. Our first impression was that this was either going to be really big or a complete zero. We were immediately taken in by Bitcoin’s elegance and enormous promise, and as we started to learn more, we became convinced that Bitcoin was the future of money.\n\nThe Gemini Exchange\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss launched their Gemini Bitcoin exchange in 2015;\n\nWe began buying bitcoin, but quickly realized that there was no safe and easy way to buy and sell bitcoin in the US! So, a year and a half ago, we decided to do something about it. We began assembling a team of top engineers to build Gemini.\n\nSince then they have tried to pass a Bitcoin ETF, which has so far met with resistance as a number of other such ETF applications having also been rejected in the US. However, hopes are still high that one will eventually pass. Reasons presented by the SEC board for the application rejection particularly pointed out the fact that Bitcoin has too few regulations. The pair also established their own index which tracks the price of Bitcoin across multiple exchanges as well as contributing funding to Bitcoin and blockchain companies under their company Winklevoss Capital.\n\nOther known Members of the Bitcoin Rich List\n\nOther known people on the Bitcoin richest list would include Tony Gallippi (co-founder of the Bitpay payment processing company), Charlie Shrem (an early Bitcoin adopter possessing a few thousand BTC back when they were worth very little), Tim Draper (venture capitalist), and Barry Silbert (venture capitalist who reportedly bought 48,000 Bitcoins in a U.S Marshal’s auction selling seized coins from the Silk Road online marketplace). Ultimately the largest owner of Bitcoin is Bitcoin’s absent, and mysterious, creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who now controls over a $6 billion portion of the coins with his initial 1 Million BTC.\n\nDo you think the Winklevoss twins are worth as much as is speculated?

However, capital resources that are intended for the development of enterprises have been attracted to morbid speculations in some markets,” Li explained. “Since the second half of 2015, the financial industry has a cycle of strong regulation where the capital should support the economic development.”\n\nLi added:\n\nWe believe that the strict control over digital assets trading is in line with China’s current situation.\n\nCoinciding with Huobi’s cessation of its Chinese exchange is the launch of Huobi.pro, its international trading platform with support for Tether (USDT) with trading enabled for ten cryptocurrencies. The exchange is headquartered in Singapore with a subsidiary in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Huobi China will transform from a cryptocurrency trading platform to a blockchain consulting and research platform.\n\nChina’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, first announced a sweeping ban on all initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading on 4th September. In this post, Li revealed official notices received from the PBoC on 15th September, forcing the exchange to suspend user registrations and RMB deposits on the same day.\n\nHuobi’s shuttering of trading in China comes a month after fellow ‘big three’ exchange BTCC, the world’s oldest bitcoin exchange, shut its doors following the regulator’s squeeze.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It’s been a very good year for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency climbing more than 600% to over $6,000. As result, one of Bitcoin’s largest holders appears to now be worth nearly $6 billion.\n\nIn 2013, Bitcoin watcher and head of cryptocurrency firm rsk.co Sergio Lerner wrote a series of blog posts explaining why he believes an account holding 980,000 individual Bitcoins belongs to Bitcoin’s mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nLerner analyzed the path of the first Bitcoins ever created, or “mined,” and traced them to a single mining source. Lerner then correlated this source to about 19,600 other Bitcoin “blocks,” which were actually just sets of cryptographic puzzles that, when solved, were worth 50 Bitcoins in 2010.\n\nThis mining entity stopped at 19,600, and never moved any of the Bitcoins it had earned. Lerner believed anyone who wasn’t Satoshi would have almost certainly tried to sell at least some of the Bitcoins, to take profits on what turned out to be as successful, if speculative, investment. The fact that none of the Bitcoins have been touched suggests the miner has “shown complete trust in Bitcoin” and is almost certainly therefore Satoshi,” according to Lerner.\n\nNolan Bauerle, researcher at bitcoin news and research group CoinDesk, says that Lerner’s analysis is generally accepted as accurate within the Bitcoin community.\n\n“The leading analysis remains what Sergio Demian Lerner published 3-4 years ago,” Bauerle says. “There has not been much done besides this, but that analysis managed to turn into something people quote as the truth.”\n\nIn an email, Lerner told MONEY that since he published his original posts,”Nothing has changed about the supposed Satoshi holdings” and that “no additional coin has been spent and no research has revealed anything else about them.”\n\nHence, the alleged Satoshi stash still contains 980,000 Bitcoins — which at current prices are worth about more than $5.8 billion.\n\nQuartz, which earlier reported Nakamoto’s wealth, says it would make him the 247th richest person in the world.\n\nSo, who is Satoshi Nakamoto? There have been multiple claims to his identity. In 2014, Newsweek fingered a California man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who vigorously denied the report.\n\nSPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT\n\nThen in 2016, an Australian named Craig Wright claimed he had invented the cryptocurrency. But other observers pointed out inconsistencies in the evidence Wright used and other elements known about “Satoshi’s” backstory, leading many to conclude it wasn’t him.\n\nSo, there is still no agreement on who the real Satoshi is — or, for that matter, whether he (or she) is the holder of the account Lerner analyzed.\n\nBut someone is sitting on nearly $6 billion in Bitcoin.', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New Jersey pastor was sentenced to five years in prison for scheming to help an illegal bitcoin exchange escape scrutiny from banks and regulators.\n\nTrevon Gross, 47, was sentenced on Monday by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan, who also ordered him to pay a $12,000 fine, U.S. prosecutors said.\n\nA lawyer for Gross could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe bitcoin exchange involved in the case, Coin.mx, was linked to an investigation of a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co, revealed in 2014, that exposed more than 83 million accounts.\n\nGross was convicted by a jury in March along with Yuri Lebedev, a Florida software engineer.\n\nProsecutors charged that Gross took bribes from Lebedev and the operator of Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, including $150,000 in donations to his church, HOPE Cathedral in Jackson, New Jersey. In exchange, they said, Gross helped Murgio take over a small credit union associated with the church.\n\nMurgio used the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing payments involving the virtual currency, prosecutors said.\n\nLebedev, who was accused of working for Coin.mx through a front called Collectables Club, was sentenced to 16 months earlier this month. Murgio pleaded guilty in January and in June was sentenced to 5-1/2 years in prison in June.\n\nThe trial followed an investigation rooted in the JPMorgan data breach, which lead to charges against nine people.\n\nGross, Lebedev and Murgio were not accused of hacking but prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli, Gary Shalon, who was behind the JPMorgan hack.\n\nProsecutors have said Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of information from more than 100 million people.\n\nProsecutors said they carried out the hacks to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails.\n\nShalon, Aaron and Orenstein pleaded not guilty to criminal charges.']"
