02/01/2017,"[""Higher Bitcoin trading volumes continue to go the way of the US even as the price of the digital currency picks up to over $966 at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin yuan trading dropped\n\nAccording to data from Bitcoinity, Bitcoin tradings in US dollar is still at almost 50 percent of the global market today while those conducted using the Chinese yuan have dropped to as low as 20 percent.\n\nFiatleak, which shows world currencies flow into Bitcoin in real time, also confirms that more of the digital currency has been going in the direction of the US - at about four-fold higher than what is going to China.\n\nThe close to five percent rise in price in just half a day, on Tuesday, Jan. 31, came in time to coincide with the signing of an executive order on cyber security by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe order is expected to commission several different reviews of the government's offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. It is also expected to initiate an audit of several federal agencies' cyber capabilities, seek input on how to improve protections for critical infrastructure and review government efforts to attract and train a technically sophisticated workforce.\n\nGemini factor\n\nThe rise in price also coincides with US-based exchange Gemini introducing a new first for digital asset exchanges - zero-confirmation pre-credited Bitcoin deposits.\n\nThe new measure is to help ease Bitcoin deposit delays by enabling any transaction that passes the exchange’s set out criteria to be pre-credited with the amount being deposited and made available for trading immediately.\n\nThe exchange notes in a blog post: “That means that you’ll be able to sell BTC for USD or ETH faster and more efficiently. You can also trade in our daily two-sided auction without a delay due to Bitcoin network congestion. Then, once your deposit eventually reaches its required three confirmations, you’ll be able to withdraw the amount of your deposit or any USD or ETH purchased with your deposit.”\n\nLunar Year factor\n\nBitcoin price has been unfazed for some time despite the key issues on the market which would have previously changed the market trend.\n\nWith the ongoing scaling issue, the drop in Bitcoin trading on Chinese exchanges due to PBoC monitoring which eventually led to the introduction of trading fees then normalized trading volumes across various platforms and the ongoing Chinese Lunar Year celebration, the effect of these issues are hardly felt on the price.\n\nHowever, despite the Chinese dominance of the trading sector being challenged, the PBoC’s resolve to continue its series of onsite inspections and warning to investors to pay attention to the risks of exchanges and the inability to accurately conclude trading volume changes in the exchange rates of the yuan and dollar to Bitcoin due to the Lunar New Year celebration, the Chinese factor could still be considered relevant to an extent. In the next one or two weeks, a clearer picture may emerge as the Chinese seem to put everything on pause at the moment."", ""Nigeria and Africa generally are showing a huge sign of optimism for Bitcoin trading in the coming years, says the founder of BitcoinNow, a Bitcoin selling platform that is available in five African countries.\n\nDavidson Atere-Roberts notes that Bitcoin provides a deregulated, borderless and a decentralized system of alternative finance to Nigerians and Africans but the increase in adoption will only come when they realize that the digital currency can be exchanged for goods and services.\n\nHe says:\n\n“We believe that in the coming years Bitcoin would be adopted as an alternative to the basic investments, it will be seen as a safe-haven virtual asset. We expect within the next few years that high net worth individuals and the middle class will be investing in Bitcoins to protect and increase their capital as opposed to stocks, bonds, gold etc. We assume that more Africans will go into Bitcoin trading and there will be much more peer-to-peer transactions.”\n\nM-Pesa success an example\n\n“We are very enthusiastic about the Nigerian market as an influential and leading market in Africa although Senegal has taken the lead globally by introducing its own digital currency that will be a legal tender alongside its currency. We are also very optimistic about the East and Southern Africa regions. It will take a while but we believe Bitcoin will follow the M-Pesa line in revolutionizing digital transactions,” he adds.\n\nM-Pesa is the world's most successful money transfer service that enables millions of people who have access to a mobile phone but do not have or have only limited access to a bank account, to send and receive money, top-up airtime and make bill payments. As at last year, it announced it has 25 mln active global users.\n\nChallenges\n\nAtere-Roberts’ BitcoinNow is trying to solve the problem of accessibility as there is still a controlled supply of Bitcoin in Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Gambia and Sierra Leone.\n\nThe idea is to bridge the gap between these developing markets and Bitcoin access by providing a seamless platform in as many African markets as its resources can establish.\n\nHe believes Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against political and economic uncertainty, capital and foreign exchange controls, demonetization and devaluation and hyperinflation even though Bitcoin-related businesses in Nigeria and Africa are still faced with major challenges."", ""80% of all Bitcoins Will Have Been Mined In a year From now\n\n80% of all Bitcoins Will Have Been Mined In a year From now\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

That policy document included the stipulation that ""all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited"", prompting questions about both the definition of ""virtual currency"" the central bank was relying on as well as the exact scope and nature of the ostensible prohibition.\n\nNew comments suggest that, at least for now, the central bank isn’t taking any action on bitcoin or other digital currencies.\n\nIn a statement released to regional news service Gulf News, central bank governor Mubarak Al Mansouri said:\n\n""These regulations do not cover \'virtual currency\' which is defined as any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, unit account, or a form of stored value. In this context, these regulations do not apply to bitcoin or other crypto - currencies, currency exchanges, or underlying technology such as blockchain.""\n\nThat said, the central bank indicated that the topic of digital currencies remains an open question – and one that could be subject to new rules in the future.\n\n""This area is currently under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate,"" Al Mansouri remarked.\n\nAs can be expected, those working in the region’s nascent digital currency ecosystem quickly praised the move.\n\n""We\'re optimistic about the direction the Central Bank have been recently taking to support innovation in fintech in UAE,"" Ola Doudin, CEO of bitcoin exchange service BitOasis, told CoinDesk.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The project gained hash power support from several new Bitcoin mining pools, including ViaBTC, GBMiners and BTC.TOP, while node adoption appears to be on the rise as well.\n\n\n\nThe central idea behind Bitcoin Unlimited — specified in “Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal 001” (BUIP001) — is to hand control of Bitcoin’s block size limit to users and miners. Or perhaps more accurately: to make this control more explicit and easier to handle.\n\nBut as explained in “How Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains,” BUIP001 does not include a technical consensus mechanism as reliable as in Bitcoin’s current consensus rules.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin Unlimited relies on a philosophy often referred to as “Emergent Consensus.”\n\n(Note: If you are not sure how Bitcoin Unlimited works, or what the technical weaknesses of BUIP001 are, make sure to first read “A Closer Look at Bitcoin Unlimited’s Configurable Block Size Proposal” and “How Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains.”)\n\n“Emergent Consensus”\n\nBUIP001 does not ensure machine consensus; users can configure their nodes to split into different blockchains, either intentionally or unintentionally. Instead, Bitcoin Unlimited relies on “Emergent Consensus.” This is a conviction that participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have a strong enough economic incentive to converge on a single blockchain, such that they will converge on a single blockchain. If their software does not automatically realize this, users are expected to configure their settings to make it happen. After all, it benefits everyone to be on the same blockchain and to be able to transact with one another.\n\nHow this Emergent Consensus should form is not really documented, however. While some have made analogies — with flocks of birds, for example — it’s not clear how these apply to Bitcoin, exactly.\n\nThat said, it is possible to draw out a scenario that many Bitcoin Unlimited proponents roughly envisage. As a first step, users should signal what size of blocks they will accept with the Excessive Block Size (EB) setting. Then, miners — incentivized to satisfy market demand — should increase (or decrease) the block size limit accordingly. Finally, if these new blocks exceed some users’ EB, these users are expected to follow regardless, either because their Excessive Acceptance Depth (AD) setting is triggered, or maybe because they’ll reconfigure their nodes manually.\n\nAs explained in “How Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains,” this scenario does present some problems. For one, if a user’s EB signaling is trivially spoofed by an adversary, miners can be tricked into thinking a block size limit increase has more support than it does — or perhaps malicious miners can themselves trick users.\n\nAnd for the (remaining) users, this scenario presents an odd choice: Either they set their AD settings low to remain in consensus, but essentially give up much of their autonomy to miners; or they set their AD settings high to protect their autonomy, but risk splitting the network.\n\nOff-Chain Coordination\n\nTo counter some of the problems described, Emergent Consensus can also be established through debate on forums, blog posts, chat rooms and other media. Realistically, it may even require this kind of off-chain coordination, to some extent.\n\nFor example, while mining pool ViaBTC wants to hard fork to a two-megabyte block size limit, that is not what the pool is currently signaling with its EB settings. If it did, that could be abused to split the network. Instead, ViaBTC signals support for one megabyte and in their “miner guide” proposes to hard fork to two megabytes once at least 75 percent of hash power acknowledges support.\n\nHowever, this kind of off-chain coordination is not unique. Groups of people have coordinated and achieved consensus through discourse for a long time. But such systems often either have a leader or tend to break down and split into factions once the number of participants reaches a certain size. Other popular open-source projects, for example, sometimes consist of hundreds of incompatible forks.\n\nAnd this is probably even more true under adversarial conditions. If the people in these groups don’t really know or trust one another, they have no way of knowing whether the other people are telling the truth or lying. Even a single adversary can pretend to be many users and communicate many false preferences. This makes coordination and reaching consensus a very difficult problem to solve.\n\nIn fact, this is the Byzantine Generals’ Problem. That is exactly the problem Satoshi Nakamoto attempted to address.\n\nWith a track record of about eight years, Bitcoin’s main technological achievement is a math-based protocol that realizes strong, fast, scalable and automated machine consensus for large groups of people who do not necessarily know or trust one another. Bitcoin is reasonably “Byzantine Fault tolerant.”\n\nBitcoin Unlimited proponents believe that Bitcoin’s economic incentives — the incentive for users to all remain part of the same Bitcoin blockchain — is in itself sufficiently Byzantine Fault tolerant. But that is, so far, largely unproven. No altcoin relies on similar assumptions, nor is there a publicly available testnet where the BUIP001 configurations are actively used.\n\nWhat Bitcoin Unlimited Changes\n\nThat said, part of the same Bitcoin Unlimited philosophy is that Bitcoin relies on a sort of Emergent Consensus anyway.\n\nRather than merely relying on math, code or protocol, many really see Bitcoin as a consensus between people first and foremost. People choose to partake in the system, people give it value, and sometimes — like during the August 2010 and March 2013 blockchain forks — people have to coordinate “off-chain” to determine which chain is valid.\n\nAs such, BUIP001 doesn’t fundamentally change anything. Users choose to run Bitcoin Unlimited. Node software can already be (re-)compiled. And a social consensus may have to form “off-chain” either way.\n\nBut by making this control more explicit and easier to handle, and assuming users actually use these options, Bitcoin Unlimited does rely on the human consensus aspect to a much larger extent. Rather than opting into a protocol once and relying on machine consensus from then on, users need to take on a much more proactive role. As one Bitcoin Unlimited proponent noted, shortly after miners had to reconfigure their nodes in response to a bug that briefly forked the network earlier this week: “This IS part of how Bitcoin works. It’s not meant for people sleeping at the wheel.”\n\nIt is true that BUIP001 doesn’t introduce anything that wasn’t possible before. As an open-source project, users and miners could always recompile their Bitcoin software to do anything that Bitcoin Unlimited allows. But of course, that in itself is not an argument in favor of BUIP001. Just because users could, that does not mean they should.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin has had several forks that lasted for several blocks, caused by technical failures. The August 2010 blockchain fork was needed to revert the creation of billions of bitcoins out of thin air, which required orphaning an hour-long chain. The only reason that the event wasn’t catastrophic is that bitcoin was hardly used as money back then. During the March 2013 blockchain fork, however, the network was unreliable for real users, and at least one person was double-spent, while several miners wasted valuable resources mining an orphaned chain. The same is true for the July 2015 blockchain fork, where miners were urged to switch to fully validating mining pools, and many have learned from that mistake.\n\nIndeed, developers, miners and the rest of the Bitcoin community have generally tried to avoid these types of crisis events as much as they possibly can.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin Unlimited seems to embrace them as an upgrade mechanism.\n\n“Jonny1000” contributed to this article.\n\nAuthor\'s note: An earlier version of this article suggested there is no testnet for BUIP001 at all. Since publication, it was pointed out there actually is such a testnet, dubbed ""nolnet"". This testnet is not really publicly available, however, and seems to be used only by a small group of developers close to the Bitcoin Unlimited project. And of course, by definition a testnet does not test economic incentives either way, so these remain unproven.\n\n', 'Central Bank Governor said they do not outlaw virtual currencies such as BitCoin.\n\nWednesday, Feb 01, 2017\n\nDubai: The Central Bank of the UAE has clarified regulations released on January 1, 2017, stating they do not outlaw virtual currencies such as BitCoin.\n\nIn a statement to Gulf News clarifying the regulation, Mubarak Rashid Khamis Al Mansouri, Governor of the Central Bank, said “these regulations do not cover ‘virtual currency’, which is defined as any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a form of stored value. In this context, these regulations do not apply to bitcoin or other crypto — currencies, currency exchanges, or underlying technology such as Blockchain.” Al Mansouri added in his statement that virtual currencies are “currently under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate.”\n\nThe original regulation contained the phrase “all virtual currencies [and transactions thereof] are prohibited,” which lawyers and investors initially took to mean a blanket ban on all such currencies.\n\nFor Ola Doudin, CEO and co-founder of BitOasis, the UAE’s first digital currency exchange, the clarification was welcome news, after worrying about the implications the prohibition might have had on her business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’re very glad to hear the Governor’s statement on virtual currencies, bitcoin and blockchain in light of the recent PSP regulations, and we’re optimistic about the direction the Central Bank is taking to support innovation in fintech. We are committed to working side by side with regulators to make sure we are compliant and to help promote innovation,” Doudin said in a statement to Gulf News.\n\nWhilst commenting that the clarification was positive, Sally Sfeir-Tait, a lawyer for Clyde & Co and regulatory expert, warned that “from a legal perspective, until the regulations are amended, a clarification does not have the same legal value. I hope it does mean that, until then, the Central Bank will not take any action in respect to existing (and proposed) businesses who deal in virtual currencies.”\n\n“At least for now, this means that those who were concerned by the apparent ban on virtual currencies like bitcoin (and the potential impact of this on fintech and blockchain initiatives) can breathe a collective sigh of relief,” said Paul Allen, head of intellectual property and technology at DLA Piper, Middle East.\n\nBy Ed Clowes Staff Reporter\n\nGulf News 2017.

In this time of the year, capital outflow significantly increases as Chinese and Korean people send red envelopes to relatives and friends as a cultural ceremony. Red envelopes contain cash and are usually given from the old to the young member of a family.\n\nOn every fifth day of the first month of the Chinese lunar calendar, the Chinese people also celebrates the God of Wealth, a nationwide celebration wherein families prepare to pay tribute to the God of Wealth by providing animals, cakes and fruits and launching fireworks to welcome the God of Wealth.\n\nBitcoin as a safe haven asset, hedge against system\n\nOver the past few weeks, Bitcoin exchange executives and analysts including Bobby Lee, CEO of the world’s longest running Bitcoin exchange BTCC, have emphasized Bitcoin’s presence in leading economies as a safe haven asset.\n\nLee stated:\n\n""Gold is sort of the hedge against the system, the status quo. Our society is ingrained with the current monetary system of fiat money, where governments issue it, they can put out as much of it as they want. Today’s money system, in a very rude way, it’s no different to airline miles or hotel reward points.""\n\nIn late 2016, Bitcoin price began to increase rapidly as investors and traders began to perceive Bitcoin as an efficient long-term investment and stable safe haven asset for the first time since its introduction in 2009.\n\nThis change in viewpoint towards Bitcoin led Bitcoin price to climb all-time highs and as it skyrocketed and approached the $1,000 mark, mainstream media coverage started to hype up the digital currency.\n\nA cycle in rising Bitcoin value\n\nThere is an evident cycle in the rising Bitcoin value. An event triggers Bitcoin price to climb and mainstream media hype sends Bitcoin to all-time highs.\n\nIn this case, Bitcoin price on the Chinese and Korean markets began to increase due to increasing capital flow and restriction of cash and financial services to supplement the Chinese yuan or the Korean won leaving the country.\n\nIt will be likely that the Bitcoin price will continue climbing if media attention continues to accelerate, as Lee explains:', 'The Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley presented the Union Budget to the parliament, India’s most important financial event expected with hopes and worries.\n\nThe budget was supposed to help an ailing economy hit hard by the demonetization of 86 percent of the currency in circulation on Nov. 8, 2016.\n\nThe government proposes to cut taxes for the people in the lowest income tax slab to five percent from the current 10 percent.\n\nThe government is also planning a massive penalty on cash use come April 2017.\n\nAn exercise in populism\n\nIndian media outlets had been predicting a populist budget after the Indian president Pranab Mukherjee made a speech to open the budget session of the Parliament. The president had mentioned in his speech that at the core of his government’s policies are the welfare of the poor, the low castes, suffering populace, exploited, the left behind, farmers, workers and the youth.\n\nThe expectations of the media and the people turned out to be correct as Jaitley cut taxes on the people in the lowest of India’s three income tax slabs.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper reported,\n\n“In a major step, Jaitley announced the reduction of the existing rate of taxation for individuals with income ranging between Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh to five percent instead of 10 percent. There will be a surcharge of 10 percent for those whose annual income is Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore. Additionally, the 15 percent surcharge on Rs 1 crore or more remains unchanged. This is to make up for Rs 15,000 crore loss due to the cut in the personal income tax rate.”\n\nRs. 1 Lakh equals One hundred Thousand, while 1 crore equals 10 mln.\n\nFiscal numbers unrealistic\n\nAccording to Reuters, India’s fiscal deficit in the first nine months to December 2016 was Rs. 5.01 tln or $ 73.87 bln.\n\nIt has reached nearly 94 percent of the budgeted target for the financial year ending March 2017. While the finance minister vowed to keep the deficit at 3.2 percent of GDP, the numbers seemed unrealistic. Varun Khandelwal, Managing Director, Bullero Capital, Delhi told Firstpost,\n\n""The fiscal deficit bit does not seem very credible. Jaitley is leaving room to exceed it at a later time. I think people will question the fiscal math over the next few days.""\n\nThe telecom spectrum auction conducted by the Indian government in October 2016 was a damp squib and managed to raise only 657.89 bln rupees whereas the government had hoped to raise at least 56.6 tln rupees.\n\nAdd to the fiscal constraints, the implementation of the pay commission and the “one rank, one pension” scheme for Indian army personnel. These challenges would need to be met along with India’s need for a massive push in infrastructure and rural development.\n\nPenalty for the use of cash\n\nThe Indian finance minister may have cut taxes for the lowest in the tax slabs and this would bring some relief to India’s small but vocal middle classes but the challenge remains widening the country’s tax base, which is pathetic compared with the size of the country’s population.\n\nIt is estimated that only 1 percent of Indians pay any income tax. The reduction of personal income tax may prompt more individuals to start paying taxes and can also put more disposable income in the hands of the ones that already do.\n\nHowever broadening the tax base is only possible if the government is efficient at tax collection. In this respect, the finance minister has introduced a 100 percent penalty on cash payments over Rs. 300,000, around $4,500, by any individual or business starting April 1, 2017. This is being done to deter cash transactions.\n\nThe finance minister’s assault on cash continues and India is determined to reign in cash transactions which account for 68 percent of all transactions in the country according to a CLSA report quoted by Business Standard.\n\nBitcoin price soars\n\nIf India is serious about going cashless, then Blockchain technology will have a serious role to play.\n\nIndia can use e-wallets and digital payment systems based on the Blockchain.\n\nThe Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDBRT), which is the research body of the Indian Central Bank the RBI have already published a white paper called Applications of Blockchain Technology to Banking and Financial Sector in India which has explored the idea of a central bank based digital currency.\n\nWhile the government has been pushing for a cashless India, the effects have led to considerable anxiety in a class of Indians and Bitcoin price in India has soared.\n\nIndian exchanges have been enjoying a premium on Bitcoin prices. At the time of writing of this article, 1 BTC fetched $965.25 on Poloniex while on ZebPay an Indian Bitcoin exchange 1 BTC was worth Rs. 68,301 or $1011.34! It would be interesting to see the effects of further restrictions on cash by the government in April on Bitcoin prices.\n\nWill Indians move their transactions to a currency which can’t be tracked easily by the tax authorities? Only time will tell.']"
02/02/2017,"['With a public statement, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has – once again – said it has not authorized any use of virtual currencies like bitcoin among companies or individuals in the country.\n\nIn a public release on its website, the RBI has stated:\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India advises that it has not given any licence / authorization to any entity / company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency. As such, any user, holder, investor, trader etc., dealing with virtual currencies will be doing so at their own risk.\n\nIndia’s financial regulator also pointed to a previous public statement from December 2013, when it cautioned adopters and traders of virtual currencies “including Bitcoins” about any potential legal, operational and consumer protection risks.\n\nAt the time, the RBI urged caution among bitcoin and virtual currency (VC) users, reminding them of the possibility of digital wallet compromises due to hacking, malware-led attacks etc. The “huge volatility in the value of VCs” was also cited one of the factors toward the public warning. The central authority had also stated that it was “presently examining” the use of virtual currencies under existing legal and regulatory frameworks at the time. Besides today’s reiterated warning, the RBI hasn’t followed up on those initial examinations.\n\nSpeaking to CCN, Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of leading Indian bitcoin exchange UnoCoin is quick to point out that the RBI’s latest statement is merely reiterating the previous 2013 statement.\n\nThe RBI is reminding users of its original statement from years ago. Nothing has changed since the original statement, for the better or worse.\n\n“No, they haven’t” added Vishwanath, when asked if the RBI had reached out to UnoCoin toward exploring or laying the groundwork for regulating bitcoin exchanges in the country.\n\nHe added:\n\nIndia’s bitcoin trading volumes are relatively small compared to other countries around the world. So, it may not be a priority, yet. First, the RBI will need to understand the bitcoin ecosystem before regulating it.\n\nWhen asked if India’s bitcoin industry would welcome regulation from the financial regulator, Vishwanath stated:\n\nIt depends. The RBI will look at examples of regulatory moves from around the world and it could go one of two ways. New York’s BitLicense was a regulatory move that did not help the industry and a lot of companies left its shores. [Regulatory moves in Japan and South Korea] where Fintech innovation is encouraged, would be welcome.\n\nTwo Sides\n\nThe RBI’s latest statement on bitcoin and virtual currencies comes amid soaring interest in the cryptocurrency in the country. Bitcoin adoption in India has never been higher and the increased interest follows the unprecedented and controversial demonetization drive enforced by India’s central government.\n\nWhile the regulator’s official stance is one to urge caution among users and adopters, RBI’s governor and chief Raghuram Rajan has previously stated “bitcoin is fascinating”, in late 2014.\n\nCuriously, a recent blockchain whitepaper [PDF] released by the RBI’s research references bitcoin repeatedly, noting that blockchain technology was best known for “its groundbreaking application in the modern cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and moreso because of the disruptive innovations it promises.” Having researched blockchain technology solutions for core banking processes, researchers deemed blockchain technology had “matured enough” to be the core technology toward digitizing the Indian rupee.\n\nInterview with Sathvik Vishwanath edited for clarity.\n\nImages from Wikimedia and Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The company plans to use the new payment system to facilitate car financing and related transactions.\n\n“We invest in the future of mobility and are a pioneer in the realm of innovative mobility services,” notes the mobility services website. “With smartphone based mobility concepts, we optimize the use of existing transportation infrastructure and develop flexible and ecofriendly mobility solutions of the future.”\n\n“‘Mercedes pay’ is a fundamental component of our mobility and digitization strategy,” said Bodo Uebber, member of the Daimler Board of Management. “Daimler’s new payment system underscores our ambition, as a leading provider of digital mobility services, to make the products and services we offer even more appealing.”\n\n“Our philosophy is to provide mobility at your fingertips,” added Klaus Entenmann, chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler Financial Services. “‘Mercedes pay’ allows our customers to easily and securely pay for our mobility offerings and services using their smartphones. ‘Mercedes pay’ will mainly benefit customers who, in the future, will only need to provide their payment details one time, in order to be able to use a range of Daimler’s services. This is made possible by the eWallet function, a virtual source of payment.”\n\nPayCash Europe, founded in 2012 and headquartered in Luxembourg, offers a digital payment platform for mobile payments, e-money, voucher and loyalty solutions, and digital currencies. The company has an e-money license, issued by the Luxembourg financial supervisory body CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier), which allows it to operate as a one-stop payment partner.\n\nIt’s worth noting that digital currencies, including bitcoin, are prominently featured in the service portfolio of PayCash. “Get your business ready for virtual currencies,” says the company. “Whether you are operating a bitcoin exchange or a merchant business that wants to offer its customers bitcoins as a payment solution, our backend solution provides the technical and legal platform to implement the virtual currency into the existing payment infrastructure and enables payments to be processed in all major fiat currencies.”\n\nThe PayCash platform enables bitcoin exchanges to run fiat currency accounts in the most traded currencies, managed through connections to the banking system. “We are able to offer your business a merchant account for the exchange and a dedicated E-wallet for your customers and exchange users,” claims the company. “Finally, to make our platform the best fit for your business, PayCash offers a Full KYC (Know Your Customer) service.”\n\nSince digital currency solutions are but one component of PayCash service offerings, the acquisition does not necessarily imply that bitcoin will be part of “Mercedes pay” or other Daimler mobility services. However, the Daimler press release explicitly mentions that PayCash “offers solutions for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and eWallet systems, in addition to mobile payment services.” Digital currencies are now part of Daimler’s infrastructure, and the company has in-house industry-standard and KYC/AML-compliant means to offer digital currency options to its customers. For example, it seems likely that, given sufficient user demand, Daimler Financial Services could offer bitcoin options for car financing and other mobility services.', 'As the Dutch proverb goes: “The soup is not eaten as hot as it is served.” Meaning: The threat is often not carried through as thoroughly as initially presented.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Magazine recently reported that the investigative arm of the Dutch tax authority — the FIOD — wants to lower the bar for prosecution of unlicensed bitcoin traders. As part of that effort, the FIOD aims to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering indicators. Users of mixing services would be assumed guilty, Dutch financial newspaper Financieele Dagblad (FD) wrote, unless they could prove otherwise.\n\nThe FIOD has now nuanced these reports. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the press officer for the tax authority explained that recognizing something as a money laundering indicator does not mean it will be illegal in and of itself.\n\n“But it does mean it indicates money laundering,” he added.\n\nExpanding on this reasoning, the press officer explained that the tax agency established a money-laundering typology that includes several factors.\n\nThese include, for example, the location where a transaction is made; a public space like a McDonald’s is more suspect than a regular office. “Similarly, whether or not the exchanger keeps an administration, what kind of compensation he charges, how the customer is verified, whether physical cash is used, the amounts involved, visibility of the exchanger on public websites or official government records, and whether communication happened in encrypted form,” the press officer said.\n\nAnd soon, perhaps, also the use of bitcoin mixers.\n\nDarknet Markets\n\nBitcoin can be used relatively anonymously. This has made the digital currency a popular means of exchange on darknet markets like AlphaBay and Silk Road, and is also increasingly used for other cybercrimes, such as ransomware. In a report published last year, Europol — the law enforcement agency of the European Union — said more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends is made with bitcoin.\n\nDarknet market merchants typically do exchange their earned bitcoins for fiat currencies. While trading bitcoin for fiat is itself not illegal in The Netherlands, most exchanges apply strict Anti–Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. This is usually required by the banks they work with.\n\nDarknet merchants, therefore, often prefer to exchange their bitcoins at what the FIOD refers to as “bitcoincashers”: exchanges and dealers that do not comply with such rules. They often offer their services via largely unregulated websites like LocalBitcoins.com, and typically meet up in person to trade bitcoins for cash fiat currency. These bitcoincashers then sell the bitcoins at a regular exchange or brokerage.\n\nThat’s where some bitcoincashers are caught. If they deposit large amounts and tick too many boxes in the above-mentioned money-laundering typology, an investigation can be started against them. And since all bitcoin transactions are traceable on the blockchain, in some cases, this investigation also leads to the original criminals and their crime.\n\nThat’s why bitcoincashers as well as the darknet merchants and cybercriminals increasingly make use of bitcoin mixers. On hosted sites, like bitmixer.io, these mixers exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins, to cut all links on the blockchain.\n\nIf these mixers themselves become a money-laundering indicator, using them would no longer shield the bitcoincashers as effectively.\n\nPrivacy\n\nWithin the Bitcoin community itself, many are concerned with the lack of privacy offered by Bitcoin. Not all bitcoin users want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own — even if they’re not breaking any laws.\n\nAs such, a series of new mixing instruments have been developed and designed over the past few years. These include JoinMarket, ValueShuffle and TumbleBit, while alternative digital currencies offering increased privacy, like Monero and Zcash, have gained in popularity too.\n\nWhen asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the FIOD spokesperson did acknowledge that bitcoin mixing can also be done for perfectly valid, privacy-related reasons.\n\nHe noted, however, “We believe these use cases do not represent a majority. Compare it to the 500 euro note. This is legal tender (for now). However, when someone pays you with a 500 euro bill you are going to find that suspicious. We believe the same is true for mixing bitcoins.”', 'BITCOIN\n\nBitcoin is welcoming a new era, and it’s one that’s marked by the rising political tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump smack dab in the middle of it all.\n\nThe popular digital currency finally woke up from its sleepy streak this week, boosted by the recent developments in the United States. News of Trump signing an executive order that bans citizens of seven countries from entering the U.S. over the weekend pushed bitcoin to cross the $950 barrier.\n\nNow, bitcoin rallied a further 3.7 percent amid reports of Trump’s team exchanging barbs with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the weakness of the euro. In an interview with the Financial Times, Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro accused Germany of using a “grossly undervalued” euro to hurt the U.S. economy—a statement that, of course, promptly drew the ire of the German leader.\n\nBitcoin has had a wild start to the new year, rallying more than 120 percent to reach $1,140.64 in early January—its highest since November 2013. The dramatic rally, however, came to an abrupt end when the digital currency’s price plummeted to $885.41 following reports that the Chinese government is eyeing to introduce cryptocurrency regulations.\n\nA lot of things happened since then: China’s central bank inspected three of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the country—BTC China, OKCoin and Huobi—which led to a discovery of “irregularities” in the operations that the government said caused bitcoin’s recent volatility. This, in turn, prompted the companies to overhaul their practices, which included introducing a 0.2 percent trading fee per transaction to all of their users. Since then, the market has returned to normalcy, and bitcoin’s price slowly recovered.\n\nThe political uncertainty will continue to affect the country as well as the global markets—and this could work in bitcoin’s favor. Trump is already predicted to help boost the price of digital currency by as much as 165 percent.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin is rising steadily, trading at $990 early Thursday morning.\n\nComments', 'One thing a lot of people are concerned over is the time it takes for Bitcoin transactions to confirm. This is especially true when moving funds to and from an exchange platform. Gemini, the bitcoin exchange operated by the Winklevoss twins, is introducing zero-confirmation deposits. This is quite a risky move, as zero-confirmation transactions are subject to double spending.\n\nIntroducing zero-confirmation bitcoin deposits is a significant step for the Gemini exchange. Allowing customers to instantly trade their balance without having to wait half an hour will attract more people to the exchange. Deposit delays have been a problem in the world of cryptocurrency for quite some time now. With the bitcoin transaction volume increasing, and the network capacity remaining fixed, confirmations can take much longer than needed.\n\nZero-Confirmation Bitcoin Deposits Come To Gemini\n\nThis is why the Gemini exchange becomes one of the first in the world to allow zero-confirmation deposits. Withdrawals from the platform are confirmed as soon as possible already. With a new aggressive fee algorithm, the exchange pays these costs out of their own pocket. Unfortunately, doing the same for bitcoin deposits has proven to be a much bigger challenge. Gemini can’t control transaction fees on deposit transactions, yet they want to avoid hours of delays.\n\nEvery Bitcoin deposit on the exchange will be run through a proprietary analysis to determine its expected confirmation time. Once the transactions passed the criteria, the amount will be pre-credited to the Gemini exchange account in question. In doing so, the company allows users to sell BTC for USD or Ether much faster and more efficiently. Moreover, this allows users to participate in the daily two-sided auction without delays.\n\nAdditionally, Gemini improved their Instant ACH deposit system. Funds being available for trading right away is important, both for US Dollars and cryptocurrencies. This new feature will be quite useful to frequent traders on the platform. Gemini is making major strides to become a bitcoin exchange platform with mainstream investor appeal, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', ""The cryptocurrency world is abuzz again as Bitcoin price continues to climb to new heights. It is almost getting to a point many Bitcoin enthusiasts have seen before, although for only a short period of time - 1 mBTC getting to be on par with $1.\n\nBitcoin price has almost crossed the $1000 mark on several exchanges including Bitfinex, Poloniex and Bitstamp as at the time of writing. With the look of things, the crossing may happen today, Feb. 2 although the likes of Erik Voorhees and several other onlookers had predicted it would have happened at least a day earlier.\n\nThe last time the $1000 mark was crossed, apart from the all-time record high, was earlier in January 2017 but it didn't last more than six days when the price was reversed due to the impact of the onsite inspection of key exchanges in China by the country's top bank, PBoC. The price of Bitcoin slumped due to the checks.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nWhen it happens, the 1 mBTC to $1 parity, owing to the $1000 break, will make calculating it - which is 1/1000 of a Bitcoin or 0.001 BTC - as a unit of account easier, especially for new users who find the decimal numeric a little confusing.\n\nGoing by Bitedge, mBTC is popular because they are easily equatable mentally to Bitcoin amounts and government currency amounts. This will impact Bitcoin use positively as merchants and users would be able to relate to the unit better than the calculations they may have to do to ensure their charges are well done.\n\nLunar Year effect\n\nWith February being a very busy month for the Chinese, especially the first few days, it is not clear yet what impact they will have once their festive season is over and they resume full activities.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any major factor that may stop the price of the digital currency from crossing $1000 anytime soon. Rather, the question now is centered on whether it would hang in the spot for a very long time or would be reversed in a couple of days like we have seen in the past.\n\nRelatedly, the digital currency's market cap has also crossed $16 bln again as at the time of publication."", 'Switzerland is one of Europe’s most forward thinking countries, particularly in the world of payment innovation. The Federal Council is looking to amend the Banking Act and Banking Ordinance, which would introduce new fintech regulations moving forward. These will be positive revisions, though, as the barriers to entry into the fintech market will be lowered significantly.\n\nSwitzerland Proposes Positive Regulation Change\n\nLowering the barrier to market for fintech startups and entrepreneurs remains a critical issue all over the world. Switzerland wants to lead by example and modify their existing Banking Act and Banking Ordinance to improve competitiveness in the Swiss financial sector. A consultation has been initiated – which will run until May 8 – to collect valuable feedback regarding this upcoming change to the regulatory system.\n\nThree major changes have been proposed, although they are not turned into a decree or law just yet. First of all, the Federal Council wants to provide an exception for the acceptance of funds for settlement purposes as part of the Banking Ordinance. The new regulation would apply explicitly for settlements within 60 days, rather than those within seven days. A more than welcome change for fintech startups and entrepreneurs, that much is certain.\n\nSecondly, the Federal Council wants to establish an official innovation area. Accepting public funds for up to CHF 1m should not be regarded at as operating on a commercial basis. This change would make it possible for fintechs to do so without further authorisations. In the overall fintech world, this change should allow for more business models, which in turns brings more competition to the financial sector.\n\nLast but not least, banking licenses in specific Swiss cantons will need to be revised. Companies accepting public funds will be able to benefit from simplified authorisation and operating requirements moving forward. A lot of startups may accept up to CHF 100m in public funds, yet would not be active in the lending business under the standard definition. Less strict requirements related to minimum capital required, own funds, and liquidity for fintech startups will benefit the ecosystem over the coming years.\n\nSwitzerland wants to remain a financial center of Europe and the rest of the world. Easing off on regulation in the fintech sector will bring some significant changes to the table. Moreover, the country would set an example for the rest of Europe, and even the world, where fintech regulation is concerned. It will be interesting to see what types of feedback will be provided between now and May 8, 2017.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The price of bitcoin is inching closer to $1,000 once again.\n\nPrices hit a high of $994.79 during morning trading, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), after opening at an average of $977.52.

02/03/2017,"['Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have the potential to revolutionize retail payments. Adoption is on the rise and consumers show an increased appetite to find places to spend their Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Yet, it seems that enthusiasts and critics alike are always debating the likelihood of consumers fully adopting the virtual currency.\n\nRegardless of individual opinions, the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies cannot be ignored. There are many billion dollar businesses that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. The trend began in 2014 when Overstock.com announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments. Several other large online retailers followed suit, with more widely recognizable brands adding their name on a growing early adopters list. Today, consumers can use Bitcoin for a wide range of products, from buying a cup of coffee, to booking a vacation or even buying a car or real estate online. There are even sites that are designed to receive exclusively Bitcoin payments.\n\nBitcoin ATMs are also spreading quite fast since the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016. Because of their functionality, bitcoin users can easily insert physical cash in exchange for bitcoins, which can then be used to shop online.\n\nBitcoin and Retailers\n\nBitcoins are taking over the cryptocurrency marketplace. To date, they are the largest and most well-known digital currency. Many large retailers, including Amazon, Dell, Expedia, Microsoft, Subway and Target, have adapted to bitcoin technology to appeal to a larger audience. With the extreme adaption of this technology, it would be detrimental to merchants to note accept this new form of payment.\n\nThere are certain advantages for merchants of adopting virtual currency as one of their accepted methods of payment. Accepting virtual currency improves the retailer’s profit margins by eliminating processing fees associated with other types of payment. By offering another payment channel, they are broadening their potential customer acquisition. Some early statistics also indicate that virtual currency shoppers are more loyal to merchants that accept virtual currency.\n\nSo What’s Next?\n\nWhile the signs are promising, virtual currency has a long way to go before achieving a wide user-adoption similar to other traditional methods of payment. The technology behind virtual currency, the Blockchain, is relatively new, only a few years old. Even though it is a revolutionary type of technology, consumers are not familiar with it outside of mainstream media coverage and what they read about on social platforms. The clear majority of coverage on the subject comes either from those who do not understand it and are quick to demonize it, or from those that understand it too well but are too technical to explain it in plain language.\n\nThese adoption obstacles are not unique to virtual currency. They have been associated, over the years, with the introduction of any new technology at a wide scale. Similar challenges can easily be applied to mobile payments or even on-line payments in the early days of the Internet commerce.\n\nLet’s Talk About Consumer Adoption\n\nAiming only to increase the number of merchants that accept virtual currency is only half of the equation for wide consumer adoption. Achieving greater consumer adoption equates making consumers feel safe using virtual currency in their everyday lives. All this will come with time and a little bit of consumer education. Cost savings may ultimately be the most compelling benefit for virtual currency consumers.\n\nThe savings on the merchant side are clear considering the fees incurred by using existing payment methods. An increasing number of merchants pass some of the cost savings on to consumers, in the form of discounts and incentives. As these cost savings continue, consumers will soon realize that virtual currency enables lower prices for goods and services.\n\nPrivacy is another benefit for consumers. During a virtual currency transaction, the consumer only shares a public key, a sequence of letters and numbers unique to the consumer, and the amount of the payment with the merchant. There is no personal information shared that potentially could make the consumer susceptible to identity theft.\n\nVirtual currency and its underlying technology, the Blockchain, is the next step in the evolution of the payment system. It unlocks great potential for consumers and retailers. As with any new technology, it takes time to mature and become widely adopted. But it is rapidly reaching its tipping point.\n\nIt is expected that in the next couple of years’ virtual currency will become more and more accessible, making it easier to integrate with existing payment systems and becoming the preferred method of payment amongst consumers. Someday soon, bitcoin will be the new form of currency.\n\nIrene Katzela is the chief executive officer of Chain of Points, creators of the Blockchain-based platform that incentivizes participation in loyalty programs.', 'As the price of Bitcoin is climbing slowly, a compromise may have to be reached in the face of the unfolding situation between a Donald Trump-led US and China for the earlier projected $2,000 price range for Bitcoin in 2017 not to be just a starter in months to come.\n\nA looming trade war between the two countries would favor Bitcoin. However, the extent to which the war would last will only be determined by which of the leaders of the two biggest economies in the world to back down first on their policy statements.\n\nAnother considered scenario could be that the US would make efforts to contain China. According to Victor Zhikai Gao, a leading Chinese expert on international relations and chairperson of the China Energy Security Institute, this could backfire and escalate the doctrine of mutually assured destruction.\n\nThe state of the US-China relationship\n\nSo far, the US-China relationship has had some tension in the last few days. The new US president has signed into law a new national day of patriotism, and in a separate statement on the White House website, said he intends to develop a “state of the art” missile defense system to protect against attacks from Iran and North Korea. In response, Iran is planning to dump the US dollar now.\n\nTrump also called for an immediate “regulatory freeze” to prevent federal agencies from issuing any new regulations. His focus is on a resolve to have a nationalistic vision for his country, a view that is somewhat counterproductive to the Chinese leader’s whose idea of a globalized world does not seem to be appealing to Trump.\n\nAt Davos, Xi Jinping spoke in defense of an open and globalized international economy which his country’s economic performance and the stability of his regime depend on, according to British historian, author and Professor of European Studies at Oxford University in his latest piece for The Guardian.\n\nWe are in for a dangerous and rough ride over the next few years, we’d better be ready for it, writes Timothy Garton Ash as he dissects the early hours of Trump’s assumption into office and summed it up with the keyword: confrontation.\n\nAn editorial in the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, says: “Frictions between the US and its allies as well as trade tensions between the US and China seem inevitable within the four years ahead. Undoubtedly, the Trump administration will be igniting many ‘fires’ on its front door and around the world. Let’s wait and see when it will be China’s turn.”\n\nThe confrontational tendency will likely continue to take a toll on the global economy until the US and China work out a term.\n\nCurrency woes\n\nConsidering all that has been happening to the Chinese yuan in the last few months, China seems at a more disadvantaged point than the US.\n\nA further weakening of the yuan will see more capital outflows which will see more Bitcoin uptake not only in China but in several other parts of the world where the effect of a strengthened dollar is a constraint.\n\nThe case would be the same if the dollar faced a similar predicament.\n\nOther factors to influence Bitcoin price\n\nIn reality, we should understand that the Trump factor is just an addition to the various anticipated events that are expected to affect the price of the digital currency.\n\nSeveral issues are springing up on the corporate scene which are expected to enhance the adoption of Bitcoin and push its price higher. We have the debate over the activation of SegWit, ETFs getting approved and the several new use cases springing up here and there.\n\nThe economic showdown in Europe has started but it hasn’t really gone too far. Africans are warming up to the reality and we all know what is going on in South America.', 'As the value of hard currency changes drastically—and often—developing or recession-hit countries are finding Bitcoin as an innovative solution.\n\nJust look at Venezuela, the country with the highest inflation rate in the world. The socialist nation has experienced a swift fall in oil prices, throwing the entire economy into turmoil. Experts say that Venezuelan inflation could go as high as 1,600%, leaving many people without basic necessities.\n\nA 100 bolivar note—once the highest denomination offered in Venezuela—is now worth roughly about 2 cents. The country is printing higher-denomination notes so citizens don’t have to bring bags and bags of cash for transactions in stores, but this doesn’t solve the issue of poverty.\n\nWith the Venezuelan bolivar essentially worthless and supplies rapidly running out, Bitcoin is rising as an answer. According to Bitcoin brokerage Surbitcoin.com, the number of Venezuelan users skyrocketed, from 450 in August 2014 to more than 85,000 in November 2016.\n\nWatch On Forbes: Getting Rid Of Pocket Money\n\nSo, just how is Bitcoin helping in Venezuela, and can it be used to boost other recession-struck nations?\n\nRecession-proof currency\n\nAs the bolivar continues to fall, many Venezuelans are turning to Bitcoin as an alternative. Humanitarians can donate Bitcoin to those in need, who can then use Bitcoin to buy Amazon gift cards, then purchase goods through the online retailer.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths to Bitcoin, and one often ignored in developed nations such as the United States, is that you don’t need to have a physical bank account to send and receive Bitcoin. All you need is an Internet connection, which many Venezuelans have in the form of mobile phones.\n\nThis lowers the bar for Venezuelans seeking relief, allowing them to receive Bitcoin through their phone and use that money for desperately needed goods. Some companies in Venezuela are even exclusively accepting payment in Bitcoin, knowing that the bolivar is highly volatile and largely useless right now.\n\nAnother major positive to Bitcoin for a country in disarray is that its government can’t control the value of it. Countries like Venezuela can become banana republics as their government causes rampant inflation via over-printing currency.\n\nUnlike the bolivar, a government agency can’t just print more Bitcoin. There’s no central agency regulating Bitcoin, allowing the free market to take hold. While the value of Bitcoin can (and does) change quite often, the shifts aren’t as violent as the devaluation of bolivar.\n\nBitcoin taking hold worldwide\n\nUnlike many other currencies, the value of Bitcoin continues to grow. Once a mysterious cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is now widely acknowledged and accepted as a valid form of payment.\n\nCash-strapped governments are taking notice. Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro have accepted policies that allow Bitcoin to flourish in struggling economies.\n\nThe risky-but-lucrative field of Bitcoin mining has also found a foothold in Venezuela, where many people are living off a government-issued stipend of roughly $9 per month.\n\nWhile countries such as Iceland, Bolivia, Ecuador and Vietnam have outright banned Bitcoin, it’s largely legal to some degree throughout the world.\n\nThose in Venezuela have taken advantage of the government’s embrace of the cryptocurrency, as Quartz reported in November that Venezuelan trading volume on LocalBitcoins reached as many as 370 Bitcoins per week.\n\nCountries with struggling economies can look to Bitcoin as a more reliable alternative for citizens. Usage of Bitcoin has surged in Nigeria, where Google search interest in Bitcoin is definitely the highest, as well. As Bitcoin becomes accepted and embraced by more countries, the taboo will lift and those in impoverished nations can have access to a more stable form of currency.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is not within government control scares nations with a strong central bank, but for nations with currency in disarray, Bitcoin is a relatively stable investment. If you really want to help those in developing countries, a gift of Bitcoin might be the best bet for a sustainable recovery.', 'Fidelity Charitable, an independent public American charity, has announced that it received $7 million in bitcoin donations in 2016 from donors across the country.\n\nTo enable Fidelity Charitable donors to give more and to support a broader expansion, in November 2015, the charity began accepting bitcoin. Donors were then able to donate more with the non-profit efficiently monetizing the bitcoin for grant-making.\n\nAs well as accepting digital currency donations, the charity also raised $3.5 billion in donor-recommended grants to non-profit organizations last year, which saw a 15 percent increase compared to 2015. To celebrate its 25th anniversary the charity also asked donors to recommend a cumulative $25 billion in grants to be reached by the end of 2016. Donors surpassed the goal on December 16, according to a press release.\n\nPamela Norley, president of Fidelity Charitable, said:\n\nReaching this milestone of $25 billion in 25 years is the latest reminder of Fidelity Charitable’s responsibility to continually improve our support to our donors who seek to do good.\n\nBitcoin Accepting Charities\n\nWhen it comes to donating to charity cash still leads the way. However, with more charities now accepting bitcoin they are providing an alternative avenue for people to donate with the digital currency.\n\nIn 2014, Greenpeace announced that it was accepting bitcoin donations to combat credit card fees while the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), a charity which rescues people at sea in the British Isles, became the first major charity in the U.K. or Ireland to accept the digital currency.\n\nThe American Red Cross is another major charity that accepts donations in the currency.\n\nAs more people embrace bitcoin as a form of payment it only seems natural that people will also want to donate to their favorite causes with the currency.\n\nSo to keep charities relevant in the technologically-savvy times that we live in, charities are increasingly providing donors with the option to contribute in bitcoin.\n\nAnother popular way for people to donate the cryptocurrency to their chosen charities is through Bitcoin Giving Tuesday, which follows the Black Friday sales. This new global movement aims to help bring awareness to charities and individuals about bitcoin while providing a list to donors of all the charities that accept the digital currency.\n\nEven though cash is still king when it comes to donating to charity, the digital currency is certainly picking up the pace and providing donors with another option that may cut out any fees traditional payments may incur.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Former Bitcoin core developer and one of the founders of the Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen, has once again expressed his negative feelings about Bitcoin Core known via Twitter after a miner with a node running the alternative Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin Unlimited, lost $12,000 through a bug.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited bug\n\nNews of a bug in the Bitcoin Unlimited code that had caused a miner to lose 13.2BTC, which equates to about $12,000, arose on Reddit in the pro-Bitcoin core subreddit, /r/bitcoin, where the poster proclaimed “Bitcoin.com loses 13.2BTC trying to fork the network: Untested and buggy BU [Bitcoin Unlimited] creates an oversized block, Many BU node banned, the HF [hard fork] fails”.\n\nCoinFox reported:\n\n“An anonymous Bitcoin node created a block of 1,000,023 bytes. The current maximum block size limit in the Bitcoin system is 1MB and a block exceeding this limit is considered invalid. Those miners who created this block will not be able to use their premium.”\n\nResponses to the Reddit thread criticized the seeming lack of peer-review for the Bitcoin Unlimited code and their later response to miners to cap the size of their blocks as counterintuitive to the ‘unlimited’ nature of BU.\n\nTwitter responds\n\nGavin Andresen, an advocate for increasing Bitcoin block size instead of transferring transactions to side-chains as suggested by Bitcoin Core, tweeted in response to the news:\n\nOne miner loses $12k from BU bug, some Core devs scream.\n\n\n\nUsers pay millions in excessive tx fees over the last year ""meh, not a priority"" — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) January 30, 2017\n\nAndresen argues that Bitcoin Core promotes unnecessarily high transaction fees for users in its attempt to force users onto side-chains which he sees as counter to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision, while other BTC protocols like Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic provide a better solution.\n\nRoger Ver hits back\n\nRoger Ver, a member of the Bitcoin.com mining pool who was the subject of this bug, later weighed in on the news:\n\nCore\'s 1MB block size limit is costing the users of bitcoin >$100k per day for the past several months and is hindering Bitcoin adoption. — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 30, 2017\n\nAlthough not explicitly referencing the Bitcoin lost to the bug, the timing and subject of the tweet would seem to suggest Ver is hitting back at users damning Bitcoin Unlimited and ignoring potential issues with Bitcoin Core.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\n\nAccording to Investopedia, Bitcoin Unlimited “embraces the absence of a hard-coded block size limit. Instead, it allows users to manually set limits on their own nodes; the Bitcoin Unlimited team expects consensus on a limit to emerge naturally at a so-called Schelling or focal point - a solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication because it seems natural, special or relevant to them.”\n\n“Furthermore, Bitcoin Unlimited intends to introduce a level of democracy into development and management of the implementation, allowing the community to vote on changes.”', 'Bitcoin regulation in Poland has taken a step forward with the news that the country’s Central Statistical Office (GUS) has recognized the trading and mining of virtual currencies as an official economic activity.\n\nAs a result, companies active in the industry will now be able to register with the agency.\n\nFirms involved in virtual currency trade and production can apply to obtain an official PKD 64.19.Z registration when filing their entities with the official court register, the GUS said in a statement.\n\nThe development marks a significant advance for industry players in Poland where, to date, the state has not issued any specific legislation that regulates bitcoin and other virtual currencies.\n\nThat said, the Polish Ministry of Finance has previously released a number of documents that address bitcoin’s legal status.\n\nIn a statement from 2nd November, the ministry said that ""there is a lack of a general, legal definition of virtual currency … in international, European and national law"". It concluded that, while virtual currencies are not subject to any separate regulation under Polish legislation, it is subject to income tax.\n\nThe ministry also stated:\n\n""It should also be stressed here that their use in Poland is fully legal.""\n\nFurther exploration\n\nTo further explore the legal and financial implications of the use of virtual currencies in Poland, the country\'s government has established an expert group on blockchain and virtual currencies.\n\nThe task force was set up under the auspices of the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs, and it is part of the government’s ""From Paper To Digital Poland"" program that was launched by the Cabinet in June 2016.\n\nThe group is responsible for preparing analyses for use by other government entities in their legislative work, and the potential regulation of virtual currencies is one of its fields of interest.\n\nKrakow image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Yet, while generous contributions continue to be made around the world, public trust and confidence in charities has been reported at its lowest recorded level.\n\n\n\nAccording to a 2016 report from UK Fundraising, a survey of over 1,000 people found that trust in charities has fallen from 6.7 out of 10 in 2014 to 5.7 in 2016. The main reasons for this decline are distrust in how charities spend their donations, a lack of knowledge among the public about where their donations go and media coverage critical of charity practices.\n\nFurthermore, a 2013 Guardian report suggests that people in the U.K. would donate an extra £665 million a year to charity if organizations provided additional information about the things they care about, such as evidence of how their donations are impacting a cause and how their money is spent.\n\nSo how exactly can this issue be rectified for the benefit of charities and those who want to donate to a worthy cause? Enter bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nAlice.si: A Blockchain Philanthropy Platform\n\nAccording to Raphaël Mazet, CEO of Alice.si, a U.K.-based blockchain philanthropy platform, charities are well documented with trust issues, particularly in the U.K. He believes, though, that blockchain technology is useful in addressing these issues.\n\n“[As] donations can be made conditional to impact, and because everything is recorded immutably and transparently, anyone can verify what charities have achieved,” he said, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nAlice.si is built on Ethereum’s blockchain; its name is an homage to “Alice,” who anecdotally always seems to be sending money to Bob. The “.si” stands for “social impact.” Using Alice, charities can raise donations based on the transparency of their impact. Once a donation appeal has been launched on Alice, the charity commits to delivering specific outcomes and receives payment only when those outcomes are verified and validated by an independent third party.\n\nAs part of the Nominet Trust’s Social Tech Seed grant-making program, Alice received just over £45,000 in up-front funding to get the startup off the ground, thus allowing the company to build a track record of trust.\n\nWhile Mazet states that the use of blockchain technology in charity cases can help to humanize the technology and introduce it to the general public, the company’s main message to donors focuses on how they can track the impact of their donations.\n\n“Because we’re trying to reach a mainstream audience, we won’t necessarily put the tech front and center,” he said.\n\nAs such, Alice’s first pilot with St. Mungo’s, a forward-thinking U.K.-based homeless charity, due to be launched in Q1 of 2017, will be measuring its impact and working on a payment-by-results basis.\n\nThe platform will not accept donations in digital currencies just yet, however. Mazet explained that Alice is working with Tramonex Labs, which is registered within the sandbox framework of the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, to issue electronic tokens that represent the donations on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n“That means they’ll collateralize and tokenize donations made in fiat on the Alice website so we can use them in our smart contracts,” he said. “In time, as people become more familiar with the technology, our plan is to empower them to interact with the smart contracts directly, and start donating with cryptocurrencies if they want to.”\n\nMazet says that Alice will be launching pilots in the first half of 2017 so they can test different use cases with different partners. After that, the idea is to open up to more charities, launching programs outside the U.K., such as in the U.S. and South Africa.\n\n“The end game is really to make sure donors can trust the charities they’re funding, and see if we can help tackle some of the world’s really big issues in a demonstrable way.”\n\nBitGive: Facilitating Bitcoin Donations\n\nSince the establishment of the BitGive Foundation in 2013, the nonprofit organization has been revolutionizing the way in which people donate to charity; in fact, it is the first 501(c)(3) registered nonprofit in the Bitcoin space.\n\nConnie Gallippi, founder of BitGive, said to Bitcoin Magazine that the number of donations largely trends with the price of bitcoin; when the price is up, the organization sees more donations.\n\n“Early on, it was a novel and interesting way to give, so there was more attention on it in the media,” she said.\n\nFor BitGive’s projects specifically, it also correlates to the amount of time and effort they have put into a charity or campaign and how much their mission and projects interest potential donors, Gallippi added.\n\nIn December, BitGive announced the beta launch of GiveTrack, a blockchain-based multidimensional donation platform that provides the ability to transfer, track and provide a permanent record of financial transactions across the globe from beginning to end.\n\nBy leveraging blockchain technology, GiveTrack enables a high level of confidence in donors, who can see exactly where their donation is going and how the funds are being used. By implementing the technology with charities, Gallippi believes it connects people with the technology.\n\n“Offering them an explanation as to how this technology can improve the work of charities, and ultimately drive more impact toward causes they care about, makes the technology more approachable and more relevant to a mainstream audience,” she said.\n\nDespite working with large organizations such as Save the Children, who now accepts bitcoin directly, Gallippi noted that it is BitGive’s role in supporting a new water well built at the Shisango Girls School in Kenya that she is most proud of.\n\n“The well has changed so many young lives and will continue to lift up that community for many years to come.”\n\nGallippi added, though, that while charities will continue to receive cash donations, she believes that Bitcoin and blockchain technology will eventually become more of the norm for giving. Through a cost-effective approach where less fraud and faster transaction times are guaranteed with donor tracking, she said that these organizations will be at the forefront, leading the way to the future of philanthropy.\n\nHelperbit: A Blockchain Natural Disaster Management Platform\n\nAccording to the U.N., every year, the total number of people affected by natural disasters reaches approaches 200 million, while 100,000 of those victims die. While the Helperbit website states that 325 million people could be affected by poverty and vulnerable to natural hazards and climate extremes by 2030.\n\n“By 2030, there could be 325 million people trapped in poverty and exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes.”\n\nUnfortunately, the charity sector has a history of lack of transparency, inefficiency and unfair redistribution of funds, but Helperbit is offering transparency in humanitarian aid through blockchain technology.\n\nIn December, Legambiente, a nonprofit organization in Italy, teamed up with Helperbit to adopt Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The funds raised will be donated to the “Rebirth Has a Young Heart campaign,” which is dedicated to youth entrepreneurs, such as young farmers, in the areas affected by the August and October earthquakes in the region.\n\nGuido Baroncini Turricchia, CEO and co-founder of Helperbit, told Bitcoin Magazine that since the company’s collaboration with Legambiente, the Swiss Re Foundation and the Swiss Re Centre for Global Dialogue have also created a multisig wallet in Helperbit and donated more than 5 bitcoins. Add that to the other donations the Legambiente charity campaign has received, and they have 6.22 bitcoins in total.\n\nEven though it’s too early to measure the impact the donations are providing, Turricchia believes that in time they can highlight the advantages of using digital currencies.\n\n“In the long-term, more people will buy bitcoins with the purpose of donating them,” he said. “At the moment we are mainly shaking the social sensibility of people in Italy, but with greater resources we will be able to increase our efforts worldwide.”\n\nThrough the Helperbit platform it is possible to analyze the total donations received as well as checking how the funds will be spent. This gives donors the assurance they need that their donations reach their destination, where they can monitor the impact resulting from the economic aid.\n\nEven though Bitcoin and blockchain technology have often been negatively portrayed and debated for years, Turricchia is of the opinion that this initiative is the best way to show that it is only a tool and, as such, can be used positively.\n\n“We are confident that an improvement of the interface for every kind of person merged with the increased social awareness of the worldwide community will bring a widespread adoption because the outcomes will be the best drivers,” he said.\n\nWhile it’s unlikely to happen straightaway, Turricchia adds that the penetration of the Bitcoin ecosystem in everyday life will also be reflected in the growth of digital currency donations.', 'Reserve Bank of India has issued a notification stating that they haven’t authorized usage of bitcoins in India. It doesn’t stop here, as RBI has clearly warned Indians against using bitcoins.\n\nIn their notification, RBI has said that usage of bitcoins can pose potential operational, financial, security related risks; and anyone using bitcoins will do so at their own risk.\n\nTheir notification said, “The RBI advises that it has not given any license/authorization to any entity/company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency. As such, any user, holder, investor, trader, etc., dealing with virtual currencies will be doing so at their own risk,”\n\nThis is certainly one of the most strongly worded cautions ever released by RBI against the usage of bitcoins in India. The future of bitcoins and related alternate currencies in India is now at a grave risk.\n\nWhy Did RBI Issue A Caution Against Bitcoins?\n\nIn the last few years, bitcoins have gained an unfortunate reputation of being a medium to carry out illegal activities online, and most probably, this is the ‘image’ which caused RBI to come out with such a warning.\n\nAlthough Oxford had included bitcoin as a new word in their dictionary, way back in 2013, hackers and anti-social elements are now using the anonymous mode of bitcoin and exploiting it for carrying their wrong deeds.\n\nLast year we reported how bitcoin is being increasingly used by hackers to demand ransom from hapless victims; and the primary reason is that this virtual currency is not monitored or controlled by any regulatory body in India.\n\nAs we saw and reported, bitcoin was the main medium to demand ransom in case of hacking by ransomware, while executing India’s largest cybercrime incident and more.\n\nDue to same very reasons, way back in 2013, RBI had to issue a similar warning against bitcoins, when they said, “The creation, trading or usage of virtual currencies including Bitcoins are not authorized by any central bank or monetary authority. As such, there is no established framework for recourse to customer problems,”\n\nBut.. Can Bitcoins Be Safe As Well?\n\nThis is the million dollar question, which every active bitcoin trader is asking right now.\n\nTake for instance example of China, wherein their Govt. is creating a new currency model based on the principles of bitcoin. And if we believe some internal reports, then this new virtual currency mode will replace all types of currencies in China, which includes digital wallets and paper-based currency.\n\nIn fact, even, RBI has appreciated the fundamentals of blockchain, in countering fake currency and to stop the menace. And blockchains are the technology behind bitcoins!\n\nOur Opinion\n\nRBI shouldn’t simply discourage a new platform, only because it is not able to understand it. Regulations can be introduced to monitor its usage, and hackers can be arrested for demanding bitcoins as ransom. Maybe we should seek more clarity from China, which is actually developing a bitcoin type platform for replacing their currencies.\n\nBitcoin is a strong concept, and has the power to change existing financial systems. We must learn it, and embrace it. Not avoid it and ban it, because it represents actual free market dynamics.\n\nRelated:\n\nThe Present and Future State of Bitcoin in India\n\nThe A to Z Of Bitcoins']"
02/04/2017,"[""The knee-jerk approach of governments around the world towards Bitcoin and Blockchain leave room for a lot of questions. The actions of the regulatory agencies as it concerns this disruptive technology shows an element of panic and confusion.\n\nJust recently, the governor of the Central Bank of the UAE reversed an earlier statement by the government which contained “all virtual currencies and transactions thereof are prohibited.”\n\nThere is no ban on Bitcoin\n\nIn a statement to Gulf News clarifying the regulation, Mubarak Rashid Khamis Al Mansouri, Governor of the Central Bank, said:\n\n“These regulations do not cover ‘virtual currency’, which is defined as any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account or a form of stored value. In this context, these regulations do not apply to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, currency exchanges or underlying technology such as Blockchain.”\n\nThe UAE is not an isolated situation because we have seen similar developments in Nigeria, where the Central Bank, after advising the public against investing in digital currencies returned a few days later with a circular requesting banks to produce nominees into a committee that will produce the policies and guidelines that will guide Blockchain regulation in Nigeria.\n\nA number of reasons have been identified for the perceived ‘back and forth’ behavior of government towards Bitcoin and Blockchain.\n\nBitcoin price will skyrocket\n\nMichael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins sees the inadequate understanding of Bitcoin by the lawmakers as one of the major reasons for the sporadic reversals in government position on Bitcoin.\n\n“If all cryptocurrenies are banned, then does that mean that businesses wouldn't be allowed to use Blockchain-based ledgers and databases?” asks Vogel. “What about smart contracts or digital assets tied to the Bitcoin Blockchain?”\n\nPerhaps from the government’s perspective, it is easier to ban than regulate or perhaps they realize after the fact that a ban would be difficult or impossible to enforce.\n\nVogel points out that regulation or lack thereof continues to be a delicate matter and a strain for those looking to use Bitcoin legitimately. He says that in some ways, a wait-and-see approach to regulation is good because over-regulation can stifle innovation. However, a lack of legal clarity can also make it difficult for Bitcoin businesses to operate.\n\nVogel concludes:\n\n“There have been predictions about Bitcoin actually becoming a government world reserve currency by 2020. This would skyrocket Bitcoin price, although by 2020 who knows how high the price will already be.”\n\nThe government is afraid\n\nSimon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com describes the actions of government as a ‘dilemma.’\n\nDixon says that the initial reaction of governments usually reveals some level of emotional response in the form of fear and panic. Therefore, their initial reaction is most often knee-jerk.\n\nHe also explains that what usually follows is that these governments then dig deeper only to realize that their banks want to explore Blockchain technology- a code word for Bitcoin. Then their central banks realize that digital currency can help them rage war on cash. In the end, they flip-flop their announcements realizing that Bitcoin may be something they have to put up with to achieve their goals of creating a worse version of Bitcoin and supporting their banks with their 'Blockchain' buzz-word.\n\nHowever, Dixon notes that this development is not new in the ecosystem as it has been a pattern across the globe.\n\nHe says:"", 'Even before the inauguration of President Donald Trump, the value of the US dollar continuously declined due to several remarks made by the President. Whilst speaking to the media including the Wall Street Journal, Trump stated that the strong performance of the US dollar is restricting international trades and thus negatively affecting the US economy.\n\nUpon the release of Trump’s interview with WSJ, the value of the US dollar decreased by 2.6% in January, marking one of the worst starts for the US dollar in the history of the country. More precisely, it was the worst start of the year in 3 decades, which worsened earlier this month when the US dollar hit a multi-month price after declining by another 4%.\n\nExamining one single factor to determine the price trend of bitcoin is extremely difficult and also inaccurate, primarily because there exists a wide range of factors that can influence the value of bitcoin. The demand amongst high profile investors may have gone up or a billion dollar investor could have purchased a large sum of bitcoin somewhere in an over-the-counter market.\n\nHowever, in most cases, the price trend of bitcoin correlates to major economic events and the performance of reserve currencies.\n\nRecently, the price of bitcoin surpassed US$1,000 for the first time since the first few days of January. It stabilized at the $1,020 margin in most global markets and exchanges. Some regions like South Korea, Japan and China demonstrated arbitrage opportunities, with bitcoin being traded at around 7~8% premium.\n\nbitcoin being traded at around $1,100 in South Korean #bitcoin exchanges including Korbit & Coinplug. Nearly 7% premium. pic.twitter.com/NeuWFzhn9f — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) February 3, 2017\n\nAlthough many factors can be analyzed to explain the recent price surge of bitcoin, the most evident factor is the decline in the value of US dollars. Previously, when both the mainstream and bitcoin media reported that the Chinese market controlled approximately 93% of the global bitcoin exchange market, analysts and investors closely looked at the development of the Chinese market and regulations. As such, events like the devaluation of the Chinese yuan or introduction of tightened policies such as the imposition of regulation on Wealth Management Products were perceived as major factors behind the increasing value of bitcoin.\n\nHowever, due to the requests of the Chinese central bank, Chinese bitcoin exchanges came to a consensus to add trading fees. As a result, inflated volumes were eliminated and the Chinese bitcoin exchange market began to demonstrate legitimate trading volumes.\n\nUpon the “clean up” of Chinese bitcoin exchanges as the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) like to describe it as, it was revealed that the USD/BTC pair is more liquid than the USD/CNY pair. In other words, major USD supporting exchanges like Bitfinex, Kraken and Bitstamp represent a larger trading volume to that of the Chinese bitcoin exchange market.\n\nAccording to bitcoin trading data providers like CoinMarketCap, the BTC/USD pair is currently demonstrating a daily volume of $41 million, while the BTC/CNY pair is demonstrating roughly half of that, at around $21 million.\n\nTherefore, it can be said that economic uncertainty, financial instability or political events in the West or the US in particular will have a larger impact on the price of bitcoin and its trend.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin prices experienced notable gains this week, pushing higher as sentiment recovered from the lagging impact of market turmoil.\n\nThe digital currency rose to as much as $1,024.14 on 3rd February, roughly 11.5% above its opening price of $918.56 on 28th January, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nAt the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,015.11, slightly below the weekly high.\n\nThis sharp gain compared to the tepid increase of 3% generated during the week through 27th January, and the more notable rise of 7.9% produced during the prior week.\n\nBitcoin’s price volatility was reasonably calm during this two-week period, as it relaxed after an intense price fluctuations experienced around the start of the year.\n\nStill, greater growth was seen outside the US dollar markets.\n\nCNY-denominated bitcoin managed to enjoy even more robust gains, surging more than 20% during the week to a high of ¥7,186.17 after opening the week at ¥5,964.90, additional BPI figures show.\n\nAt the time of report, bitcoin was trading at ¥7,129.10, less than 1% below the weekly high reached earlier on 3rd February.\n\nSentiment slowly recovers\n\nAnalysts pointed to the recent improvement in sentiment as the impetus for the increases.\n\nEarlier this month, trader sentiment encountered headwinds when bitcoin’s sharp price volatility motivated the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to intervene and meet with major Chinese exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin. The startups later eliminated margin trading and began charging trading fees, two developments some have speculated would help reduce volatility.\n\nHowever, bitcoin trading volume flooded to no-fee exchanges, which once again raised the question of which trading volume figures were reliable.\n\nMore recently, traders have become more optimistic, according to several market observers.\n\nAlgorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff emphasized the key role that China’s investors and traders play in the bitcoin market, as well as their recent uptick in trading activity.\n\nHe stated that while their exact motivations may not be clear, it is certain that while these market participants “shied away from bitcoin” over the last few weeks, they “have come roaring back"".\n\nPetar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, also stressed how PBoC intervention affected trader sentiment.\n\n""This was seen as a sign of legitimacy for bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nChina\'s take\n\nStill, there are some who are waiting on further announcements.\n\nZhou Shouji, operator of China OTC trading firm FinTech Blockchain Group, said he is convinced further PBoC actions are forthcoming.\n\n""Everyone is waiting for the next PBoC action,"" he said.\n\nFurther, he worried that without margin trading and automated trading, prices could collapse more quickly on any negative moves.\n\nAlready, exchanges appear to be expressing an eagerness to remove fees, with OKCoin pulling back an announcement it would ease prices.\n\nAt press time, Huobi said it was not involved in any conversations to lower fees, while BTCC did not offer any statement.\n\nStrong market dynamics\n\nYet, all this is occurring amid improving sentiment. Zivkovski spoke to how market dynamics helped fuel this rally:\n\n""This bull run was fueled by shorts closing, hence powering price up with more thrust, as well as a lack of sell orders on many exchanges, which created a liquidity vacuum that allowed price to rise quickly,"" he said.\n\nThe robust nature of trader sentiment is illustrated by Whaleclub data, which shows that the market was an average of 84% long in the seven days between 28th January and 3rd February.\n\nDuring all but one of these sessions, the market was at least 80% long.\n\nConfidence, the extent by which a session’s positions are larger than usual, was an average of 82% during the seven days, and was at least 80% in six of the last seven sessions.\n\nGoing forward, these market dynamics could help bitcoin create support at $1,000, something that would be ""a first,"" according to Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management.\n\nHe emphasized that ""It will take a bit for $1,000 to become a support level,"" pointing to the price fluctuations taking place over the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The decentralized nature of Bitcoin, combined with its ease of use and secure nature makes it an ideal alternative for those in troubled economies or cut off from the traditional financial system. The economic condition of Venezuela and Bitcoin’s increasing adoption in the country has presented itself as a case study for mainstream and fringe economists alike.\n\nThe mere mention of Bitcoin evokes mixed response among seasoned economists. There are those who swear by the revolutionary cryptocurrency and others who try their best to put down the digital currency’s success, even calling it a giant pyramid scheme in the process. But the ground realities in Venezuela, as reported by various news media outlets presents Bitcoin in a favorable light while conveying that the governments are not always right.\n\nVenezuela currently has the highest inflation rate in the world. According to reports, the country’s inflation rate is expected to hit 1600%, turning the country’s fiat currency — Bolivar into worthless pieces of paper. The increasing prices, rising poverty, and falling Bolivar have left the supermarket and pharmacy shelves devoid of essential commodities and medicines respectively. In such a situation, Venezuelans are attempting to move away from the diseased Bolivar to much stable alternative — Bitcoin.\n\nThe increased adoption of Bitcoin in the country has led to a surge in cryptocurrency exchange volumes on the country’s Bitcoin platforms. Also, there are reports of good samaritans offering Bitcoin contributions to cash-strapped Venezuelans. People in the country are trying to meet their needs by ordering essential goods and medicines from international online shopping platforms, paying with either Bitcoin or gift cards/prepaid cards bought with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has presented itself as a boon to those without bank accounts, as all they need is a working internet connection and a bitcoin wallet software installed on their smartphones or computers. Also, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin saves it from government’s bad decisions, like printing excess currency and others.\n\nThe universal nature of Bitcoin offers equal opportunities to everyone. Anyone, anywhere in the world can use the cryptocurrency for their day-to-day transactions. This very feature is now keeping thousands of Venezuelans alive.\n\nIt is not just the case of Venezuela. The cryptocurrency has already proven its capabilities in the African continent by making financial services accessible to the unbanked and underbanked. The Bitpesa service has already offered a far more efficient method for remittance and cross-border B2B payments than those available through mainstream banking and financial institutions.\n\nConsidering all these factors, Bitcoin deserves appreciation from people and authorities from across the world. The cryptocurrency may turn out to be the tool needed to solve world hunger and bring peace on earth.\n\nRef: Forbes | Image: NewsBTC', 'An incredible sum of more than 900,000 bitcoins, worth almost a billion dollars, was stuck at one point last night, waiting to move, due to limited transaction capacity. At the time of writing, more than 300,000 bitcoins remain stuck.\n\nLuke-Jr, a developer of the Bitcoin Core client and a Blockstream contractor, publicly responded to the backlog by stating “[j]ust pay a $5 fee and it’ll go through every time.” Jameson Lopp, a BitGo engineer, publicly stated yesterday that if bitcoin’s price hits $10,000 without an increase in transaction capacity, fees will be $400 based on current data.\n\nLopp publicly says that one reason for the considerable increase in fees would be because of more user demand for transaction space as “higher price coincides with more adoption, thus more contention for block space.” He further states that users are already being priced out:\n\n“Early sign of users getting priced out [of] bitcoin: services that previously absorbed on-chain transaction fees cease to do so.”\n\nThe backlog follows a spike in bitcoin’s price by almost $100 in the past four days which may have been due to new users, and thus more demand for transaction space. It is the biggest backlog yet in value and comes just days after a $250 million backlog.\n\nSome services try to estimate fees so that you don’t have to wait, but this is difficult, if at all possible, for two main reasons. Firstly, if hashrate increases, as is often the case, blocks are found more quickly, thus transaction space increases, but once difficulty re-adjusts, transaction space decreases, causing a backlog.\n\nMore worryingly, blocks have a Poisson distribution. That is, on average they are meant to be found every ten minutes, but there could be ten blocks in one hour or none at all, which has happened before. As bitcoin has never operated under full blocks save for the past year or so, with demand for transaction space seemingly considerably increasing recently, we do not quite know what would happen if no block is found in one hour as these backlogs are being created under fairly normal conditions.\n\nThere has been a debate over almost two years on how to solve the problem. Three solutions have been presented – Bitcoin XT, which doubles the blocksize every two years, Bitcoin Classic, a last-ditch attempt to increase the blocksize to just 2MB and segwit which increases transaction capacity to only around 1.7MB. All three have seemingly been rejected with segwit having stalled at around 23% for the past two months.\n\nA fourth proposal on the table, Bitcoin Unlimited, is gaining momentum. The grassroots client continues the transaction capacity increase method bitcoin used for much of its existence. Without any centralized direction, miners increased the block limit from 250kb to 500kb in March 2013 to the apparent opposition of Peter Todd and Luke-Jr. That was followed by an increase to 750kb and then finally to 1MB. With Bitcoin Unlimited, they can increase it in roughly the same manner to 2MB or 4MB in line with demand as well as the progress of technology.\n\nSome bitcoin developers are against a maxblocksize increase, even though it was long suggested by Nakamoto. Luke-Jr has even recommended a decrease of current transaction capacity by 70%. He has further threatened to PoW fork bitcoin if maxblocksize is increased. A threat that has seemingly made established miners (Bitmain, F2Pool, BW.com and HaoBTC) hesitant about upgrading to Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nBut, new miners are entering the scene. Most prominently, ViaBTC and BTC.TOP, who have quickly gained around 10% and 8% of the network’s hashrate respectively. The founders of these two pools both have a technical background. Haipo Yang, ViaBTC’s founder, used to work at Tencent and has “a wealth of experience in the development of distributed, highly concurrent network servers.” Jiang Zhuoer is a former employee at China Mobile in Shanghai, the world’s largest mobile phone operator, where he led a 13-men team working on Data Warehouse and Big Data before establishing BTC.TOP.\n\nThey both appear to be calling Luke-Jr’s threat bluff with Zhuoer seemingly making a checkmate move. He told CCN in an interview:\n\n“We have prepared $100 million USD to kill the small fork of CoreCoin, no matter what POW algorithm, sha256 or scrypt or X11 or any other GPU algorithm. Show me your money. We very much welcome a CoreCoin change to POS.”\n\nSome have suggested that there could be two chains with some miners continuing on the older chain or the mining algorithm could be changed entirely, which would lead to a battle over which coin retains the name of bitcoin especially as r/bitcoin has instituted a policy of strict censorship and banning of bitcoiners in favor of increasing the maxblocksize, leading to the creation of r/btc, a free public discussion space for the digital currency.\n\nBut, if the smaller and very much insecure chain, whether PoW fork or some miners remaining on the limited capacity chain, is attacked, then it could be made inoperational, thus allowing the network to smoothly upgrade. Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum and the Bitcoin Magazine, publicly stated that a “51% spawn camping attack is quite feasible.” It has been illustrated by Luke-Jr himself who successfully carried out such attack on a small altcoin while controlling the Eligius mining pool.\n\nIf the miners latest move – who have long asked for an increase in maxblocksize, even publicly formally agreeing to 8MB – is indeed a checkmate, remains to be seen as the latest proposal now standing, Bitcoin Unlimited, awaits the decision of the free market on how to solve these now somewhat frequent backlogs.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price is back in the bullish zone above $1000 against the US Dollar, and BTC/USD looks set for more gains possibly towards $1080.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price gained momentum this past week against the US Dollar, and moved above $1000.\n\nThere is a crucial bullish trend support in the form of as ascending channel on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD.\n\nOn the downside, the $$1050 support area is the key and may act as a buy area.\n\nBitcoin price is back in the bullish zone above $1000 against the US Dollar, and BTC/USD looks set for more gains possibly towards $1080.\n\nBitcoin Price Bullish Trend\n\nThis past week was positive for Bitcoin price, as it broke the $980 resistance against the US Dollar.

Armed with oversized shades and jovial blue shorts, he looks more \'Jersey Shore\' than \'Mr Robot\', a style you might not expect from someone whose claim to fame is offering privacy in drug market payments.\n\nBut, the impression that Spagni isn\'t to be taken seriously is soon wiped away by his biting South African accent and razor-sharp quips, like the ones he directs largely at those who want to measure the success of monero by metrics like price.\n\nSpagni told CoinDesk:\n\n""I don’t care about the price increase, that shouldn’t be the thing that makes people interested. In terms of transactional growth, in new contributors, in transactions per day, those have far more meaning.""\n\nIf you really want to know, monero is now the fifth-largest by market capitalization (and one of the fastest-growing by price in 2016), and it has been growing rapidly by the metrics Spagni cites (as well as other intangibles) as well.\n\nBut given that monero has been around since 2014, it isn\'t hard to understand why Spagni displays the chip-on-his-shoulder attitude you might expect from someone who has elbowed his way into the in-crowd.\n\nEver since online dark market AlphaBay began accepting the cryptocurrency in August of last year, the narrative around the project has undoubtedly shifted.\n\nSpagni acknowledges this as we\'re sitting at Satoshi Roundtable. An invite-only gathering of bitcoin’s inner circle, it hasn’t historically been welcoming to alternative blockchains (or private versions) on the basis they distract and detract from bitcoin.\n\nHe seems a bit taken aback by the embrace as well. Spagni even earned a rare speaking slot at Coinbase last month, a visit that put him face-to-face with developers from one of the industry’s most heavily regulated startups.\n\n""I don\'t really know how that happened,"" he said. ""At some point, people started to realize what we were doing wasn\'t stupid.""\n\nBut he also credits his rise in creditability more to monero\'s technological achievements. There\'s a case now that monero might be the first fungible digital currency ever created.\n\nRespect the technique\n\nCore to the increasing interest in monero is how its blockchain works (and how it has succeeded where other blockchains have run into issues).\n\nA proof-of-work blockchain like bitcoin, monero\'s is rare in that it was built without forking bitcoin\'s code. Because of this, the project has some interesting features – it has no block size (favoring a more elastic system with penalties) and is expected to be almost completely mined at a faster rate than bitcoin.\n\nBut the most interesting tech feature to many was monero\'s implementation of ring signatures, which allowed users to interact with the blockchain but maintain privacy. Essentially, monero works like a built-in mixer – users sign a transaction using their private key, public key and the public keys of other users, the latter of which obscures the source of the transaction to the network\'s distributed ledger.\n\nThe cryptography was introduced in a 2001 paper by computer scientists from MIT and The Weizmann Institute, which has also bolstered its standing when much of the cryptography powering blockchains is new or experimental.\n\nMore abstractly, the addition of ring signatures sidestepped a problem that Bitcoin Core developer David Vorick (and others) argue is one of that network\'s biggest unresolved issues.\n\nAs he put forth in a recent CoinDesk feature, regulated bitcoin companies now monitor for bitcoins that have ""fringe histories"" or that may be associated with crime or illicit trade, but they are able to do so because of the comparative limitations of its cryptography.\n\n""Because any platform in any jurisdiction can damage fungibility by choosing to discriminate between coins, most fungibility improvements come down to privacy. The best way to protect fungibility is to ensure that there\'s no way to tell the difference between two coins, regardless of the actual history of those coins,"" he wrote.\n\nThis is essentially what monero achieves.\n\nWith bitcoin, it’s safe for companies to assume that someone using a mixer has some reason to hide the history of their coins. With monero, however, all transactions are mixed automatically.\n\nFor this reason, bitcoin core developer Greg Maxwell told CoinDesk he believes monero was one of the first altcoins to have made a ""really interesting"" technical improvement that’s of interest to the wider blockchain community.\n\nLitmus test\n\nIf all the above sounds slightly familiar, then you might be aware of zcash.\n\nThe first blockchain-backed asset to be backed by major VC firms, zcash caused a stir when it launched last October, in part because it boasted enhanced privacy features aimed at solving this very problem.\n\nTo bitcoin developers like Maxwell, the interest in monero primarily revolves around how it applies privacy (which is default for all network users) and how this compares to other blockchains that seek to offer fungible payment (zcash, for example, makes its privacy features optional).\n\nAs reported by CoinDesk, though, not many people seem to be using the feature with zcash.\n\nFor those academically inclined to understand which features might be best, this horse-race competition between the networks means the possibility of new advances.\n\n""Fungibility is a really hot topic right now,"" bitcoin developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo said.\n\n""Everyone is looking for ways to get that done. It’s something we’d like to see explored and tested.""\n\nFor Lombrozo and Maxwell, the development offers an interesting litmus test by which they might consider aspects of each currency’s approach.\n\nOdd origins\n\nBut the journey to this point for monero is a long one.\n\nIt starts back in 2013 with the publication of another white paper penned by an unknown developer. Credited to a still-anonymous Nicolas van Saberhagen, the CryptoNote white paper speculated on how bitcoin might fall short on offering privacy.\n\n""Bitcoin does not satisfy the untraceability requirement,"" the paper reads. ""Since all the transactions that take place between the network’s participants are public, any transaction can be unambiguously traced to a unique origin and final recipient.""\n\nSoon, developers sought to build off the paper\'s ideas, with the first incarnation being for a short-lived digital currency called bytecoin.\n\nThe project, Spagni noted, would later come under fire for the alleged improprieties of the founding team, including the fact that many of the network’s tokens were set aside in a ""pre-mine"", where coins were distributed before being available to the public.\n\nYou can find longer versions of the drama (complete with multiple unknown developers and shady projects) here and here.\n\nSpagni said that he became interested in the ""fair relaunch"" of the network called BitMonero, which was later forked away from its lead developer in April 2014, again under suspicious of improprieties.\n\nYet, at the time, even he notes that his intentions weren’t entirely altruistic.\n\n""I thought, \'I\'m going to pump it and dump it,\' because I was interested and taking the ideas and implementing them in bitcoin. The bitcoin code base was far more interesting to me than monero, and I thought, \'I\'m not going to work on this codebase, it’s terrible,\'"" he recalls.\n\nChanging course\n\nAfter of all this, however, monero miraculously emerged, growing slowly over time into a project that\'s now one of the more reputable in the field, despite use cases that may be unsavory to some.\n\nThe credit lies with how monero\'s team made adjustments along the way.\n\nIn 2016, for example, developers Shen Noether, Adam Mackenzie and the Monero Core team released a paper that envisioned how they would build off the privacy innovations in the original CryptoNote paper (whose authors had, presumably, all since left).\n\nCalled Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring-CTs), the paper explored how Confidential Transactions, a proposal made by Maxwell for the bitcoin network, could be implemented on monero, thereby keeping transaction amounts hidden from the network (along with other differences).\n\nMonero is now in the process of updating its network for the upgrade, completing a series of hard forks (the last of which will be in September of this year) to realize the addition.\n\nAt a time when hard forks seem to be the most contentious changes to any digital currency, monero has mandated hard forks on its network every six months, in which users must accept an update to stay with the main blockchain.\n\nThat this is possible when bitcoin has been debating one hard fork for years has not gone unnoticed, even becoming a point of reference in bitcoin’s block size debate.\n\nSpagni largely credits the movement on the development front to cultural differences, and the fact that monero adopted a development process where any contribution that isn’t ""dumb or obviously bad"" is added to the code base.\n\n""Because of that open structure, we have had people pitch up and people work on it, sometimes they’re there for a few weeks, sometimes they’re there for three years,"" he said.\n\nThere\'s an attitude difference as well, in that the project has a bleacher-seat distaste for vested interests.\n\n""I think there’s a lot of respect from the wider audience because we don\'t make decisions based on stakeholders interested in short or long-term profit,"" he said, adding:\n\n""We\'re getting that social capital because we hacked away at stuff and aren’t idiots, I can\'t think of another reason.""\n\n\'Loose consensus\'\n\nIt\'s perhaps this long road (and element of outsider-ness) that has made Spagni one of the most vocal critics of developers seeking to start successful blockchains by engaging in ""token sales"" or ""initial coin offerings"".\n\nIn this case, rather than disrupting the coins in an open, competitive market, they are sold online, first come, first serve, sometimes with only a poorly written white paper to show.\n\nSpagni is not alone is his criticism, though his project offers a rare counter to those who describe token sales as a promising vehicle for project fundraising.\n\n""By and large there’s a lack of seriousness and rigor in the broader community,"" he said. ""Experimentation is super important, but when people start losing money, you can’t just say you shouldn\'t have invested more than you’re willing to lose.""\n\nAt stake in this argument is not just another use case, but the pros and cons to one of the lowest friction ways to promote interest in blockchain tech. (Major VC firms including Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz are already interested in the idea).\n\nSpagni, however, writes the model off as wishful thinking.\n\nThe irony is that Spagni has perhaps been most outspoken about exactly this sentiment, this kind of loose consensus that he argues favors the ""loudest voices"" and not the most ""technically qualified"", even as he acknowledges monero is currently benefitting from a similar word-of-mouth buzz.\n\nThere’s a social element to all this, one admitted by interviewees.\n\nLombrozo describes Spagni as ""a good guy"" with ""good intentions"", a sentiment that is echoed elsewhere.\n\nOlaoluwa Osuntokun, a developer at bitcoin’s Lightning Network, for instance, called the monero development team ""not overt scammers"", a compliment that could pass for high praise among a notoriously fickle bitcoin crowd.\n\nSelling bibles\n\nSo, what should we make of the project with suspicious origins, a suspicious use case and a man who goes by the online moniker ‘fluffypony’ at the helm?\n\nSpagni argues that, realistically, we shouldn’t have high hopes.\n\n""The greatest likelihood is monero fails, it’s that bitcoin fails,"" he said.\n\nYet, there are signs he doesn’t quite believe that.\n\nSpagni also sees a future where bitcoin and monero (and other blockchain networks) complement each other, one where bitcoin may be a store of value and monero may be more of a payment method, a digital cash that can be used for anything and everything – whether it fits into accepted norms.\n\nAsked about the new statements by US investigators, and their interest in monero, Spagni proceeds to attack morality and those who target the technology he helps develop for its supposed violation of it.\n\n""If you buy a bible in a country where it’s banned, most people will say that’s fine. But maybe it’s outlawed in their country, so now that person goes to prison or is put to death because they bought a bible,"" he said.\n\n""Now, what if the way that person was caught was because we screwed up? We treat it with that care.""\n\nFor now, Spagni is intent to keep working on the project, and keen to stay off the conference circuit and on Twitter, where he aims to continue being a divisive voice.\n\n""I\'ve spent three years now, without realizing it, trolling and being self denigrating, and I think that people are starting to realize that good technology isn’t the result of a single person,"" he said, adding:\n\n""We need to fight against the culture of personality that exists in this space.""\n\nImage via Riccardo Spagni\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

On one hand, these institutions want to implement the distributed ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, whereas on the other they don’t want to accept Bitcoin for what it is. The Reserve Bank of India has just proven it by issuing a warning against the use of Bitcoin.\n\nIt is the second such warning against Bitcoin issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The recent notification follows the earlier one, published way back in December 2013. The warning states,\n\n“The RBI advises that it has not given any license/authorization to any entity/company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency. As such, any user, holder, investor, trader, etc., dealing with virtual currencies will be doing so at their own risk.”\n\nThe notification, which may be in the best interests of the people is appreciated. But the timing of such a notification, given the central bank’s recent misadventures is questionable. The Reserve Bank of India has received sufficient flak for executing a poorly planned demonetization drive that resulted in disrupting the livelihood of many while jeopardizing the country’s economy. The demonetization drive, which was supposed to be against undeclared income and tax evasion failed to yield results. It forced the government and the central bank to term it as an initiative to create a “cashless” economy.\n\nAs the Indian government and the central bank continues to promote electronic payments among the masses, they seem to have failed to notice that Bitcoin is also a form of cashless payment. The use of Bitcoin in the country increased following the scarcity of cash created by the authorities.\n\nIronically, the Reserve Bank of India’s research and development arm recently tested a blockchain platform for trade application and even published a report on it. Other leading Indian banks are also currently working on blockchain-based applications.\n\nWhile the Reserve Bank’s notification doesn’t come as a surprise, it is still worth noting that the central bank, instead of facilitating the adoption of cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency-based services, it is discouraging people from using it. A positive view of Bitcoin among the RBI and government officials can go a long way in helping the country’s huge unbanked and underbanked population.\n\nRef: Live Mint | Image: NewsBTC']"
02/05/2017,"[""One factor that's going to help Bitcoin is the fact that government paper looks ever more shaky.\n\nBitcoin had a great 2016, becoming the world’s top performing currency. However, 2017 so far has been a rollercoaster ride – 20% up, then 35% down, then bouncing back. So what does this year hold? Will Bitcoin go through the roof, or hit the floor?\n\nOne factor that’s going to help Bitcoin is the fact that government paper looks ever more shaky. Demonetisation in India and Venezuela told people their bank notes were effectively worthless – making Bitcoin, which doesn’t depend on any individual government, look a better bet. Higher inflation could also lead to more people looking at Bitcoin as an alternative, and more businesses taking Bitcoin as a payment method. There are forecasts that Japan will see as many as 20,000 merchants accepting Bitcoin as payment by the end of the year; even a traditional British pub, the White Lion in Norwich, is taking it. That’s all good for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nEven traditional banks might become involved in Bitcoin. A former Barclays CEO, Antony Jenkins, has now joined the board of Bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, so at least one mainstream banker ‘gets it’.\n\nBitcoin seems to do well when there’s a lot of macroeconomic and political uncertainty. If all your savings are in dollars, and Trumponomics ends up sending the dollar through the floor, you’re going to feel the pinch, unless you’ve been trading currencies at CMC Markets or have plenty of foreign investments in your portfolio. Look at the other possibility – Trump’s fiscal policies lead to higher inflation, the dollar soars; that still works in Bitcoin’s favour as investors all over Europe and Asia will be looking for a secure investment while their currencies plunge. Basically, currency volatility is good news for Bitcoin.\n\nAnother factor that could help Bitcoin is a feeling that equity markets are looking overstretched. A sector rotation towards value stocks shows that professional investors are now avoiding stocks trading on high multiples, and any reverse in the economic figures could set off a flash crash. There’s some evidence that nervous investors are looking at Bitcoin as an alternative investment, and that could push the price higher.\n\nBitcoin could actually become “the new gold” – the one asset that’s inversely correlated to the markets. In other words, it’s the way you hedge your bets – when everything else looks gloomy, it’s the asset you tuck away to see you through the worst. Will money managers begin to advise their clients to look seriously at Bitcoin? The smart ones are probably doing so already, although they may be doing so informally rather than as a structured part of the portfolio.\n\nThe only thing that could derail Bitcoin is government intervention. Governments are already making war on cash – could they close Bitcoin down? It seems more likely that they’ll reach some kind of co-existence with the currency, regulating trading, perhaps, but not outlawing it. In any case, government attempts to censor and filter the Internet have generally not been successful, so there’s no reason to think they’ll have the technology to be able to close Bitcoin down completely.\n\nIn fact, experts suggest some central banks may want to test their own digital fiat currencies – in other words trying to beat Bitcoin at its own game. That can only give digital currencies more credibility.\n\nThe elephant in the room, though, is the simple fact that when Bitcoin started, a minority of us had access to it. Now it seems pretty much everyone, even in developing countries, has a mobile, and most mobiles are fairly smart. Mobile payment applications are making great strides, particularly in places like Africa where existing financial infrastructure is poor. Couple increased smartphone penetration with the functionality and robustness of blockchain technology, and you have exactly the environment needed to make Bitcoin really take off.\n\nSo where could Bitcoin end up in terms of price? At the moment it’s trading at around $970, but most followers of the currency expect it to get to at least $1,500 this year, well above the previous high of $1,150 that it hit in 2013 before the Mt Gox collapse pushed the market into reverse. Some forecasts are even higher, with one brave analyst suggesting Bitcoin could hit $3,000.\n\nCover Image via wogker\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It just generated an invalid block.""\n\nIt’s afternoon in the ‘Miner in the World’ WeChat, one of the rare channels that bridges bitcoin\'s strained east-west communications divide. But the alarm isn’t being sounded by a miner. Rather, it’s from bitcoin developer Matt Corallo, and he’s up in arms about an issue many of his peers now believe could have accidentally split the $15bn economic network.\n\nCorallo quickly posts more links to explain the situation, which boils down to this: a bitcoin mining pool processed an invalid block that was rejected by other nodes and miners. As it happens block after block, day after day, the pool found the correct hash and broadcasted it to the network.\n\nIn short, it should have been able to retrieve the current block reward, earning roughly $11,000, but it wasn\'t able to.\n\nIn this case, the pool, Bitcoin.com, was running code that was different than most the network. Unlike all previous blocks, the block generated wasn’t 1MB, but larger.\n\nQuickly, someone in the channel pings Roger Ver, its owner.\n\n""I don’t know which versions of Bitcoin Unlimited are safe,"" Corallo continues. ""Their bug report seems to say anything before 1.0 is fine, but I don’t know.""\n\n""The bug?"" another asks.\n\n""The bug where it makes blocks which are ignored by the network and you lose 13 BTC,"" Corallo shoots back.\n\n""If SPV miner found block, BTC forked,"" a China-based miner adds.\n\nFinally, Ver arrives.\n\n""You could also look at it that Bitcoin Core has had a bug all these years with 1MB incorrectly defined. It seems like Core should have fixed that bug already,"" he says, going on the attack.\n\nTensions quickly flare and within minutes the thread mirrors that vitriol that has spilled across bitcoin social media sites for nearly two years.\n\n""Roger, this is getting ridiculous,"" another Core developer says.\n\nAnd there’s a growing chorus of bitcoin developers and users that agree.\n\n\'Bitcoin Jesus\'\n\nIf there was a single person who could have brought unity to bitcoin’s longest and hardest-fought debate, Roger Ver might have been it.\n\nAn early investor and ‘true believer’ of the technology, Ver began backing bitcoin-related startups at a time when the number of people interested in the idea could have fit into a tiny room. It was love at first sight, and he showed his adoration by throwing thousands of dollars a month into pro-bitcoin advertisements on more than 100 radio stations, even buying space for the first billboard promoting the cryptocurrency.\n\nHis passion for bitcoin made sense. After an unsuccessful run for California State Assembly in 2000 (and a stint of 10 months in federal prison for the illegal sale of what the US Department of Justice called \'explosives\' and what Ver called \'fireworks\'), Ver had developed a distrust of authorities.\n\nAs the price of bitcoin rose and Ver’s net worth grew, there were excited accounts of a charismatic libertarian who preached individual economic freedom.\n\nIt could be said Ver both gave the monetary movement a face that it didn’t have in bitcoin\'s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and that he helped further develop the ideology that the cryptographic network should be a digital cash, one out of the control of the powers that be.\n\nFor all this, fans gave him the nickname \'Bitcoin Jesus\', a Biblical charge that seems to hold as much significance now, even as his standing in the community has changed.\n\nScaling – the one true king\n\nFor those who have remained on the sidelines, bitcoin’s \'block size debate\' largely rests on two issues, one technological, the other social.\n\nOn the surface, it’s a battle over whether bitcoin’s developers should change a rather minute rule in the open-source protocol (the 1MB cap on the number of transactions the miners are able to approve).\n\nBut, to some, it\'s more philosophical, centering on whether this change would fit within the vision of its original inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nOn one side is Bitcoin Core, the group of developers working on bitcoin’s most widely used software. This group has advocated for code called Segregated Witness, which would boost transaction capacity (among other optimizations) but leave the contentious block size rule unchanged.\n\nEffectively, the change would provide the network with a capacity equivalent to a 2.1MB block size, advocates say. (Instead of changing the old rule (‘MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE’), a new variable (‘MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT\') would be introduced).\n\nTo proponents, Bitcoin Core’s philosophy is one that emphasizes creativity and safety.\n\nSegWit would use a mechanism called a soft fork to enact its change, meaning that those using the network would not be forced to pick between two competing versions of the software when an update is introduced. (The hard fork process would be similar to if, every time your iPhone needed an upgrade, your failure to do so would mean you were forever on another communications branch).\n\nAs highlighted by ethereum’s hard fork last year, such a scenario can be problematic. In the case of ethereum, there are now two versions of the open-source software, both running largely similar feature sets, but backed by different communities and cultures.\n\nIn bitcoin’s case, this divergence is already occurring, though as the Bitcoin Unlimited bug showed, it’s a fight that’s being carried out on the main bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThere\'s also an argument about a perceived over-centralization of the technology within the block size debate.\n\nFor bitcoin to be successful, some argue it needs to be widely distributed, meaning its infrastructure (nodes and miners) need to be anywhere and everywhere, free from mass corruption, influence, or exploitation.\n\nLarger blocks, Core argues, might dissuade some users from running full nodes which could lead to a small group of people having too much control over the network.\n\nThe gospel according to Ver\n\nVer’s argument essentially boils down to this: bitcoin needs to scale right now because of increased demand. And to do so, the block size should be bigger.\n\nA bigger block size, in Ver’s mind, will allow far more consumers and businesses to start using the protocol, making censorship through centralization a non-issue.\n\n""The best strategy to not have censorship, to not be controlled, is to have more people using bitcoin, so the government can’t just say it’s drug dealers using it,"" Ver said.\n\nBut, with Bitcoin Core unwilling to do the work (or introduce a proposal to the network), Ver has taken matters into his own hands, helping to collect more than $1m to fund alternative developers.\n\nVer’s mining pool is running this code (one that\'s also being run by a few mining pools that disagree with Core’s approach to scaling the network). It has proven to be controversial, and the issue last weekend found the Bitcoin Unlimited developer team has been accused of deploying ""untested and buggy"" code.\n\nBlockstream CTO Greg Maxwell argued that the code that introduced the bug didn\'t appear to have ""peer review of any kind"". Though, the error was fixed by the development team within a few hours due to monitoring.\n\nAccording to Blockstream CEO Adam Back, the worst-case scenario goes something like this: by using a process called \'SPV mining\', other pools began building on the invalid block sent out by Bitcoin.com for a time.\n\nEssentially, SPV mining meant that the miners were accepting blocks found by other miners without first validating whether they met the network rules. Should this have continued, Core’s team argues the results could have been far-reaching.\n\n“I think we’re lucky that they didn’t find a block. If they found a valid block on top of an invalid block, then they would have all got banned from the network, and we might have ended up with a sort of network split, where 60% of the miners are off on their own chain,” he said.\n\n“In short, the whole BU concept is fatally flawed ... and the fact that some miners are not even fully validating blocks compounds the problem,” developer Eric Lombrozo added.\n\nThe disciples\n\nYet, Ver has prominent supporters.\n\nOne is bitcoin miner and operator of the ViaBTC mining pool Haipo Yang. Yang is an operator of one of the newer mining pools, but has already generated complaints for his favored stance – that SegWit has little to do with scaling and that all the main devs should be fired.\n\n""As a programer, I believe the SegWit is pointless and very harmful to bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nYang argues that SegWit would change bitcoin more than other proposals. He believes there’s very little chance of a split, as Core claims, in the event of a hard fork because everyone wants to scale (with the exception of Bitcoin Core).\n\nWhen asked about Ver, he called him “a great man”, largely for the way he has stood up to the developers on the issue.\n\nAnother staunch supporter is Peter Rizun, the chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, who sees the issue similarly. “Bigger blocks are needed to allow bitcoin to continue growing, the same way it did for the first seven years,” Rizun said.\n\nAccording to Rizun, Bitcoin Unlimited is merely stripping the protocol of its block size limit that was implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010.\n\nEveryone involved acknowledges the limit is largely arbitrary, and that it was merely intended to act as a throttle for the network.\n\n“The limit is now having an economic effect and isn’t serving the role Satoshi had in mind,” Rizun continued, throwing in another appeal:\n\n“At Davos, I heard people were making fun of bitcoin as not being serious because it can only process three transactions per second.”\n\nLies and ethics\n\nBut just how much data science is involved in the debate remains unclear.\n\nAs with the ongoing “fake news” scandal in the political world (where the public largely remains awestruck at the discord), only a handful of people in the world perhaps know bitcoin’s inner-workings enough to really understand the issue or evaluate proposed code.\n\nOne difference is the experience level of those involved. Bitcoin’s Core team boasts researchers who have been actively deploying code for nearly a decade in a hostile, real-time environment. The other side argues it\'s more passionate, resourceful and that it more clearly understands the vision.\n\nBut there could be indications in how the groups are carrying out their messaging.\n\nVer contends that bitcoin-based businesses are struggling with network inefficiencies, and that’s why more exchanges are adding support for alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe points to Coinbase, Xapo and Blockchain as businesses that will be negatively affected by bridling the block size (though, none of those companies seem as passionate as Ver about alternatives to Bitcoin Core’s proposal).\n\nXapo president Ted Rogers said the company isn’t evaluating the scaling debate, while Blockchain’s vice president of growth, Liana Douillet Guzmán was cautiously optimistic about the solution put forward by the core developers.\n\n“I’m hopeful that SegWit in concert with Lightning Networks (like Thunder) can help remedy a lot of the current backlog, but we won’t know the impact, if any, it will have until SegWit is deployed,” Guzmán said.\n\nStill, Ver alleges other mainstream businesses are being dissuaded from using bitcoin.\n\n“I know a company with over a 100 million users that put their bitcoin integration on hold because [the network] wouldn’t handle its scale,” Ver told CoinDesk. “That’s really frustrating to me as someone that has done everything I can to get more people to use bitcoin.”\n\nVer declined to provide the name of the company, but it’s worth examining the claim.\n\nEven if said enterprise integrates bitcoin, it doesn’t mean all of its users will immediately start using the functionality. According to Ver, though, more enterprises would offer an on-ramp into bitcoin were it not for network congestion, long transaction times and hefty fees.\n\nAlthough Ver’s claims have been found to be half-truths in some instances.\n\nFor example, Ver recently took to Twitter to complain that even when he paid the suggested $0.06 transaction fee on a $23,000 transaction, it hadn’t been confirmed 12 hours later. It was later found out that actually one of the transaction’s inputs suffered from transaction malleability (the issue that SegWit, the proposal favored by Core, is said to resolve).\n\nHe also took aim about paying a $75 transaction fee. And while he did pay that fee, Ver left out some important information, according to Bitcoin Core developer Todd, namely that the transaction was hundreds of times bigger than the average transaction.\n\nTo Todd, these white lies aren’t working in Ver’s favor:\n\n“What’s alienated him isn’t his support of big blocks, but his persistent dishonesty. His actions are not that of an ethical person.”\n\nBad Blood\n\nIt’s hard to say that Ver hasn’t gone to extreme measures to espouse his views.\n\nIn addition to running the Bitcoin.com mining pool and news portal, Ver operates his own channel on the popular social network Reddit. Called r/btc, the subreddit was started in direct response to censorship of certain views on r/bitcoin, the technology’s most popular forum.\n\nVer argues that he’s been censored from r/bitcoin on numerous occasions because he brings an opinion that doesn’t align with Core’s.\n\n“It’s pretty much impossible to reach consensus with all the censorship,” Ver said. “Core devs and those supporters are the ones doing most of the censorship, and we shouldn’t trust people that censor stuff to run a censorship resistant network.”\n\nBut Ver has been implicated in doing the same on r/BTC; (At the Satoshi Roundtable in Cancun, one of the forum’s former moderators even acknowledged that the platform has all but collapsed into an unreliable source of vitriol).\n\nFor all his supposed open-mindedness, Ver seems focused on selling rhetoric that drives discussion to a platform he makes money from advertising on.\n\n“The sad thing about all this is it’s so petty,” Todd said.\n\nWhile Core developers are largely critical, Ver seems of two minds about their work, on one hand reverting back to his pleasant, conquer-the-world-via-entrepreneurship persona even as he throws barbs and accusations.\n\nIn interview, Ver acknowledges that even Bitcoin Core has the protocol’s best intentions at heart, although in the next breath he contends all the Core developers should be fired.\n\n“They have absolutely and utterly failed to scale to keep up with demand,” he said.\n\nThe tensions seem partly economic. Armed with more users, Ver reasons, the price of bitcoin would increase, thereby liberating more people from traditional fiat monies.\n\n“That’s the measure we have for how many people see benefit there,” he said. “For bitcoin to rival the dollar or the euro, the price will have to be much higher than it is today.”\n\nA resurrection?\n\nDespite all this, however, Ver remains one of the more captivating proponents of bitcoin, advocating for what any of his supporters see as their stake in the network – and their vision for its use.\n\n“When I started using bitcoin more than four years ago, I was buying into a vision of a fast, cheap and global system that could be used by anyone, whether they are wealthy or financially disenfranchised,” said Jake Smith, general manager of Bitcoin.com.\n\nWhile others have technical appeals, Smith’s is unique in that it’s personal. To him, this is something he’s spent years of his life on.\n\nAnd it’s easy to sympathize.\n\nThere was a time when writing about bitcoin didn’t entail scouring through pages of reports issued by companies on incidents with their specific implementations at bitcoin\'s innermost layers.\n\nRather than being caught in a he-said, she-said game on minute technical issues, there were massive funding rounds, tales of user growth and grand plans to reinvent the financial system.\n\nBut, not everything has changed, and maybe that\'s another source of conflict.\n\n""I’m willing to put my money where my mouth is,"" Ver once said in a famous 2011 video, one where he bet $10,000 would outperform gold and silver by 100x.\n\nIt seemed crazy at the time, visionary in retrospect.\n\nOnly time will tell if this bet turns out the same.\n\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\n\nImage via cryptograffiti\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, are you actually outperforming the market?\n\nCryptocurrency is having a phenomenal year. In the past few months, Bitcoin price has climbed from the low $700s to $1,184.97 (CoinMarketCap.com), correct briefly at the beginning of the New Year and now seemingly continue its march upward.\n\nAltcoin gains are not to be ignored either, with some prominent altcoins nearly doubling or more in value (i.e. Monero, Dash and MaidSafeCoin). The less well-known altcoins are also seeing renewed interest, which has been accompanied by trading volatility largely absent in the prior months.\n\nMost notably, last week Pascal Coin rose from obscurity at a price of $0.015 to a peak value of $1.53, with a trough-to-peak growth over 10,000 percent. Furthermore, Pascal Coin daily trade volumes during this time ranged between $5 mln and $30 mln on Poloniex.com, liquid enough for traders to exit the market with enormous profits.\n\nCointelegraph discusses publicly available metrics for comparison.

Its composition includes weighted percentages of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and several other altcoins, which are rebalanced monthly.\n\nThe index composition is subject to its caretakers who select altcoins on a monthly basis, thus dampening its usefulness as a track of value.\n\n- Image courtesy of ICONOMI\n\nNevertheless, if you have profits less than 19.6 percent, you may want to consider buying their index token (ICNX) when it goes live next month.\n\nT&C 20 Index: 65.1 percent gain\n\nThe T&C 20 Index is positioning itself as the “S&P 500 Index of the altcoin market,” according to its managers. The index was created in April 2016 and includes approximately twenty altcoins weighted by market capitalization.\n\nAiming to be a long-term standard for tracking value in the altcoin market, the T&C 20 Index only occasionally alters its composition. While the altcoin market appears relatively stagnant in November, it now appears to be in the middle of a bull market, as the T&C 20 Index is up 65.1 percent.\n\nAlthough there is no publicly traded token that tracks the T&C 20 Index at this time, the composition of the T&C 20 Index is publicly available.\n\n- Image courtesy of T&C 20\n\nIf you are attracted to the altcoin market, you may want to consider matching the T&C 20 Index composition found on their website.\n\nSmith + Crown Index: 5.53 percent loss (one month period)\n\nThis market-cap based index includes 11 of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.\n\nAs the index has a Bitcoin dominance over 90 percent, it trends pretty closely to the performance of Bitcoin. Of note, the historical chart above only dates back one month, as this was the longest period they had publicly available.\n\n- Image courtesy of Smith + Crown\n\nIn summary, although the digital currency sector is still in its infancy, a few valuable financial metrics for evaluating market performance do exist.

That has been fundamental to every incremental innovation mproving lives. But there comes a technology once in several decades that redefines innovation and allows new technologies to get built on that. Internet was the most recent example of such technology until blockchain happened. What it can do? Well, in a nutshell it will make intermediaries – any institution, company or government body that governs transaction between two people or parties and store their information – either obsolete or transform them.\n\nThe technology behind bitcoin – blockchain is essentially an open-source decentralized or distributed ledger or database that records every transaction in a block, which is linked to other blocks. Think of it like a giant honeycomb running on every device in the world. Why it is Internet 2.0 is because unlike Internet, which is basically about sharing information in the form of content, blockchain allows you to share and store anything of value as Don Tapscott - one of the world’s most influential management thinkers and co-author of his recent book “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, BusinessThe technology behind bitcoin – blockchain is essentially an open-source decentralized or distributed ledger or database that records every transaction in a block, which is linked to other blocks.\n\nThink of it like a giant honeycomb running on every device in the world. Why it is Internet 2.0 is because unlike Internet, which is basically about sharing information in the form of content, blockchain allows you to share and store anything of value as Don Tapscott - one of the world’s most influential management thinkers and co author of his recent book “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World” – says be it money, any kind of intellectual property like a new technology, work of art, research work, and even votes.\n\nTHE EVERYTHING’ DISRUPTOR\n\nWhat makes blockchain so acutely disruptive is the data that every transaction, every comment, every click, every website visit, every Google search that we as consumers generate remains under our control stored in the blocks, secured via cryptography and timestamped, and traceable. This hasn’t been the case so far as all that information has been stored and used by the intermediaries to monetize them. This means we don’t have control over what is ours. Prime examples of this is search engines like Google, social media platforms like Facebook, banks, governments, e-commerce businesses, technology companies or any intermediary that gets any information about you and use it for advertisements, promotions to make money or track our spending and keep an eye on us in case of governments. In short, our privacy is screwed.\n\nBlockchain in this situation takes the concept of peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of things to a whole new level. For e.g. if I have to pay for a product that I bought from someone, so instead of paying him/her offline or online and hence passing on my information to the bank, I can allow the other party to directly take that money from my blockchain by giving him/her access to only that much amount via a validation step like a one-time password.\n\n“Like Internet or Wikipedia, blockchain is not owned by any single company or government. You will not be dependent on Googles and Facebooks of the world that owns your data. What if nobody owns or stores that data – this is what blockchain can do,” says Kunal Nandwani, Founder and CEO, uTrade Solutions. Based in Chandigarh, the start-up that offers trading softwares, in around mid 2016 launched its blockchain solution, uClear, for real-time clearing of contracts in financial markets. Any exchange or trading market can clear and settle trades after execution through a private blockchain. uTrade also launched its blockchain arm, HashCove, in April last year for building and designing end-to-end solutions in blockchain. Nandwani is also an angel investor with Chandigarh Angel Network.\n\nBLOCKCHAIN FOR ALL\n\nOne of the blockchain use case uTrade is working on is Know Your Customer (KYC). “If I have to buy a new mobile number, an insurance policy or open a bank account, I will have to give all my details to the company. What if I put all the necessary documents on a KYC blockchain platform and allow the bank to access my details,” adds Nandwani. This will save time and effort for verification every time you buy something that needs verification.\n\nFinancial services is where the biggest impact of blockchain will be, as the Reserve Bank of India and other banks being the repository of customer information will not be required. But on the other hand, it offer opportunity to re-imagine the business model for its banking infrastructure, transactions and settlements. Last year, ICICI Bank was the first to experiment blockchain as a pilot project to “exchange and authenticate remittance transaction messages as well as original international trade documents related to purchase order, invoice, shipping and insurance, among others,” the bank said last year. From few days, blockchain simplifies it to few minutes.\n\nLast month, Mahindra Group also announced co-developing a blockchain solution along with IBM to rework its supplier-to-manufacturer supply chain finance business, wherein each party in the process will update their part of the process. “This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain,” an IBM release stated. TCS and Infosys are also launching solutions around it.\n\nSimilarly for healthcare, all the records can be kept in a blockchain for accessibility in a decentralized way where no intermediaries like Practo own that information. In real estate too, a seller of a property can receive payment and transfer documents via blockchain.\n\n“Blockchain adoption will be mass scale. Hence start-ups will benefit as it caters to various industries. They will clearly see upwards of 30-40 per cent of savings once blockchain is implemented,” says Rajesh Mirjankar, Managing Director and CEO, InfrasoftTech – a Mumbai-based software development company for banks and other financial institutions.\n\nGREY AREA?\n\nCurrently no law governs blockchain. The technology is new; hence regulators are expected to come up with some guidelines once there is a visible impact. “It is like Internet in which first everybody showed confidence then it came to the banking sector. Had it been vice versa, everybody would be scared. That’s what happened with blockchain,” says Subash George Manuel, Founder, Bee One and CryptoCarbon. Manuel is an international attorney and a blockchain legal consultant.\n\nAs blockchain gradually picks up the challenge of lack of awareness and knowledge will be mitigated. Currently, there is no consortium or association for blockchain in India, however Arifa Khan, London-based blockchain researcher and CEO of Zero Field Labs that does global conferences and workshops on blockchain has been talking to RBI for setting up Blockchain India Council.\n\n“Awareness is the big issue because people must know whether there is going to be a tradeoff between privacy and different benefits that blockchain offers or whether it is all benefits. Also, many people don’t understand blockchain as a concept,” says Khan who last month hosted first blockchain summit in India. She adds, “I am planning with banks and financial institutions and had discussion with RBI for this. It will take some time for the council to come up.”\n\nOne might expect for next Googles of the world to emerge from blockchain even as it will take at least five years for adoption and to scale up. To sound little far-fetched, we might never need any currency or any intermediary in next 50-year time.\n\n(This article was first published in the January issue of Entrepreneur Magazine.

Franco Amati, co-founder of the Buenos Aires Bitcoin center, details the company’s continuing struggle in the city:\n\n“On the judicial front, Buenos Aires’ city prosecutor tried to put local Uber directors in jail. The judge denied the charges, but she agreed to try to block the app's access, and that should happen in a few days if Uber's appeal is not accepted.”\n\nUber’s continuing struggle in Buenos Aires\n\nUber, meanwhile, has argued that the block has no legal standing, stating that the city of Buenos Aires has no legal authority to decide the company’s legitimacy for the entire nation of Argentina. Amati points out that while there have been blocked sites in the country before, there has never been a situation like with Uber:\n\n“Internet blocks happened before in Argentina with The Pirate Bay and a few more examples, but they worked by instructing local ISPs to block those sites at their DNS servers, or blocking specific IP addresses. If that's the case, no one knows what will happen.”\n\nDaniel Alós, the local organizer for Blockchain-based ridesharing startup Swarm City, believes that Uber is too strong to be going anywhere:\n\n“I don't think Uber would leave Buenos Aires. There are many powerful forces fighting Uber here. The taxi union has hired the best lawyers in town to suit them in the local courts, along with the government stand on the taxi camp. But Uber is a 60 bln dollar company. If they want to stay here, they have enough resources to fight back for a long while.”\n\nBitcoin, prepaid cards and cash help Uber get around the card ban\n\nIn an effort to block Uber from operating in the Buenos Aires area, local card companies, under government pressure, have halted service to the ridesharing company, making payments by regular Argentinian cards impossible. Amati points out how Uber has gotten around this ban by incentivizing prepaid card use, including Bitcoin debit cards:\n\n“Local credit cards and even Neteller cards are still blocked. Meanwhile, Uber renewed the existing 25 percent discount on foreign prepaid cards and sent an email to local users mentioning many of them, including Bitcoin ones like SatoshiTango, Xapo and ZapZap.”\n\nHowever, according to Amati, the situation recently changed to allow cash payments for rides, further decreasing reliance on older payment methods:\n\n“But a week ago Uber started accepting cash for all users, so the situation changed for many users that considered getting a new card or Bitcoins was too much of a hassle.”\n\nUber’s centralized model may become problematic long-term\n\nUltimately, while Uber’s problems with governments may stem from its transformational approach to the taxi industry, it may continue to run into problems because of its large size and centralized structure. Alós believes that smaller organizations provide less visibility to state agencies seeking to regulate ridesharing:\n\n“For sure a less centralized ridesharing operation would be a smaller target. That's what we are trying to build. But a Blockchain-based ridesharing system, it’s not an easy task. It's going to take time.”\n\nAmati also sees problems down the road coming from Uber losing ground to regulators:\n\n“I believe that future regulations will make Uber operations difficult in the future. As an example, bureaucrats may try to mandate reports on all trips from all users (we have experience on that in Argentina with SUBE, the public transport card) and that will create more incentives for decentralized technologies and privacy-minded solutions.”\n\nBeyond company troubles, however, drivers, at the bottom of the ridesharing pyramid, end up suffering, even when Uber itself prospers. Christopher David, CEO of ridesharing startup Arcade City, sees this corporate structure as a problem that will be solved by the sharing economy:\n\n“Uber often yields to government pressure and screws people over in the meantime. We saw that firsthand in Austin after Uber abruptly pulled out just to make an example. Thousands of rideshare drivers were out of a job and riders who relied on Uber became stranded without transportation. Any corporation that would flip a switch to deny service overnight to thousands of users is a dead company walking. Obviously, the sharing economy of the future will be shaped by decentralized networks owned and operated by the participants themselves, not morally questionable corporations with armies of lobbyists and tight ties to the government.”"", 'On Jan. 26, the center for innovations and technologies Digital October in Moscow hosted a conference dedicated to the Regulation of Cryptocurrencies in Russia.\n\nThe event welcomed more than 250 participants - founders of Fintech startup companies, businesses interested in the integration of Blockchain technology into their operations, members of the Blockchain community and state authorities who are keeping their eyes on the trends in the development of this still bizarre phenomena.\n\nConfusing statements\n\nWithin the last few years, the problems surrounding the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia has been discussed many times. State authorities have gone from an intention to ban cryptocurrencies completely and impose legal sanctions to all involved in transacting with cryptocurrency to an initiative to create an offshore cryptocurrency zone.\n\nIn November 2016, the Federal Tax Authority published its first document addressing the issues surrounding the regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn December 2016, Deputy Chairman of the Bank of Russia Olga Skorobogatova announced that the bank was planning to suggest a few changes to national legislation in order to facilitate the process of development and integration of new technologies, including financial technologies and Blockchain.\n\nA few days later, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said that the Ministry of Finance was expecting an enactment of a bill banning exchange operations with the national Rouble and cryptocurrencies, no earlier than in the Autumn of 2017.\n\nIn January this year, however, we have seen an announcement from the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian Financial Monitoring authority that cryptocurrencies do not represent a threat, therefore, it would not be fair to rush the ban of something which has not been explicitly studied, and instead observe the international practices in this field.\n\nAs a result of all these rather confusing statements, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Russia remains unclear. Therefore, the main objective of the conference was to shed light on the current state of regulation of digital currencies and create a platform for discussion, as there are numerous questions to be answered.\n\nFrom strict ban to discrete permission\n\nLegal Consultant at Deloitte in CIS countries Ksenia Osipova opened the conference with a brief overview of how the attitude of state authorities towards cryptocurrencies has been changing in the last few years. Thus, within the last three years, the general mood of regulators has changed from strictly prohibitive to discretely permissive, which is demonstrated by the recent open letter from the Federal Tax Service discussing the status of cryptocurrencies. Generally, the letter says that everything, what is not prohibited, is allowed. Osipova explained:\n\n“The very fact that this general idea was delivered in an open letter, rather than in an official resolution is very relieving. According to the letter by the Federal Tax Authority, we can conclude that, first, cryptocurrency transactions are not prohibited, and second, that cryptocurrencies are not defined as quasi-money, which was discussed last year.”\n\nMoreover, the letter mentions the similarity between cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies and compares it to currency valuables. The latter represents a unit which can be used for transacting. Osipova said that we can expect the introduction of official regulation policies in the near future, which would address issues related to the use of cryptocurrencies for illegal purposes and money laundering.\n\nToo scared to take initiative\n\nElina Sidorenko, the head of the working group at the State Duma exploring digital currencies, explained that to this moment, state authorities decided to take a break and look at how other countries are dealing with this issue, so as not to provoke any adverse effects from hasty initiatives.\n\nShe said:\n\n“Everyone is waiting for others to make the first move.”\n\nSidorenko agrees with Osipova in that we will see the introduction of official regulation policies addressing cryptocurrencies and Blockchain initiatives most probably by the end of this year.\n\nGenerally, Sidorenko emphasized the warming and liberalization of regulator’s attitudes towards cryptocurrencies. She explained that nobody intends to completely ban the use and operations of cryptocurrencies, however, there are many nuances that should be cleared up in order to ensure that the existence of cryptocurrencies in Russia is secured from a legal point of view:\n\n“Technology cannot exist in a legal vacuum, to ensure its development we need to create a space of legitimate freedom for it.”\n\nSpeaking about the regulation of Blockchain, Sidorenko said that soon we will see the development of the model of standardization. In this case, Sidorenko said that nobody is talking about the introduction of bans and restrictions but that it is more about verification, standardization, licensing and defining areas of responsibilities.\n\nWho is interested in shutting Bitcoin down?\n\nAlexander Ivanov, founder and CEO at Waves, discussed the experience of other countries in regulating cryptocurrencies. Speculating further, he suggested that it is even possible to shut down Bitcoin - with enough resources and strong political will.\n\nHowever, to this day, no one sees any interest in doing so. Ivanov said that Bitcoin is officially restricted only in Iceland, Ecuador and Bolivia, while other countries are trying to define the status of cryptocurrencies and find ways to deal with them.\n\nIvanov also announced the establishment of the first Russian consortium of Blockchain businesses. Waves and financial group Solvena are among the members of the consortium. Viktor Nasochevsky, the founder of the payment system Rapida, has been announced as the chairman of the consortium.\n\nDimitry Bulichkov, head of the Center for Technology Innovations at Sberbank, gave some hints about the bank’s pilot projects seeking to deploy the Blockchain technology and the potential of this tech. He said that, currently, projects revolving around Blockchain tech are focused on the development and testing of prototypes for interbank communications and the automatization of documents processing.\n\n\u200b\n\nBulichkov also mentioned Sberbank’s plans to develop its own digital tokens to use for an interbank payment system.\n\nAlexey Arkhipov, CTO at Qiwi, stated that the company is still working on Bitrouble and that the project is currently in a reconfiguration phase and most probably will be released later this year.\n\nSharing his impressions, Alexander Ivanov, who was one of the organizers of the conference, said:', 'Most investors and users of bitcoin are looking at the long-term growth of bitcoin as a technology, protocol, network, and a store of value. Not a large population of users are relying on bitcoin to make a fortune out of short-term surges and price trends.\n\nIn online bitcoin communities and at roundtable discussions, investors often demonstrate their concerns in regards to the performance of bitcoin, sustainability of its value and the long-term health of bitcoin. Some worry that bitcoin could be overtaken by an alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) in the future.\n\nThere exists six main performance indicators shared by investor and journalist Trace Mayer investors and users can refer to in evaluating the performance and well-being of the bitcoin network. These indicators include bitcoin transactions, price, hashrate, bitcoin wallets, trading volumes, volatility.\n\nTransactions, Wallets & Volatility\n\nOver the past two years, the rate of volatility of bitcoin significantly decreased. As emphasized by experts including Mastering Bitcoin author Andreas Antonopoulos in the past, low volatility is crucial for bitcoin to establish itself as a currency.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin is used and perceived as digital gold. A large number of users are utilizing bitcoin as an efficient store of value that enables the facilitation of large transactions in a secure and decentralized ecosystem. To put it simply, the vast majority of users view bitcoin as a financial network which makes previously inefficient, expensive and impractical transactions easier.\n\nFor bitcoin to gain mainstream adoption and to be used as an actual digital currency, it needs to reflect low volatility rates as seen in reserve currencies. At the moment, bitcoin is yet to maximize its monetary supply so the value of bitcoin will increase exponentially in the future. An increase in price is still considered volatility, as it means it is fluctuating in price. As Antonopoulos stated before, “Volatility is bad even when it’s going upwards.”\n\nIt can also be claimed that the decreasing volatility in bitcoin and increase in stability has led to a larger user base of bitcoin. This explains the exponential increase in the number of bitcoin wallets, as the world’s most popular bitcoin wallet service provider Blockchain.info is set to reach 12 million wallets in the upcoming months. Just last year, there were less than 5 million wallets in circulation.\n\nThe increase in the number of bitcoin wallets naturally led to larger sums of transactions. In comparison to around 200,000 daily transactions in early 2016, transaction volumes in February are close to 360,000, 1.8x larger than daily transaction volumes of last year.\n\nHashrate, Price, Trading Volumes\n\nThe vast majority of traders and investors of bitcoin are captivated by the short-term growth of bitcoin that they often fail to recognize the long-term performance of bitcoin price.\n\nWhile the price of bitcoin plunged to $785 earlier this year, currently, the average trading value of bitcoin is $1,020. That is a price 25% higher than the second highest peak reached in 2016 and nearly 6% higher than the highest price reached last year.\n\nAlthough the price of bitcoin slumps when government agencies like the People’s Bank of China issue warnings or other forms of harsh regulations on bitcoin, it consistently bounces back. This can be attributed to the continuous increase in trading volumes in the bitcoin exchange market. As seen in the provided by Trace Mayer, the trading volumes of bitcoin have increased significantly over the past three years.\n\nConclusively, increasing demand, user base, trading volumes, and price of bitcoin is being supported by the exponential growth of the bitcoin network’s hashrate.\n\nImage Via: PT\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Venezuelan authorities destroyed a bitcoin mining center in Valencia in Carabobo state, the most recent action taken in an effort to clamp down on bitcoin-related activity in the economically ravaged country, according to criptonoticias, a Venezuelan cryptocurrency website.\n\nVenezuelan authorities arrested members of a Poland-based network after locating a shed with 11,000 bitcoins in Los Guayos in an industrial zone, according to the Bolivarian government of Venezuela website. The Bolivarian National Police (PNB) division against capital legitimation detected suspicious shipments entering a warehouse that contained bitcoin mining equipment. The investigation was conducted by a PNB commission in the state of Carabobo.\n\nA Criminal Network\n\nThe network used the bitcoin equipment in various parts of the country to legitimize capital, conduct computer crime, finance terrorism, engage in electronic theft and engage in fraud exchange.\n\nAuthorities arrested Eusebio Gómez Henríquez (51) and Andrés Alejandro Carrero Martínez (35).\n\nThe operations were camouflaged as Internet connection centers and a data center.\n\nGovernment action in various parts of the country continues against “criptomonedas” operations.\n\nPictures on the criptonoticias website show PicoStocks 100TH, a machine developed by PicoStocks and programmed by the Institute BioInoBank group of scientific and technological advisors. Both organizations are based in Poland.\n\nEquipment Taken To Venezuela\n\nMore than 14,000 of the bitcoin machines were available for sale in August 2015, of which 11,000 were acquired by Andres Carrero and transported allegedly to Venezuela, according to criptonoticias.\n\nAuthorities also recently dismantled another mining establishment of on the outskirts of Caracas, where they arrested four people, according to criptonoticia. The Corps of Scientific, Criminal and Criminal Investigations carried out the operation, claiming those involved washed money and stole the electricity to carry out the mining.\n\nIn late January, three men and a woman were arrested in the town of Charallave in the northern region of the country.\n\nThe arrests first came to light via an Instagram feed of Douglas Rico, director of the Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas Penales y Criminalisticas (CICPC), the federal police agency. The director’s social media post identified the apprehended as Néstor Rafael Amundaray Precilla (57), Ana Cecilia Farías Villanueva (25), Kevin David Ojeda Díaz (26) and Alberto José Zapata Orta (23), later confirmed by an official CICPC release.\n\nRico stated that the accused were operating “more than 300 [bitcoin] miners” from mining equipment manufacturer Bitmain before selling them in Cúcuta, a Colombian town near the Venezuelan border. Venezuelans’ activity in this Colombian border town has proven controversial for authorities as citizens engage in swapping bolivars to dollars, circumventing Venezuela’s currency controls. Essential commodities like food and gasoline are also smuggled into Venezuela through the border town.\n\nRico stated that the “consumption and stability of the electric service” in the place was affected due to the bitcoin miners. Despite the accusation, there are no further details about how bitcoin mining pertains to “internet fraud.” Similarly, there are no additional details of power consumption by the four who stand accused of electricity theft.\n\nAlso read: Destinia exclusively accepts bitcoin payments in Venezuela amid financial chaos\n\nWhy Venezuela Turns To Bitcoin\n\nAs the country reels from hyperinflation and an impoverished economy, many have turned to bitcoin as an alternative currency. Bitcoin miners have thrived, with fortunate miners and adopters using the cryptocurrency to import food and groceries from the United States.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have taken a hard line stance against bitcoin ever since hyperinflation struck in late 2014. A gray market for bitcoin has been in function ever since. In early January, the Venezuelan government, through a state-owned Internet service provider – the largest in the country – blocked access to bitcoin websites outright.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
02/06/2017,"['On January 1, 2017, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) published a new framework covering digital payments in the country. According to the new “Regulatory Framework For Stored Values and Electronic Payment Systems,” which is applicable to all electronic payment services providers, “all Virtual Currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited.”\n\n\n\nIn the new framework, the definition for virtual currencies that the central bank has identified is “any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a form of stored value.” This would suggest that bitcoin and other digital currencies have been officially banned by the UAE central bank as of January 1.\n\nHowever, on February 1, Mubarak Rashed Khamis Al Mansouri, governor of the UAE central bank, informed Gulf News in a statement saying that “these regulations do not cover ‘virtual currency,’ which is defined as any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a form of stored value. In this context, these regulations do not apply to bitcoin or other digital currencies, currency exchanges, or underlying technology such as blockchain.”\n\nHe added that digital currencies are “currently under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate.”\n\nIn the statement, Governor Al Mansouri further highlighted that fintech development will play an integral role in the future of the UAE’s financial industry, which is the reason why the new framework was introduced at the beginning of the year.\n\nWhile the new framework for e-payments and the confusion surrounding bitcoin regulations may sound worrying to some, the reality is that the UAE aims to become a leading center for blockchain innovation by 2020 and intends to become the first government to execute all of its transactions using the distributed ledger technology.\n\nTo achieve this goal, Dubai’s Crown Prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, launched the Dubai blockchain strategy to improve inefficiencies in governmental departments by eliminating paper transactions and by reducing the work hours involved in handling paper transactions. Furthermore, the blockchain strategy also aims to facilitate company incorporations for Emiratis, expats and foreign investors by creating a blockchain-based incorporation system.\n\nAs the UAE aims to become a leader in blockchain technology, it would be extremely surprising if its regulators would then stunt innovation in this area by restricting or prohibiting the use of digital currencies. Hence, any future bitcoin regulations in the UAE will most likely favor blockchain startups and the bitcoin economy.', ""Bitcoin is on track for an eighth straight day of gains as it trades higher by 1.4% at $1,026 per coin as of 7:28 a.m. ET.\n\nThe cryptocurrency 's winning streak comes amid wild start to 2017. Bitcoin rallied 20% in the opening days of the year, adding to its 120% gain in 2016 that made it the top performing currency for a second straight year. The gains ran bitcoin above the $1,000 level for the first time since November 2013.\n\nHowever, concerns that China was going to start cracking down on trading sparked a 35% plunge over a matter of days. But trade managed to bottom out near $750 and shrug off news that China's three largest bitcoin exchanges were going to charge a flat fee of 0.2% per transaction.\n\nThe current winning streak has tacked on nearly 15% and has bitcoin taking a run at the January high near $1,161."", 'Bitcoin price has experienced a lot of movement since the turn of 2017 while at the same time, governments and central banks have become more vocal on matters relating to the disruptive technology.\n\nBarely does a day go by without a government statement on Blockchain, Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. It is either the withdrawal of an initial ban, the introduction of a new ban, investigating the regulation or possible application of the technology among several other actions.\n\nApparently, governments seem to be under pressure to take a stand on Bitcoin and Blockchain, and this may have been the main reason why their regulators keep fluffing their lines over and over.\n\nBlockchain does not panic\n\nOne major factor that cannot be overlooked at this point is the rate of advancement within the Blockchain ecosystem. Every new day gives birth to another innovation or a new startup with big promise.\n\nConsidering the independence of the Blockchain industry, players seem to ignore the perceived lack of support from government authorities so far. At the same time, events within the ecosystem create the idea of a self-sufficient and self-sustaining community. This philosophy seems to generate a level of apprehension on the side of governments, hence their desperation to find relevance within the system.\n\nHow governments are going about their quest for relevance or not is entirely another issue. Looking at the actions of different regulatory authorities across the globe, several contradicting statements have been released, sometimes even by a particular government at short intervals, as observed in the UAE and Nigeria. These actions suggest a clear case of working under pressure or playing catch-up.\n\nBitcoin price matters\n\nPresident of Crypto Consultant, Jason Cassidy, identifies Bitcoin price as a major factor which attracts the attention of governments.\n\nCassidy says:\n\n“The price action of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies draws the attention of governments. From this perspective, expect more policy discussion during these price runs as the topic consistently hits the radar of officials and central bankers.”\n\nAccording to Cassidy, governments and banks understand that we are now quickly moving into a digital world, and that includes our money. Bitcoin and Blockchain have become hot topics over the last few years and with that comes some pressure to take a stance.\n\n\n\nCassidy notes that this is a learning process for virtually every traditional institution, therefore it is normal to anticipate an about-face stance over the next few years as political motivations along with general awareness dictate banking and governmental policy.\n\nTowards the end of 2016, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Adebayo Adelabu, implored the National Electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF) to work harder in an environment where players must either learn to swim or sink in the novelty tide of this new technology. This statement clearly suggests that governments have recognized that disruptive technology is here to stay.\n\nDespite the mixed reactions from governments of different nations across the world, one thing that has remained consistent is the progressiveness of the disruptive technology. It is indeed moving and it is moving very fast.', 'Speculation is growing about the consequences for Bitcoin if the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF gets regulatory approval in March.\n\nAfter almost four years of waiting, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is nearing its “yes” or “no” deadline of March 11 - and the consequences of a positive decision could be huge.\n\nAccording to the Cointelegraph twitter poll, about a third of the respondents believe that the Bitcoin price will reach $1,500 this month.\n\nWill Bitcoin reach $1500 by the end of this month? #CT_quiz — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 3, 2017\n\n$300 mln influx\n\nSpeaking to the Wall Street Journal, wholesale trader Bobby Cho forecast that markets would react to the sudden influx of investors. Previous estimates by analyst Spencer Bogart suggest that the ETF’s launch could add around $300 mln to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nBobby Cho says:\n\n“The market will feel the effect of authorized participants going out there and looking to source [$300 mln] 10 times more than the daily volume that goes through any of the exchanges.”\n\nThe Winklevoss’ instrument has faced more than its fair share of skepticism over the years, especially in the run-up to the SEC decision.\n\nBogart, who previously stated he thought the chances of approval for the Bitcoin ETF were “less than 25 percent,” added to the WSJ that its unorthodox structure could prove to be a further stumbling block.\n\n“I don’t believe there’s any ETF that trades in the U.S. where a single entity is the sponsor of the ETF, the provider of reference price for the underlying asset and the custodians of the underlying asset, and that is what the Winklevosses are proposing,” he said.\n\nConcerns about trading effect mount\n\nThe fund’s creators have stepped up their bullish tone on Bitcoin in recent months. In December, they described Bitcoin as “potentially the greatest social network of all” which “matches or beats gold across the board.”\n\nWith the latter view, they are not alone, with Vinny Lingham also advocating Bitcoin as a more useful investment tool than gold in the coming years.\n\nRegarding the ETF, however, further concerns shared by Cho, Bogart and other commentators focus on the relative malleability of the Bitcoin market. Large-scale investment moves could easily shift the market with every transaction, given the size of purchases common in the industry.\n\nWhat the effects of such an influx would be on Bitcoin price and volatility remains to be seen. Trading volumes have recently undergone seismic changes, however, after Chinese activity declined by over 90 percent following the introduction of trading fees by local exchanges.', 'GB, February 6, 2017 at 13:21 UTC\n\nOn March 13-14, The Blockchain Academy presented by B3 - Blockchain Business Board – moves to London. After The Blockchain Summit - November 11th 2016 - and The Blockchain Academy held at Politecnico di Milano in December 2016, B3 is continuing to improve its educational offering.\n\nB3 is conscious that with the advance of Digital disruption, it’s crucial to gain a proper understanding of Bitcoin and its underlying Blockchain technology to help leverage its full potential. ‘Distributed consensus’ without intermediaries or central authority could lead to disruption in Financial and Notarization services. The next step to such disruption leads to the Internet of Value (IoV), which already seems to be redefining the industrial, banking, and government landscapes. The application of cryptography in distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and tamper resistant records is going to play a vital role in any technological stack as well as in changing the history of money.\n\nParticipants will gain proper knowledge about Bitcoin and Blockchain as well as an understanding of how this technology fits into the existing economic framework. The Full Academy (2 days) is designed for those who want a comprehensive outlook on Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology: the first day is made of an introduction which covers most of the relevant topics that any C-Level exec would want to know. The second day provides an in-depth analysis of the most important technological breakthroughs made possible by Blockchain.\n\nThe proposed approach of The Blockchain Academy is that more than a technology this is a groundbreaking cultural paradigm shift. Participants will be able to study as well as practice what they will be listening from Ferdinando M. Ametrano who has been speaking about Bitcoin at Banca d’Italia, Italian Parliament Lower House, IlSole24Ore. Ferdinando was Chairman of the Host Committee for Scaling Bitcoin 2016 in Milan also.\n\nLast but not least, Garrick Hileman, Economic Historian at the University of Cambridge and London School of Economics, will be presenting the results of the Blockchain Research co-authored by Vincenzo Morabito, Associate Professor at Università Bocconi and Founding Partner of B3.\n\nThe Blockchain Academy is the second educational event organized by B3 – Blockchain Business Board.\n\nWHO SHOULD ATTEND: C-level execs conceding that they need to properly understand what is going on, transaction bankers, regulators, innovators, payment institution managers, technologists, software developers, security experts, lawyers and notaries interested in the digital domain.\n\nWHEN AND WHERE IS IT: 13/14 March 2017 Tower Room – London & Partners\n\n6th floor, 2 More London Riverside, SE1 2RR, London (UK)\n\nEVENT BROCHURE: Get all the relevant info here\n\nAbout B3 – Blockchain Business Board\n\nB3 is an International Research Program that aims to explore and share how existing business models could evolve in line with the improvements made possible by the Blockchain technology.

The program was first reported by CyberScoop.\n\nFor bugs that aren’t as critical, admins said they would offer 1 BTC, with 0.05 BTC being put up for display issues and other minor problems.\n\nThere are rules for the program, however.

The founder of Kuaidi, a major Chinese car-hailing service that merged with DiDi, and a big global bitcoin holder are amongst the backers.\n\nIt was through this network that US$1m was raised last year to kickstart that the Singapore-based project, which has the ambitious goal of becoming the ‘Blockchain of China’ no less.\n\nHaving previously announced plans to meld the Bitcoin protocol with Ethereum technology, they are now launching the first ‘Proof-of-Stake’ smart contracts platform. It is all part of what the developers behind the project hope “can disrupt entire business models” by spawning a series of ideas and engagement with enthusiasts.\n\nThe Backers\n\nA group of ten major backers have provided their financial support and opened up their network of connections to help accelerate development of the Qtum technology and infrastructure around it. However, the identity of the top accountancy firm helping with the project\'s governance structure remains undisclosed for now.\n\n“All of our investors are strategic backers as well as financial backers,” explained Patrick Dai, the 27-year co-founder of Qtum (pronounced ‘Quantum’). It is the Qtum Foundation, established last November and headquartered in Singapore, that is the decision-making body driving the project’s development.\n\nBy any measure we are talking to some big hitters on the investment scene when looking down the list of the protagonists supporting Qtum’s endeavours.\n\nAs well as Chen Weixing, the billionaire founder of Kuaidi being in the fold, there is Anthony Di Iorio, Ethereum founder and CEO of JaxxWallet; Jeremy Gardner, co-founder of Augur and EIR at Blockchain Capital; David Lee Cuo Chuen, founder of Left Coast, Libai, and DLEE Capital Management.\n\nThen there is Bo Shen, General Partner at Fenbushi Capital; Jehan Chu, Managing Partner at Jen Advisors; Qingzhong Gao, director of Huawei Strategic Cooperation; Xu Star, OKCoin CEO; Lihua Yi; and, Partner of ZhongWo Investment. Add to that Xiaolai Li, one of biggest bitcoin holders in the world and a Blockchain Angel backer.\n\nDai, a Computer Science PhD candidate at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, commenting on the level of investment attracted said: “We raised more than we originally intended to get the project started.”\n\nHe added: “But since these backers were able to provide a great deal of technical and strategic support, we saw it as very beneficial to the project. This has enabled us to hit a few major milestones before our crowdsale.”\n\nA former Alibaba senior product manager, Dai told Forbes that funds from this crowdsale will be used to develop the technology and “enhance the usability of the platform”.\n\nHe asserted: “Qtum is committed to creating a globally influential open source community by co-operating with other blockchain communities, third-party developers and technological innovations.” Their ultimate goal is to bring blockchain technology into industries spanning finance, social, mobile, the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as other sectors.\n\nWhile they clearly want to the community to be involved in helping develop this platform, Qtum has yet to decide on a date for its crowdsale.\n\nAs a combination of Bitcoin Core, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the end product of Qtum Blockchain is Qtum Core, which will allow smart contracts to execute on a PoS consensus model.\n\nA major Qtum goal is to build a so-called Value Transfer Protocol, which along with decentralized applications (dapps) can be used to support and enhance various industries. Another goal is to maintain compatibility with existing processes from Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be as secure as possible and to be used not just in the finance industry.\n\nWhile Qtum can in theory be used just like Bitcoin to send and receive digital currency - except for the PoS modifications - the real power of Qtum centres on the Smart Contract system.\n\nWhat’s The Interest?\n\nMany consider Qtum to be the top team coming out of China given their industry expertise and enterprise interest. “Our backers like the fact that we have taken into consideration what has and has not worked for blockchain technology…and they see us building from there,” he said. And, the pioneers and the backers aim to make this technology extremely usable going forward.\n\nDai added: “There is high demand for China to have its own blockchain and our objective is to be the blockchain of China and gradually advance from there to be one of the top technology platforms in the world.”\n\nThe team at Qtum alongside Dai includes Jordan Earls, Qtum Core developer, and Neil Mahi, Qtum Blockchain Architect. Earls, who has been developing software since he was thirteen, reviewed over 100 altcoins and identified multiple exploits in coins.\n\nMahi, who has Master’s degree in Business Administration from ISCAE but specialized later on in computer science, has around twenty years’ experience developing software and four years’ experience in the blockchain space. There are also former employees from some China’s biggest companies including Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in the team.\n\nBitcoin Core Protocol\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Qtum is an open-source value transfer protocol and decentralized application platform, which is boldly touted as an “elegant new paradigm” combining the stability of the Bitcoin Core protocol with an enhanced version of the EVM called the Qtum Virtual Machine (QVM).\n\nSome have expressed the view that it is basically just another bitcoin fork with extension to the bitcoin scripting language and a new altcoin platform. The founders counter those claims.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin Core is the most thoroughly tested blockchain code in the world, with billions of dollars of trust within the network and millions of dollars spent each year for the developers to maintain and enhance it, “unfortunately bitcoin is limited in what it can do with its simple script language” according to Dai.\n\n“Primarily it’s used for sending value. On the other hand, ethereum allows for many use cases; but the source code is not as stable and secure as bitcoin’s source code,” he explained.\n\n“The new paradigm of Qtum is where we bring the new industry-friendly consensus with a stable, safe and scalable platform. Qtum is combining the best parts of bitcoin and ethereum,"" contended Dai.\n\nAs such it is claimed to be “consistent” with Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), as it is based on Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, while allowing real-time interactions with the QVM.\n\nAccount Abstraction Layer\n\nThis is said to be accomplished by using Qtum’s Account Abstraction Layer, which allows the QVM to operate on a stable and proven platform - without the use of Ethereum’s account model. (Note: The open source project integrates the EVM with Bitcoin’s UTXO model and aims to provide smart contracts to businesses worldwide).\n\nDai pointed out: “Bringing a superior version of the EVM to the UTXO model does more than just allow the standard smart contracts you can perform on Ethereum. And, we plan to expand on this in the next few weeks.”\n\nThis Smart Contract and Decentralized Applications platform is further held up as allowing developers to ""easily port"" projects from the Ethereum blockchain to Qtum’s. But one might ask how exactly.\n\n“All current ethereum projects can be easily ported to Qtum platform since the Qtum platform is compatible with EVM,” explained John Scianna at Qtum, who has worked for several startups included CoinPip and been following bitcoin since 2012. “The only thing a developer needs to do is to construct the states of contract and account based on the Qtum Account Abstraction Layer.”\n\nHe added: “We already have two community project. One is springemail (BiSMTP: Blockchain integrated SMTP), which we hope everyone will use their email as a wallet address, so people can send and receive cryptographic tokens through their email address. It aims to improve the usability of the blockchain industry.”\n\nLikewise Qloha, is another project that will integrate into WeChat’s new mini app platform whereby people will be able to send and receive tokens through WeChat. Both these projects aim to improve the usability of the blockchain industry.\n\nQtum’s Roadmap\n\nThe startup has revealed that it is “constantly looking” to implement not just what designs they have now, but also to ensure that the designs they are building will be extensible and work well as a foundation to build on for their future activities.\n\nWhile these are ""in-flux designs"", some ideas currently being discussed include: better and faster interactions with smart contracts from SPV wallets, making data feeds a ‘first-class citizen’ on the blockchain with efficiency and usability improvements and Automatic/periodic contract execution, plus enhancing side-chain support with smart contracts.\n\nThey have also not limited themselves one particular industry, which is why they have talked to many different potential stakeholders so that they could build an ""industry agnostic"" platform and not be oblivious to actual business needs.\n\nEmbracing Blockchain Technology\n\nQtum is a compatible community that according to Dai “embraces much of the best Blockchain technology available.”\n\nThrough the use of Oracles and data feeds, Smart Contracts can be made that allow anyone to take part in a living economy. This decentralized economy model under Qtum will be fully open sourced, meaning that any developer is welcome to review the code base completely.\n\nAn Oracle is a particular agent (i.e. entity, node or address) that is trusted by the participants in the blockchain. An Oracle network can be used to implement a system for off-blockchain computations and (total or partial) contract code execution.\n\n“Useful and exciting smart contracts operating on public blockchains may need or require to process certain data (e.g. financial, economic, business, meteorological, social) that is external to the blockchain (i.e. out-of-blockchain data),” Dai explained.\n\nFor example, the result of a smart contract execution could depend on external data such as exchange rates, the GDP of countries, temperatures in cities and sports scores amongst other data. The term data-feed refers to any system, procedure or technique used to fetch ‘off-blockchain’ data and feed it to a smart contract - or decentralized application - being executed on the blockchain.\n\n“Platform approaches based on a blockchain with a built-in virtual machine have the limitation that every node must execute (run) all of the smart contracts in real time, leading to slower speeds and redundant processing,” Dai stated. “Then, it’s possible that smart contracts that are computationally expensive would consume (take) an enormous amount of resources when being run on the blockchain.”\n\nTherefore, in such cases a full execution of the smart contract on the blockchain may not be the best choice. And, he indicated that it might be “better or even necessary” to run the contract or part of its source code off-blockchain, where computations can be done at a much lower cost.\n\nAlso, given the public nature of the blockchain - where data and computations are publicly visible - and the privacy requirements of many financial transactions, off-blockchain executions could be necessary to preserve the privacy of smart contracts data and transactions.\n\nBlockchain Ecosystem & Issues\n\nAs a promising ecosystem, Qtum Blockchain as well as combining the advantages of Bitcoin and Ethereum community it is said to address the “inherited problems” of existing blockchain systems.\n\nThese problems span the lack of business-oriented smart contracts in that the current smart contract platforms are mainly based on \'Proof-of-Work\' (PoW). However, according to a recently published Qtum whitepaper the “consensus mechanism of Proof-of-Stake is more suited for business applications.”\n\nThere is also issue of compatibility between different blockchain technologies. Bitcoin’s UTXO model, for example, is not compatible with Ethereum’s account model.\n\nOne can also add the lack of flexibility consensus mechanisms because of different participants. Requirements of consensus mechanisms in the public chains and permissioned chain are different,\n\nThen there is the lack of consideration for business compliance requirements (i.e. identity and KYC/AML requirements of the financial industry, which the current blockchain implementations cannot fully support).\n\nFurthermore, current blockchain systems are not open enough, with most of the triggering criteria for smart contracts being set on the blockchain itself. And, there are no triggering criteria from \'off-chain\' data sources, which can be used to build a connection with the real world.\n\nAs to when Qtum’s platform is expected to launch in 2017, the Foundation hopes to launch it this summer. The testnet is expected to be available in a few months’ time from now.', 'A small town located outside of Chicago is about to sell some bitcoins.\n\nThe village of Vernon Hills, Illinois, is currently in possession of roughly $10,000 worth of the digital currency, according to The Chicago Tribune. That amount, seized last year during a criminal drug investigation by local police and federal agencies, is set to be sold off in the days ahead. Local officials approved a plan to use Coinbase to sell the confiscated coins during a town meeting on 24th January.\n\nWhile not as flashy as one of the US Marshals’ bitcoin auctions or the $19m worth sold in Australia last year, the Vernon Hills story illustrates the questions local jurisdictions face when coming into possession of bitcoin following a criminal investigation. The village has a population of about 25,000 people, according to US Census data.\n\nThe Tribune quoted Vernon Hills finance chief Nikki Larson, who told town officials:\n\n""[Bitcoins are] used to facilitate transactions online, but because the village doesn\'t have a use for bitcoins we\'re recommending that the village share be accepted and then subsequently converted into US currency.”\n\nCuriously, it won’t be the last time that Vernon Hills receives a small windfall – which will be directed to local police coffers – from a bitcoin bust.\n\nIn the months ahead, local police are expected to finalize another criminal investigation that will involve a bitcoin asset forfeiture. As that process comes to a close, Vernon Hills officials will hold yet another bitcoin sale.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Raids, detentions, and public announcements have contributed to a general sense of unease for Venezuelans, as nearly a dozen people have been detained as authorities confiscated Bitcoin mining equipment from a number of different sites. Now, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the country, Surbitcoin, has announced that it has temporarily suspended its operations.\n\nSome exchange users had anticipated the suspension after the exchange’s bank, Banesco, discontinued the company’s corporate accounts last week. Others, however, were surprised by the Surbitcoin announcement, and have criticized the exchange for the way in which customers received notification. Rather than notify them individually, the first news that most customers received was via a post on Facebook. That notice was posted twenty-four hours before customers received official notification on the exchange website.\n\nSurbitcoin did advice its customers to begin using the Localbitcoins exchange for their digital currency transactions. Unfortunately, some of those customers will have to wait for Surbitcoin to locate another banking service provider before they can access their currency. The company estimates that it will need roughly two weeks to secure a new account provider.\n\nMeanwhile, many ordinary Bitcoin users have been unsettled by the ongoing crackdown. The Venezuelan government has been targeting mining operations with greater frequency, and its latest success netted 11,000 mining systems that are reported to have come from Poland. Authorities have been focusing on charges ranging from computer crimes and electricity theft to accusations that the miners are members of a larger international criminal entity.\n\nFor Venezuelan citizens who have looked to Bitcoin as a way to order food and other necessities from the United States, the current hard-line government position on Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining couldn’t come at a worse time. The socialist nation continues to suffer from impoverishment and hyperinflation, and many of its people struggle to find the basic necessities they need to survive.', 'The Dash cryptocurrency platform has received the latest upgrade, codenamed Sentinel. It will lay the groundwork for Evolution cryptocurrency payments system.Read more...\n\nDash, the seventh largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization has received a major software upgrade. The update codenamed Sentinel, also referred to as Dash ver 12.1 will serve as the foundation for an efficient decentralized payments system.\n\nThe upcoming decentralized payments system, codename Evolution will be first of its kind to facilitate cryptocurrency payments with negligible merchant fees and zero customer fees. It is a deviation from the current Bitcoin-based payments, where the people making transactions between wallets are forced to pay miner fees. The Dash-based Evolution payment system will also support instant transactions and comes with an integrated marketplace and an easy to use interface.\n\nThe Dash Sentinel upgrade adds new features to the platform. It also improves the existing backend protocols, governance, voting and privacy functions. The future Evolution upgrade, to be built on the latest version of Dash is expected to give a stiff competition to conventional payment processors like PayPal and Venmo. But unlike them, Evolution won’t involve any intermediary to facilitate payments between two parties.\n\nThe founder of Dash, Evan Duffield is quoted in the press release saying,\n\n“Evolution will profoundly change the user experience and expand the cryptocurrency market to users from all walks of life by making it easy to use and relevant to people’s lives. It’s my belief that digital currencies will never be the same after Evolution, in the same way, we would never consider going back to a text-only internet.”\n\nAccording to Dash, the Evolution payments system can be used seamlessly across devices, and it comes with a cryptocurrency equivalent of a hack-proof savings account that issues interest to users. In addition to the usual benefits offered by cryptocurrencies, Evolution will also allow users to integrate their regular bank accounts to facilitate fiat payments and settlements over Dash network.\n\nThe announcement of a Dash based payments system couldn’t have come at a better time. As Bitcoin continues to struggle with scalability problems, the cryptocurrency community is expected to look for alternatives and Evolution could be the answer they are looking for.\n\nRef: Dash Press Release | Image: NewsBTC']"
02/07/2017,"['These are the show notes for the Unchained podcast, sponsored by OnRamp. Listen to my whole interview with Spencer and Daniel here or on Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio.\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins known for their dispute with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and for their careers as Olympian rowers, are now proponents of bitcoin.\n\nThey run the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and have made investments in companies like 21 and Xapo through their investment fund Winklevoss Capital. (Learn more about their journey with bitcoin on my podcast Unchained via the show notes and the episode.)\n\nThree-and-a-half years ago, they filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, named the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, to trade under the ticker symbol COIN. The proposal has been updated around a couple dozen times, and the SEC has asked for public comments more than once and repeatedly extended the timeline on its decision.\n\nHaving run out of extensions, the SEC will make a call one way or another by March 11. Many in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community are bullish on the prospects for approval, while others are not. This week, on my podcast, Unchained, a bitcoin ETF optimist and pessimist discuss the likelihood of SEC approval (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio) — and along the way, touch upon bitcoin’s liquidity, what impact recent events in China have had on its trading, as well as proposals for bitcoin ETFs by other companies. They also describe what effect approval could have on the market for the cryptocurrency.\n\nSpencer Bogart, vice-president of equity research at Needham & Company, is the bitcoin ETF Eeyore of the episode. “I think we need to take into heavy consideration the general conservativeness of the SEC,” he says. “If you think of this just from a game theory aspect, if I work at the SEC and I approve this ETF and a lot of money flows into it and something goes wrong, there’s a very good chance I could lose my job over that. If I do approve and it goes extremely well, it’s very unlikely someone comes around to pat me on the back or give me a promotion.”\n\nIn a report released in early January, Bogart put the likelihood of SEC approval at 25% or less. In the episode, he also notes, “The very first task mentioned in the SEC’s mission statement is to protect investors, and the very last thing they mention is to facilitate capital formation.”\n\nThe episode’s bitcoin ETF Pollyanna is Daniel Masters, director of Global Advisors, which launched the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, the world’s first fully regulated bitcoin investment vehicle in 2014. Global Advisors also owns XBT Provider, an issuer of Nasdaq Nordic-listed bitcoin tracking certificates.\n\nMasters, who sees parallels in bitcoin to the early days of the commodities super cycle, says a number of the concerns around bitcoin have been addressed, such as its use in illicit activity, anti-money laundering issues, as well as questions around security.\n\n“Many of those risks have been ameliorated, counteracted and addressed by things like the [New York Department of Financial Services] regulatory regime [aka the Bitlicense, which is regulation specifically designed for cryptocurrency firms], by the anti-money laundering provisions that pretty much every decent [cryptocurrency] exchange has in place, which in some cases rise to the level of opening a banking account in terms of identification."" He also notes that sophisticated protocols and new hardware modules used for so-called cold storage, the process by which bitcoins are secured offline so as to protect them from theft and hacking, should also address security concerns.\n\n“There are enough serious people — banks, regulators, technology companies — all sorts of different players now in the space doing sensible things,” Masters says.\n\nIn the episode, we also discussed issues with bitcoin’s liquidity, especially now that trading volume plunged after Chinese regulators cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges in China, prompting three big exchanges to stop offering free trades and impose fees. “You have to pick poison here,” says Masters. “Are you concerned there isn’t enough bitcoin trading to support a bitcoin ETF because some of that is in China or are we now happy that the volume is much less in China and therefore it’s now more evenly balanced across the West?”\n\nHe personally thinks concerns about liquidity are overblown. Speaking of Global Advisors, he says, “We’re in the markets every single day — our assets are $40 million under management, and we have no problem moving those kinds of volumes around to suit our clients needs and perfect our hedging strategies.""\n\nBogart agrees: “There are certainly ETFs whose underlying markets are less liquid than bitcoin.”\n\nTune in to the episode (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio or web) to find out why Bogart thinks that SEC approval of a bitcoin ETF could cause at least $300 million in assets to flow into bitcoin in the first week (bitcoin’s current market capitalization is almost $17 billion); why Masters isn’t at all worried about liquidity for bitcoin; which of the bitcoin ETF filings the two think is best poised to win approval; and whether or not traditional ETF issuers will get in the game.\n\nThese are the show notes for the Unchained podcast, sponsored by OnRamp. Listen to my whole interview with Spencer and Daniel here or on Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio.', 'There has been a flurry of central bank activity recently spewing advice and cautioning citizens about virtual currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nFirst, it was PBOC and now the recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India’s central bank has come up with a press release that warns Indians about the dangers of dabbling in virtual currencies.\n\nRBI cautions holders and traders of Bitcoin\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2017, the Reserve Bank of India posted a brief press release on their website saying, “The Reserve Bank of India had cautioned users, holders and traders of Virtual Currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to, vide its press release dated Dec. 24, 2013. The Reserve Bank of India advises that it has not given any license/ authorization to any entity/ company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency. As such, any user, holder, investor, trader, etc. dealing with Virtual Currencies will be doing so at their own risk.”\n\nAs is clear from the central bank’s communique, they had also earlier issued a similarly worded caution way back in 2013.\n\nThe timing is the key\n\nWhat is interesting to note about the press release by the Indian central bank is the timing. The Reserve Bank carried out a botched demonetization on Nov. 8, 2016, which wiped out 86 percent of the circulating currency in India. Indian citizens had to endure months of pain afterward and there was a renewed interest in Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin is extracting a premium in India, at the time of the writing of this article 1 BTC was worth $1041 on Poloniex but on the Indian Bitcoin exchange ZebPay 1 BTC was worth INR$72,790 or $1080 approx.\n\nRecently the government of India presented its Union Budget and the Indian finance minister announced further curbs on cash which included a 100 percent penalty on cash usage above Rs.$300,000. This warning on Bitcoin comes just days after the penalty was announced.\n\nBitcoin is not illegal in India\n\nIt should be absolutely clear to anyone who is using Bitcoin in India that the usage of Bitcoin is not in violation of any of the country’s laws and the Reserve Bank notice does not affect Bitcoin or any other virtual currency adversely.\n\nWe talked with Kumar Gaurav, CEO Cashaa.com who says, “There is no major impact of this comment. Average consumers are still not involved in Bitcoin in India, yes a little pro consumers with extra cash are only looking for an alternate investment which can be highly liquid. And as they are pro, they know what they are doing and are willing to take risks.”\n\nRBI wearing its Capital Control Hat\n\nIndia has very strict capital controls in place. The infamous Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) imposes several restrictions on resident Indians who can’t hold foreign exchange in cash beyond $2000, in such times Bitcoin may be attractive to certain Indians who may not want to be subject to India’s cash limits or store their wealth in a depreciating rupee that has lost nearly half its value since March 2011 against the dollar.\n\nSo the RBI warning may also be the central bank exercising its capital control duties as Kumar Gaurav points out, “RBI has many responsibilities than just printing currencies and one of them is capital control measures. India has strict capital control rules and anything which will make it weaker, obviously not accepted by the central bank. But at the same time, India does not want to kill innovation; it does not want to ban cryptocurrencies - it wants to understand its effect more closely.”\n\nWhile the RBI may have been cautionary in its approach, the truth is that nothing has changed in India when it comes to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies except the fact that the central bank’s own actions have spurred more interest in alternatives to the Rupee.', 'It appears that the Venezuelan authorities have had enough of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nOver the past two weeks, police in the Latin American country arrested eight Bitcoin miners in three different cities. While some of them were accused of cybercrime and stealing energy, others were merely selling ASIC hardware. In addition to that, the country’s main exchange — Surbitcoin — had to halt operations, as the company’s bank closed their account.\n\n\n\nWhile the country’s economy is in a state of turmoil, and the national currency — the bolivar — has been in hyperinflationary free fall for some time, the socialist regime in the Latin American country subsidizes electricity to the point where it’s almost free. As covered in a popular article published on reason.com last November, this has made Bitcoin mining popular among some tech-savvy Venezuelans. Even yields from older, secondhand hardware can provide a lifeline to order food products and medicines from outside of the country.\n\nThere is no official law against Bitcoin mining in Venezuela, and using the digital currency is legal too: travel agency Destinia even decided to ditch the bolivar and exclusively accept bitcoin. Regardless, as the country has been plagued by scarce electricity and regular blackouts, it appears that (ab)using the cheap energy for the purpose of Bitcoin mining does not go down well with local authorities.\n\nIn what was the biggest bust of the past couple weeks, the Policía Nacional Bolivariana (PNB) raided a warehouse in Valencia, the third-largest city in Venezuela. As reported by reason.com, the building hosted 11,000 ASIC miners, which allegedly consumed enough energy for an entire village. The arrested duo has been accused of stealing electricity, but also of cybercrime, financing terrorism and exchange fraud.\n\nIn a separate case that same week, four people operating over 300 ASIC machines were arrested by agents from the Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas (CICPC) in the relatively small town of Charallave. Somewhat similarly, these four suspects were charged with electricity theft and internet fraud, Spanish-language Bitcoin news site CriptoNoticias reported. According to the director of the CICPC, the miners had affected “the consumption and the stability” of electricity service in Charallave, reported reason.com.\n\nAnd, perhaps the most notable case, the PNB also arrested two men from Caracas. As opposed to the other suspects, these men were not themselves mining Bitcoin. Rather, they attempted to sell mining equipment through MercadoLibre, an online marketplace. It is currently not clear what these men were arrested for exactly.\n\nAnd to top it off, Venezuela’s biggest bitcoin exchange, Surbitcoin, had to halt operations as well. According to Surbitcoin, the exchange received a notice from their bank Banesco on February 2 that their bank account would be closed the next day. The exchange says it is establishing a new commercial structure to prevent situations like this one in the future, and in the meantime recommends customers use LocalBitcoins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, trading volume on LocalBitcoins broke records last week, with 1.12 billion bolivars’ (approximately $337,000) worth of bitcoin exchanged.\n\nWhile it seems that Venezuelan authorities have increased the pressure these past two weeks, it is not the first time Bitcoin miners were arrested in the country. About a year ago, a Bitcoin miner was arrested and jailed for three months on charges of electricity theft. Unsurprisingly, most Venezuelan miners therefore keep their operations relatively small and hidden from authorities.', 'In a vote of confidence for a fledgling technology, the Republic of Georgia committed in a signing ceremony in Tbilisi on Tuesday to use the bitcoin network to validate property-related government transactions.\n\nIn April last year, the government and bitcoin hardware and software firm Bitfury Group launched a project to register land titles via a private blockchain, which is a tamper-proof ledger, and then to make those transactions verifiable using bitcoin’s blockchain, which is public.\n\nIt is the first time a national government has used the bitcoin blockchain to secure and validate official actions, signifying a vote of confidence for a technology still somewhat tainted by an early association with illicit activity.\n\nHaving so far built the software and tested it with a couple dozen land title registrations, Bitfury and the Georgian National Agency of Public Registry have now signed a new memorandum of understanding to expand the service to purchases and sales of land titles, registration of new land titles, demolition of property, mortgages and rentals, as well as notary services.\n\nThe Bitfury and Republic of Georgia initiative is just one of several collaborations aimed at creating blockchain-based land-titling services. (Such software is also being created in Sweden, Honduras and Cook County in Chicago with startups ChromaWay, Factom and Velox, respectively.) Peruvian economist Hernando DeSoto, who has also been involved in the project, has estimated that worldwide, the value of “dead capital” — in which people do not have legal title to their houses, cars and other assets — at $20 trillion.\n\nTea Tsulukiani, Georgia’s Minister of Justice, said in a statement, “We will be able to work with Blockchain technology from this summer [to] place real estate extracts in a totally safe and innovative system.""\n\nNAPR chairman Papuna Ugrekhelidze said in a statement that his department is “very pleased with the technical progress and looks forward to continuing [their] fruitful collaboration.”\n\nNoting that the Georgian government “like[s] how the work was done and how easy blockchain is implementable in the existing system,” Bitfury chief executive officer Valery Vavilov said in an interview that the changes were all made on the back end, and the only difference for Georgian citizens is that they can now check if a land title is legitimate (if it’s been entered into the system).\n\nCalling the work so far a “phase one, beta stage” and declaring that the software will be “fully operational” this year, he said, “The big goal is to move [the process] to smartphones, so people can use it 24/7 and all transactions are secured, transferrable and accountable.”\n\nBitfury has raised $90 million in funding, including a recent $30 million investment by Credit China Fintech Holdings.\n\nApplied to property, blockchain technology holds promise in several ways. In a blockchain-based ledger, records are time-stamped, as are subsequent changes to those records. This would allow enable people interested in a specific property to see and verify the date of past transactions.\n\nAdditionally, data on blockchains can be made private or public. In this case, the details of the real estate transactions are placed on a private blockchain network run by known computers, and then, in order for citizens to verify the authenticity of certificates, that data can be turned into a cryptographic “hash” that’s made public on the bitcoin blockchain which is run by thousands of computers worldwide. The hash is a type of digital fingerprint that enables anyone to verify that the data matches what’s on the blockchain without seeing the data itself.\n\nFinally, blockchain technology brings security to real estate transactions because there’s no central point of failure. The ledger is distributed among many computers, so a would-be hacker would need to simultaneously attack at least 51% of the network in order to fraudulently alter records.\n\nWhile many financial institutions and governments have expressed interest in blockchain technology, the vast majority of them have been pursuing private blockchains, some for reasons of privacy and some perhaps because of bitcoin’s early reputation as being the currency of choice for online drug dealers.\n\nHowever, Bitfury is working with the bitcoin blockchain both because it is public, for purposes of transparency, and because it is the blockchain that would be most difficult to fraudulently alter. Last summer, the company partnered with New America and the National Democratic Institute to create the Blockchain Trust Accelerator to work on pilot blockchain projects that have a positive social impact; the Georgia pilot is the accelerator’s first.\n\nTrust Accelerator cofounder and New America director of the Bretton Woods II program Tomicah Tillemann said of Georgia’s decision to use the public bitcoin blockchain, “Especially at a moment when there’s a global crisis of confidence in institutions, this is a powerful indication of their commitment to transparency and accountability.”\n\nThe MOU comes at a time when the future of the bitcoin blockchain is up in the air due to a longstanding rift in the community over how to expand the network to accommodate more transactions. The inability to come to an agreement raises questions about how long the network can be sustained if no process emerges for resolving stalemates. But Bitfury executive vice chairman George Kikvadze said the fact that there was no one at the helm of bitcoin was a strength. “Once you start centralizing it and making decisions fast, the whole point of security and the whole power of the trust protocol goes out the window. ”\n\nEventually, Bitfury plans to also help put notary services and smart contracts (programmable contracts that self-execute when certain conditions are met) for services such as escrow in Georgia onto blockchains. While many of the technology’s enthusiasts tout the potential for blockchain to improve notary services, processes for verifying the accuracy of information that gets placed on the ledger have yet to be established. However, Tillemann noted that Georgia’s property registration systems were ranked third best in the world by the World Bank, which bodes well for any future notary products there. “We have great confidence that the information coming into the system is valid. They have good controls in place to ensure it’s accurate, that they aren’t going to be registering erroneous data on the blockchain,” he said.\n\nOne of the advantages in the pilot, said Bitfury chief communications officer and accelerator cofounder Jamie Smith, was the strength of Georgia’s already existing software. “You want to be in a situation, especially in these pilots, to put the best systems on [blockchain technology],” she said.\n\nKikvadze said the choice of partner enabled the pilot projects to move forward more quickly and efficiently. “We found the right partner in the Georgian government,” he said, relating a story about how Tsulukiani has become so fascinated by blockchain that her assistants say that any time she has a free moment, she watches Youtube videos or takes online courses on blockchain technology.\n\n“If you think about this happening at a time when a lot of people are struggling to separate what’s real from what’s fake, this is a powerful tool to prove what’s real, said Tillemann. “Especially when you’re dealing with something as fundamental as your home or property, it’s important to have that added layer of security that’s provided by blockchain validation.”', ""News about immigrants, refugees and guest workers has received a massive amount of media attention of late. Amid this political clamor, questions are being increasingly raised about the future of cross-border remittances and monetary exchange. With this, a new book entitled “Reinventing Remittances With Bitcoin” aims to usher in the next new normal of cross-border financial transactions.\n\n\n\nWith a message directed toward Bitcoin enthusiasts, entrepreneurs and industry veterans, this compact 47-page read offers a deep dive into the emerging frontier of Bitcoin-powered remittance.\n\nThis book is chock-full of stories documenting innovative startups that have had a disruptive impact on this space since 2013. Replete with poignant use cases and data-rich insights, it offers a fresh look at an economic landscape that’s destined for an exponential growth spurt in coming years.\n\nWith the advent of Bitcoin in 2009 came its most obvious use case, namely, making the global transfer of money as simple as sending an email. The success of this has now informed the world of remittance, a billion-dollar market with profound implication for migrants and their families.\n\nAccording to a recent World Bank research report, the potential benefits are enormous for the 250 million global citizens that send $601 billion in remittances back home every year. But as the book “Reinventing Remittances With Bitcoin” suggests, there is still much ground that needs to be explored in terms of blockchain technology’s vast potential in this equation.\n\nThe book’s author, Luis Buenaventura, is a Filipino entrepreneur who has been building internet startups for over 10 years. Based in Manila, he has specialized in digital currencies, with a specific focus on the bitcoin remittance space since 2014. Over the years, he has presented on related topics at a number of conferences, including Inside Bitcoins, BlockFin Asia, the International Money Transfer Conference and the Brookings Blum Roundtable.\n\nWith his current startup BloomSolutions, Buenaventura helps money transfer businesses improve their processes through Bitcoin and the blockchain. He says he initially discovered Bitcoin back in 2014 in an attempt to identify a solution to low credit card usage rates in the Philippines (around 5 percent at the time) — an issue that had made it challenging to build an e-commerce business. He says that while Bitcoin wasn’t a great fit for ecommerce payments, it was a superior mechanism for cross-border value transfer. This, he says, is how he got started on the road of bitcoin remittances.\n\nHis new book is informed by remittance developments occurring in the Philippines, his home country. The number of Filipinos working abroad (the seventh largest among nationality groups of migrant workers around the world) registers at slightly more than 6 million (based on 2013 data). Remittances to families back in the Philippines were estimated at $29.79 billion, the third highest in the world.\n\nIn the opening chapter of the book, Buenaventura asserts that it’s simply not possible for a small Bitcoin startup to singlehandedly overthrow Western Union, MoneyGram or other major remittance industry players at this stage. He does, however, suggest the possibility of delivering a very compelling alternative to a small subsection of their customers. “Narrow your focus to the smallest possible problem you can solve, as the oft quoted startup saying goes,” he notes in the book.\n\nHe admits that while Bitcoin has a ways to go as a currency, it is extremely good at instant settlement. The book cites Bitspark in Hong Kong and Align Commerce as examples of companies that are currently facilitating the acceptance of fiat currency and converting that cash into bitcoin on the back end prior to transferring the funds to off-ramps in countries like the Philippines and Indonesia.\n\nIn breaking down this process, he explains the First Mile and Last Mile challenges and solutions; the former reflecting the remittance transaction origination point, and the latter the end point destination for the settlement process.\n\nCase studies on companies like BitPesa, Bitspark and Abra are widely interspersed throughout the book, along with topical coverage of themes such as “Does the Bitcoin Price Matter?,” “Bitcoin Regulation Around the World” and “Abra: The Uber of Remittances?” among others.\n\nHe brings the book to a close with a section entitled “Why Doesn’t Western Union Use Bitcoin?” Here, Buenaventura states that Western Union doesn’t need Bitcoin in its infancy stage, noting that the current unregulated status of digital currencies makes it a risky proposition for a publicly traded company.\n\n“I felt like we’ve gotten so caught up in how Bitcoin is performing as a speculative investment, that we've forgotten its usefulness in other regards,” Buenaventura said to Bitcoin Magazine. “The community has largely moved on from the initial excitement in 2014 around using Bitcoin as a remittance vehicle, and I wanted this book to reaffirm that it’s still happening, and it’s actually working successfully. The fact that 20 percent of the personal remittances flowing between South Korea and the Philippines is now powered by Bitcoin is a big deal, and it deserves to be recognized.”\n\nOn the ongoing crisis involving refugees and immigrants worldwide, particularly the terse climate between the U.S. and Mexico,and its potential effect on remittance markets, Buenaventura said:\n\n“While my familiarity is limited to what I read on the feeds, I will say that any time you attempt to restrict cash flow between countries, people will get creative. Maybe that will bring more people into the Bitcoin fold, or maybe it will cause them to stuff cash envelopes into their shoes when they travel. Maybe it’ll be a little of both.”\n\nHe laments that there are a lot of components involved when building a bitcoin remittance corridor between countries, which he says is the reason you can’t just throw up new corridors every other week. He cites as an example the difficulty in building a corridor between Malaysia and Nepal because there are no bitcoin exchanges that will allow you to convert your BTC into local currency on the receiving side. And he says that building such corridors in Papua New Guinea, Myanmar or dozens of other countries is even more challenging because the banking infrastructure isn’t homogeneous and doesn’t lend itself toward automation.\n\nNevertheless he remains optimistic about the potential of Bitcoin as a conduit for advancing the remittance movement worldwide. “The book is meant to act like a general guide for the whole business process. I’m hoping that it will awaken entrepreneurs in these disparate locales to try to solve these problems in their own backyards, and then hook up to the global bitcoin remittance network when they’re ready. The only way to get the whole world connected is if you have hundreds of startups all working on their own piece of the puzzle, because the challenges are deep and varied.

In 2016, investors made 132 investments in bitcoin and blockchain companies, fewer deals than in 2014, and an 18% drop from 2015′s high of 161 investments, said the report.\n\n2012 saw 5 deals total $1.3M in disclosed investment, and was followed by two years of steep annual increases, to 143 deals and $357M invested in 2014. In 2015 it increased to 161 deals with funding of $524 million.\n\nThere were four rounds which raised above $50 million rounds in 2016. This includes Circle ($60 million, Series D), Digital Asset Holdings ($60 million, Series A), Ripple ($55 million, Series B), and Blockstream ($55 million, Series A). But 21 and Coinbase still lead in terms of largest financings, having closed $111 million and $75 million rounds, respectively, in Q1 2015.\n\nA closer quarter to quarter look at funding of bitcoin and blockchain start-ups reveals that funding has gradually declined from $175 million in Q1 2016 to $87 million in Q4 2016.\n\nSome of the biggest investors in bitcoin and blockchain technology start-ups include Digital Currency Group, Blockchain Capital, Tim Draper, Pantera Capital, RRE Ventures and Y Combinator.\n\nWhile seed and angel funding continues to be the major contributor to these start-ups, it has declined gradually since 2013 onwards.

High volatility in the digital currency space has long been cited as a reason against adoption. But, as charts and analysis demonstrate, it is very likely that Bitcoin volatility is trending downwards, even as volatility in other cryptocurrencies remain high.\n\nThe Bitcoin industry generally highlights key indicators like price, transaction volume, bitcoin wallet numbers and trading volumes to underscore Bitcoin’s increasing popularity. All of these factors have jumped in recent years. But Bitcoin’s volatility has fallen, now sitting at approximately 5%. For comparison, gold volatility averages approximately 1.2% and major fiat currencies between 0.5% and 1.0%.\n\nDiminishing Volatility\n\nBitcoin’s volatility, a measure of how much its price varies over time, has long been cited as the digital currency’s downfall. Each day, Bitcoin’s value goes up or down – and oftentimes both. Measuring volatility is important to judging an asset’s overall risk profile. High volatility is cited as to why sophisticated investors and the mainstream public stay away from Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors generally limit exposure to volatile assets by not holding them or hedging. Hedging Bitcoin is tough due to a dearth of options to short Bitcoin. Further, the more volatile an asset, the more expensive it is to hedge.\n\nMonied investors in China are leaving their money in the digital currency.\n\nThere are external factors which could contribute to currency-pair volatility like fiscal policy, geopolitical disruption and other factors. Bitcoin volatility could also be a function of transaction volume, as some suggest.\n\nA paper published in 2014 by University of Victoria researchers examined the relationship between Bitcoin volatility and Google searches is implied. “Changes in Google Trends have an effect on the realized volatility of Bitcoin,” according to the paper. According to the paper, changes in the volatility of Bitcoin also have an effect on Google searches for Bitcoin.\n\n“An increase in Google Trends has a positive impact on volatility, and an increase in volatility has a positive impact on Google Trends,” states the research team, led by Darryl C. Davies. In the past year, this has proven untrue, as an increase in Bitcoin search queries has paralleled a decrease in volatility.\n\nAn end to zero fee futures trading in China has led some to speculate Bitcoin volatility will decrease in the coming months and years. When the change was announced, Bitcoin trading volume crashed 90%. In fact, most volatility so far in 2017 is credited to actions and statements by the Chinese government. Bitcoin.com reported earlier this year that monied investors in China are leaving their money in the digital currency.\n\n“We are starting to see a lot of smart money enter into the space and stay there,” said Ryan Rabaglia, Head Trader for Octagon Strategy, a Commodity and Digital Asset Trading firm based in Hong Kong. “In the form of small to medium sized institutions taking much larger positions in [bitcoin] and a natural progression to larger ones is sure to follow. With all the uncertainties surrounding us in traditional product spaces, alternatives are being sought, and although this space is still foreign to most, it’s not preventing the capital inflows we’re seeing.”\n\nAll Time Highs Amid Low in Volatility\n\nThe number of Bitcoin transactions has skyrocketed throughout the digital currency’s lifespan, as has the price, which currently sits near an all-time high after crossing the $1,000 threshold twice so far in 2017. The number of bitcoin wallets at popular multi-service provider Blockchain.info has increased, as well, in the past eight years. Trading volumes are also at all-time highs. Yet, over time, Bitcoin price volatility has declined.Reprinted from Bitcoin.\n\nJustin is an Associate Editor with the Bitcoin.com News team. This article was originally published on FEE.org.

Project XBTC will host their ICO to fund a new bitcoin mining operation. The primary objective of this new pool is to signal Bitcoin Unlimited support. A total of 21 million XBTC tokens will be issued, all of which can only be paid for with Ethereum Classic. A rather strange turn of events, to say the least.\n\nIt is not often one sees an ICO not accepting bitcoin payments these days. This only becomes more intriguing when considering how the XBTC ICO is designed to support Bitcoin Unlimited. For some reason, the project reasons will only accept Ethereum Classic investments. Moreover, the team expects to raise 12 million ETC for this initiative, worth US$18.36m at current prices.\n\nAn Unusual ICO That Doesn’t Accept Bitcoin\n\nOnly 60% of this money will be used to increase the mining pool’s hashrate. It is expected this hashrate will surpasses the 100 petahash/second mark rather quickly. Moreover, the team wants to generate at least 67 BTC per day. Quite an ambitious goal, although it is not entirely unlikely this target can be reached. The remainder of the ETC funds will be frozen for six months while being owned by the project manager.\n\nThis latter part of the proposal may turn off a lot of investors, though. Putting several million of US Dollars worth of ETC into the hands of one person seems rather strange. If the funds were put into a multi-user address, there is nothing to be concerned about. That does not seem to be the case, which makes the whole investment a far bigger risk than it needs to be. Additionally, there is the question as to what XBTC tokens can be used for in the first place.\n\nWithout a clear use case for the XBTC tokens, hardly anyone will invest in this project. Not that there is anything wrong with supporting Bitcoin Unlimited, though. It seems evident the amount of tokens one holds will determine how many bitcoins they receive from the mining pool earnings. However, the whole concept seems a bit strange, even though it provides a new use case for ETC. Do your own research before investing in this ICO.\n\nSupport for Bitcoin Unlimited continues to grow, which is a positive development. It is nice to see miners and enthusiasts finally express some support for a block size solution they prefer.Whether or not this new venture will be successful, remains to be seen, though. Using an ICO to increase BU mining support seems rather strange but it might work.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The price of a single bitcoin on Tuesday touched its highest level in more than a month as populists in the U.S. and Europe threaten the established political order, increasing the appeal of alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, market strategists said.\n\nThe price touched $1,060 BTCUSD, +3.96% on Tuesday, according to Coin Market Cap.

Initially, investors feared this could signal a shift to a more aggressive approach by Chinese regulators who had previously left the cryptocurrency world more or less along.\n\nRead: And 2016’s best-performing commodity is…bitcoin?\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin could soar if the Winklevoss ETF is approved\n\nCheck out: Grayscale Investments files to list its bitcoin trust on NYSE\n\nInstead, Chinese authorities appear to have reached an understanding with local exchanges. Several exchanges adopted a 0.2% trading fee to cut down on market manipulation while strengthening controls to prevent money laundering, all in accordance with regulators’ wishes.\n\nOthers are betting that the U.S.’s first bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund now faces an easier path to approval thanks in part to the unexpected electoral victory of President Donald Trump, who has promised to scale back financial regulations.

They should be taken either as a result of initiatives at the EU level with a view to the cross-border nature of the business or as a result of a threat market failure cryptocurrency.”\n\nPoland has been one of those countries that want to tax Bitcoin profits and the unclear status of Bitcoin in Poland has been a source of anxiety as banks in Poland have moved to close accounts of clients trading in Bitcoin.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if Bitcoin can be accepted as a currency in Poland or throughout Europe as it has already been in Japan, for example.']"
02/08/2017,"['Bitcoin prices retreated Wednesday following reports that China’s central bank is holding a closed-door meeting with several local cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe news, first reported by Bloomberg, revived fears that authorities in one of bitcoin’s biggest markets are planning to crack down on the digital currency market, said Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive officer of CryptoCompare. Until recently, Chinese authorities had allowed bitcoin trading to flourish with relatively few restrictions.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, +3.96% dropped as much as 3% on Wednesday after the news broke. It was down 1% in recent trade, with one bitcoin trading at $1,051. On Tuesday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded above $1,1060, its highest level since Jan. 4, when bitcoin traded at $1,100, its highest level in more than three years.\n\nRead: Venezuelan authorities arrest 4 bitcoin miners\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin price soars past $1,060 as political worries intensify\n\nCheck out: And 2016’s best-performing commodity is…bitcoin?\n\nMoney laundering was one of the topics up for discussion at the meeting, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nNews emerged late last year that Chinese authorities were exploring how to better monitor, and possibly restrict, digital-currency trading to prevent market manipulation and money laundering. In January, China’s largest bitcoin exchanges announced they had adopted new controls to ensure compliance with local rules in accordance with the wishes of authorities at the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank.\n\nChinese exchanges also adopted trading fees, leading to a dramatic reduction in local trading volume. Previously, Chinese exchanges had handled nearly 90% of bitcoin transactions thanks in part to their rock-bottom trading fees. U.S. exchanges, by comparison, have always required clients to pay a fee to trade.\n\nCryptocompare\n\nThe growth of the bitcoin market in China has been sharp, bitcoin experts say. Bitcoin miners based in China are responsible for generating more than two-thirds of the bitcoin network’s processing power. Bitcoin miners compete to process pending bitcoin transactions by rushing to solve complex cryptographic puzzles before others. Whoever is first to solve a puzzle blockchain, is rewarded with a cache of freshly minted bitcoins.\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin more than doubled in 2016. Bitcoin watchers said a sharp decline in the value of the Chinese yuan USDCNY, +0.0045% inspired some locals to invest in bitcoin to help preserve the value of their assets, or, as some believe, as a means of circumventing the country’s stringent capital controls.', 'The Philippine Central Bank recently approved new rules and regulations governing the operation of virtual currency exchanges. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) defines virtual currency (VC) as, “any type of digital unit that is used as a medium of exchange or a form of digitally stored value created by agreement within the community of VC users.”\n\nThe Bangko Sentral recognizes that Virtual Currency systems have “the potential to revolutionize” the delivery of financial services, “particularly for payments and remittance, in view of their ability to provide faster and more economical transfer of funds, both domestic and international, and may further support financial inclusion.” However, the bank does not intend to endorse any VC, “such as bitcoin,” as a currency, “since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity.”\n\n- Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\n\nThe BSP aims to regulate VCs when used for delivery of financial services, and in particular for payments and remittances, “which have material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability.”\n\nThe new guidelines cover VC exchanges offering services, or engaging in activities, that convert or exchange fiat currency to VC or vice versa. “Once fiat currency is exchanged or converted into VC, it becomes easily transferrable, facilitating expedient movement or transfer of funds and payment services, among others,” states the Central Bank. “In this manner, they are considered similar to remittance and transfer companies.\n\nThe new rules and regulations will go into effect on February 21, at which point all VC exchanges must obtain a Certificate of Registration (COR). Applicants incur a one-time registration fee and an ongoing annual service fee, both of which will cost about US$2,000, far less than the money transmitter licenses required throughout most US states.\n\nDeputy Governor of the Central Bank Nestor A. Espenilla Jr. first mentioned the upcoming regulations on Jan 30th, and the reason why they were needed. “Volume is growing,” he explained. “You cannot ignore it anymore because it’s a growing channel. In the overall scheme of things, it’s not yet that big but it has a potential to grow.”\n\n- Central Bank Governor Nestor A. Espenilla Jr.\n\nMany social and technological indications show that the Philippines is an ideal market for Bitcoin, including a lagging banking infrastructure coupled with high smartphone adoption rates. However, despite the environment, Bitcoin’s primary reason for the strong growth in the Philippines has remained the popularity of using it as a backbone for remittance services.\n\nThe Philippines has been a global leader in bitcoin remittance since 2013, when payment service Coins.ph and the Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI)-owned Rebit began competing in the local remittance market. The peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins has also seen a large and growing trade volume in the country.\n\nLate last year Luis Buenaventura, the CEO of Bitcoin software remittance company Bloom Solutions and a past Vice President of SCI claimed that 20 percent of the remittance corridor between the Philippines and South Korea was already using Bitcoin as a backbone to their remittance services. However, the CEO states that, “the Philippines is a huge destination for bitcoins and yet does not have any significant exchanges.”\n\n- Luis Buenaventura, CEO Bloom Solutions\n\nIn his recent book about the state of the Bitcoin remittance industry, Buenaventura described his company and three others in the country as “last mile” providers, meaning that they receive bitcoin from remittance businesses in other countries and cash them out to hand over to the Filipino recipients. As of November, Bloom’s major corridors originate in China, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, and Canada.\n\nHis interpretation of the new regulations is hopeful but cautious. “It’s good news that the government is finally recognizing that we exist and acknowledge that our efforts do have a positive social impact on our country,” he said on Tuesday. “I hope that it won’t put the brakes on the innovative momentum that has been building up over the past few years. We’ve been making a lot of progress since 2013, but there’s still a ton more work to be done.”', 'Following last week’s public notice by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s central bank, that warned Indians about using virtual currencies like Bitcoin, the still-nascent but growing industry has banded together to form the “Blockchain and Virtual Currency Association of India.”\n\nIndia’s leading bitcoin companies that include the likes of Unocoin, Coinsecure, Zebpay and SearchTrade have come together to form a new industry association that is currently under the process of a formal registration.\n\nAccording to a report in India’s biggest business daily, the Economic Times, the four companies met in India’s business capital of Mumbai last Friday, marking the first meeting of the industry association.\n\nIn quotes reported by the publication, Saurabh Agarwal, co-founder of bitcoin wallet and trading company Zebpay stated:\n\nWhile we have been planning to create an association for some time, we finally pushed things after the circular.\n\nThe ‘circular’ he refers to is a public notice published by the RBI last week, where the central bank stated that it hadn’t given any license or authority to bitcoin companies to operate in the country. In essence, the apex bank was reminding Indian investors that trading or dealing in virtual currencies would be done so at their own risk.\n\n“The RBI is reminding users of its original statement from years ago” said Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of leading bitcoin exchange UnoCoin, speaking to CCN at the time. “Nothing has changed since the original statement, for the better or worse.”\n\nBitcoin Awareness\n\nThe four big players decided against reviving the “Bitcoin Alliance of India”, a now-defunct association formed in 2014. Instead, blockchain companies – typically those that develop enterprise blockchain solutions – will also be welcomed under the new banner. Coinsecure CEO Mohit Kalra, who was a part of the first industry association effort sees other industry companies joining the association. India is currently home to about 20 bitcoin startups.\n\nThe RBI had not reached out to discuss bitcoin or the regulation of the industry, reveled Vishwanath in a conversation with CCN last week. The new association is set to address that, as the working group’s primary objective is to engage with regulators. Further, the association also intends to increase bitcoin awareness in the country while reminding them of the risks of investment and Ponzi schemes that use the cryptocurrency.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Researchers from North Carolina State University, Boston University and George Mason University have developed a Bitcoin-compatible system that could make it significantly more difficult for observers to identify or track the parties involved in any given Bitcoin transaction.\n\nBitcoin was initially conceived as a way for people to exchange money anonymously. But then it was discovered that anyone could track all Bitcoin transactions and often identify the parties involved.\n\nBitcoin operates by giving each user a unique public key, which is a string of numbers. Users can transmit money in the form of digital bitcoins from one public key to another. This is made possible by a system that ensures a user has enough bitcoins in his or her account to make the transfer. The use of the public keys gave users a sense of anonymity, even though all of the transactions were visible on the public Bitcoin blockchain which lists all transactions. Over time, experts and private companies have developed highly effective methods of de-anonymizing those public keys.\n\nNow researchers have developed a system called TumbleBit, which is a computer protocol that runs on top of Bitcoin.\n\nTumbleBit takes advantage of an existing concept called ""mixing service."" The idea works like this: instead of Party A paying Party B directly, many different Parties A pay an intermdiary ""tumbler,"" which then pays the Parties B. The more parties are involved, the harder it is to determine which Party A paid which Party B.\n\n""However, this still has a security flaw,"" says Alessandra Scafuro, an assistant professor of computer science at NC State and co-author of a paper describing TumbleBit. ""Namely, if an outside observer can compromise the tumbler, it could figure out who was paying whom.""\n\nTo address this, TumbleBit takes a three-phased approach.\n\nIn the first phase, called escrow, the Parties A notify the tumbler that they would like to make a payment, and the Parties B notify the tumbler that they would like to be paid. This is all done on the public blockchain.\n\nFor the second phase, the researchers have put cryptographic tools into place that allow the tumbler to pay the correct parties without actually knowing which parties are involved. Phase two does not appear on the blockchain.\n\nIn the third phase, called cashout, all of the transactions are conducted simultaneously, making it more difficult to identify which parties are involved in any specific transaction. Phase three does appear in the public blockchain.\n\n""We tested TumbleBit with 800 Bitcoin users, and found that the second phase only took seconds to complete,"" Scafuro says.\n\n""One limitation of TumbleBit is that, right now, the system is designed to work with a fixed denomination - so paying amounts larger than that denomination require making multiple payments,"" Scafuro says. ""That\'s something we\'re working on.""\n\nThe paper, ""TumbleBit: An Untrusted Bitcoin-Compatible Anonymous Payment Hub,"" will be presented at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, being held Feb. 26 to March 1 in San Diego, Calif.\n\nExplore further: Finally, interesting uses for the blockchain that go beyond bitcoin\n\nMore information: ""TumbleBit: An Untrusted Bitcoin-Compatible Anonymous Payment Hub,"" DOI: 10.14722/ndss.2017.23086\n\n', 'Editor’s Note: This analysis piece was published at 04:30 UCT, in the early hours of Thursday, February 9th, 2017.\n\nBitcoin prices took a dramatic drop yesterday, despite having given indications that price wanted to go higher. Prices have rallied back to almost the high, but there are now indications that bulls should be wary.\n\nElliott Wave theory suggests that corrective waves often take a 5-3-5 pattern. In this case, it is often the case that the 1st and 3rd waves are related to one another in a Fibonacci relationship. In other words, the third wave might be .618 of the first wave, or often, the waves might be the same size in terms of price.\n\nThat is exactly what we saw yesterday. The collapse occurred just as the second wave reached the same price range as the first. See the picture below:\n\nAs we know, one should “never say never” in the trading business. There are big players who make their living trying to run stops, and otherwise try to manipulate the charts to their benefit. However, I have long suspected this rally from the swing low was a wave B of an A-B-C corrective wave. The fact that price dropped so strongly when the waves reached the same size makes me suspect that wave B might have just ended. If so, then wave C is beginning, which will likely test the 750 low.\n\nIn the event that price rallies above the recent swing high of 1069 (Kraken) then my stated concerns will be shown to be likely in error. We will see….\n\nHappy trading!\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgement.

They not only invest time and financial support, but also provide a robust network for startups to connect to as they navigate the pitfalls common among early-stage businesses.\n\nVaultoro currently has over 4,000 clients from 92 countries that hold more than 1.8 million euros\' worth of bitcoin and gold through the platform. By joining Techstars, says Vaultoro CEO Joshua Scigala, the company is putting their plan to integrate the euro on the fast track, and to provide a physical gold-backed VISA card and a sleek new app that allows bank independence while maintaining online shopping and bill paying functionality.\n\n""Techstars has a massive network of mentors and connections. If we need a warm contact to almost anyone they will be able to make it happen. Our goal at Vaultoro is to enable as many people as possible to be able to easily exit debt-based fiat and jump into securing and spending physical allocated gold and bitcoin.""\n\nIn the short amount of time that he\'s been involved with Berlin Techstars, Scigala says that he\'s already garnered a vast amount of experience, noting that it\'s ""like being put into a pressure cooker of influence and ideas.""\n\n""The great thing about Techstars is that they\'re all about getting companies to be as successful as possible in the shortest time possible. Having Techstars invest in Vaultoro will help us reach the mass market, which ultimately helps us in promoting private asset-based money like bitcoin and physical allocated gold to the mainstream.""\n\nGlass Books and the Value of Transparency\n\nAnd in another move, Vaultoro is seeding the development of a ""glass books"" system, a transparent protocol based on blockchain technology that fosters financial institution transparency while maintaining client data privacy.\n\nAs one of the victims of MtGox, Scigala says that this crucial move toward greater transparency will help prove that Vaultoro is at full reserves all the time. ""If MtGox had what we had, then red flags would have popped up all over the place and people would have left the exchange way before it got so bad.""\n\nScigala says that this level of transparency is critically important because if exchanges in the bitcoin industry do not self-regulate, as Vaultoro intends to do, then another MtGox-type event could likely happen somewhere in the world. This sort of catastrophic event, he says, could be the ideal fuel that the legacy banking system needs to force governments around the world to push draconian regulations onto Bitcoin startups that will cause them to drown under massive regulatory burdens.\n\n""I really want other exchanges in the Bitcoin industry to follow our lead as being the most transparent exchange in the industry. I also want users to choose exchanges that have a solid transparency protocol in place and walk away from ones that don\'t.""\n\nVaultoro and the Global Markets\n\nGlobal monetary uncertainty in countries like Venezuela, India and China has had an impact on Vaultoro\'s growth, says Scigala. ""We have many clients from these countries. When the Greek banking crisis happened we received a massive uptick in signups from Greek IP addresses. About three months after it happened a lot more people from Greece started to hold allocated gold in the Pro Aurum Swiss Vaults that we connect to.""\n\nThe reason the Greeks like Vaultoro, he says, is because it is allocated gold. ""We cannot gamble with their savings like banks do, and are obviously not in a position to do bailouts or bail-ins. They know their savings are just sitting safely in a top-tier vaulting facility, audited and insured. And even if we go broke it doesn\'t matter because our clients\' gold is off our balance sheet.""\n\nWhile Scigala recognizes the growing buzz around blockchain technology, for him it is bitcoin, the token, that is most exciting.\n\n""I mean it\'s money being disrupted that we are talking about! Something we all use every day. There is no need to put gold as a token on the blockchain because it makes it unallocated and opens a massive regulatory can of worms. Bitcoin is so fast we don\'t need to tokenize gold. In the end it\'s about jumping in and out of it on Vaultoro when you need to. That\'s why Satoshi invented bitcoin in the first place. We\'ll look to Techstars Berlin to help us with this proposition.""', 'It appears the United States Postal Service is determined not to be the courier of choice for drug dealers any longer.\n\n\n\nJudging by a recent job listing sent to the information security community, the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) - the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service ( USPS ) - wants to sniff out users of darknet markets that send their packages by mail. Applicants for the job, listed as ""Investigative (Internet) Analyst"", are expected to know their way around bitcoin - the currency of choice on the darkweb - a as well as other tools typically used by darknets, like Tor .\n\nAlthough the job listing doesn\'t appear to be published online any more, according to Deep Dot Web the USPIS is specifically looking for applicants able to unmask pseudonymous users of dark net markets:\n\n""Candidates shall be capable of performing a prioritized assessment of the data to identify the most critical and reliable data in order to identify bitcoins, locations, accounts, services, travels, email addresses, IP addresses and other pattern of life data in an effort to determine physical attribution of an Internet identity.""\n\nAnd, according to Motherboard :\n\n""The analyst shall be capable to use technology solutions to actively search, analyze and prioritize the various market places and cyber-criminals to identify high value targets for the USPIS investigators.""\n\nDarknet markets are eBay-like market places that operate on darknets such as Tor and I2P, most commonly operating as digital black markets. The vast majority of purchases are illegal drugs, but weapons, stolen credit card details and other illegal goods are traded as well. Since pioneering darknet market Silk Road was closed down in 2013, and founder Ross Ulbricht sentenced to life in prison , buying and selling of illegal contraband has only increased .\n\nShipment of the illegal goods is exclusively done by mail. In most cases, at least in the United Stated, this is done with USPS. As a federal agency, USPS is bound by the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. This prevents the postal service from inspecting packages without a warrant, attaining which in turn requires probable cause. Providing this probable cause is - presumably - where the investigative analyst would come in.\n\nThat said, even now, the mailing system is probably the weakest link in darknet market operations. Where online communication is protected with encryption and Tor, and bitcoin (or monero) payments can be mixed and tumbled, packages still require physical addresses - and can be intercepted.\n\nIndeed, the USPIS does already regularly provide assistance in darknet investigations. Perhaps most notably, the USPIS is said to have played an active role November 2016\'s "" Operation Hyperion ,"" one of the most extensive police operations focused on the darknet to date, where thousands of users of darknet marketplaces were identified.\n\nThe job listing suggests the USPIS will ramp of these and similar efforts in the future.', 'On Tuesday, in Tbilisi, the government of Georgia signed an agreement to use the Bitcoin Blockchain to verify property transactions.\n\nLast April, the Georgian government and Bitcoin company BitFury initiated a project to record land titles on the Blockchain.\n\nThis is the first time a national government is using the Blockchain to safeguard and authenticate state operations, therefore ushering in a belief in the technology that has wrongfully been painted black.\n\nFirst-time government Blockchain\n\nAs a matter of fact, the private Blockchain that will be an alter-proof ledger will also be provable using the Bitcoin Blockchain that is in the public domain.\n\nAs of now, a software has been built and tested on some land title registrations. The Georgian National Agency of Public Registry and BitFury signed a memorandum of understanding paving the way to extend services to the registration of new land titles, demolition of property, mortgages, purchases and sales of land titles, rentals as well as notary services.\n\nThere are many other projects focusing on Blockchain land title services apart from the BitFury and Republic of Georgia drive. This includes Sweden, Honduras and Cook County in Chicago which are being run by ChromaWay, Factcom and Velox respectively.\n\nMedia reports hinted that Peruvian Economist Hernando de Soto is associated with the Georgian project. De Soto, in his book Mystery of Capital, estimates that there is ""dead capital"" of $20 trillion globally, consisting of buildings and lands without legal title.\n\n24/7 with smartphones\n\nGeorgia’s Minister of Justice, Tea Tsulukiani, says that she is optimistic her country will be able to work with Blockchain technology from this coming summer to have real estate quotations in a completely trustworthy and avant-garde.\n\nPapuna Ugrekhelidze, chairman of the Georgian National Agency of Public Registry, stated in an announcement that his outfit is “very pleased with the technical progress and looks forward to continuing [their] fruitful collaboration.”\n\nBitFury CEO Valery Vavilov also told the media that the Georgian government is excited about how the whole work was handled and executed with the current method. He explained that all the changes were made on the back end and the only dichotomy for the citizens of Georgia is that they can monitor if a title is legitimate when it is entered into the system.\n\nVavilov revealed that the current platform is phase one and at a beta stage but the software will be fully operational this year:\n\n“The big goal is to move [the process] to smartphones, so people can use it 24/7 and all transactions are secured, transferrable and accountable.”\n\nSo far, BitFury has been able to raise $90 mln funding including a $30 mln investment by Credit China FinTech Holdings in January.\n\nImplemented on a property, Blockchain technology maintains agreements in diverse fashions. In Blockchain-based entries, records are time-stamped, as well as consequent modifications to these records. The aforementioned would permit public members interested in a property to examine and establish the date of previous sales.', 'Scientists at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg have developed an important mathematical algorithm called ""Equihash."" Equihash is a core component for the new cryptocurrency Zcash, which offers more privacy and equality than the famous Bitcoin. Zcash came into operation as an experimental technology for a community-driven digital currency in late 2016.\n\nBitcoin is by far the most recognized and widely used digital currency. It was introduced in January 2009 and has garnered much attention since then. But it is not the only one of its kind. Wikipedia lists nearly one hundred cryptocurrencies boasting more than 1 million US dollar market capitalisation.\n\nOne of the newest cryptocurrencies is ""Zcash,"" which can be seen as an update to the Bitcoin protocols. In Bitcoin, the transfer of coins is recorded in a global ledger, the so-called blockchain. The validity of the latest transfers in the blockchain is verified about every ten minutes. Verifying the transfers and creating new blocks for the blockchain (the so-called mining) requires a lot of computing power, which is provided by distributed computers worldwide. The ""miners"" who allocate the processing power are rewarded with new coins.\n\nZcash is trying to resolve two main shortcomings of Bitcoin: its lack of privacy for transactions and the centralization of transaction verification into the hands of a mere dozen miners who have invested in large amounts of specialized mining hardware: Bitcoin is prone to such centralization because the computational load of the bitcoin mining algorithm can be split into many different small tasks, which can be conducted in parallel. The algorithm is easy to implement in dedicated, energy-efficient and cheap microchips, but not suited to standard hardware. Bitcoin mining today is therefore done on special-purpose supercomputers which are located in places with cheap electricity and/or cheap cooling. Such supercomputers are expensive, costing millions of euros, but provide much more mining power than if one were to use standard PC hardware of the same price.\n\nProf. Alex Biryukov, head of the research group ""Cryptolux"" and Dr. Dmitry Khovratovich at SnT have developed the algorithm ""Equihash"" which can resolve this problem. Equihash is a so called memory-hard problem, which can not be split up into smaller working packages. It can be more efficiently calculated on desktop-class computers with their multiple processing cores and gigabytes of memory than on special hardware chips. ""If 10.000 miners with a single PC were active, in Zcash the investment to compete with them would be 10.000 times the price of a PC, while with bitcoin, the investment would be significantly smaller,"" says Khovratovich. This creates a more democratic digital currency by allowing more users to contribute to the mining process. Khovratovich adds: ""The strength of a cryptocurrency comes from the fact that the ledger is globally distributed. Our Equihash algorithm reverses the situation back to this more ideal world.""\n\nEquihash was first presented at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium last year – one of the top-5 IT security events. Prof. Biryukov comments: ""Since Equihash is based on a fundamental computer science problem, advances in Equihash mining algorithms will benefit computer science in general. Equihash is so far unique among all the mining algorithms: it is memory-hard on the one hand and very easy to verify on the other."" In other words, while mining new coins with Zcash/Equihash is comparatively expensive, hence posing a smaller risk of monopolization because it requires large amounts of computer memory and hard computational work, checking that the new coins are genuine is memoryless, fast and cheap.\n\nUnderstanding these advantages, the creators of Zcash chose Equihash as the algorithm for mining coins and verifying transfers. Equihash itself is not limited to use in Zcash and can be used in any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin.\n\n""With our contribution to Zcash, the Cryptography and Security lab (CryptoLux) has shown its strength in innovative research that has immediate applications in the financial technology industry,"" says SnT´s director, Prof. Björn Ottersten. ""We invite students to follow us in this promising field,"" adds Professor Biryukov: ""There are still lots of challenging research problems to solve.""\n\nExplore further: Bitcoin \'mining pool\' promises to stay small\n\nMore information: Equihash: Asymmetric proof-of-work based on the Generalized Birthday problem. hdl.handle.net/10993/22277\n\n', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

02/09/2017,"['The Bitcoin price plunged by 9 percent overnight, declining from $1,060 to $959 across major global Bitcoin exchanges. The short-term drop in price was likely caused by the announcement of Huobi and OKCoin to temporarily disable Bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals for one month.\n\nHuobi and OKCoin are two of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in China that control approximately 25 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market. The two Bitcoin exchanges process around $55 mln worth of Bitcoin and litecoin on a daily basis.\n\nIn the morning of Jan. 9, almost immediately after a meeting took place between nine Chinese Bitcoin exchanges and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), Huobi and OKCoin abruptly disabled withdrawals for Bitcoin and litecoin funds for up to one month. OKCoin and Huobi told users that they were asked to upgrade their Anti-Money Laundering systems to ensure they are in compliance with local financial and money transmission regulations.\n\nUsers of OKCoin and Huobi didn’t receive any notifications or warning letters prior to the abrupt announcement. The halt of withdrawal of Bitcoin and litecoin funds in the Chinese Bitcoin market led the entire global Bitcoin exchange market to panic, plunging the Bitcoin price which was recovering from its initial decline caused by the People’s Bank of China’s meeting with Chinese Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBoth OKCoin and Huobi provided identical statements to their users. OKCoin and Huobi stated that credit lines and cryptocurrency operations of both exchanges will be frozen immediately and that users will not be able to withdraw any funds apart from RMB balances until the AML system upgrade is completed.\n\nWhile the two exchanges expect the overhaul of AML infrastructure to take up to one month, a local news outlet CnLedger confirmed that OKCoin and Huobi may allow users to withdraw balances if the upgrade is completed within the one-month roadmap.\n\nOn Jan. 22, Huobi and OKCoin were criticized by the People’s Bank of China for operating cryptocurrency businesses on top of an AML system that isn’t compliant with local regulations. The PBoC specifically addressed the two Bitcoin exchanges out of nine Bitcoin exchanges operating actively within the country and informed them on how to improve or change the AML system in order to remain compliant with local laws.\n\nAt the time, the local publication Shanghai Observer reported:\n\n“Preliminary inspection of “OKCoin” and “Huobi” showed that these platforms provided margin trading which violated rules, resulting in abnormal price fluctuations in the market. During the inspection, it has also been discovered that these platforms had not established sound anti-money laundering system according to regulations.”\n\nAlthough Huobi terminated margin trading after the announcement of PBoC, they failed to address the AML system issue the PBoC brought up during the preliminary inspection and visits. As a result, the PBoC pressured the two Bitcoin exchanges to immediately overhaul the AML system and temporarily disable withdrawals and operations until the upgrade is completed.', ""BASSETERRE, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Feb. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WeUseCoins, the popular online information portal offering information on Bitcoin, Altcoins and blockchain technology is now providing a valuable guide with detailed instructions about Bitcoin and ways to buy the cryptocurrency across the world.

The value of the cryptocurrency has been three times more volatile than the price of oil and 11 times more than the post-Brexit exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar, according to the bank’s markets research department.\n\nBitcoin transfers are also irreversible, so someone making a mistake entering an account number when making a payment will be out of luck. In addition, if a bitcoin user loses their private key, they can lose all their bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain’s Immune Structure\n\nBitcoin’s blockchain architecture has demonstrated immunity to hacking risks. The blockchain is not an interconnected series of individual accounts, but a record of past transactions. When a user wants to transfer bitcoins, all computers running the bitcoin software process the sender’s signature through an algorithm and checks the past transactions encoded in the blockchain to ensure the sender owns the bitcoins they say they do.\n\nOther computers then verify the recipient’s work. The transaction is then aggregated with other transactions, and computers running the bitcoin software, known as miners, race to solve a mathematical puzzle to verify the transactions. One miner wins the race, while the others verify the accuracy of the solution. When they agree the transactions are valid, the miner winning the race receives new bitcoins, thereby increasing the bitcoin supply.\n\nA Challenge for Hackers?\n\nTheoretically, someone could hack into the blockchain and alter the record to make it look like previous bitcoin transactions transferred money to the hacker’s account. But it would require huge computing power. Bitcoin users verify a transaction by looking at all past transactions, so a hacker needs to solve the mathematical puzzle linked to a particular block to manipulate it, and also with the blocks that come after it.\n\nBlocks are only considered valid six blocks deep into the chain. The deeper one goes into the blockchain, the more computing power needed to alter records.\n\nA 51 Percent Attack\n\nConcentrated share among bitcoin miners also presents a potential risk. If a single party gained control over 51 percent of the bitcoin network, it could theoretically stop legitimate new transactions from settling or undoing recent confirmations, potentially enabling it to double spend the bitcoins.\n\nCredit Suisse, with 30 percent of the network, has calculated that a malevolent actor has a 40 percent chance of mining six consecutive blocks in one week, enabling them to alter transactions. In the event of a so-called “51 percent attack,” however, bitcoin’s value would plummet. In other words, miners attacking the network would also undermine the value of the same assets they attempted to steal, along with the assets they already own.\n\nTo acquire 30 percent of the network, the malevolent actor would need to mine past blocks. Hence, they have a stake in keeping the ledger intact.\n\nAlso read: Can the blockchain deliver security to banks against cyber attacks?\n\nCyber Theft Of Cryptocurrency\n\nMost bitcoin users use online exchanges to exchange fiat currency for bitcoin, and digital wallets that facilitate payments. Both have been suffered cyberattacks. In August 2016, hackers stole 119,756 bitcoins on deposit with the Bitfinex exchange.\n\nThe Mt. Gox exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2014, claiming hackers stole 850,000 bitcoins. Only 24 percent of the coins have been recovered. Japanese prosecutors charged ex-CEO Mark Karpeles with embezzlement. Various articles have laid the blame for the exchange’s problems on unorthodox management.\n\nThe bottom line is that blockchain technology and bitcoin trading are relatively safe. Complications arise when people enter the mix.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Central Bank of Philippines, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has released a notification that makes it easier for Bitcoin exchanges in the country to operate. The new “Guidelines for Virtual Currency (VC) Exchanges” was approved by the country’s Monetary Board.\n\nAccording to the regulation, all cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country will have to register themselves as Non-Banking Financial Institutions. The Central Bank has introduced these regulations in the light of increased usage of Bitcoin for remittance within the country.\n\nBangko Sentral, in the notification clearly mentions that the banking institution understands Bitcoin’s potential benefits and it doesn’t intend to hamper innovation in the sector. The central bank is quoted in the circular stating,\n\n“The Bangko Sentral does not intend to endorse any VC, such as Bitcoin, as a currency since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity. Rather, the BSP aims to regulate VCs when used for delivery of financial services, particularly, for payments and remittance, which have material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability.”\n\nThe guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges also outlines various obligations and compliances on the exchanges’ part as well. Bangko Sentral classifies cryptocurrency exchanges among remittance and fund transfer companies. The platforms will be governed by Section11 of Republic Act no. 9160 or the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2011 along with the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations and other applicable regulations issued by Bangko Sentral.\n\nThe approved guidelines facilitate mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The digital currencies are equivalent to foreign currency, except for the absence of guarantees on Bangko Sentral’s part. However, the regulations also increase the costs of operations of the virtual currency exchanges, in terms of compliance requirements. But given the tremendous opportunities and scale of usage, the platforms will not be affected by it.\n\nRead the full notification here\n\nRef: Bangko Sentral | Image: ManilaLiveWire', '', 'On the so-called ""dark web"" black markets exist outside the purview of the law. These online marketplaces have relied on digital currencies to avoid detection and allow for the monetary exchange for illicit goods and services. Most commonly, Bitcoin has been used for transaction purposes, but there is increasing concern that Bitcoin\'s protocol is not wholly anonymous. Notably, Silk Road, the largest such black market at the time, was brought down by the FBI, purportedly by following the Bitcoin transactions of its founder. According to a recent report by Wired, a new digital currency has begun to stand out for black market purposes, known as Monero. (See also: E&Y Auctioning Last of Seized Bitcoin from Silk Road)\n\nMonero\n\nMonero, which is esperanto for \'coin\' was the best performing cryptocurrency of 2016 in terms of price, rising more than 27-fold, this according to Wired. One Monero currently trades for around $12. One reason for its sudden rise is its increasing use in black markets online. (For more, see: Is Bitcoin Legal in the United States?)\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nIn the Wired article, they cite the fact that all Monero transactions are completely anonymous and untraceable. This achieved via a number of mechanisms that address vulnerabilities in Bitcoin\'s protocol. For example, wallet balances are obscured in Monero using so-called ""stealth addresses."" It has a feature known as ""ring signatures"" which essentially mixes up the transactions of many users at once automatically to make a forensic analysis of money flows impossible. It also hides the amount of each transaction from view. Wired concludes, ""all of that makes Monero a significant upgrade for a cryptocurrency user’s financial privacy."" People transacting in Monero can then change it back to either Bitcoin or to dollars (or other currency) via a number of online cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nOf course, having complete anonymity and opacity is valued by black market denizens, but is frowned upon by regulators and law enforcement. If the only perceived usage of something like Monero is for illegal or questionable activity, then its widespread use may be dampered. Indeed, Bitcoin used to be used primarily for black markets and gambling, but has since evolved in to a much more general use currency with very little illegal activity going through its network.', 'Cryptic bitcoin company 21 Inc has launched a paid email platform that seems far removed from its initial focus on hardware.\n\nThe move is yet another in a string of pivots by the firm. Since it revealed it had raised $116m in 2015 (accrued over multiple rounds), 21 has evolved its strategy several times.\n\nOriginally founded as a bitcoin mining company, it soon appointed a new CEO – Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan – and announced plans to distribute bitcoin mining chips embedded in consumer and enterprise hardware devices. The chips, attached to a Raspberry Pi and called \'21 Bitcoin Computers\', started shipping in November 2015 and quickly developers began building applications for the device.\n\nThen, in March 2016, the company launched its first proof-of-concept for a network of devices incentivized to monitor websites with bitcoin. Several months later, it launched a software package that allowed any connected device to join the 21 network, enabling capabilities that were once only available to those with a 21 Bitcoin Computer.\n\nThe new communications platform seems to be yet another evolution for 21 Inc, though Srinivasan said the company has been working on this idea for some time, pointing to an SMS version of the current product that was published in late 2015.\n\nFurther, the CEO said, the email platform still aligns with the company’s primary goal.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Allowing people to earn bitcoin by responding to emails and completing tasks achieves many of the same goals in that it may get millions of people their first exposure to digital currency.""\n\nIn the old SMS version, 21 Inc showed users how to set up a 21 Bitcoin Computer to allow them to receive paid text messages from anyone without revealing the recipient’s number. The new platform, which allows users to set their own rate, makes the service accessible for people even without the company’s hardware.\n\nRewarding the recipient\n\nThe new service – available via the website and a MacOS app – looks similar to LinkedIn\'s InMail (which Srinivasan said is the platform’s closest competitor). And some enthusiasts, including Craig Lauer, an angel investor and mentor to TechStars and EvoNexus, have even made it public that they\'d rather use 21’s platform over LinkedIn.\n\nThat’s probably because, according to Srinivasan, the recipient gets paid instead of the social network giant. On LinkedIn, payments made to send email to people outside your network are taken by LinkedIn itself, but on 21\'s platform, the money goes straight to the recipient.\n\nMost of it, anyway. When a user sends an email, 21 adds a 10% fee to transactions – for instance, sending an email to someone charging $1 means paying $1.10 total.\n\nThat small fee, though, has the potential to turn into big revenue for 21.\n\n""InMail is nevertheless estimated to be a $300m per year business for LinkedIn, and we think that market could expand if recipients can get paid,"" Srinivasan said.\n\nPremium prices\n\nThis is especially true if well-known early adopters keep setting high prices (and people are prepared to pay for access to them).\n\nAndreessen Horowitz\'s Ben Horowitz set his account at $100 via the service. With such high values, some wonder what the benefit of using bitcoin would be since, in these cases, it might be just as easy to add debit and credit payment options.\n\nBut Srinivasan contends there are several advantages.\n\n""It allows instant receipt of funds without linking a bank account, it works across borders and it can scale up and down to very small and large payments alike,"" he said.\n\nThis appreciation is also, it seems, why people have rushed to the new service, since users can make $2 in bitcoin just by reading through how the site works and setting up an account.\n\nThis mechanism for offering monetary value for tasks is the real mission of the 21 platform, according to Srinivasan.\n\n""The goal is to make it possible to send targeted tasks to people. In the same way that your resume qualifies you for an offline job, a verified 21 profile qualifies you for online tasks, payable in bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nThe Gerson Lehrman Group, an expert network that provides independent consulting services, offers a service like this, although it is aimed at survey participants, rewarding users with virtual event credits and monetary reimbursement.\n\n""Think of it like a hybrid of LinkedIn and Amazon Mechanical Turk,"" Srinivasan said.\n\nMixed reviews\n\nJohn Light, head of product marketing at Abra, a bitcoin-based mobile app for remittances, suggested the paid email use case is merely a way to market the tasks platform.\n\n""The email application seems like a useful idea, especially for those getting a lot of inbound requests and they need to apply some filter to decide what’s worth responding to – especially if those people are outside your network,"" Light said. ""The messaging product is also useful because it’s public-facing … and acts as a marketing tool.""\n\nAlthough others, like Wayne Vaughan, founder and CEO of Tierion, remain skeptical – not only of the paid inbox, but also of the tasks platform.\n\nIn today’s world, social signals such as getting introduced by a mutual friend are generally seen as more valuable than monetary compensation, Vaughan suggested.\n\n""Putting a price on that … it\'s like if I want to tell you something interesting, but you ask for $50 to do that, I want to tell you to go screw yourself,"" he said.\n\nNot to mention, high prices put some people – such as young entrepreneurs or developers and small publication journalists – at a disadvantage.\n\n""It’s not a perfect solution,"" conceded Light, ""but it’s a new option for purely unsolicited messages with no pre-applied filter.""\n\nOf course, there will always be other channels on which people can reach out, such as the public networks like Twitter. On these, though, account holders aren’t guaranteed to respond, and surely, said Light, they would if someone paid them to.\n\nAs an added incentive for some, the money received from incoming emails or earned from tasks can be donated to three different “tech-savvy and bitcoin-friendly” charities, said Srinivasan.\n\n""Because price is a signal, money could be a very interesting way to prioritize messages,"" he argued. ""At the same time, the recipients often don’t actually need the money, so donating it to a good cause is a creative solution.""\n\nExit play?\n\nYet, some like Vaughan are still doubtful.\n\nAll in all, Vaughan (and other observers) wonders if 21 isn’t trying to amass a large user base, a new asset so the company can sell.\n\n""If you’re trying to sell your company and show fast customer acquisition this might be a way to do it,"" he said.\n\nBut maybe it\'s more about finding a business model that gains traction, allowing 21 to drill down on a specific use case, Light argued.\n\nWhile the move isn\'t necessarily a desperation play, Vaughan thinks 21\'s ability to raise money could be limited since its mining equipment business hasn\'t worked itself into a commercial success as of yet.\n\nIn Vaughan’s mind, this is the latest pivot that shows a company experimenting with revenue-generating business models.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""If there’s a thread of continuity, then they need to do a better job of communicating what they’re all about.""\n\nImages via 21 Inc\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The 10 MW facility is in close proximity to Facebook’s European data center, the first site for the social media giant outside the United States.\n\nCanaan’s expansion to having a presence in Europe comes in the aftermath of moves made toward its acquisition by Chinese electronics manufacturer Shandong Luyitong. The mid-2016 deal, worth a reported ¥3.06 billion (approximately $466 million) would have represented the biggest acquisition in the bitcoin industry. However, the deal fell through with reports of regulatory challenges making the acquisition unfeasible for both parties.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Brainy boffins have developed a mathematical algorithm that could boost new cryptocurrency Zcash‘s prestige and topple Bitcoin’s crown.\n\nScientists at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg have created the algorithm – Equihash – a core component for Zcash, which “offers more privacy and equality than the famous Bitcoin”.\n\nAccording to SnT, Zcash is trying to resolve the two main shortcomings of Bitcoin: its lack of privacy for transactions and the centralisation of transaction verification into the hands of a mere dozen miners who have invested in large amounts of specialised mining hardware.

02/10/2017,"[""Will Bitcoin’s future rest on keeping the dragon happy? We have come a long way from an independent currency. What would you rather have? Wild speculation but a completely government free Bitcoin or a new Bitcoin run by the PBOC?\n\nBitcoin was envisioned as a free and independent currency and it was always thought that governments could not really have a great impact on the price movement of this cryptocurrency.\n\nIndeed, it has been this aspect of Bitcoin that appealed to many people including people in countries like Venezuela, Nigeria and India where government’s mismanaged their domestic currencies leading to the significant erosion of monetary value or simply unleashed chaos.\n\nYet, Bitcoin itself seems to be the victim of one particular government and its central bank.\n\nIs PBOC out to get Bitcoin?\n\nWe have been covering the actions of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) from the very beginning when they carried out their so-called “inspections” on Bitcoin exchanges in China. The stated intention then was that they wanted to look into market manipulation, find out if exchanges have correct licenses and if they have implemented anti-money laundering systems.\n\nWell, fast forward to today and the anti-money laundering part of the PBOC diktat seems to have come into full force. Huobi and OKCoin have both suspended the withdrawal of Bitcoin and Litecoin from their exchanges.\n\nWreaking havoc on Bitcoin price\n\nThe announcement of the exchanges after they came out of a closed-door meeting with the PBOC led to a drop in Bitcoin price and many other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin fell from levels of near $1060 per Bitcoin to $977 yesterday, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $966 on Poloniex. The frequent upheavals caused by China’s fear over capital flight or market manipulation are keeping Bitcoin from crossing the $1000 levels. While China has assumed a central role in the Bitcoin market, considering the country’s nationals are leading operators of mines and are also involved in trading Bitcoin, the frequent interruptions of the PBOC in the Chinese Bitcoin market is a source of increasing worry.\n\nTaming the Wild Wild West\n\nThere is a view among some experts that the Chinese central bank’s actions are benign and are motivated solely as a reasonable and responsible regulator.\n\nAccording to Fran Stajnar of BraveNewCoin.com, when asked if there were any financial pressures behind the suspension of withdrawals on Chinese exchanges:\n\n“There is no evidence of financial pressures - withdrawal suspension at the main Chinese exchanges is purely to allow those exchanges time to comply with the PBOC's latest requirements around better AML procedures.”\n\nCharles Hoskinson, co-founder and CEO of Input Output, thinks it's more of a house-cleaning operation:\n\n“I suspect that the PBOC told the exchanges to knock it off and clean up. It's a wild west out there.”\n\nKeep the dragon happy\n\nThe PBOC having closed-door meetings and releasing press releases on their website is sinister and worrying.\n\nThe fact is that no matter who argues what, each time the PBOC has taken some action in the past few months, Bitcoin prices have nosedived.\n\nThe very future of Bitcoin in China and elsewhere is now at stake, especially if the PBOC is to play the regulator’s role in the world’s largest Bitcoin market.\n\nHowever, there is hope as some think this is a transient phenomenon. Fran Stajnar on the question of Bitcoin in China says: “It will take time for the Chinese exchange landscape to transform into something the PBOC is happy with.”"", 'Tech-savvy Chinese bitcoin traders may have just seen their good days come to a halt as China\'s central banks continue to place sharper scrutiny over the virtual currency market.\n\nUnder pressure to clamp down on capital outflow and prop up the Chinese currency, the People\'s Bank of China warned nine bitcoin trading exchanges at a meeting in Beijing on Wednesday that it will shut down venues that violate foreign exchange management, money laundering, and other regulatory rules. The warning is followed by some of China\'s biggest bitcoin exchanges announcing that they would prevent customer withdrawals of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThree of China\'s biggest bitcoin exchanges OkCoin, Huobi and BTCC, which had accounted for more than 90 percent of the global bitcoin market in January, had respectively suspended withdrawals or subjected all bitcoin withdrawals to a 72-hour review. The disruption is likely to temporarily constrain volumes further after already shrinking trading volumes since the government started clamping down in January.\n\nAnalytics platform Sosobtc showed the number of bitcoins traded on the three exchanges slid from 13.6 million on Jan. 6 to just over 120,000 on Feb. 9. but as an analyst pointed out, the exchange volumes might be misleading.\n\n""Prior to January 24 those exchanges didn\'t charge a trading fee and the volume was largely compared to exchanges that were charging a trading fee. Without a trading fee, I could sit there and trade 1,000 BTC back and forth with myself all day and generate massive volume but it isn\'t economically meaningful,"" said Spencer Bogart, a bitcoin analyst at Needham & Co., one of the few Wall Street investment banks that covers bitcoin.\n\n""Exacerbating this effect was the fact that these exchanges also provided leverage for trading. Starting on January 24, in response to concerns from the PBOC, the Chinese exchanges began charging a trading fee and stopped offering leverage. In that sense it\'s a one-time shock that has normalized trading volumes and not an ongoing \'downward spiral\',"" said Bogart.\n\nBut the announcement is notable and Bogart said he expects that ""volume will fall significantly until withdrawals are re-enabled and confidence in the exchanges and regulators returns.""\n\nChina has been the leading venue for bitcoin trading. Bitcoin prices have soared to near-record highs since last year even as the Chinese currency maintains a sharp depreciation streak against the dollar. But bitcoin\'s meteoric 120% gain in 2016 is also coincided with China\'s ever-widening capital outflow.\n\nAccording to an outlook report from the Institute of International Finance on Thursday, China is expected to have around $1 trillion of resident outflows, including errors and omissions, and $560 billion of net capital outflows in 2017. In the past, the Chinese government has resorted to several measures to stanch the money outflows, which includes requiring citizens to report overseas transfers over $10,000, discouraging Chinese companies from making overseas acquisitions and barring individuals from moving more than $50,000 out of the country each year.\n\nHowever, none of these measures have managed to bring any pronounced improvements to the problem so far, which is lately evidence by China\'s currency reserves hitting down below the $3 trillion mark. A lot of this is said to have come from Chinese investors\' resort to using bitcoin as a way to move money out of the country.', 'Episode 753: Blockchain Gang\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Marsden/Getty Images David Marsden/Getty Images\n\nCharlie Shrem had a prison epiphany. Instead of using packets of mackerel to buy and sell things, inmates should use something more like the digital currency Bitcoin. He even came up with a way it could work in prison, never mind that it was Bitcoin that got him arrested in the first place.\n\nBefore getting locked up, Shrem had run the company BitInstant. BitInstant made buying Bitcoin as easy as purchasing a money order. By the time he was 22, Shrem had hired dozens of employees, found a brand new office in Manhattan, and was processing a million dollars a day.\n\nShrem though ended up helping some of the wrong people trade dollars for Bitcoin: buyers and sellers of illegal drugs on the website Silk Road. As he was getting off a plane from Europe to New York, Shrem was arrested. He was convicted of aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitter, and sentenced to two years in federal prison .\n\nWhile Shrem was behind bars he began to see Bitcoin in a new light. So did the rest of the world. Now he\'s got a new idea, and he\'s trying to convince investors to give him a second chance. It\'s not about Bitcoin for him anymore. It\'s about the technology behind Bitcoin: Blockchain.\n\nCharlie Shrem\'s journey to prison and back out again is a parable for the transformation of Bitcoin over the last five years. Shrem and Bitcoin have gone from being idealists to outlaws to trying to make it as respectable citizens.\n\nOn today\'s show, a thought experiment involving packets of mackerel as a prison currency and a story about how a libertarian\'s dream technology was taken over by big banks and stock traders.\n\nMusic: ""Funk Fathers"" and the Bitinstant Jingle.

(The price has rebounded somewhat and is trading at about $1,000 as of press time.)\n\nThis week also saw the Winklevoss twins update their proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAnd then there’s the news coming out of the new presidential administration, which last week embarked on some ambitious priorities around financial regulation.\n\nHere’s how these events and other factors affect the odds of SEC approval (labeled positive, neutral or negative), as well as what the market seems to be thinking. (For more discussion around the prospects for Bitcoin ETF approval, check out this episode on my podcast, Unchained — links here to the show notes and to the podcast itself on the web, Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio.)\n\nThe China Factor: Marginally Positive\n\nSpencer Bogart, vice president of Equity Research at Needham & Company, and one of my guests on the podcast, previously put the odds of SEC approval at 25% or less, mostly due to the generally conservative nature of the SEC. (His remarks on bitcoin are published in reports on the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a private placement security for wealthy investors that also trades after a one-year lockup period over the counter under the ticker GBTC.)\n\nHe sees this week’s beefing up of AML and KYC processes on Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges as only slightly helping the odds for a bitcoin ETF.\n\nEvents in China in January also help a bit. Previously, because many Chinese exchanges did not charge fees to trade, it appeared that 95% of all trading in bitcoin worldwide occurred in China. A month ago, regulators in China urged exchanges to produce “real volume,” prompting the biggest three exchanges to institute fees for trading. (This week, it looks like a host of smaller exchanges are following suit.)\n\nBogart says that since this wasn’t “economically meaningful volume,” the fact that trading is somewhat more evenly spread geographically worldwide probably only marginally helps the case for a bitcoin ETF with the SEC. “But I don’t know that that was ever the main factor that the SEC was concerned about,” he says.\n\nAnd, as Daniel Masters, director of Global Advisors, which offers the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, mentioned in my podcast, other ETFs have underlying assets that trade heavily in China, such as a copper ETF.\n\nThe Fact Of The Amendment: Neutral\n\nIf the SEC intends not to approve a filing, it often will notify the involved parties who can then gracefully withdrawal. However, the fact that Winklevoss twins updated their proposal this week indicates either that the SEC has not made a decision, or that it has not notified them or the BATS Exchange, where their COIN ETF would list, that it won’t approve the filing.\n\n“Why go through the expense of filing this extra S-1 if you think it won’t be approved?” says Bogart, referring to the name of the registration form.\n\nA Technical Matter In The Update: Negative\n\nHowever, the substance of the update has raised a red flag. One of the challenges with putting a cryptocurrency like bitcoin into an ETF form stems from the fact that bitcoin is created by software run by thousands of computers worldwide. As long as the computers are all in agreement in certain ways, that software will only support one version of bitcoin. But sometimes, upgrades to the network will require changes that run the risk of two versions of the currency being produced, each with their own value determined by market demand. This change is known as a hard fork.\n\n(A well-known hard fork in another cryptocurrency called Ethereum last summer did actually result in two different currencies — Ether and Ether Classic — much as if there was a shadow dollar that traded around but was worth only a fraction of the dollar that was more widely used.)\n\nThe updated Winklevoss filing describes how the trust would determine which coin to accept in the event of a hard fork (it would opt for the network that had “the greatest” computing power after 48 hours), but people with technical knowledge of hard forks believe the plan to be insufficient and in fact somewhat dangerous, as it could expose the ETF to market manipulation. (The events that gave rise to Ether Classic occurred more than 48 hours after the hard fork.) Even if the twins re-filed to amend this, the fact that the contingency plans for potentially serious events in bitcoin are being revised somewhat last-minute does give Bogart pause. “How is the SEC going to look at this and be OK with that risk?”\n\nStill, overall, Bogart believes if the SEC disapproved the ETF, it would likely hinge on concerns about bitcoin itself rather than on any specific aspect of the Winklevoss filing.\n\nThe Trump Administration’s Priorities: Negative\n\nWhile the Trump administration would seem to be somewhat sympathetic to bitcoin — its nominee for White House budget director is known bitcoin proponent Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina — it likely has higher priorities than bitcoin on its agenda.\n\nDavid Brill, the former lawyer for Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange run by the Winklevoss twins, who recently remarked that he thought approval was unlikely, says, “When you look at what’s on the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and SEC’s plate collectively, blockchain broadly speaking is going to get some attention, but I don’t know if the agencies will want to put a lot of resources to bitcoin and blockchain, because other things are higher priorities.”\n\nOther obstacles could be the directive to remove two regulations for every one that’s incorporated, the hiring freeze and the fact that the CFTC is only operating with three commissioners instead of the full five.\n\n“That’s not a lot of bandwidth to be dealing with what may be viewed as extraneous products or issues in the grand scheme of things for the commissioners,” says Brill.\n\nIndications In The Market\n\nFor a long while, it seemed as if the cryptocurrency community expected the Bitcoin ETF to be approved. But a few market movements indicate that sentiment is currently mixed.\n\nBitmex, an offshore exchange for cryptocurrency derivatives, currently offers a contract that allows for speculation on the approval odds for a bitcoin ETF. It has been trading below 50% (at 40% as of press time), though the market is thinly traded.\n\nFor a long while, GBTC, whose price is pegged at one-tenth of one bitcoin, has traded at a premium to bitcoin itself, indicating pent-up demand for an investment vehicle that would provide exposure to bitcoin in an investment portfolio. However, that premium has dropped significantly in recent months. At about 100% last summer, it is now less than 20%.\n\nBogart hypothesizes that some of this could be due to speculators shorting the stock if they think approval of a bitcoin ETF is likely. It could also be attributed to investors who bought GBTC through the private placement selling in order to lock in that premium now, since it would likely disappear if the ETF is approved.\n\n“That premium is essentially free money on the table,” says Bogart, “so you might say, I’ll take my 15% premium and buy bitcoin instead.”\n\nFinally, the premium could be lessening simply because the value of bitcoin has gone up so much recently, while the demand for GBTC may have either stayed the same or increased at a slower rate. (However, for Feb. 10, the market price went up by about 1.5%, in contrast to the price of the private placement falling almost 3%.)\n\nImpact Of Decision On Price\n\nIf approved, a bitcoin ETF would drive up the price of bitcoin significantly. Bogart estimates that at least $300 million in assets would flow into a bitcoin ETF in its first week, which would outpace typical volumes, which have typically ranged from $15 million to $30 million traded daily against the dollar, though over the last month or two, volumes have been more in the $30 million to $60 million range. “Regardless, at either of these levels, it would be difficult to source $300 million of bitcoin over a few days without drastically increasing price,” writes Bogart in his report on GBTC, updated Friday.\n\nHe also posits that the boost in reputation, lower perceived regulatory risk and media attention would increase the price.\n\nHowever, his imagined scenario for disapproval isn’t all that pessimistic. Though it might cause the price to dip, he writes, “The vast majority of owners will continue holding bitcoin regardless of the SEC’s decision and would likely welcome the opportunity to buy at a lower price.”\n\nBe sure not to miss the podcast episode in which two bitcoin industry experts square off on the prospects for bitcoin ETF approval. Listen on the web, Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio.', ""TumbleBit is probably one of the most promising technological advancements built on top of Bitcoin to date. Not only does it offer one of the best — if not the best — privacy related innovations so far, it can also provide significant scaling benefits as a payment hub. The solution is also fully compatible with the current Bitcoin protocol and, most important, it is in an advanced stage of development.\n\n\n\n“The prospect is good that before summer we will have software that regular users can safely use,” one of TumbleBit’s inventors, Ethan Heilman, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nNTumbleBit\n\nTumbleBit has made a good deal of progress in little time. The idea was first proposed last summer by Heilman, Leen AlShenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg. The group of university researchers also coded up a proof of concept and even made successful test transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Shortly after, in September, Heilman and AlShenibr presented their proposal at Scaling Bitcoin Milan, where it was very well received: enthusiasts even made two different trailers celebrating the innovation.\n\nInspired by its potential, author of the book “Programming The Blockchain in C#” and NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier started working on his own implementation of TumbleBit in the C# programming language, called NTumbleBit.\n\n“His work is very impressive, so we decided to move over to it, and NTumbleBit is now the official TumbleBit implementation,” Heilman explained. “Much progress has been made over the past months, and we are now working to ensure that the software is as secure as it can be, and as tested as it can be. We are also building the operational tools necessary for it to be deployed in production.”\n\nTumbleBit merges several cryptographic tricks to allow for a completely trustless coin mixing service. In “Classic Tumbler mode,” all users connect through a central TumbleBit server and send coins to one another in such a way that everyone receives as much as they sent. Using a series of clever cryptographic tricks, this is done so no one can steal coins and no one knows who’s sending bitcoins to whom, not even the central server. Hundreds of users can participate at the same time, thereby obfuscating blockchain trails and, in turn, vastly improving Bitcoin privacy for everyone involved.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Dorier explained how this is done with his NTumbleBit implementation.\n\n“Users will need to use a Bitcoin Core full node as a wallet; pruning mode is fine, so they don’t need to store the entire blockchain,” he said. “Then, the NTumbleBit client slowly drains all the coins from the wallet, and connects to the NTumbleBit server to mix them. Completely different coins are returned to the user, preferably to an HD public key for light wallets, though the Bitcoin Core wallet is an option too. The whole process can take a couple of hours depending on the amount to mix, but then everyone will have a completely different batch of coins.”\n\nDorier completed a first iteration of the NBitcoin software and has stepped back from active development.\n\nUsability\n\nNow, others are picking up where Dorier left off.\n\nAs an important next step, the co-author of Dorier’s C# Bitcoin book, Ficsór Ádám, traveled to Tokyo — where Dorier lives — to help with Tor integration.\n\nAnonymizing through Tor may be needed to ensure that the NTumbleBit server can operate as a hidden service. Not all regulators will be very happy with the existence of such a coin mixing tool, and it is possible TumbleBit server operators may encounter trouble when providing the service. (This is also one of the reasons Dorier hasn’t tested the implementation on main net himself, and is instead sticking to testnet.)\n\nBut Tor integration is also very much required for TumbleBit to work as advertised, at least in Classic Tumbler mode, Ádám explained.\n\n“In Classic Tumbler mode, everyone is effectively sending bitcoins to themselves,” he said. “Everyone receives new bitcoins, so it breaks the blockchain links. But if everyone communicates with the TumbleBit server through their own IP addresses, that server can easily re-establish the link: it can simply link the IP addresses of sending and receiving Bitcoin addresses and conclude it’s the same person. That’s solved with Tor.”\n\nAnd then, of course, TumbleBit must actually be made usable — and not only usable for command-line techies, but for regular users as well. After all, the greater the number of people who use TumbleBit, the greater the number of Bitcoin addresses that get mixed together. This increases the anonymity set and therefore benefits everyone’s privacy, including that of command-line techies.\n\nThis step is being realized by Dan Gould. An undergraduate at Boston University, Gould is working on a graphic user interface for NTumbleBit. This user interface should make mixing coins with TumbleBit as easy as clicking a button.\n\nAll in all, Heilman expects that the first working and usable release of NTumbleBit may be available within months.\n\n“It’s hard to say with certainty, but many of the pieces are in place, and there should be even more people working on NTumbleBit in March, including myself and Leen,” he said.\n\nPayment Hub\n\nFinally, TumbleBit is capable of more than just increasing privacy.\n\nTumbleBit in Classic Tumbler mode may be the best mixing solution for Bitcoin so far (ValueShuffle is another candidate). But in “Payment Hub mode,” a TumbleBit server can, indeed, act as a payment hub. Not unlike the lightning network, this allows users to transact with other users “off-chain” for an extended period of time. If both a customer and a merchant are connected to the TumbleBit server, for example, the customer can make a payment in bitcoin, while neither the customer nor the merchant (nor the tumbler) learn anything about each other’s Bitcoin addresses.\n\n“While we have no timelines yet, we are definitely building Payment Hub mode as well,” Heilman acknowledged. “But our first goal is Classic Tumbler mode; that is 95 percent of the work from a coding perspective.”\n\nAnd, as with so many of Bitcoin’s tech innovations, TumbleBit could also benefit from Segregated Witness (“SegWit”). The protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team would solve Bitcoin’s long-standing malleability bug; however, adoption of the proposal currently seems uncertain.\n\n“SegWit is an across-the-board win for anything doing anything with payment channels,” Heilman said. “The biggest advantages are for TumbleBit in Payment Hub mode, as it would allow for more flexibility in payments and an overall smoother user experience. If SegWit happens, then some of the research I'm working on now to improve TumbleBit will happen on Bitcoin. If SegWit doesn't happen, TumbleBit will still happen exactly as we planned, but my further research will probably target Litecoin or other coins with malleability fixes.”\n\nFor more on TumbleBit, read “With TumbleBit, Bitcoin Mixing May Have Found Its Winning Answer.”"", ""Disclaimer - the original article described the shop as a 'Bitcoin Bank' in line with several other news sources.

Asia, of course, houses most of the world\'s bitcoin trades, which drove a 160% rally against the dollar in the past 12 mos.', 'The price collapse of “black gold” locked Nigerians into their economy. Now, “digital gold” is providing some Nigerians with a way out.\n\n\n\nOnly three years ago, crude oil cost over $100 a barrel. But that peak came tumbling down. Throughout 2014 and 2015, oil prices took an almost unprecedented plunge to the $30 range, and is currently trading around $50 a barrel. As the lifeblood of Africa’s largest economy, Nigerian income from exports plunged with it.\n\nFaced with dwindling foreign currency reserves, Nigeria’s central bank was quick to impose capital controls. Whole industries were banned from importing goods; the Nigerian president wanted businesses to buy their products from domestic suppliers. Instead, this policy led to widespread shortages of raw materials, machine parts and supermarket products. Additionally, foreign currency–denominated Nigerian bank cards had strict spending limits imposed, preventing Nigerians from shopping abroad or paying overseas school fees.\n\nNigeria initially refused to devalue its currency, the naira (NGN), which was pegged to the U.S. dollar. However, that led to black market rates for U.S. dollars, increasing to levels almost double that of the official figures. As of June 2016, the naira exchange rate was finally allowed to float. As a result, the national currency fell by about 40 over the last year, according to official figures.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Bitcoin is gaining ground.\n\nTim Akinbo is a 35-year-old software developer and Bitcoin enthusiast from Nigeria, and the only person in West Africa running a full node.\n\n“There’s been quite some interest in bitcoin use in Nigeria recently,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “It’s definitely growing. The devaluation of the national currency is an obvious reason, as bitcoin serves as a hedge in that respect. But companies have also started to use bitcoin for imports. Either through companies like BitPesa, or individually. And Nigerians in the diaspora also increasingly use bitcoin to send money to their family and friends at home.”\n\nThis observation is perhaps best reflected in the increase in Nigerian trading volume on LocalBitcoins.com. This has regularly topped 400 million NGN ($1.2 million) per week, more than the entire eurozone combined. Moreover, the bitcoin exchange rate even reached some 500,000 NGN ($1,600) on Nigerian exchanges recently; similar premiums were previously seen in other countries faced with capital controls or monetary woes, like China and India.\n\nOther figures show similar trends. Of all countries, Nigeria tops the Google trend charts for most “Bitcoin” searches. Asked by Bitcoin Magazine, several wallet providers — including Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet, Breadwallet and BTC.com — reported significant relative growth in downloads from the African country: new installs in some cases increased around 2000% since October. And as another indicator of success, Africa-focused Bitcoin startup BitPesa secured a $2.5 million funding round from leading venture capital firms only last week.\n\nAlejandro De La Torre is the business development manager for Bitcoin wallet provider BTC.com, and speaking to Bitcoin Magazine he confirmed this sentiment.\n\n“Wallet downloads from Nigeria were only topped by the United States and India. For a developing country that’s not known to be very tech savvy, with relative high illiteracy, and that has less inhabitants than countries like China, Indonesia or Brazil, that had us very surprised,” De La Torre told Bitcoin Magazine. “We’re now in the process of setting up a meetup in Lagos, which already has 130 members signed up in three weeks. I think Bitcoin interest in Nigeria is growing exponentially.”\n\nThe MMM Ponzi Scheme\n\nThough, it seems there’s also a significantly more depressing explanation for the Bitcoin surge.\n\nUnfortunately, a largely illiterate populace hit with an economic downturn proved a fertile breeding ground for large-scale Ponzi schemes. The most famous of these, MMM, swept through several African countries over the past couple of years, including South Africa, Zimbabwe and — indeed — Nigeria. Similar, perhaps even bigger schemes, have been “successful” in Nigeria, too.\n\n“People were promised incredible returns on their investment if they’d put their money in these pyramid schemes,” Akinbo said. “And a couple months ago, some of these schemes introduced the option to fund and receive payments with bitcoin. Unfortunately — or fortunately depending on how you see it — a number of these schemes went bust toward the end of the year. A lot of people lost money in these schemes, and the few Ponzis that survived aren’t doing so well.”\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, financial regulators in Nigeria have started to take note as well. In a letter from the Nigerian central bank, addressed at financial institutions and virtual currency operations, bitcoin is listed in one breath with MLM scheme OneCoin. The central bank warned it may “address the Money Laundering / Terrorism Financing (ML/TF) risks associated with [digital currency] exchanges,” in order to “protect the integrity of the Nigerian financial system.”\n\nRegardless, Akinbo remains optimistic.\n\n“While these Ponzi schemes were bad news, they did expose many Nigerians to bitcoin for the first time. Bitcoin took a slight dip in trading volume and price but surprisingly continued to trade even after the demise of a number of the major schemes. I think we will see these Ponzi schemes disappear over time, while bitcoin might just stick around …”', 'Bitcoin demanding ransomware has become a common occurrence these days. People dread receiving a ransom note from cybercriminals responsible for launching attacks on critical IT infrastructure and web applications across the internet. Many times, such acts lead to massive losses while compromising the safety and security of those directly or indirectly affected by the attack. Few extortionists have decided to capitalize on the pre-existing fear by sending out fake threats.\n\nA cryptocurrency blog platform recently reported an increase in the fake threat emails demanding Bitcoin payments. These emails, mostly in poorly written English threatens to leak certain private information to family, friends, and employers. The people behind these email claim to have access to dirty secrets concerning the target, which might turn out to be shameful for them if released.\n\nThe blog also includes an example of one such email which contains the threat along with information on how to buy Bitcoin and where to send it. The criminals demand a payment of 1 BTC to resolve the situation.\n\nAn analysis of the threat email shows that it is not addressed to one particular person, but a general bulk mail which is being sent en masse. The blog also advises people not to react to such emails, even though the validity of such threats can’t be discounted.\n\nThere are numerous blackmail attempts in the past where the people behind it have demanded bitcoin in ransom. Many such cases arose in the wake of Ashley Madison hack, where the blackmailers in few cases made good on their threats as well.\n\nHowever, as any ransom demand is concerned, it is never a good idea to pay the cybercriminals. There is no guarantee that they will stick to the terms after extorting the money from their victims. In order to avoid such situation, people should strictly follow safe internet usage practices.\n\nThe importance of keeping one’s software and security applications updated has been stressed upon by multiple publications, including NewsBTC in many occasions. Also, most malicious software is spread through emails and downloads from untrusted sources. If anyone receives an email, with an attachment from unknown sources, they are better off not opening it as it may contain malware or ransomware that can compromise the system.\n\nRecently, a cybersecurity firm Cyren identified a malware that was spread through emails disguised as fund transfer notification from reputed banks. The malware could steal personal information and also cryptocurrency from a range of wallet applications.\n\nIn the end, it always serves well to be protected than becoming victims of cybercrime.\n\nRef: Cryptomining Blog | Image: Kaspersky', 'A Washington DC lawyer was recently arrested after attempting to bribe a tech company for $310,000 in Bitcoin in exchange for details on a whistleblower case filed against it.\n\nWearing a wig and using the moniker ‘Dan’, Jeffrey Wertkin wanted payment in the cryptocurrency and in return would swap the case details to the accused tech firm.\n\nWertkin, 40, a former partner at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, contacted a “high ranking” employee at an unnamed California tech firm last year, claiming to possess a sealed lawsuit filed against them, according to court documents released by the FBI.\n\nTo prove he was genuine, Wertkin mailed a redacted version of the first page of the lawsuit to the company.\n\nUnder US law, the government does not have to notify a company under investigation as long as the complaint has been permitted by a court to remain under seal.\n\nBelieving a head start in any potential legal proceedings would be of interest to the company, ‘Dan’ asked for $310,000 in “untraceable” Bitcoin in exchange for the document.\n\nAfter liaising with the company to arrange a meeting, ‘Dan’ waited in a California hotel for his bounty, but was instead busted by the FBI.\n\n“My life is over,” Wertkin said as the agent arrested him.

02/11/2017,"['Bitcoin price has not taken a hit or is not likely to experience further shake up as BTCC announced it is suspending aspects of transactions including the withdrawal of digital currencies traded on its platform.\n\nIt is joining two other top Bitcoin exchanges - OKCoin and Huobi - which had on Thursday, Feb. 9 announced the suspension of their trading activities.\n\nIn their separate announcements, the two exchanges cite that the suspension which is as a result of their upgrading of an anti-money laundering AML system in accordance with China’s laws and regulations could last for a month.\n\nBitcoin price picks up\n\nBitcoin price dropped by about 10 percent immediately after the news came out as there were reports of panic-selling since the announcements.

Whether this is just a coincidence cannot be confirmed.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Nelson M Rosario is an intellectual property attorney working as an associate at Marshall, Gerstein & Borun in Chicago. He has years of experience working on patent prosecution matters in bitcoin/blockchain and fintech, as well as other areas.\n\nIn this CoinDesk opinion piece, Rosario ponders why we have developed so many terms for what is effectively the same technology – bitcoin.\n\n“What’s in a name? That which we call an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust by any other name would smell as sweet.”\n\n– William 'Satoshi' Shakespeare (probably)\n\nIn the beginning, there was 'bitcoin', and it was good. But, bitcoin would end up bearing a nomenclature fruit salad that tests mortal comprehension. Perhaps, that is the natural way of things.\n\nAs a new technology develops, the number of people exposed to that new technology increases, and the language used to describe the new technology evolves.\n\nInitially, the language was limited to bitcoin. Now a person is liable to see any of the following words or phrases that theoretically all mean different things: bitcoin, Bitcoin, block chain, blockchain, Blockchain, private blockchain, public blockchain, distributed ledger technology, distributed asset ledgers, decentralized ledger technology, shared ledgers, et al.\n\nFurther confusing the matter, the term bitcoin may not always mean the same thing to different people. What happened? Why the change in language?\n\nFirst, bitcoin has the word 'coin' right in it. This naturally makes people think of currency. Not surprisingly, bitcoin use as a currency is far and away the most successful iteration of bitcoin. The applications for bitcoin are not, however, limited to currency.\n\nThis is where much of the confusion arises. Intuitively, the currency implementation for bitcoin (with the word coin in it) makes sense. Trying to convince someone that bitcoin can also be used for purposes as diverse as asset transfers, escrow services, or logistics management is not so straightforward.\n\nBitcoin also suffers from an image problem. The early publicity surrounding bitcoin included scandals, thefts, a euphoria akin to the Tulip bubble, and in general, bad press. 'Fake internet money', as some people called bitcoin, did not inspire confidence amongst the masses.\n\nAdditionally, the main advocates for the new technology were unpolished and unproven. Often if someone had heard of bitcoin they had heard of the failed Mt Gox exchange, or they assumed bitcoin was something a person used to buy illicit drugs or hire a hitman. The reality was not that far off.\n\nHow do you get people to forget about the failed exchanges, drugs, and hitmen? Get them to focus on 'the technology underlying bitcoin', and get them to think about the other potential implementations. Once the conversation moved beyond currency, people started searching for a new word. That search led them to the blockchain.\n\nThe rise of the blockchain\n\nNegative publicity and conceptual confusion laid the groundwork for people to begin to refer to the blockchain as the real innovation to come out of the bitcoin phenomenon.\n\nThe blockchain is a chain of transactions that makes bitcoin possible. The term refers to a collection of bitcoin transactions grouped together into blocks and linked through cryptography. This linkage is part of what makes it virtually impossible to fake bitcoin transactions.\n\nIn a sense, the blockchain provides true decentralized trust and distributed consensus, but the rebranding, or reorienting of people’s attention, to the blockchain and away from bitcoin may be just a clever marketing trick.\n\nMany people argue that you cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin. The thinking is that you cannot break up bitcoin into its component parts because the parts by themselves will not work the same way independent of each other. In other words, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Regardless of whether this is correct, that is precisely what people have done.\n\nOnce the power of bitcoin became apparent, we started to see article after article touting the 'real innovation' behind bitcoin. Respectable and well-established firms began developing blockchain solutions to their problems.\n\nPeople consistently discredited bitcoin as boring, while extolling the virtues of the multifaceted blockchain. Large banks, financial exchanges, and the 'Big Four' consultancies all rushed to publish reports on blockchain technology. The hype train that left the station heading to Bitcoinland was diverted to Blockchainville.\n\nThere are now hundreds of blockchain startups. Problems related to back end services for large institutions, digital identity, asset transfer, escrow, and logistics, are all being tackled by blockchain solutions. Even tracking pork along a blockchain has been proposed. These companies are doing truly innovative work.\n\nHowever, to many observers the term 'blockchain' is still conceptually associated with bitcoin. So, if a company describes an innovation that leverages a type of blockchain they have to distinguish it from bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain. How do blockchain companies talk about what they are doing without referencing bitcoin, or other blockchains? The solution is to talk about ledgers.\n\nThe arrival of distributed ledger technology\n\nA ledger can record transactions between multiple parties. The ledger concept is a main building block of bitcoin and any blockchain. Ledgers also benefit from the fact that they are commonly thought of as boring, safe, and dependable tools in an accountant’s toolbox, as opposed to the technological innovation that makes bitcoin possible.\n\nWhat better way to put thoughts of bitcoin and blockchain out of people’s minds than insisting that you are only talking about ledger technology? Thus, the conceptual chain to bitcoin was broken.\n\nHowever, there remains considerable debate over whether this is feasible or even desirable. To early adopters, bitcoin is a monolith that cannot exist without distributed trust, consensus, and immutability, but many new industry entrants view the technology as an a la carte buffet. They are free to decide between many concepts including: permissioned vs permissionless, public vs private, tokenized vs no token, etc.\n\nToday any institution or organization that refers to ledgers is free to discuss bitcoin or blockchain related concepts, without the supposed taint of bitcoin. Even the Federal Reserve Board (of Federal Reserve Bank fame), has touted ledgers in their recent report on “Distributed Ledger Technology.”\n\nOver the past two years, hundreds of new blockchains and ledgers have been created. They all draw on the root concepts of bitcoin, but their purposes and the lingo used to describe them have diverged widely. This conceptual repackaging, and public relations approved language replacement, is likely to continue for some time.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThis story has gone from bitcoin to blockchain to distributed ledger technology. There are companies that operate in all of these spaces, or only one of them.\n\nOutside observers are forgiven if they struggle to keep up with all the different terms. Yet, through all of this evolution and upheaval, bitcoin has remained central to the discussion. Whether bitcoin, the blockchain, and distributed ledgers will be adopted and thrive or consigned to the ash heap of history remains to be seen.\n\nThe fact that bitcoin has undergone repeated repackaging is a testament to the strength of the technology. Other blockchains or related technologies may rise and fall, but bitcoin’s inertia and first-mover advantage will continue to make it the most relevant cryptocurrency, blockchain, and ledger.\n\nEvolution image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The RBI suggested users to actively look into the risk and unpredictability of Bitcoin trading before they initiate in any activities involving Bitcoin or other digital currencies.\n\nSaurabh Agarwal, co-founder of Bitcoin trading and wallet company Zebpay stated:\n\n“While we have been planning to create an association for some time, we finally pushed things after the circular.”\n\nBlockchain consortia\n\nOver the past two years, leading banks, financial institutions and Blockchain companies have formed various consortia in countries like the US and China to ensure any developer of Blockchain technology within the realm of finance are compliant with local regulations and policies.\n\nConsortia such as Hyperledger or R3CEV are leading Blockchain innovation and development by cooperating with regulators and lawmakers to assist Blockchain startups and financial institutions in understanding fundamental regulations in place. The establishment of such consortia has significantly lessened regulatory conflicts between regulators and companies, creating a more viable environment for technological development.\n\nLack of Bitcoin associations\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin industry is yet to see the formation of consortia led by industry leaders to discuss and come to a consensus on important matters. The establishment of an industry-wide association grants Bitcoin companies and Blockchain startups the ability to collectively bargain with regulators.\n\nMajor companies join forces\n\nThe Blockchain and Virtual currency Association of India formed by leading Bitcoin exchanges, companies and Blockchain firms are the first of its kind which brings Blockchain and Bitcoin companies together.

The four companies represent the Bitcoin industry as Zebpay, Unocoin and Coinsecure hold the majority of market share of the Bitcoin exchange and wallet market. In upcoming months, the association plans to add 20 small startups and Blockchain firms.\n\nIndian Bitcoin exchanges such as Unocoin have been a few of the fastest growing Bitcoin firms in all of 2016. Developers and industry leaders such as Blockstream CEO Adam Back also commented on the rapid growth of the Indian Bitcoin industry, stating:\n\n""India represents a massive growth opportunity for Bitcoin and Unocoin who are on the cutting edge of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.”', ""As three main Bitcoin exchanges in China lock the withdrawal of the currency on their platforms, a strategist with the macroeconomic research firm Lamoureux & Co. is sure that Bitcoin will reach a target of $25,000 or more.\n\nThough the news of the Chinese exchange's actions have caused the Bitcoin price to drop by almost 10 percent, it is gradually gaining strength again.\n\nYves Lamoureux states in a piece that most key ingredients found in past bubbles are now present for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to appeal to hard asset investors — or a rare chance to get in on a venture capital style bet.\n\nReserve currency\n\nThis projection by the chief behavioral strategist is somewhat in line with that shared by the CEO of Netcoins, Michael Vogel, who says there have been predictions about Bitcoin becoming a government world reserve currency by 2020. If and when that happens, it is expected to skyrocket the Bitcoin price, though it isn’t clear how high it would go by then.\n\nSimilarly, multi-bln dollar investor Tim Draper, who believes that many investors now prefer to fund Bitcoin startups as a safer long-term option, is of the view that these new startups will increase in value in relation to the digital currency. As a result, Draper stuck to the prediction he had made about three years ago about the increasing Bitcoin value that it would have reached $10,000 by now. He still expects it in a year, though.\n\nLamoureux noted in a previous article that a central bank-fueled hyperinflation is set to take place in several years with cryptocurrencies as one of the newest benefactors of the hyperinflationary wave.\n\nIn this latest piece, however, he likened the projected rise of Bitcoin price to the pattern gold followed when it traded at $300 and employed primarily to avoid the dilution of fiat money to make investors care about keeping their purchasing power.\n\nHe notes that nothing has changed in how people trade since 100 years ago as long as they get the same set of incentives. He also touched on the need to convince the majority.\n\nHe writes:"", 'For the first time ever, bitcoin has been running above capacity for more than a week as transaction backlogs are now becoming a common experience with no indication of any solution in the near future.\n\nOn the 4th of February 2017, almost $1billion worth of bitcoin was stuck. It gradually went down, but never cleared, with around 300,000 bitcoins waiting to move. Yesterday, that went up again to almost 900,000. The mempool is usually full and the network now runs at around 3-4 txs per second when it can only handle around 2.5.\n\nThis complete transformation has had an effect on everyone. In public forums, on social media, at bitcoin businesses, at mining farms, nothing is given more attention for a prolonged period than transaction capacity. Even occasional bitcoin users and traders who never cared about scalability now bring it up everywhere with different individuals periodically complaining about still waiting for a confirmation after many hours.\n\nSome try to help. ViaBTC, a new pool that strongly supports Bitcoin Unlimited – a grassroots client which increases transaction capacity by turning the maxblocksize limit of 1MB into a soft limit – launched a Transaction Accelerator which prioritizes any transaction that has paid more than 0.0001 BTC/KB, up to 100 transactions per hour, but it only solves one bitcoiner’s problem at the expense of another.\n\nThat’s because transaction space has now become even worse than a zero-sum game as block variance – one block might not be found in an hour – and difficulty adjustments, means that, sometimes, all transactions are suddenly sent to the back of the queue because newer transactions, with higher fee estimates, take their place.\n\nThis isn’t a coincidence. The unspoken plan (publicly implied if not at times expressly stated) is for the current situation to continue so that higher fees reduce demand for on-chain transactions to the point where everyone, but financial institutions, are priced out, thus “solving” the problem.\n\nBitcoin – The Banks Clearing House?\n\nAccording to proponents of bitcoin as a settlement, fees should be so high that no one can afford to pay them unless they are extremely wealthy or a bank. Ordinary transactions are “spam.” – they say. Implying that only bank transactions are genuine. Bitcoin’s blockchain is not for everyday purchases, – they argue. Implying that bitcoin’s public blockchain should be reserved only for banks.\n\nThey are trying to replicate the current financial system which uses clearing houses – centralized, usually private, for profit, institutions that act as a buyer to every seller and a seller to every buyer. The most known example being the SWIFT network.\n\nOrdinary users cannot access this network – they have to go through a bank (a trusted intermediary). Banks then move their money by first sending it to SWIFT, which confirms its veracity and validity, and once it does so sends it to its destination – usually another bank.\n\nIn practice, it is far more complex with clearing houses within clearing houses, but the settlement idea suggests that we should replicate it with bitcoin by using bitbanks – now known as Lightning Network hubs – with its very different trust model. Then, bitbanks, instead of using SWIFT, use bitcoin’s public blockchain purely as a clearing house only.\n\nThat public blockchain would have fees that are so high – maybe $400, perhaps $10,000 or even in the hundreds of thousands – that no ordinary user or company would pay.\n\nIt has some benefits over the current system because it would increase efficiency compared to centralized, largely non-automated SWIFT, but there would be added direct costs as third-parties are re-introduced and many indirect costs.\n\nBitbanks would act as gatekeepers, free to censor transactions, deny service, close “accounts,” and – eventually – be fully regulated, require a license, etc. As on-chain fees would be so high – at a world scale probably in the hundreds of thousands – smaller bitbanks would not really be able to compete. A Wikileaks friendly bitbank might not be able to rise, allowing for a successful cut-off of all monetary functions.\n\nThis is clearly not a peer to peer system, it’s a bank to bank system. The current bitcoin network allows anyone to send a transaction to anyone in a direct peer to peer fashion without permission from anyone and for any reason. No one can censor it, no one can ask for the creation of an “account,” no one can deny service. No one can withhold this money for any period of time.\n\nBut, if the public blockchain remains accessible to all – as is currently the case – running a node might be more expensive if technology does not keep up with demand for transactions.\n\nThe Bitcoin Nodes\n\nEach bitcoin node has to store and verify every transaction made on bitcoin’s public blockchain. That would not directly change under bitbanks, but the growth of the blockchain would be slower and, as technology progresses, it may require less direct resources for a full node while requiring added resources for hubs.\n\nUnder direct public blockchain access, as technology progresses, node costs might reduce, but not to the same extent as under bitbanks. More likely, they remain around the same or even slightly increase.\n\nThe proponents of bitbanks argue we can not have that because of a potential increase in the costs of running a node would lead to their reduction. That implies a decrease in costs would lead to an increase in nodes. A factual question which can, to a great extent (while trying to eliminate external one-off factors), be answered by a scientific study as the bitcoin network has been running for more than eight years.\n\nAs such, it is relatively easy to research bandwidth, storage, etc., costs in a four years’ time period (or whenever lightnodes became prominent) and compare it to the number of full nodes, but this hasn’t been done despite almost two years of very public debate.\n\nFrom observation, the number of publicly reachable nodes has remained somewhat constant – there have been around 5,000 over the past three years. In the meantime, storage and bandwidth has become cheaper, potentially indicating that the number of full nodes is affected more by other factors than just monetary costs, such as inconvenience.\n\nWhat’s in a Node?\n\nA node is a computer software program that applies a number of rules to validate transactions. It rejects, for example, the attempt of a rouge miner to send you fake bitcoins. It can also provide you information on whether someone is trying to double spend.\n\nIf all nodes are applying the same rules, they enforce honesty. On the other hand, if all mining nodes are applying different rules to all non-mining nodes, the latter stop working. We can change the distribution to some or a majority of non-mining/mining nodes, but the main objective analysis remains the same.\n\nThat is, nodes, by themselves, have no power where genuine network wide differences of opinions on the applicable rules are concerned. That would be a question for miners in non-dishonest situations. But, nodes do have a say where actual and objective dishonesty is concerned.\n\nThis can allow for the formation of some sort of objective conclusion. Where there is a publicly discussed difference of opinion on potential directions, rationally and objectively, as well as according to the whitepaper, it cannot be anyone else but the miners who must be the judges as they are best incentivized and positioned to make the decision.\n\nWhere there is no public discussion and the action is secretive, covert or dishonest, then almost all network wide nodes are in agreement, therefore the software both denies the invalid transaction and informs you of it, allowing you to act on a coordinated basis.\n\nBoth of the above have exceptions. Non-mining nodes can be turned by human action into mining nodes by splitting off from the network. A full node, even if all of them are in agreement, cannot protect from the double spending of a rogue miner with more than 50% control of the network hashrate.\n\nBeyond rare exceptions, as nodes perform no function where there is a publicly discussed and genuine disagreement, their function of ensuring honesty – whether directly by rejecting invalid transactions or indirectly by providing information when almost all nodes are in agreement – can be provided, to a large extent, by light nodes which connect to full nodes.\n\nLightnodes require almost no resources, making them the primary choice over full nodes for two main reasons. Firstly, you can’t run a full node on a smartphone. Secondly, running a full node on a laptop makes your computer clunky, heavy, requiring much CPU, slowing down performance, and an overall hassle.\n\nAs such, most bitcoin users show no interest in operating a full node as, for an ordinary bitcoiner, there is little to gain by doing so and much inconvenience. It is also unnecessary as far as they individually are concerned because lightnodes provide to a great extent a fully acceptable service.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin related businesses need to run a node as they deal with so many transactions they require information as soon as possible. This suggests that increasing bitcoin businesses should, in theory, increase the number of nodes, but, since 2013, their numbers appear to have remained somewhat stable with falling businesses replaced by new ones entering the bitcoin market from developing countries.\n\nCorporate Bitcoin?\n\nProponents of bitbanks argue that if running a node becomes so expensive only a few multinational co-operations can afford it, no one can say whether they are colluding and secretly breaching the rules to, for example, print bitcoins out of thin air. That is, even if all nodes are in agreement, they would not be able to perform their primary function of rejecting objectively dishonest behavior because they could all change their code to dishonest behavior and no one would know.\n\nThis argument requires the exercise of imagination in an attempt to predict the future – an impossible task, but let us try. A world where multinationals are running huge servers which only perform the function of acting as a node is a world where almost everyone is transacting in bitcoin. The value of the network would be so many trillions. Every house purchase, every sale, every coffee, would be in bitcoin.\n\nAny business that accept many payments would need to run a bitcoin node. Every university that claims some reputation would need one too so that future developers can gain the required knowledge. Independent businesses which provide node access would rise. Within banks, many developers would be required to man the nodes. Governments would probably consider them as vital infrastructure for the nation’s security.\n\nEven if we do not imagine the other incredible transformations and the clear benefits bitcoin would have provided to so many to reach such scale, a global co-ordination between all countries and businesses, for profit and non-profit, which necessarily would include so many people, appears impossible if the intentions are dishonest. If the intentions are honest, how on earth can we possibly form any opinion considering it would be a global co-ordination, enemy governments agreeing, their citizens too, all businesses, etc.\n\nBut, since this is just an imaginative exercise with very limited information and a mountain of unknown unknowns, different scenarios can be portrayed as one pleases. The exercise, therefore, is subjective, speculative, not based on scientific thinking and just a mere opinion with no facts.\n\nTo illustrate, if we look back just thirty years ago, we would find ourselves in a time with no cell-phones – let alone smart phones – when computers were nearly as big as houses and, later on, when 640KB was enough for everyone. More concretely, what 80s adult would have even remotely imagined the current discussion?\n\nBitcoin – The Payment Network\n\nWe cannot predict the future. What we do know is that the bitcoin community has in fact reached wide consensus on what affects today and the near future.\n\nEvery reasonable and objective bitcoiner agrees that a fourfold increase of transaction capacity is “safe.” Segregated Witnesses, a proposal supported by many Bitcoin Core developers, increases transaction capacity to 4MB in attack scenarios. A Cornell study found that 4MB would largely retain the current number of nodes. Miners have agreed to 8MB.\n\nThis is consensus. Therefore, the current stalemate has nothing to do with technology. It is, instead, a needless and very harmful division of bitcoin’s community. Its effect has been to hamper bitcoin’s current function as a payment network. An effect that proponents of the bitbank network will readily admit or willingly imply by calling ordinary transactions “spam”, thus seemingly stating that only bitbank transactions are not spam. Or stating that bitcoin is not for “ordinary transactions,” thus implying its only for the use of banks.\n\nNonetheless, around 46% of miners do not seem to care. Although bitcoin has now become even slower than cross-border payments within Europe, as well as an experience far more inconvenient than a bank transfer, while at the same time providing no added benefit save for an easily replicated limited number of coins, they do not act.\n\n“This makes me sad.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Enthusiasm among Hong Kong’s bitcoin entrepreneurs has waned since its peak in 2013 and they blame regulators and banks for making it difficult for their businesses to gain traction in the city.\n\nChoking regulations on bitcoin by governments in the United States and Great Britain saw Hong Kong receive an exodus of entrepreneurs between 2013 and 2014. They felt the regulations were detrimental to their cryptocurrency-based businesses, and Hong Kong had a more favourable environment.\n\nAround this period, the price of bitcoin was increasing and hit a record price of US$1,216.\n\nThe first bitcoin ATM was introduced in Hong Kong to much fanfare in 2014. At its peak, there were 10 bitcoin ATMs in Hong Kong. Today, there are only four left.\n\nChinese bitcoin investors see holdings partly frozen\n\nIt feels like two years ago talk of bitcoin started going down,” bitcoin entrepreneur James Bang said.\n\nBang believes uncertainty from Hong Kong regulators has contributed to decreasing enthusiasm in bitcoin. He cited Singapore as more favourable for bitcoin businesses because the city-state has laid out clear rules and regulations.\n\n“The uncertainly is why [bitcoin companies] could not get investment. Investors don’t like uncertainty,” he said.\n\nAccording to the president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, Leo Weese, the regulatory uncertainly led to one foreign exchange shop in Central having its bitcoin ATM removed by the Customs and Excise Department.\n\nThe department did not confirm or deny removing the ATM, but said “any person who wishes to operate a money service is required to obtain a money service operator licence” to comply with local anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws.\n\nBang said if all regulators came together and laid out the rules clearly for bitcoin entrepreneurs it would bring confidence to them and investors.\n\n“I think regulators should be less risk averse, it is not their obligation to shield the Hong Kong economy from people losing money or other negative things,” Weese said.\n\nHong Kong banks are also receiving some of the blame for impeding bitcoin and other fintech-related businesses by not opening bank accounts or providing financial services.\n\n“In the case of many banks it’s a red flag,” co-founder of money remittance platform Bitspark, George Harrap, said.\n\n“They don’t care about what your compliance requirements are, or if you already have a licence, or you’ve been operating for 10 years.”\n\nChina’s bitcoin market: another ticking time bomb?\n\nHowever information technology legislator Charles Mok did not believe it was the fault of regulators, but rather the bitcoin “fad” was dying down due to a lack of practical applications.\n\n“Recently in fintech, the attention has been shifting away from bitcoin. It’s not like a few years ago when bitcoin was the poster child of new financial technologies,” he said.\n\n“I think it’s not truly about regulation but rather finding the right applications for bitcoin. There are just not a lot of transactions. It hasn’t really caught on.”\n\nHe also added that negative publicity had severely affected public trust in the cryptocurrency, citing examples of collapses of bitcoin exchanges and it being used as a ransom currency.\n\nBut Mok still believes there is a place for bitcoin technology, specifically blockchain – the electronic public ledger bitcoin is based on – and could have wide and practical uses.', 'Bitcoin is by default and by nature a currency which shows no respect for borders. One of the less popularized advantages of Bitcoin is that, through the power of encryption, immutable transactions are possible, as well as the ability to withhold funds from seizure. In the nations which are currently producing the most refugees, Bitcoin’s digitization is another great aspect of it – people are less likely to steal what they cannot see. A private key can be written and stored virtually anywhere. For all intents and purposes, Bitcoin is precisely the currency you would want if your world were torn apart by war and famine, provided you had some way to turn it into usable goods.\n\nAirBNB recently entered the political conversation by launching its #WeAccept campaign. The decentralized rental service made a stern political statement, despite having a bright and positive message, with the following commercial:\n\nThe sentiments expressed were not long ago what would be considered an “All-American” attitude. We urge the hungry, the tired, the broken to reach our shores and thrive in the land of the opportunity. For decades gone past, people from all corners of the globe have been able to do as much. Bitcoin’s resistance to regulatory jurisdiction, at the code level, is less of a political decision than it is a security matter. For it is obvious that if the state can compromise a Bitcoin transaction, someone else can, as well.\n\nBut as long as AirBNB is advertising an internationalist message, perhaps it should also adopt an internationally immutable payment method. AirBNB could increase its own take of fees placed on providers, and attract users who may struggle to provide other forms of digital payment. CEO Brian Chesky recently asked Twitter followers:\n\nIf @Airbnb could launch anything in 2017, what would it be? — Brian Chesky (@bchesky) December 26, 2016\n\nHe then came back and said:\n\nThanks for the 2,000 submissions. Most popular: Bitcoin, Guest Loyalty, upgraded homes & services, group travel, things to do, and Mars https://t.co/DbrBSTDlCl — Brian Chesky (@bchesky) December 30, 2016\n\nMultiple users had suggested Bitcoin. With things that can require later pull transactions such as rental services, the cryptocurrency has certain limitations that must be worked out within the solution in question.\n\nIt’s not possible, for instance, to bill a person’s Bitcoin wallet for funds previously authorized. The Bitcoin holder must choose to push the funds to the requestor. In implementation, this could mean that Bitcoin users would be required to pay more than the amount of the actual rental via AirBNB, and have the remainder of funds returned to them upon successful closing of the transaction.\n\nBut this writer is not here to talk about the technical implementation of Bitcoin for AirBNB. I am here to talk about the philosophical reasons for adopting Bitcoin, and potentially for refusing certain other payment methods which have shown themselves to be diametrically opposed to the views expressed by AirBNB. Credit card companies have willingly shut down freedom-fighting organizations like WikiLeaks as part of the “banking blockade.” Indeed, this episode in recent history was one of the most attention-bringing for Bitcoin, and one of Satoshi’s last memos expressed concern about\n\nCredit card companies have willingly shut down freedom-fighting organizations like WikiLeaks as part of the “banking blockade.” Indeed, this episode in recent history was one of the most attention-bringing for Bitcoin, and one of Satoshi’s last memos expressed concern about overflow government persecution:\n\nI make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.\n\nWhile the WikiLeaks project deferred to Satoshi at the time, they did later accept Bitcoin when it was flourishing. AirBNB accepting Bitcoin in order to protect the privacy of its users, as well as the peace of mind of its socially conscious board, seems an obvious plus for both parties. Chesky says the company has long considered the idea, but there is no time like the present. Intermingling the idea of a universal currency for a united race of humans would be a plus, but it’s unlikely anyone expects as much of the company.\n\nIntermingling the idea of a universal currency for a united race of humans would be a plus, but it’s unlikely anyone expects as much of the company.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
02/12/2017,"[""Bitcoin is showing signs of becoming a serious asset class.\n\nLast week's price swings hardly back up that assertion. The cryptocurrency dropped 7.8 percent on Thursday after news that the People's Bank of China threatened to shut exchanges that violate money-laundering rules. The announcement also prompted some of the biggest websites operating bitcoin in the country to halt withdrawals, limiting them to converting the digital coin to yuan and depositing it in local banks.\n\nTwo-day bounce in late 2013 70%\n\nFor all the volatility, though, there are indications that bitcoin is acting more grown up. Go back to December 2013, when the PBOC intervened after the cryptocurrency reached a record high of $1,137. It then dropped 51.4 percent in a week, only to bounce back about 70 percent in the next two days and fall below $600 in another week. Bitcoin then settled into a slow descent to $183 by January 2015.\n\nMaturing Bitcoin's wild swings hardly make it look like a mature market, but it's calmer than it was three years ago Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe latest swings followed a similar pattern. As soon as bitcoin breached $1,000, the Chinese authorities got involved and the price plunged. Last week, once again, that level was pierced, and once more the central bank entered the fray. On Monday, the price was little changed at $1,003.\n\nThe difference now is the magnitude of the moves. While the currency did fluctuate by double digits some days, these were nothing like the gyrations the PBOC prompted back in 2013.\n\nLess Fickle While bitcoin has been volatile, it's nothing like the old days Source: Bloomberg\n\nMovements deriving from black swan events for the currency are therefore much smaller and shorter-lived than they once were. There are some technical reasons for that: There's greater volume, circulation is broader, and the overall market is deeper.\n\nThe relative stability of bitcoin is probably also a result of the variety of instruments associated with it available to investors. People wanting to hedge their positions or even short the asset, for example, can use futures contracts traded through Bitmex.com, a marketplace that specializes in them. Investors can even use the platform to check whether the direction of the currency is changing.\n\nThe quarterly contract sold at Bitmex entered backwardation -- the future price fell below the spot price -- in January, shortly after the PBOC started cracking down on the exchanges. In a market with limited supply, the fact that most of the big traders are betting prices will go down must be bad news. So it proved, but this time hedging may have limited the downside.\n\nBitfinex, another site, has created an active marketplace for lending bitcoin to people who want to sell it short. The exchange even publishes an average daily rate for borrowing the currency, which has been going up in the past two weeks.\n\nBitcoin is still a small market, prone to dislocations, but as the variety of instruments around the currency grows, it's starting to look more like the real thing.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story:\n\nChristopher Langner in Singapore at clangner@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nPaul Sillitoe at psillitoe@bloomberg.net"", 'MMM Nigeria - a prominent multi-marketing Ponzi scheme - has recently announced that it is making a comeback enabling Bitcoin as a form of payment. MMM was founded by Sergei Mavrodi in Russia in the 1990s, the original scheme has collapsed resulting in participants losing billions of dollars.\n\nHowever, it has blossomed again with one simple model: participants committed to sending money to other participants and after a month, they got their ‘investments’ back plus 30 percent interest from other participants of the pyramid.\n\nThere is a high risk that this lending money chain will eventually collapse and millions of people will lose their money… again. However, the number of participants keeps growing, even despite the questionable logic of the whole enterprise and recent daunting events.\n\nIn mid-December 2016, MMM has frozen accounts of participants, reportedly, more than three million Nigerians were affected. The later statement said that the scheme had to temporarily suspend operations due to the heavy workload in the system.\n\nThe continuity and sustainability of the MMM Nigeria community depend on your actions and inactions. Always do the needful because #MMMPays. pic.twitter.com/t8L1CVAG18 — MMM Nigeria Support (@MMMNigeriaHelp) February 11, 2017\n\nNow with MAVRO-BTC\n\nRebooting operations a month later, MMM announced the introduction of Bitcoin-based currency, MAVRO-BTC, to “make participation in MMM more comfortable.” Prior to the freeze of participants’ accounts, MMM supported a number of transactions through Bitcoin, which were anyway recalculated into the Nigerian Naira.\n\nThe new scheme claims to enable payouts in Bitcoin, in addition to Nigeria’s fiat currency, the Naira. Referring to the Bitcoin’s recent price growth, it promises further returns in addition to a “30 percent monthly growth.” In the case of falling Bitcoin price, the scheme promises participants that they will be able to convert their balances from Bitcoins to Naira.\n\nPlotting its comeback plans MMM has been throwing a number of measures to get its community active again. Thus, participants were asked to complete a number of online and offline tasks to promote the scheme and drive traffic and participation. As apparently, participation in MMM implies not only opportunities but also responsibilities for the spread of MMM.\n\nRegulators warn the public\n\nThe National capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reacted in a timely manner and warned the public against investing in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe warning read:\n\n“The attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission has been drawn to radio advertisements and other modes of solicitations of the public to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Swisscoin, OneCoin, Bitcoin and other such virtual or digital currencies. The public is hereby advised to exercise extreme caution with regard to digital cryptocurrencies as a vehicle for investments.”\n\nThe regulator reminded that currently none of the companies advertising cryptocurrency-related investments were recognized or authorized to receive deposits, therefore there will be no consumer protection available to those investing in digital currencies if the scheme goes bust.\n\n- Source: AFP/Getty\n\nA scheme for money laundering\n\nInvestigators are worried that despite the fact that Bitcoin is traded by legitimate users and more retailers are accepting it as a form of payment, international criminals often turn to cryptocurrency, is what definitely puts a stain on its reputation.\n\nDanny Myburgh, Managing Director at Cyanre, specializing in computer crime investigations, commented:\n\n“They are using it because it is very difficult to trace. You try and follow the money trace and it disappears into cyberspace. The scheme could further launder money by moving it between various Bitcoin wallets.”\n\nAfter all, for whom is the use of Bitcoin in this scheme going to be more comfortable?', 'Despite the UK government’s pro-blockchain stance, commercial banks have put a dozen or more bitcoin exchanges out of business by denying or withdrawing facilities. Without a fundamental change in approach, the banking sector will hamstring progress in this ‘bleeding-edge’ sector of fintech, forcing cryptocurrency entrepreneurs to work outside of the national banking system in the process.\n\nOf course bitcoin is perfectly legal in the UK although unregulated, but the hub of the matter centres on the banks’ attitude to the cryptocurrency in this country and that they “won\'t play nice”. That is according to one crypto protagonist I spoke to at the recently held Blockchain Expo London event late this January.\n\nAnd, so it would appear given recent history in the sector with a host of exchanges having hit the buffers and gone out of business - all despite the British government’s approach to blockchain.\n\nJust take the following email message issued by Cryptopay, a bitcoin brokerage. It will barely have come as a surprise to the majority of Cryptopay’s British customers, especially those who have been active in the bitcoin world for more than a few months.\n\n“I regret to inform you that starting from 1st February, British Pound deposits and withdrawals are no longer supported by Cryptopay due to updated bank policies.”\n\nIt’s a message that has been repeated time and time again ever since bitcoin first gained a measure of popularity in the UK, and with it, the need to exchange the digital currency for Sterling (GBP).\n\nCryptopay allows people to buy and sell bitcoin easily. Not so easily any more, however. Cancellation of GBP deposit and withdrawal facilities means they are limited to SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) transfers, making the service all but useless to most British customers.\n\nNeither is Cryptopay alone. Over the past three or four years, perhaps a dozen or more UK bitcoin exchanges and brokerages have launched and floundered as their banking facilities were withdrawn. They ended up with either awkward workarounds or sinking entirely.\n\nIndeed, in 2015 around eleven bitcoin firms across the globe were reported and profiled by Coindesk to have been shuttered for various reasons including heightened competition and insufficient cash. According to another source (bravenewcoin.com) reporting in late October 2015 “at the very least 36 bitcoin exchanges” had folded.\n\nBritcoin, later to be re-branded Intersango, launched in 2011. Before it ultimately shut down for good, it had repeated problems with UK bank transfers, detailed in one of its updates from August 2012 (their site is now defunct) that read as follows.\n\n“Bridging the gap between the conventional banking system and bitcoin is a challenging and expensive task. We have had many issues dealing with the conventional banking system; missing transfers, crippling technical issues, accounts frozen without warning, and even accounts closed without warning.”\n\nLater, in early 2014 Bit121 launched when bitcoin was emerging into the light. The same happened. After a promising start, banking facilities were withdrawn and the exchange was no longer able to function.\n\nAnother outfit, ‘In Bitcoin We Trust’ (ibwt.co.uk), suffered the same problem. For a while, as they tried to cling on by their fingernails, they resorted to using postal orders, of all things.\n\nCoinfloor, currently one of the only UK exchanges in operation, uses international SWIFT transfers, which incur a significant cost and delay; as a result, the minimum transfer in is £1,000 (c.$1,250).\n\nUK Peer-to-Peer Services\n\nInstead of traditional exchanges, the UK has a series of peer-to-peer services that match individual buyers and sellers. Sellers are typically trusted individuals, where trust is established by feedback and reputation.\n\nThey work by pairing a buyer and seller for a specific amount of bitcoin. Once the buyer has paid - typically with a bank transfer - the seller sends the bitcoins. It gets around the problem of centralized organizations that can be shut down by the bank.\n\nHowever, the anxiety that pervades bitcoin businesses in the UK is evident here too. On at least one popular site, buyers are instructed never to include ‘bitcoin’ in the payment reference, on pain of being permanently banned from using the service.\n\nUK versus Other Nations\n\nSo what’s the picture in other jurisdictions around the globe. Well, Russia has just relaxed its regulatory stance and adopted a ‘wait-and-see’ approach, which has effectively legalized bitcoin and made it possible to open exchanges there.\n\nOther countries are much more progressive. Switzerland, for example, has made it very easy to buy bitcoins through a large network of ATMs on their rail system, and recently in the town of Zug a system was trialled for paying bills using bitcoin.\n\nThe same in Japan, where it\'s possible to pay electricity bills with bitcoin. America has a more complicated regulatory framework, but things are becoming much clearer since the BitLicense was implemented in 2015. Many states are now following New York\'s approach.\n\nChina is also clarifying its position somewhat. Bitcoin is legal there, but they appear to be taking a ‘caveat emptor’ approach. The People\'s Bank of China recently met with a number of big Chinese exchanges, after which they stopped the highly leveraged trading for which these exchanges are well known. Much of the volume was believed to be fake as they had zero-trading fees.\n\nFintech versus Banks\n\nYou could understand why banks might once have been reluctant to deal with transactions from bitcoin exchanges.\n\nA few years ago, bitcoin was best known to the public as the means by which drugs could be bought on the Internet’s dark markets - chiefly the Silk Road, which was raided by the FBI in October 2013. Its borderless and quasi-anonymous nature meant that it could also be a useful vehicle for money laundering.\n\nBut that was then and this is now. Bitcoin has come a long way since the days of the Silk Road, and there is a fast-growing segment of the fintech industry that makes use of both bitcoin itself and the wider blockchain technology that it pioneers.\n\nThe mismatch between government and the banking sector may also appear as odd. The UK government is vocally pro-blockchain research and development, as last year’s ‘Distributed Ledger Technology: Beyond block chain’ (Jan 2016) report and the activity around it unequivocally demonstrate.\n\nSome say we are in a bizarre situation where the British government claims we are open for business, but the banking sector stands threateningly in the doorway.\n\nRemember too that these are not distinct entities. Since the financial crisis the taxpayer has been a majority shareholder in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), the bank that fell hardest and required the largest bailout. That stake stands at some 82%, and at the time of writing there is no immediate appetite to reduce it. RBS simply isn’t ready yet. That ought to form an important piece of leverage.\n\nBritain has a reputation for being a fintech hub with London at its beating heart, and aspires to blaze a trail in the promising new world of blockchain application. The banking sector has evidently taken exception to that.\n\nIt probably does not help matters that, right at this moment, UK banks are facing another existential threat: the reality that, out of the European Union (EU), London could lose its status as a global financial hub. Several have already taken the decision or are seriously considering moving their headquarters out of The City.\n\nBut whether for fear of competition, over-caution around fraud and money-laundering, or simply a laziness to change course regarding something that was once primarily associated with drug purchases, they seem to have closed ranks and apparently taken the collective decision not to work with bitcoin-related businesses.\n\nClosing The Loop\n\nFiat money, created and curated by banks, is inherently centralized. The central bank creates central bank money, which includes physical coins and notes as well as the electronic central bank reserves that are written into existence in Quantitative Easing.\n\nCommercial banks create the majority of the money supply, by lending money into being - not, as is popularly believed, by lending out customer deposits - even under a fractional reserve system.\n\nThis centralization of seigniorage - derived from Old French ‘seigneuriage’ (right of the lord (seigneur) to mint money) - and of the payments system is diametrically opposed to bitcoin’s decentralized money creation and complete freedom over payments. The nature of bitcoin is that transactions cannot be reversed or blocked, since there is no intermediary to carry out a transfer on your behalf - as regular payment processors do.\n\nPerhaps it’s no wonder the two systems don’t interface well - they are the financial equivalent of oil and water. And, addressing this problem without the assistance of the banking sector is not straightforward.\n\nMoney cannot easily flow from the blockchain economy into the traditional financial sector and vice versa without that co-operation.\n\nIdeally this would not be necessary: money would circulate within the bitcoin economy as bitcoins. Goods and services would be paid for in bitcoin and the recipients would themselves spend those bitcoins. In reality, of course, this doesn’t happen. The sector is not large enough to offer all the goods and services required to make bitcoin a broad enough means of payment.\n\nMoreover, bitcoin’s volatility means it’s not really suited as a unit of account or store of value. It’s a great medium of transfer, but its price against fiat fluctuates too much for most people’s comfort.\n\nThis can make for something of a chicken and egg situation. The bitcoin economy won’t expand until bitcoin is more suited as a means of payment; it won’t be better suited without greater growth and stability. But if it’s not possible to close the loop of the bitcoin/blockchain economy in this way, perhaps it’s possible to expand it.\n\nFiat On The Blockchain\n\n‘Real’ money - the fiat pounds Sterling (GBP) issued by central and commercial banks - is not going out of fashion any time soon. It has problems. In some cases some say it’s barely fit for purpose. But we need it, because being as it is issued by banks and governments, that’s how we pay for our mortgages, taxes, loans and much else besides. And, with the help of the right blockchain it could be improved with relatively little effort.\n\nNow if we take as an example Waves, a custom blockchain-powered tokens platform that raised over $16m last summer through crowdfunding, it makes it easy to create your own crypto tokens, which can be used to represent whatever you want. These can be sent anywhere, almost instantly, thanks to the borderless and efficient nature of the blockchain.\n\nMaking Waves\n\nKey to Waves’ overall strategy is creating fiat-backed blockchain tokens. Here the idea is that a trusted organization - a bank or other financial institution of some kind - will act as a gateway between the fiat world and that of the blockchain.\n\nIn practice, this involves holding fiat money in a fully insured, audited account and issuing tokens representing each unit of it on the Waves blockchain. Customers pay money into the gateway using a bank transfer or other suitable means, and the gateway issues them with the same sum in blockchain tokens. For example, £1,000 is added to their account, and they send 1,000 wavesGBP to the customer.\n\nThe same exchange happens in reverse when customers want to cash out their wavesGBP and have them sent as ‘real’ GBP (Sterling) to their bank account. Each gateway is responsible for compliance in their jurisdiction. Waves is essentially the toolkit.\n\nThis naturally raises the same issue that exchanges have: if the UK’s banks are anti-bitcoin and anti-blockchain money more generally, how do you get them to co-operate by letting organizations issue GBP tokens in the first place?\n\nIn practice, this step can be dealt with in much the same way as the exchanges do it - by using foreign banking facilities and moving money around using SEPA or SWIFT transfers. Yes, the costs are the same, but that may not matter so much as it does for bitcoin, because the result is something very different.\n\nMaking Money More Efficient\n\nSasha Ivanov, the Ukrainian CEO and founder of Waves, commenting said: ""Waves isn\'t trying to replace existing money. We already have money - US dollar (USD), Sterling (GBP), Chinese Yuan (CNY), Euro (EUR). Bitcoin is money too. But we do think we can make money more efficient.” Waves is built on the Scorex platform, which is itself based on Scala I, with Bitcoin and its clones being C++ as well as Java being occasionally used.\n\nHe added: “By putting fiat money on the blockchain we can make it faster and more transparent and we can reduce costs and times for sending it abroad. By doing so we can introduce competition and encourage the banks to be more accountable.""\n\nA graduate in Theoretical Physics from Moscow State University, Ivanov opined further: “If the banking sector in one country won\'t work with us, we will work with banks in another jurisdiction. The nature of the internet, open source software more generally and blockchains specifically is that they are not confined geographically.”\n\nSo, if one organization won\'t work with them another will. Ultimately, according to the Ukrainian “there is nothing to lose by embracing this technology, and much to gain.""\n\nFrictionless Fiat\n\nThe problem with bitcoin exchanges is the costs involved in moving money into and out of them, and the fact that this is probably a regular requirement for customers.\n\nIf you are paid in bitcoin, you will likely want to cash it out to pay bills and buy things. The difference with wavesGBP is that once the money is on the blockchain, it can be used as money - including as a store of value.\n\nThere is not such an immediate pressure to cash it out into real GBP, incurring the costs of exchange and transfer involved in the traditional financial system. It can be sent anywhere in the world, almost instantly and at practically zero cost. Furthermore, it can also be used to invest in crowdfunds, which will be one of the Waves platform’s chief purposes.\n\nCritically, it will be possible to exchange funds quickly and easily on the built-in decentralized exchange (DEX). And, wavesGBP could be exchanged for wavesUSD or wavesGOLD with minimal cost. One could even exchange it for bitcoin (wavesBTC) and withdraw it via a bitcoin gateway - which is, in fact, the first gateway to be created on Waves.\n\nNow, if you need to cash it out and pay your mortgage, for example, you’ll run into the same issues and will incur the gateway’s costs. But making blockchain-based money a lot more like fiat money means that storing your tokens doesn’t come with the same problems of them fluctuating in value.\n\nTokens can circulate in the blockchain economy more readily and usefully, without being converted back to fiat. This is because they are essentially already a form of turbocharged, blockchain-powered fiat.\n\nWavesGBP’s value is just the same as the Pounds (GBP) in your bank account, but this money can do things that bank-issued money cannot. At that point, expanding the blockchain economy starts to make more sense, because you can build network effect now that businesses and consumers do not have to worry about their money holding its value from day to day.\n\nThis does not entirely solve the problems of the UK banking sector’s hostile attitude towards bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it does suggest that the roadblocks they throw up will not be insurmountable. It’s just that the answer will be to work around them rather than with them.', 'Leo Lewis in Tokyo FEBRUARY 12, 2017 6 Hedge funds in the US and Japan have devised a daring wager on the future price of bitcoin as the Tokyo courts continue to wade through the aftermath of the Mt Gox exchange collapse and one of the biggest digital heists in history. According to people with direct knowledge of the situation, at least four hedge funds have begun buying or offering to buy claims from the many thousands of former trading account holders who lost bitcoins and cash when Mt Gox — then the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange — declared bankruptcy in February 2014.  None of the 24,000 or so claimants is expected to get back more than a quarter of the lost bitcoins and cash in their accounts. But the payout will eventually come entirely in the form of bitcoins, so the potential advantage is huge.  The trigger for the collapse of Mt Gox, which hammered the bitcoin market price at the time, was the disappearance from its virtual vaults of nearly 850,000 bitcoins — of which about 90 per cent belonged to Mt Gox customers and was worth $473m at the time. But as police investigated the collapse and Tokyo prosecutors began building a criminal case of embezzlement against Mt Gox founder Mark Karpeles, part of the missing trove was found. The resulting pool of 202,000 bitcoins recovered by the Japanese authorities will be used to settle the former Mt Gox customers’ claims. Kim Nilsson, chief engineer at WizSec, a Tokyo-based consultancy that produced the most authoritative independent report on Mt Gox’s demise, says there is little hope of finding the remainder, even if the thieves are caught. Nobody knows how long it will take for claims to be settled but there is the potential for it to be at least another year while five other Mt Gox-related legal disputes are resolved.  Hedge funds are offering claimholders a shortcut that lets them sell their claim now and receive 15 per cent of the yen value of each claim in cash. The hedge funds, meanwhile, are gambling on a bitcoin windfall at some point in the future. When the claims were lodged in 2014, the Mt Gox trustees calculated their value using an exchange rate of just under $450 per bitcoin. After gains throughout 2016 the market price of one bitcoin in January surpassed $1,000 for the first time since the Mt Gox collapse, and on Monday was trading just above $1,012. Related article Bitcoin was the best performing currency of 2016 As political and economic uncertainty grows across the world, bitcoin is becoming more stable Daniel Kelman, a Mt Gox creditor himself and an attorney representing creditor interest in the case, this month set up a website, mygoxclaim.com, to link claimants with hedge funds potentially interested in buying their claims. “The peculiarities of the situation — in which creditors may not be paid out for at least another year\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009along with the striking rise in the market price of bitcoins since the exchange rate was calculated with respect to the claims, means that a fund willing to take the risk of a long wait could be betting on a payout with huge upside,” said Mr Kelman.  Frustration is building among the Mt Gox claimants as the process enters its fourth year. The largest dispute to resolve before claims are settled is between Mt Gox and CoinLab, a former business partner that has filed a $75m claim. Former Mt Gox customers, who fear a heavy dilution of their eventual payout if CoinLab is successful, have rallied online to condemn the CoinLab claim as frivolous. In the criminal case against Mr Karpeles, who denies any wrongdoing, the Tokyo courts will hold another pre-trial hearing on February 14.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'On Jan. 29, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran Valiollah Seif officially announced during a national television interview that the US dollar will no longer be used within the country as a response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial temporary travel ban on certain countries including Iran.\n\nAccording to the official statement of the Iranian central bank and Seif, the government intends to terminate the usability of U.S. dollars in Iran and replace USD with a stable reserve currency that is more frequently used in foreign trades.\n\nCurrently, the central bank of Iran are exploring two options; whether to select one particular foreign currency such as the euro which is used widely for foreign trades in Iran or to establish multiple currencies and thus allowing the Iranian people to select whichever currency they would prefer to use.\n\nOne major issue analysts have on the elimination of USD as a legal tender in Iran is that the USD is the foundation of the oil industry in Iran, which accounts for approximately $41 bln in revenue. The replacement of USD could lead to severe complications for local authorities.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin and its demand\n\nThe Iranian Bitcoin industry has a relatively shallow Bitcoin exchange market and infrastructure. BTXCapital, the country’s first Bitcoin exchange which was launched in August of 2015, entered the Iranian market in hopes to provide a more reliable and secure alternative to peer-to-peer trading platforms such as CoinAva and LocalBitcoins.\n\nWith a market of over 50 million Internet users, BTXCapital stated that Iran has a potential to become the next major Bitcoin market in the upcoming years. Ganesh Jung, CEO of Draglet, the development firm behind a white label Bitcoin exchange platform used by BTXCapital as its base infrastructure, emphasized the struggle Iranian people undergo to purchase Bitcoin in the country.\n\nIn an interview, Jung stated:\n\n""It\'s really hard to get hold of Bitcoin in Iran. There were ways to buy Bitcoin but the process was very difficult and the amounts it was possible to buy were small. The market is massive. A large population with a high proportion connected to the internet means there is a lot of completely untapped market potential. Our platform makes trading really easy. All you need to do is deposit some local currency and then you can trade.""\n\nAs seen in India, wherein people began to search for alternative stores of value or gold-like assets such as Bitcoin amid economic turmoil and financial disaster, it is likely that the Iranian people will look out for currencies like Bitcoin that are decentralized and easily transferrable.\n\n(Source: The CoinTelegraph)', ""Over the past month, many Bitcoin exchanges, startups and experts weighed in on the debate between Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) supporters.\n\nThe main claim of SegWit supports is that nearly 60 percent of nodes within the Bitcoin network are supporting the activation of SegWit. According to 21 Inc’s Bitnodes, approximately 56 percent of all Bitcoin nodes are in support of Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 and the other two minor updates of Bitcoin Core which includes SegWit support on testnet.\n\nWhat is the debate about exactly?\n\nIn comparison, BU supporters and developers, including prominent angel investor and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, claimed that Bitcoin miners are showing increasing support of SegWit. A chart called “Mining Pool Support by Proposal” provided by Coin Dance and shared by Ver, demonstrated that 17.3 percent of miners support BU while the other 16.67 percent supported the activation of SegWit.\n\nSamson Mow, COO of the world’s longest running Bitcoin exchange BTCC, and Alistair Milne, Bitcoin investor at Atlanta Digital Currency Fund, expressed their support for SegWit stating that SegWit’s transaction malleability solution opens the door for Lightning, a micropayment solution, that is ultimately beneficial for the long-term growth of Bitcoin.\n\nMilne further emphasized the majority support of Bitcoin nodes for SegWit, requesting Bitcoin miners to start listening to its users.\n\n“Betrayal” to the mining community?\n\nIn response, Gang Wu, HaoBTC CEO, offered his strong stance against SegWit, describing the Bitcoin Core development team’s efforts in pushing SegWit development instead of a 2MB hardfork which they previously agreed on at the Hong Kong consensus conference as a “betrayal” to the mining community.\n\nAlthough HaoBTC later published a follow-up statement to explain their neutral attitude towards BU and SegWit, the exchange firmly reaffirmed that it intends to support the Hong Kong agreement that the organization signed.\n\nOpportunities for two-layer solutions\n\nIn mid last month, Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos published a blog post in response to Tuur Demeester’s article entitled “Bitcoin: digital gold or digital cash? Both.” In it, Antonopoulos stated that organizations or people that are objecting to Lightning are pushing for off-chain trusted third party custodial or centralized platforms based on trust.\n\nAntonopoulos later acknowledged that he supports SegWit, not necessarily because of its scaling solution but because it provides opportunities for two-layer solutions like Lightning or TumbleBit to enter.\n\n“I'm for SegWit, not because of scaling, but because it offers solutions to many technical issues in Bitcoin,” said Antonopoulos.\n\nEfficient scaling solution\n\nStill, Bitcoin developers like Lightning co-author Thaddeus Dryja firmly believe SegWit can be described as an efficient scaling solution, as it increases Bitcoin block size to at least 2.1MB. On testest, Dryja was able to find 3.7MB blocks, a size 3.7x larger than the current block size.\n\n“I have a script that will spam testnet and make 3.7MB blocks. It’s not an 800KB regular block with txids and output scripts, and a 2.9MB witness block with just a bunch of signatures. It’s a single block, that looks pretty much the same as old blocks with a few extra requirements, that’s 3.7MB,” said Dryja.\n\nNecessary for the long-term growth of Bitcoin\n\nWhile BU supporters including Ver and Justus Ranvier, lead architect at Stash Crypto, all believe that the elimination of transaction malleability and the entrance of two-layer solutions are necessary for the long-term growth of Bitcoin, they don’t believe SegWit is the best method of doing so.\n\nVer told Cointelegraph:\n\n“I think ending transaction malleability is great for Bitcoin. The current SegWit soft fork is just one of many many ways that transaction malleability can be ended, but there are many other proposals on the table that may work as well as, or even better than SegWit.”\n\n“BU is not even remotely an option”\n\nIn response to Ver’s preference of other solutions, Alex Bergeron from Blockstream stated that other solutions like Tom Zander’s “Flexible Transactions” aren’t viable alternatives, as they aren’t backward compatible, received little to no peer review and aren’t technically sound.\n\nBTCC COO Samson Mow gave Cointelegraph a similar statement:\n\n“The Bitcoin Core contributors, the entire technical community, wallet developers, many mining pools and major exchanges all believe a SegWit soft-fork is the path forward to end transaction malleability and for a safe yet quick way to increase the block size. Flexible Transactions from BU is not even remotely an option as the concept has already been dismissed by the technical community, and more importantly, there is no functioning code available - it's vaporware.”\n\nThe lack of peer review has also proven to be an issue for Bitcoin Unlimited, as the Bitcoin Unlimited team recently found buggy codes within the software. The lack of peer review ultimately caused the loss of 13 BTC for Bitcoin unlimited miners.\n\nSegWit - the best alternative so far\n\nAt this stage of Bitcoin development, it is of utmost importance to the Bitcoin development community, users, companies and mining community to push for the activation of a safer alternative. Considering Bitcoin Unlimited’s lack of peer review and software which isn’t ready for deployment, SegWit seems to be the best alternative so far.\n\nIndustry leaders and large-scale Bitcoin companies like Coinbase and Blockchain have already expressed their support for SegWit. The Blockchain is listed as “SegWit ready” in the SegWit Adoption list of the Bitcoin Core development team."", 'Bitcoin price appears to be pulling back to the broken channel support before carrying on with its downtrend.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price recently broke below an ascending channel support visible on the 4-hour time frame and a pullback is happening.\n\nPrice could make a retest of the broken channel support before heading further south and resuming its selloff.\n\nBitcoin price fell sharply last week when top exchanges in China halted client withdrawals following a meeting with authorities.\n\nBitcoin price appears to be pulling back to the broken channel support before carrying on with its downtrend.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is still above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the upside. However, the short-term moving average is holding as dynamic resistance for the time being and might be enough to keep near-term gains in check.\n\nIf so, another test of the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point could be underway and a break below $950 might be enough to confirm that bearish momentum is getting stronger. From there, bitcoin price could test the key support at the $900 area next.\n\nStochastic is indicating overbought conditions and is crossing lower, also hinting that sellers are gaining traction. RSI is on middle ground, barely offering strong directional clues, but also appears to be turning slightly lower to suggest a return in selling pressure.\n\nMarket Events\n\nInvestors are once again feeling the jitters in the Chinese bitcoin market, as a couple of main exchanges announced that they would be halting client withdrawals for a certain period in compliance with anti-money laundering requirements. This led several traders to close out their positions for fear of having their funds locked up in other accounts as well.\n\nFor now, traders are keeping a watchful eye on developments in China, as this represents the vast majority of bitcoin transactions. In the meantime, renewed demand for the US dollar on subdued geopolitical risks and strong economic performance is also preventing BTCUSD from advancing. Further downside is eyed unless market confidence is once again restored when Chinese authorities refrain from introducing more measures to curtail trading activity.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Erik Voorhees recently stated how he is keeping a supply of ETH on hand for regular payments, as bitcoin’s network congestion is getting out of hand. A rather unusual statement that will create a bit more friction between the two communities.\n\nIs Ethereum A Viable Payment Option?\n\nThat is the big question that needs to be answered first and foremost. Even though bitcoin is far from a major mainstream payment option right now, it is seemingly impossible to think any alternative currency would be more useful in the long run. Ethereum is focused on creating technical blockchain use cases, rather than being a payment method of its own. This makes Erik Voorhees’ statement even more strange, although it does make some sense.\n\nUsing Ethereum directly for payments, either online or in real life is virtually impossible without converting it to bitcoin first. If that is the only option, it seems highly unlikely Ethereum will overtake bitcoin anytime soon in this regard. Erik Voorhees, who runs the Shapeshift platform, knows that most people make Ethereum payments by going through bitcoin first, sometimes even by using his own company. Converting Ethereum to bitcoin only adds more transactions to the network, and can end up delaying other transactions.\n\nI'm finding myself holding some extra ETH to use as payments, since Bitcoin is becoming too expensive/delayed 🙁 — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) February 10, 2017\n\nIt is true bitcoin transactions are becoming more expensive unless one wants to wait a few hours before it is confirmed. Using a higher fee is not a viable option for most people, which is perfectly understandable. Then again, most wallet solutions will determine the appropriate fees without overcharging its users. In most cases, people should never pay US$0.50 or more for any bitcoin transaction, albeit your mileage may vary.\n\nThe statement issued by Voorhees is greeted with a mix of support and disbelief right now. Ethereum has had plenty of issues of its own already, making it look far less appealing to both cryptocurrency users and retailers accepting bitcoin payments who look for an alternative. Moreover, Ethereum was never designed to be a payment network like bitcoin. Scalability can also be an issue for Ethereum if people were to use it as a payment method, as gas transaction prices would soon skyrocket.\n\nWhile statements like these will set some people on edge, it is evident bitcoin has some issues that need to be solved sooner rather than later. Scalability – and its associated transaction fees – are a big problem that needs to be resolved. Whether either SegWit or Bitcoin Unlimited is the solution, remains to be seen at this time. Ethereum may look somewhat appealing to some people, yet it is doubtful ETH would ever overtake bitcoin as a cryptocurrency payment option.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock"", 'Traders seem to be already pricing in the US Securities and Exchange Commission\'s (SEC) upcoming ruling on the Winklevoss bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to most analysts polled by CoinDesk.\n\nShould the fund – sought by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss – receive approval, the creation of an easily accessible investment vehicle could trigger a massive influx of capital and robust price increases, market observers have stated. As a result, the SEC decision, which has a deadline of 11th March, has drawn significant attention from traders.\n\nPotential impact\n\nSeveral analysts spoke with CoinDesk about how an SEC decision to approve a bitcoin ETF could have a significant impact on the market for the digital currency.\n\n""If the Winklevoss ETF, or any other bitcoin ETF for that matter, is approved by the SEC, bitcoin prices are almost certainly likely to jump in the following months and years,"" said Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.\n\nHe pointed to the sharp gains that gold and silver prices enjoyed after ETFs backed by these commodities hit the market. ""A bitcoin ETF could also open the door"" to retirement accounts and pension funds, which represent a market worth trillions.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, also offered some bullish commentary, stating that SEC approval would likely motivate foreign regulators to approve similar listings in their jurisdictions. He added that this could have a huge effect on the digital currency, saying:\n\n""Traders know what effect as little as $10m of fresh cash can have on the price of bitcoin. Thirty times that would fire the engines to Alpha Centauri.""\n\nJacob Eliosoff, an algorithmic trader, weighed in on how approving the SEC could spur both significant investor interest and higher prices.\n\n""I\'d expect approval of the ETF to trigger a deluge of mainstream and institutional investor money pouring in. So, even if the chance of approval is small, it\'s a small chance of a big gain, which could certainly be pushing up the price.""\n\nDecision uncertain\n\nWhile several market observers have emphasized how much of a difference approving a bitcoin ETF would make, traders have offered a wide range of views on what the SEC may decide.\n\nMany are optimistic that the Winklevoss fund will receive approval, according to Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy. ""Most traders are bullish that something will get done,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nBobby Lee, CEO of Chinese exchange BTCC, provided a similar assessment, stating:\n\n""I think that the Winklevoss ETF has a real chance of getting approval.""\n\nHowever, not everyone is so certain. Zivkovski described the markets as cautiously optimistic about the fund\'s chances of receiving approval, pointing to market dynamics to support his point of view.\n\nHe recently told CoinDesk that most of the orders coming in to his platform are long, and Whaleclub data shows that in the seven days through 10th February, speculative wagers were 84% long. \'Confidence\', which measures the extent by which a particular session\'s position sizes were larger than average, averaged 83% during this period.\n\nWhile these figures seemingly point to bullish sentiment, some analysts have painted a less optimistic picture of the situation, forecasting that the fund has low chances of obtaining approval.\n\nKevin Zhou, a cryptocurrency trader for exchange Kraken, estimated that the markets are giving the ETF a 10% chance of receiving authorization from the SEC – a figure with which he agrees.\n\nSpencer Bogart, an analyst for Needham & Company, has also provided a less-than-optimistic forecast.\n\n""In contrast to most of the people that we speak to in the industry, we think the probability that a bitcoin ETF will be approved in 2017 is very low – it\'s difficult to quantify but we think the probability is sub-25%.""\n\nPotential obstacles\n\nThe Winklevoss ETF might still run into some hurdles that could prevent its approval. The SEC has already provided the Winklevoss twins with many potential risks they must consider, including whether the fund could be the victim of a hack or whether the bitcoin network could split into more than one faction, as happened with ethereum.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins originally filed for the ETF in July 2013, so the fund has been awaiting approval for more than three years. Even after this time, unanswered questions still remain, said Zivkovski.\n\nFor example, he asked how a bitcoin ETF would fulfill demand on the notoriously illiquid bitcoin markets. And would the Winklevoss fund provide insurance in the event of a hack?\n\nThere are also concerns that approving a bitcoin ETF could intensify volatility, according to Hayes. The ""copycat effect"" – where foreign regulators follow the SEC’s lead – could end up being one of the reasons the government agency refuses to give the fund the nod.\n\nHayes pointed to the sharp price fluctuations bitcoin has experienced over the last several weeks, as the digital currency surged to more than $1,150 and then fell below $750.\n\n""No doubt the SEC has been watching,"" he said.\n\nIn addition, the government agency might reject the proposed fund simply to cover its back, according to Bogart. Pointing to the SEC\'s generally conservative nature, he asserted that, if the organization\'s staff approve the ETF, they have little to gain and much to lose.\n\nBogart suggested that if the fund does well, the staff who approved it will likely not receive any recognition, but if it does poorly, they could face serious consequences.\n\nPositive for prices\n\nIn spite of the ETF\'s aforementioned obstacles, the current situation is on the whole a good one for bitcoin prices, said Hayes.\n\nWhile Bogart has given the Winklevoss fund low odds of approval, a refusal would cause only a ""slight drop"" in price. he said.\n\nPast that, he described the approval of a bitcoin ETF as inevitable, saying:\n\n""A publicly traded ETF will come, it\'s just a matter of time.""\n\nBecause of these factors, Bogart described the risk-reward ratio for this event as positive.\n\nWilly Woo, a derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast, painted a similar picture, emphasizing that while a \'no\' from the SEC would produce a minor correction in price, a \'yes\' would produce sharp gains.\n\nTrader at work image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Karpeles was arrested on suspicion of fabricating volume data and was later charged with embezzlement.\n\nThe demise of Gox set the stage for much of the regulatory response to bitcoin in the years since, particularly in Japan, which has moved to bring the country’s bitcoin exchange ecosystem under existing financial statutes.

Bogart is one of the few Wall Street analysts who cover Bitcoin.\n\nThe trust’s premium over bitcoin’s net asset value has shrunk from about 42.21% in early January to about 13% in recent trade, according to data provided by Grayscale.\n\nThe shrinking premium suggests investors are less willing to pay for shares of the trust because they expect one of the ETFs to be approved in the near future, Bogart said. Shares of a bitcoin ETF would likely trade much closer to the cryptocurrency’s net asset value, bitcoin watchers said.\n\nThe trading activity is at odds with the likelihood of approval tabulated by Bogart, who places it at less than 25%. Last month, a former lawyer for Gemini Trading, the bitcoin exchange operated by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, said he believed the SEC wouldn't approve the creation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The SEC has said it would issue a ruling on the Winklevoss’s proposed bitcoin ETF, known as the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, by March 11.\n\nRead: Final rule on proposed bitcoin ETF to come in March\n\nRead: And 2016’s best-performing commodity is ... bitcoin?\n\nPlus: Bitcoin price falls as Chinese authorities meet with exchanges\n\nBitMEX recently launched a futures contract that allows investors to bet on the odds that the Winklevoss ETF will be approved. It is presently trading around 33.3, indicating that the thinly traded market is pricing in about a 33% chance of approval, which is higher than what Bogart expects. BitMEX couldn't be reached for immediate comment.\n\nA few weeks ago, Grayscale, which launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust in 2013, filed for an initial public offering that would allow its trust to trade as an ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. The Grayscale bitcoin trust is presently one of the few registered investment vehicles available to financial institutions. A company known as SolidX has also filed for a bitcoin ETF.\n\nBogart believes that if an ETF is approved, more than $300 million of new institutional capital would flood the bitcoin ecosystem during the first week alone. Such an influx would likely cause the price of a single coin to skyrocket. Typically, trading volume in the global bitcoin market measures less than $100 million a day.\n\nRead: Path to Bitcoin ETF still uncertain but may be easier under Trump\n\nDon’t miss: Bitcoin could soar if the Winklevoss ETF is approved\n\nChris Burniske, blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, believes that the decline in the Grayscale bitcoin trust’s premium may suggest that investors are taking a wait-and-see approach ahead of the SEC’s decision.

He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'My firm’s cannabis lawyers are always getting pitched on “creative solutions” to the cannabis industry’s banking problem. Because marijuana is still federally illegal, most banks will not provide financial services to marijuana businesses, even though way back in 2014 FinCEN issued guidelines to allow financial institutions to provide bank accounts to the state-legal pot businesses. Many of those with creative solutions are touting Bitcoin (i.e., cryptocurrency) as the solution.\n\nBitcoin is viewed as the world’s first completely decentralized currency. Unlike the Dollar, the Euro, the Yuan, etc., no central government manages or backs Bitcoin. It is also called a “cryptocurrency” — a digital currency that uses encrypted services to generate units of the currency and to transfer funds. You can read primers on it here and here. Using a Bitcoin wallet enables customers and businesses to engage in transactions without using paper currency and without going through an intermediary institution like a bank. Its chief appeal to the marijuana industry is that allows for currency transfers with little to no need for a bank. There are though significant issues involved with using Bitcoin in the marijuana industry and law enforcement associates Bitcoin with the illegal narcotics trade (see the Silk Road).\n\nSince cannabis legalization and “medicalization” have picked up across several states, two major questions about pot and cryptocurrency have arisen. The first is whether cannabis businesses can substitute Bitcoin for a bank account, and the second is whether marijuana businesses should be allowed to accept Bitcoin when selling marijuana products.\n\nUsing Bitcoin to replace a traditional bank account does not make a lot of sense in the short term now that we have the FinCEN guidelines. Plus, using Bitcoin instead of a bank account would be a logistical nightmare for marijuana businesses since it has a low adoption rate; for a cannabis business to do a significant volume of business with Bitcoins, it would need buy-in from its customers, vendors, shareholders, employees, taxing authorities, and others, which isn’t likely to happen. And if a cannabis business owner is going to accept Bitcoins as legal tender it will in turn need to pay its employees and vendors and others using Bitcoins or else need to exchange its Bitcoins for cash. Exchanging Bitcoins for cash will necessarily involve either selling the Bitcoins for cash that goes into a bank account (the original problem everyone is trying to solve) or engaging in activities that will look a lot like money laundering to law enforcement.\n\nThough there exists a “Crypto Cannabis Conference” (apparently coming up on its third annual meeting, no less) and though a slew of marijuana entrepreneurs are likely trying out Bitcoin, at least one state is trying to drop the hammer on such practices. At the beginning of January, Washington State proposed a bill to ban Bitcoin in its marijuana marketplace. The eight-page SB 5264 adds to the definitions section of RCW 69.50.101 (Washington’s Controlled Substances Act) the term “virtual currency,” and then proceeds to ban it for marijuana sales. Under the bill, “virtual currency” would be defined as follows:\n\na digital representation of value used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States government. “Virtual currency” does not include the software or protocols governing the transfer of the digital representation of value or other uses of virtual distributed ledger systems to verify ownership or authenticity in a digital capacity when the virtual currency is not used as a medium of exchange.\n\nThe bill then states that “[a] marijuana producer, marijuana processor, or retail outlet must not pay with or accept virtual currency for the purchase or sale of marijuana or any marijuana product.”\n\nThe Bitcoin ban bill was debated at length and Senator Ann Rivers, one of the bill’s backers, cited to the Cole Memo prohibiting the “shrouding” of anyone who participates in Washington’s marijuana industry as its justification. Senator Rivers contends BitCoin can’t meet the 2014 FinCEN transparency mandates. Tom Parker and Kenneth Berke of PayQwick also testified that Bitcoin does not satisfy FinCEN transparency guidelines and allowing it for Washington State marijuana businesses will invite federal enforcement and thereby harm the cannabis industry as a whole. On the other side of the argument, Ryan Hamlin and Jon Baugher of POSaBIT testified that BitCoin is perfectly traceable, auditable, verifiable, and transparent, and that the state needs to better understand BitCoin transactions before it bans its use in the marijuana industry.\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the state-legal marijuana industry under President Trump and Attorney General Sessions, as well as the precarious staying power of the Cole Memo and the FinCEN guidelines, Bitcoin may just be too risky for Washington State’s marijuana industry. And if other states fearful of added federal scrutiny become convinced of the same, the marijuana Bitcoin ban may eventually extend to the U.S. marijuana industry at-large.', 'Jeffrey Tarrant is a Wall Street guy. He spent the last thirty years investing in new hedge funds. As the founder and CEO of a firm called Protege Partners, he compares himself to Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator. What Altman does for Silicon Valley tech startups, Tarrant does for hedge funds. ""I help seed them and incubate them,"" he says.\n\nThe analogy has never been more true than right now. Tarrant is beginning to explore hedge funds built on ideas that have sparked so many companies and created so much wealth in Silicon Valley—ideas that span artificial intelligence, crowdsourcing, and digital currencies. He believes the hedge fund world is on the verge of a new revolution, a revolution he calls the Third Wave.\n\nHedge funds are moving beyond the quants.\n\nThe 1970s saw the rise of discretionary funds, where iconic investors like George Soros used their very human judgments to find new opportunities in the market. Then came the ""quants"" at funds like Renaissance Technologies, who found even greater opportunities through statistics and computer algorithms. Now, Tarrant says hedge funds are moving beyond the quants.\n\nAs a prime example, he cites Numerai, a San Francisco hedge fund that makes trades using machine learning models built by thousands of anonymous data scientists paid in bitcoin. Funds such as Quantopian and Quantiacs are tapping the wisdom of the masses in other ways. And then there\'s Polychain, a fund that invests exclusively in bitcoin and other digital ""tokens"" housed on a blockchain, the distributed online ledger that makes cryptocurrencies possible. As its name suggests, Polychain isn\'t just investing in digital coins—it\'s investing in a radically new breed of businesses owned, funded, and operated entirely by decentralized networks of anonymous online investors.\n\nSuch funds aren\'t always easy to wrap your head around. But as Wall Street tries to make sense of them, these new tech-driven approaches to investing are proliferating. In the late `90s, Tarrant helped build an online directory of hedge funds called AltVest. Now, he\'s building a directory for this new wave of funds. It includes roughly fifty players, many of whom have yet to publicly announce themselves—though Tarrant admits that only about half have demonstrated real promise so far.\n\nNot surprisingly, some financial vets question how effective Tarrant\'s new wave will be. In a recent Bloomberg story, several fund managers said that recent enthusiasm for machine learning is overblown. In some cases, even the founders of these Third Wave funds urge caution.\n\n""Regardless of what method you use in quantitative finance—be it machine learning or traditional quant methods—there are an infinite number of ways to fail,"" says Martin Froehler, a former quant with Superfund Asset Management GmbH in Switzerland who went on to found Quantiacs. Machine learning models are no ""superweapon,"" he says. In his experience, ninety percent of live machine learning tests fail.\n\nBut Froehler\'s fund benefits from machine learning, too. Based in Silicon Valley, Quantiacs attempts to crowdsource the quant model, and many of the quants feeding the fund are using machine learning technologies. Among other things, they\'re making use of deep neural networks, complex mathematical systems for recognizing patterns in vast amounts of data. In other words, the Third Wave is not just about using one new technique. It\'s about combining techniques, from machine learning to crowdsourcing to the blockchain.\n\nNor is this just a battle of the old guard and the new. The founder of Renaissance has invested in Numerai, and Point72 Asset Management, the fund founded by billionaire Stephen Cohen, has put money into Quantopian. ""These people who I considered old school really understood what I was getting at,"" says Numerai founder Richard Craib. ""And I thought I was going to be ahead of my time.""\n\nEven the apparent skeptics are embracing the trend. ""I\'m concerned that people may have unrealistic expectations of what is possible with the current state of the art,"" David Siegel, co-founder of storied quant fund Two Sigma Investments, said last fall. But more recently, his fund ran an online contest through Silicon Valley data scientist marketplace Kaggle, offering a $100,000 prize for the best machine learning model. One company director indicated the contest was more of a recruitment tool than a full embrace of crowdsourcing or machine learning. But whatever the intention, it was yet another example of Silicon Valley and Wall Street drawing closer than ever before.', 'As Iran moves away from using the US dollar, bitcoin has emerged as a potential replacement. The cryptocurrency could thrive in a country where more than 50 million people are connected to the internet, financial experts claim.\n\nIn the wake of US President Donald Trump’s travel restrictions on seven countries including Iran, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran announced last month that the US dollar will be replaced with a stable reserve currency more frequently used in foreign trades.\n\nREAD MORE: Iran to dump the US dollar in response to Trump\'s travel ban\n\nTwo possible replacements are being explored such as using one currency, potentially the euro, or allowing Iranians to select from multiple currencies, reported the Coin Telegraph.\n\nThe announcement has caught the attention of the country’s first bitcoin exchange, BTXCapital, which sees Iran as a market with potential to grow. “The market is massive. A large population with a high proportion connected to the internet means there is a lot of completely untapped market potential,” Ganesh Jung, CEO of Draglet who develop an exchange platform used by BTXCapital, told IBTimes UK.\n\nIndia recently saw a surge in bitcoin usage following the country’s demonetization of high-value paper notes, pushing people towards cashless transactions.\n\nHowever, last week the Reserve Bank of India issued a warning to bitcoin users saying it is not licensed in the country.\n\n“Any user, holder, investor, trader, etc. dealing with virtual currencies will be doing so at their own risk,” they said in a statement.\n\nThe cryptocurrency faces similar challenges in Iran where, according to the central bank, Article 2 of the state’s Money and Banking Act states that “The Currency of Iran shall be in the form of money and coins,” which were either in circulation at the time the legislation was passed or which are issued under the Act.\n\nHowever, the restriction does not prevent bitcoin being used for other purposes including money transfers overseas.\n\nREAD MORE: Bitcoin keeps popping with prices at 2016 highs\n\nJung claims Iran will be supportive of bitcoin and use it as a way to “signal that the country is hoping to reintegrate with the West – and bitcoin is one way to do this.""\n\nBitcoin more than doubled its value in 2016, becoming the year’s best-performing currency. It rallied at 126 percent on the back of strong demand in China, where the yuan saw its worst year on record, weakening 6.5 percent.', 'In January, a transaction sent by the Reminder to News Media Canada was blocked by PayPal for being noncompliant with PayPal’s “acceptable use policy.”\n\nReminder, formerly known as the Flin Flon Daily Reminder, is a newspaper published three times a week in Canada.\n\nReminder publisher Valerie Durnin sent a payment worth $242.95 to the News Media Canada team to enter an article entitled ""Syrian family adapts to new life” to the annual Canadian Community Newspaper Awards.\n\nProhibited news\n\nLater, it was discovered that PayPal locked the account of News Media Canada because the transaction contained the keyword “Syria.”\n\nOn PayPal, when an institution or an individual sends payment to each other, the transaction is considered a goods or services payment. Under this transactional category, users are required to input the description of the item, good or service being sold to the other party. In the case of the Reminder and News Media Canada, the algorithm was triggered as the Reminder editor included the title of the article which contained the keyword “Syria” in the transaction.\n\nInitially, PayPal blocked the payment for 72 hours and promised the Reminder a response or a follow-up within three days. After 72 hours passed, the PayPal team did not issue an explanation or a response and simply redirected the payment back to the Reminder.\n\nWhen the Reminder contacted News Media Canada in regards to the failed payment, the News Media Canada team realized that PayPal blocked the incoming transaction from the Reminder and the actual account of News Media Canada, which meant that the PayPal account of News Media Canada wasn’t eligible to receive or send payments to anyone and withdraw balance from the account.\n\nRegardless of the purpose of the payment, the PayPal team continued to lock the account of News Media Canada and demanded the media outlet to provide explicit details about the services it provides and the article.\n\nIt was only after a PayPal Canada spokeswoman sent an email to News Media Canada stating that the US Department of Treasury has regulations for sending payments to Syria when the account was restored. The entire process of unlocking the account and having the transaction go through took over a week.\n\nBitcoin and financial freedom\n\nSuch cases involving centralized financial service providers have led to great discomfort for businesses and individuals over the past few decades. PayPal is known for its reckless actions towards consumers, blocking transactions and disabling accounts at their will without attempting to come to a resolution with account holders.\n\nIt is important for users to understand the importance of financial privacy and the merit of using a decentralized payment system or currency like Bitcoin. Centralized financial service providers like PayPal shouldn’t be able to block the payments of genuine business operators based on unsubstantiated accusations.', 'As Iran plans to scrap the use of US dollar as reserve currency, there are speculations of it being replaced by Bitcoin. Read more...\n\nIran could pave the way for the adoption of Bitcoin as a foreign reserve currency. The reports of Iran moving away from US dollar as the preferred reserve currency in retaliation to the travel ban issued by Trump administration has led to this speculation.\n\nUntil recently, Iran has been under sanctions for its nuclear program. With the sanctions relaxed last year, there were signs of trade and diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States returning to normalcy. However, the recent executive decision banning the entry of people from seven Islamic countries into the United States has again flared up tensions between both the countries.\n\nEarlier, on many occasions, Iran had pushed for the use of currencies other than the US dollar for international trade. But given the strong position of the US dollar as the reserve currency across the world, the initiative was moderately successful. However, recent developments under the new presidency have encouraged the Persian nation to pursue the use of alternative currencies.\n\nBitcoin has already gained acceptance among people across the world as an alternative to fiat. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin, it’s ease of use and faster cross-border fund transfer capabilities of the digital currency makes it a logical choice for use in international trade. However, it is highly unlikely for countries to adopt a currency that is not issued by any central bank.\n\nThere have been calls for the Iranian banking and financial sector to explore the use of Bitcoin and its underlying technology. Recently, the chief executive of Tejarat Bank in Iran called for the country’s banking and payment service providers to prepare themselves to embrace new technologies which could help the country’s financial sector. Few news outlets have quoted Ganesh Jung, the CEO of Draglet — the creator of Bitcoin exchange platform currently used by Iranian BTXCapital saying,\n\n“The market is massive. A large population with a high proportion connected to the internet means there is a lot of completely untapped market potential.”\n\nHe also added that Iran would be supportive of Bitcoin to signal that the country is hoping to reintegrate with the West.\n\nAt present, there are no rules that specifically prevent the use of Bitcoin in the country. But an official endorsement of the cryptocurrency by adopting Bitcoin as a foreign reserve currency is still far-fetched. If it happens, then the adoption of Bitcoin will further increase, strengthening its value across markets.\n\nRef: RT | Financial Tribune | Image: Shutterstock']"

Gross was originally charged last March.\n\nNow, according to reports, Judge Alison Nathan has delayed jury selection by a day after the prosecution introduced a new witness, who was said to have information related to Gross’s activities.\n\nJudge Nathan ultimately opted not to allow the witness, punting jury selection to 14th February.\n\nLebedev, along with Murgio, was initially arrested in mid-2015, accused of running an unlicensed money transmission business in Florida. While related court filings don’t explicitly draw the connection, prosecutors have tied Coin.mx’s actions to a broader cybercriminal scheme involving a series of high-profile hacks in the last several years.\n\nThe most notable of these was a breach of Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase, resulting in a data compromise for tens of millions of customer accounts. Prosecutors have also alleged that that Coin.mx functioned as a money conduit for the cybercrime scheme, using the New Jersey credit union – since shuttered by regulators – as a means to discreetly move funds.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear when the trial itself will begin.

The firm scrutinized permissioned blockchain protocols and applications with professional auditing standards.\n\nThe aim of the project, Deloitte said, was to “enhance the utility and trust of a permissioned blockchain system” by putting it through both professional audit and assurance standards.\n\nIf 2017 is the year of blockchain prototypes and proof-of-concepts turning into real-world applications, auditors will have to keep abreast with technological changes to scrutinize and pore over protocols and data from new innovations like blockchain technology.\n\n“[W]e need to get ahead of the curve on quantifying and defining how an auditor could provide a level of assurance on a permissioned blockchain application” said Will Bible, a partner at Deloitte. Further, he revealed that it was merely a “matter of time” before which Deloitte’s clients started switching portions of their businesses onto blockchain-based infrastructure. The oncoming wave of adoption further underlines the need for Deloitte’s audit and assurance project.\n\nDeloitte’s Rubix – a team of professionals exclusively researching and developing blockchain applications in the firms Toronto offices was involved in the project. Bitcoin enthusiasts will remember Rubix for their effort to purchase and launch a bitcoin ATM now installed in Deloitte’s Toronto office.\n\n“We thought it was really important to show people how to get access to bitcoin, because it is really the entry point to understand the broader implications of blockchain,” stated Rubix strategy lead and co-founder Iliana Oris Valiente at the time.\n\nIn order to understand and explore the project, the Rubix team applied existing guidance from attestation standards, to the permissioned blockchain application. The development team also devised procedures specific to the requirements of a loyalty points blockchain application built on Ethereum technology.\n\nValiente stated:\n\nFor the purposes of this project, we selected an internally-developed loyalty points blockchain application built by our Rubix by Deloitte team on a permissioned Ethereum network as a test case.\n\nBig on Blockchain\n\nWhile all four services firms are known to be engaging in researching and developing blockchain applications and protocols for clients alike, Deloitte is arguably leading the pack with a multitude of developments in the blockchain-specific Fintech space.\n\nThe firm’s ‘global blockchain team’ now consists of 8000 professionals across 20 countries, who have developed over 30 blockchain-related prototypes in areas including digital banking, payments and rewards programs.\n\nDeloitte deemed 2017 the “make-or-break” year for blockchain adoption when opening its blockchain lab in New York in January.

The original Alliance was founded in 2013 by Anthony Di Iorio, who stepped down from his role in 2015.\n\n“Our mandate is to educate, drive awareness and foster a dialogue between businesses, thought leaders and policy makers to ensure that Canada continues to be a leading nation for blockchain technology innovation,” Kyle Kemper, current executive director of the new Blockchain Association of Canada (BAC), told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“There is an incredible, thriving scene here that keeps growing,” said BAC board member and Outlier Solutions CEO Amber D. Scott. “Most recently I've seen great interest and engagement from both the academic and regulatory communities. The discussions that are happening in those spaces are excellent, and likely to foster innovation in the long term.”\n\nAgeesen Sri, director on the BAC board, noted: “Canada is a hotbed of talent, creativeness and grit and there are great things ahead for the country in this industry as long as the environment (both regulatory, financing and education) keeps pace with the innovations.”\n\nScott is a firm believer in the benefit of an organization like the BAC:\n\n\n\n“I believe that it’s incredibly important that we as a community are willing to educate and advise policy makers (as well as listen to their concerns). Where we have the ability to work toward effective and well-written policy, we should be doing that.”\n\nA New Vision\n\nConsidering the wide-reaching scope and disruptive potential of blockchain technology across so many sectors, from healthcare to the Internet of Things, the change in name from the Bitcoin Alliance to the Blockchain Association of Canada (BAC) seemed like a logical step.\n\n“The space has grown to encapsulate much more than just Bitcoin, which for some time was the only blockchain of significance,” said Jason Cassidy, vice-chair of the BAC board of directors. “Bitcoin, being the largest blockchain, is still very much a part of our mandate. The BAC will continue to keep Bitcoin in focus and we see a bright future for it within our own country.”\n\n“The idea of a movement from ‘Bitcoin’ to ‘blockchain’ on behalf of the BAC is not an abandonment of Bitcoin,” Scott said. “And as much as I love Bitcoin, the word itself does create certain barriers, like difficulty in opening a traditional bank account for the association.\n\n“It’s a running joke at Outlier that when it comes to banking, Bitcoin is like Fight Club: the first rule is that you don’t talk about it.”\n\nBAC board Chair Manie Eagar recognized the benefits an advocacy organization like the BAC can accomplish. During the recent board of directors election, Eagar said:\n\n“There is still much work to do around merchant adoption, friendlier user experience, regulatory clarification, the opening of bank accounts for BTC startups and trading accounts around the world, closing the gap between innovation and regulatory roadblocks.”\n\nScott concurred: “It’s ludicrous that innovative Canadian businesses find themselves unable to access the Canadian banking system. If there’s one space in which I would love to see immediate government intervention, it would be here. Basic business banking should be entrenched as a right for legitimate organizations. We already have this right as individuals. I think that this alone would attract even more innovators to Canada.”\n\n“This is the time to redouble our efforts and ensure that the fight is not just on the frontlines, but also where it really matters,” Eager added. “With people who can apply this for their personal benefit and in their daily lives.”\n\nThere was considerable interest in the recent Bitcoin Alliance of Canada elections, with highly qualified blockchain entrepreneurs and academics running for positions on the board of directors. Board members now represent a wide range of expertise in the space, from technical experts in blockchain technology and its applications to communications and government relations professionals.\n\nThe new BAC is planning a hackathon, educational workshops and a major conference in the early summer.

02/15/2017,"['Speculation about the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF possible regulatory approval continues. On March 11, the US Securities and Exchange Commission should come to its “yes” or “no” verdict after almost four years of waiting.\n\nIt may happen by the time two of the world’s top Bitcoin exchanges that are based in China - Huobi and OKCoin - would have resumed their full withdrawal services.\n\nMost commentators are certain that the first Bitcoin exchange traded fund or ETF is not likely to be approved. However, commentaries are still divided over the issue and none of the stakeholders rule out the approval completely. The consequences of a positive decision could be huge.\n\nSo if it happens, what would the ETF mean to the market?\n\nYes means +68 percent return\n\nGoing by notable views at the moment, the chance of the Bitcoin ETF being approved is very slim.\n\nAnalyst firm Needham & Company, on Feb. 10, confirmed its prior estimate that it sees a ""sub-25 percent"" chance of approval for the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF. But, if approved, it says the ETF would likely attract more than $300 mln into the market in its first week alone.\n\nWilly Woo, a cryptocurrency market analyst, also puts the approval probability at 25 percent and speculates that $500 mln and $1 bln will be injected into the market.\n\nQuantitative analysis and value research firm, Emerita Capital, assigned a probability of 35 percent for approval against 65 percent probability of rejection, making our final average expected price $1645.45 or a +67.8 percent expected return above the current price.\n\nChinese may be caught unprepared\n\nBy the time two of the world’s top Bitcoin exchanges - Huobi and OKCoin - would have resumed their full withdrawal services, in about a month of its KYC/AML system upgrade (it could be less), the first US-based Bitcoin ETF could be approved.\n\nAccording to Spencer Bogart from Needham & Company, this ongoing upgrade is a plus for the approval bid of the Bitcoin ETF as trading is now somewhat more evenly spread geographically worldwide.\n\nHowever, considering that ETFs have a long history of penetrating new and occasionally untapped investment areas, it’s likely that approval may dawn on Chinese players, unprepared for the first-mover advantage it would bring.\n\nThis is crucial, particularly now that the latest reports say the PBoC would be eyeing a tighter monetary policy as China’s inflation measures hit multi-year highs in January, up by 6.9 percent, and the consumer price index rose 2.5 percent.\n\nDollar sways\n\nIt should also be considered that Bitcoin transactions in US dollars have spiked of late even before the series of regulatory measures introduced by Chinese exchanges and there has been a relative price stability around the $1000 range even without the full participation of the most popular Chinese exchanges. The early user advantage will sway further to the US dollar transactions at the commencement of the ETF’s operation, though how better the experience gets would determine how long the focus on the market would be.\n\nShorting Bitcoin\n\nShorting Bitcoin is a common practice. With much of the ETF’s operation solely based around Bitcoin, it could either prevent or make it easier for this practice to continue.\n\nIt could also affect the price. Needham & Company observe a slight downside in the price of Bitcoin in the event of a disapproval, while Emerita Capital targets a Bitcoin price of $3,678 if the ETF is approved in 2017 and $551 if rejected.', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Florida software engineer and a New Jersey pastor engaged in lies and corruption to facilitate an illegal bitcoin exchange business whose operators wanted to take over a small credit union to evade scrutiny, a federal prosecutor said on Wednesday.\n\nAt the start of a trial in Manhattan federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Won Shin told jurors that programmer Yuri Lebedev schemed with others to bribe Trevor Gross, the pastor and head of a Jackson, New Jersey-based credit union housed in his church.\n\nShin said Gross accepted bribes including a $150,000 church donation in exchange for helping unlicensed bitcoin exchange Coin.mx’s operator take over Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union.\n\nCoin.mx, which employed Lebedev while running through a front called “Collectables Club,” in exchange could use the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing payments by individuals buying the virtual currency.\n\n“The bribes and lies had a simple, shared purpose: For the defendants Lebedev and Gross and their co-conspirators to make money,” Shin said.\n\nBut lawyers for Lebedev, 39, and Gross, 52, said they did nothing wrong and were being blamed due to actions by Anthony Murgio, who ran Coin.mx and who they said manipulated people while trying to illegally grow the business.\n\n“Yuri was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people,” said Eric Creizman, Lebedev’s lawyer.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nKristen Santillo, Gross’ lawyer, said he was tricked into believing Coin.mx was a memorabilia club, and thought there was nothing wrong about a donation to the church, and which did not benefit him personally.\n\n“He didn’t know anything about what they were up to,” she said.\n\nThe trial followed an investigation rooted in a data breach that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) disclosed in 2014 that exposed over 83 million accounts, leading to charges against nine individuals.\n\nGross, Lebedev and Murgio were not accused of hacking. But prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli behind the breach, Gery Shalon.\n\nProsecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of over 100 million peoples’ information.\n\nProsecutors said they carried out the hackings to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty.\n\nRegulators took the credit union into conservatorship in 2015. Murgio pleaded guilty to charges related to Coin.mx in January.', 'With many crypto traders sitting on the sidelines and awaiting news from China, volumes for bitcoin, the market\'s most highly traded asset, have seen a decline.\n\nMarket participants traded 6,670 bitcoins through Bitfinex, one of the world\'s largest exchanges by volume, in the 24 hours through roughly 21:30 UTC today, more than 50% less than the daily average of 17,900 bitcoins over the last week.\n\nLikewise, volume has declined at major Chinese exchanges Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC, all exchanges whose policies have been affected by directives from that country\'s central bank.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, bitcoin\'s price has stabilized, fluctuating between a daily high of $1,011 reached at 01:15 UTC and a session low of $1,001.00 hit at 07:00 UTC, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nThe 14th February session provided a similar story, as bitcoin prices moved within a slightly larger range between $987.33 and $1,106.44, additional BPI figures reveal.\n\nThe rangebound trading that bitcoin has experienced may form part of a broader trend, according to Vinny Lingham, market analyst and CEO of identity startup Civic.\n\nLingham told CoinDesk:\n\n""I expect bitcoin to consolidate around $1,000 for a while, maybe a month or even two.""\n\nWhile some might embrace such a period of lower volatility, this reduction in price movement also results in fewer opportunities for traders to profit from the cryptocurrency\'s price swings.\n\nAlternatives emerge\n\nBut while bitcoin\'s market has settled, many other cryptographic assets have received tailwinds from the development.\n\nAt the time of report, eight out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap (listed in terms of market capitalization) were higher for the day, with monero and dash having experienced the most notable gains.\n\nMonero, a token that powers a blockchain that leverages digital signatures to help preserve the privacy of its users, rose to $13.74 during the session, more than 5.6% higher than the currency\'s price of $13.01 at 12:04 UTC, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.\n\nAt the time of report, monero\'s token, XMR, was trading at $13.61, 4.6% higher for the session.\n\nData provided by cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub shows the benefit that this particular altcoin has derived as a result of traders\' lack of interest in bitcoin.\n\n""We\'ve seen lower volume (both shorts and longs) in the past few days on BTC/USD, with traders moving on to other markets which offer greater volatility,"" Petar Zivkovski, COO for Whaleclub, told CoinDesk.\n\nHe singled out monero\'s XMR token in particular, indicating that ""we see some volume flocking"" to this privacy-oriented digital currency.\n\nDash, a digital currency that offers users privacy and instant transactions, also pushed higher in 15th February. The cryptocurrency climbed to $19.66 during the session, 8.6% higher than the currency’s price of $18.10 at 12:04 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAt the time of report, dash had fallen to $19.23, representing a 6.2% increase for the day.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, offered similar sentiment.\n\n""We are also moving a bit of money into altcoins,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nHis take is that this is just the latest example of traders investing in smaller digital currencies when bitcoin prices remain rangebound.\n\nPenguin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Japan's leading banking groups are pouring money into the country’s largest Bitcoin exchange, BitFlyer. The experiment they are about to perform means a lot for the global financial services market.\n\nThe $1.75 mln funding comes from Mizuho Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Dai-ichi Life Insurance, a part of Dai-ichi Life Holdings.\n\nThe aim is to use the exchange’s digital currency know-how to better secure and make international wire transfers cheaper particularly for remittance purpose, reports Nikkei Asian Review. Working with BitFlyer in this aspect is expected to make wiring money become available around the clock, instead of customers being confined to ATM hours.\n\nTaking on remittances\n\nMost of the problems the initiative tends to address are universal in nature and it could be handy for any banking institution in Asia, Africa, Europe and elsewhere to use. It could also be extended for use in remittances.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, addressing the high cost of sending remittances at the global, country and municipality levels has been a major challenge and how the right approaches are used to tackle it at the country level varies depending on specific challenges faced by each country.\n\nBitcoin’s introduction into this aspect in Japan could mean the start of a Bitcoin-banking revolution which could break beyond imagination. The successful outcome of the trial with BitFlyer will likely prove critics of the digital currency wrong. It may also draw financial institutions that have been skeptical about Bitcoin to rethink their respective strategies and seek ways to replicate the system.\n\nBiggest global market\n\nJapan is a huge market for Bitcoin. It has even gotten bigger following the recent series of regulatory measures introduced in parts of China. The country is now deemed to be above the US and China as the highest-volume country for Bitcoin trading in the world.\n\nGlobally, several startups have been working to improve on how to solve the problem facing the traditional money-transfer method dominated by the likes of Western Union, Moneygram, and RIA, which account for more than 25 percent of the world’s annual remittance volume.\n\nSome startups in Africa such as Bitpesa have been building Bitcoin alternatives though they still have to go through the banks. What becomes of this foremost experiment will reflect globally as the nascent Bitcoin industry produces more players like Payphil, Sentbe and SCI.\n\nLast year, Bitcoin startups and investors revealed that 20 percent of remittances from the Philippines to South Korea are processed using Bitcoin."", ""Have you ever wondered if you could keep your Bitcoin in a fixed deposit (FD) or a term deposit and earn interest on them? Well, wonder no more. Coinbank claims to be giving out the highest interest rate anywhere in the world on Bitcoin.\n\nCoinbank is a wallet provided by Amaze Mining and Blockchain Research Limited. They are also the people behind GBMiners and are based out of New Delhi, India. Please, note that there is also CoinsBank that offers Blockchain services too but which is registered in Scotland and has nothing to do with either Indian Coinbank or the topic of this article.\n\nThe statement, released by Amit Bhardwaj of Amaze Mining and Blockchain Research, says:\n\n“We have two plans for three-month and six-month Fixed Deposits. On three months we are offering a one percent rate of interest and on a six-month deposit, we are offering 1.25 percent. This is the highest rate of interest offered on Bitcoin globally by anybody.”\n\nIndians love their fixed deposits\n\nIndians traditionally have a love for fixed deposits and almost every household has some money in FDs or would at least aspire to keep some in one. Transporting that concept to Bitcoin is interesting.\n\n“Billions worth of Bitcoins are saved in people's wallets on various platforms and since Bitcoin is an established store of value it can be lent and hence can and should earn interest like any other real world asset, whether that be your tillable land or piece of gold or fiat currency itself,” says Amit Bhardwaj. “Hence, with this philosophy, we are launching Coinbank, the world's first bank which is offering real like interest rates or rather better rates on your fixed deposits.”\n\nThe question of regulation\n\nIn India at least fixed deposits are issued by banks or by companies such as Non-Banking Finance Companies. In both these cases, there are regulators like the Reserve Bank of India involved.\n\nWe were told by Amit that since they are only dealing with Bitcoin, they do not need a license from the RBI.\n\n“We might have needed a license from the local authorities,” he explains, “only if we had been either accepting deposits in a local fiat currency or offering interest earnings in the same. We are doing neither.”\n\nHow will it all work out?\n\nCoinbank is offering two types of ‘fixed deposits.’ You can invest in their six-month plan which will offer an interest rate of 1.25 percent per month or their three-month plan on which you will get one percent per month.\n\nHowever, since your Bitcoins will be locked up, you can only withdraw your money if you accept a lower interest rate of 0.25 percent per month pro rata on any premature withdrawal.\n\nThere is, however, a minimum 15 day lock-in period during which no withdrawals are possible at all. Unlike traditional banks, Coinbank has no plans to lend Bitcoins but they would be investing money in Bitcoin mining and that is how they will be able to offer any interest according to Amit.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nAny investments should be made carefully and only after due-diligence. We asked Amit Bhardwaj about the fiduciary responsibilities that they are entering.\n\nHe remarked:\n\n“We have put in best-in-class security measures for storage of earned Bitcoins. The Bitcoin community has seen enough hacks of consumer funds and it cannot and should not face another one and especially not from professional miners.”\n\nIt is an interesting concept and if a wallet offers interest, there is always an enticing possibility that it may attract users. It now remains to be seen if most other wallets will also start offering interest or if it will remain confined to a minority of service providers such as BSave."", 'After almost two years of debate and seemingly nothing left to be said on the topic of bitcoin scalability, miners continue to not make a concrete decision with transaction backlogs now becoming common.\n\nBW.com, a mining pool with around 7% of the network’s hashrate, signals for 8MB blocks, but has never mined with any client which increases maxblocksize. Bitmain’s co-founder, Micree Zhan, stated in a recent interview that he prefers Bitcoin Unlimited. Jihan Wu, the other co-founder of Bitmain, has vocally asked for a maxblocksize increase. Yet, despite the pool controlling around 18% of the network’s hashrate, they do not mine with Bitcoin Unlimited and have never mined with any client which increases maxblocksize.\n\nThis behavior appears puzzling, but, there was collusion, CCN was told back in November by a miner who would rather not be named:\n\n“I saw industry colluding to push their agendas and I wanted no part in it.”\n\nHe is one of many miners that have now entered the scene “not primarily driven by profit seeking but to disrupt, or at least, irritate, the incumbents a little bit and free myself the burden of moral conflict.”\n\nNo details were provided, nor any concrete evidence, but suspicions that there was collusion has continued to increase due to the maneuvers over the Hong Kong Agreement.\n\nJust under exactly one year ago, almost all miners and many Bitcoin Core developers held a closed-door meeting where no journalists or independent observers were invited.\n\nLittle, if anything, is known about what exactly happened during those 17 hours, except for a published signed agreement which binds miners to only run Bitcoin Core compatible clients for the foreseeable future.\n\nIndications that this was more than just a paper promise came within hours of the agreement’s publication due to a spat between miners and Adam Back, Blockstream’s President. The English version showed him as signing under his individual capacity, but the Chinese version showed him signing as Blockstream’s President. This discrepancy led to miners publicly asking him to changes the English version to Blockstream President, which he did.\n\nSuspicions that this wasn’t just a mere paper agreement grew further when Bitcoin Core pull requested an unfinished segwit to argue that, technically, they had kept the agreement. Luke-Jr further claimed he technically delivered on the maxblocksize increase promise by suggesting a decrease of the blocksize to 300KB, followed by a 17% yearly increase, delivering 2MB in around two decades.\n\nThe nature of these arguments, which are based on legalese technicalities, indicates the agreement was contractual and binding, but there has been no concrete evidence except for the miner’s statement that he saw industry collusion.\n\nBitcoin Core developers and miners have kept blaming each other for breaching the agreement, but all miners who signed it continue to mine with the Bitcoin Core client.\n\n1MB Forever?\n\nThere are two proposals on the table to increase transaction capacity, Segregated Witnesses – a proposal by Bitcoin Core – and Bitcoin Unlimited – a new grassroots client. They both currently stand at around 20-25%. Bitmain, F2Pool, BW.com and HaoBTC, all signers of the agreement, are not choosing either, maintaining capacity at a very limited 1MB.\n\nIt is not clear why they are making no decision. Suggestions have included that they are waiting for the right time, that they are waiting for Bitcoin Core to make a new, more acceptable, proposal, that they may be enjoying the high fees, that they find any move to be highly risky and that perhaps they are bound to run only Bitcoin Core compatible clients.\n\nSince the agreement was signed, mining has become more decentralized. In February 2016, F2Pool and Bitmain had, in combination, just above 50% of the network hash-share with Bitfury, BTCC and BW.com accounting for almost all of the rest. Now, new pools have entered the scene with ViaBTC and BTC.TOP being the most prominent. They have not signed the agreement and are both vocally in favor of Bitcoin Unlimited, mining with the new grassroots client.\n\nHowever, without a decision by F2Pool or Bitmain, both signatory to the agreement, it is unlikely the situation will change anytime soon. Wang Chun, co-founder of F2Pool, told CCN earlier this month that they have no plan to upgrade to segwit or to mine with Bitcoin Unlimited. Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, told CCN on the 5th of February 2017 that:\n\n“The protocol debate is not my priority. I need to focus on BITMAIN’s own business these days.”\n\nIf there was indeed collusion, then Bitcoin is facing its ultimate test. Mining is an open and permissionless zero-sum game as any gain in hashrate is at the expense of other miners. As such, concentration of hashrate, in theory, is not a great problem because any abuse would likely lead to miners being replaced with newer honest miners who wish to protect their investment.\n\nWhether that theory translates into practice remains to be seen, but what appears clear, for now, is that any solution is unlikely for 2017, with transaction backlogs probably continuing as bitcoin begins to transform into a slow, unpredictable and expensive payment network.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Satoshi Nakamoto’s math doesn’t quite add up.\n\n\n\nIn chapter 11 of the Bitcoin white paper, the pseudonymous author explained that an honest mining majority will always outrun a dishonest minority. As a key innovation in digital currency, this ensures transactions are practically irreversible once they have sufficient confirmations, effectively solving the double-spend problem.\n\nHowever, as first explained by Israeli mathematician Meni Rosenfeld back in 2012, Satoshi made some simplified assumptions. While Bitcoin mining is a random process, Satoshi did not fully take into account that honest miners can be just as lucky or unlucky as dishonest miners can.\n\nCyril Grunspan, mathematician at École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs Léonard de Vinci, and Ricardo Pérez-Marco, mathematician at the French National Center for Scientific Research, now have taken this randomness into account. The two Parisians published a new paper, finally correcting Satoshi’s “mistake.”\n\n“Satoshi wrongly assumed that honest miners use exactly as much time to find a block as they would on average,” Grunspan told Bitcoin Magazine. “However, this is actually a rough approximation of reality, since the time used by honest miners to mine a block is not deterministic. Therefore, the distribution of the number of blocks mined by the attacker is actually — what is called — a ‘negative binomial distribution.’ Not the assumed ‘Poisson law.’”\n\nIn essence, the Bitcoin white paper assumes that two factors are needed to calculate how irreversible a transaction is. Satoshi rightly assumed that the share of total hash power available to the attacker is one factor: as an attacker controls more hash power, more confirmations are needed. And Satoshi rightfully assumed that the number of confirmations is another factor: the more confirmations a transaction has, the more secure it is.\n\nGrunspan and Pérez-Marco now show how a third factor comes into play: the deviation from average mining time — “luck” — the honest miners have in finding blocks. If they are very lucky, and find blocks faster than the average, their chain will probably be further ahead; the attacker will have had less time to secretly mine an alternative chain. On the other hand, if the honest miners are unlucky and find blocks slower than the average, they will probably be less far ahead: thus, the attacker will have had more time to mine an alternative chain.\n\nWhat This Means\n\nThe good news, as now conclusively shown by Grunspan and Pérez-Marco, is that the basic premise of the white paper still holds up. Bitcoin works as intended.\n\n“In this paper, we show that the probability of double spends drops exponentially to zero as the honest mining majority finds more blocks,” Grunspan said. In other words, it becomes increasingly difficult for minority attackers to catch up and overtake the honest majority.\n\nThat said, the security assumptions as stated in the white paper need to be tweaked a little. Rather than just accounting for the amount of hash power an attacker has and the number of blocks the attacker is behind, this third factor must also be considered. In their paper, Grunspan and Pérez-Marco have now published exactly how much this matters.\n\n“This is interesting information that can be used by merchants to monitor risk,” Grunspan said on the relevancy of their calculations. “Let’s say a merchant always waits for six confirmations before sending his goods to a customer, as that is the level of risk he is comfortable with. That’s 60 minutes on average. But sometimes he’ll have to wait for two hours before six blocks are found. If that happens, the double-spend risk is also higher. So for the same level of security, he’ll actually have to wait for a seventh confirmation. While if the confirmations come in much faster, he should be fine even with five confirmations.”\n\nAs double-spend protection is arguably at the heart of Bitcoin’s innovation, the mathematical simplification in Satoshi’s work is notable, especially for mathematicians. Grunspan does allow, however, that simplifying assumptions in a white paper is also understandable.\n\nAnd, perhaps, it reveals another hint about Bitcoin’s origins.\n\n“Satoshi was a genius,” concluded Grunspan. “But he was not a mathematician.”"", 'Merely weeks after cautioning residents that bitcoin companies weren’t authorized or licensed to operate in the country, India’s central bank is reportedly not including bitcoin under the purview of regulations for digital payments. In essence, the cryptocurrency will not be legitimized as a legal form of payment or settlement in an economy which is the world’s largest receiver of remittances, anytime soon.\n\nDigital payments and financial technology (Fintech) solutions have caught on rampantly amongst the Indian society in recent times, particularly after a sweeping, unprecedented cash crunch brought on by the government’s demonetization drive.\n\nIn light of these new innovations, the Payments and Settlement Systems Act of 2007 [PDF], the code by which payment systems are regulated, was amended to include digital payment gateways and platforms. The amended regulations will look to deem physical cash and digital cash as equals, with developments toward interoperability and a unified payments platform as India embraces the digitization of cash.\n\nAs it transpires, bitcoin will not be included as a valid payment system under the new act, according to a report in Indian publication The Telegraph.\n\nBitcoin Continues to Get Shunned\n\nThe prospect of digital currencies’ being acknowledged by authorities were dealt an early blow when India’s central (federal) government decided against creating a separate regulator for the digital payments industry. The authority to regulate was promptly awarded to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s central bank. Setting up a separate regulator would have led to one too many financial regulators, according to officials. “Globally, the trend is towards unified regulators and the RBI is a strong institution, hence the government chose to go with it,” the officials stated according to the report.\n\nThe RBI will set up a ‘Payments Regulatory Board’, headed by its governor, to oversee and handle digital payment gateways which now fall under the amended regulations.\n\nEarlier this month, the central bank issued a public notice, urging caution among bitcoin adopters and users in the country while stating that no exchanges or businesses dealing with the cryptocurrency were licensed by the authority. A week after the public notice, India’s small but growing bitcoin industry came together to form the “Virtual Currency Association”. The industry group, which consists of India’s biggest digital currency companies and exchanges, has since set out to lobby the government to license and recognize bitcoin trading.\n\nHowever, the report suggests that “attempts by bitcoin players to come under the ambit of the new body are unlikely to succeed as the government and the RBI are not in favour of legitimizing bitcoins as legal tender”.\n\nThe stance is certain to prove frustrating among bitcoin exchange operators and companies in the industry, particularly when the new regulations allow licensed e-wallet platforms like widely-adopted PayTM to gain access to RBI-controlled remittance infrastructure. Fundamentally, Fintech platforms like PayTM and other e-wallets will gain payment and settlement interoperability with every bank account in a country of over a billion people.\n\nIndia Isn’t Catching On\n\nThe continuing hardline stance taken by authorities contrasts to approaches taken by other Asian countries.\n\nIn December, Philippine authorities revealed that they were considering regulating bitcoin exchange operators after a marked increase in bitcoin remittance in the country. Come January, the regulations were approved before their public release last week. Fundamentally, bitcoin is now recognized as a valid payment method in the Philippines.\n\nIn Japan, industry insiders expect to see up to 20,000 bitcoin-accepting merchants in 2017, quintupling the total from 2016, due to the upcoming regulations toward the digital currency industry, expected in June. Tokyo-based bitFlyer, Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange now sees investors in all three of the country’s ‘mega-banks’. Japan recognized bitcoin and virtual currencies as equivalents to fiat cash in early 2016 before proceeding to pass a bill toward the regulation of bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBy turning a blind eye toward the bitcoin industry when not shunning it completely, India is missing a trick when it comes to the next generation of simpler, more efficient and faster digital payments.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Researchers from North Carolina State University, Boston University, and George Mason University in the U.S. have created a new system that makes it harder to detect bitcoin transactions.\n\nCalled TumbleBit, it is a computer protocol that runs on top of Bitcoin and benefits from an existing notion known as a ‘mixing service,’ according to a report from the North Carolina State University.\n\nAccording to the research, instead of Party A paying Party B, there are several Parties A that pay an intermediary ‘tumbler,’ which then pays Parties B. However, the more parties involved, the harder it is to determine which Party A paid which Party B.\n\nYet, Alessandra Scafuro, an assistant professor of computer science at NC State and co-author of a paper describing TumbleBit, said a security flaw still exists.\n\nNamely, if an outside observer can compromise the tumbler, it could figure out who was paying whom.\n\nTo solve this problem, TumbleBit undertakes a three-phased approach.\n\nDuring phase one, known as escrow, the Parties A inform the tumbler that they want to make a payment while Parties B notify the tumbler that they want to be paid, which is all done through the blockchain.\n\nIn phase two, researchers from the universities involved in the development placed cryptographic tools in place that permitted the tumbler to pay the correct parties what they were owed without knowing which parties were involved. The research states that the second phase does not appear on the blockchain.\n\nDuring phase three, which is known as the cashout, all the transactions take place at the same time, which in turn makes it harder to determine which parties are involved in any transaction. Phase three, NC State, says also does not appear on the blockchain.\n\nHowever, while this three-phase approach may solve one issue, it doesn’t solve them all. As Scafuro adds, TumbleBit works only with fixed denominations.\n\nSo paying amounts larger than that denomination require making multiple payments. That’s something we’re working on.\n\nThe use of public keys gave users with a sense of anonymity; however, all transactions are essentially visible on the blockchain, but more and more people are researching new ways to de-anonymize these public keys.\n\nNow, with this latest research from the U.S. universities it provides a step further in hiding bitcoin transactions that so many are working toward with various research that is being undertaken.\n\nOf course, while many may be glad to hear about this latest research regarding bitcoin’s anonymity, it will certainly peak the interests of darknet criminals who may be keen to hide who they are paying at any given time.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price made an upside breakout from its symmetrical triangle but failed to sustain the climb, which suggests that consolidation could still stay in play.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price recently broke above a short-term consolidation pattern, possibly signaling its intention to head further north.\n\nHowever, price pulled back to the broken resistance just as quickly so the breakout may have been a result of a squeeze rather than a directional catalyst.\n\nScrolling further back reveals that bitcoin price could be ranging between $960 to $1000.\n\nBitcoin price made an upside breakout from its symmetrical triangle but failed to sustain the climb, which suggests that consolidation could still stay in play.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe moving averages are oscillating on this time frame, which means that ranging market conditions could persist. In the event that a downward or upward crossover materializes, bitcoin price could gain more traction in a particular direction. For now, the moving averages are holding as dynamic support, which reflects a bit of upside bias.\n\nStochastic is heading south so there may be some selling pressure left, but the oscillator is already closing in on the oversold area. In that case, buying pressure could return soon and push bitcoin price back up to the resistance at $1000. RSI is also on the move down so bitcoin could follow suit, possibly making its way to the next near-term area of interest at $975 or onto the range support at $960.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThere still a general feeling of unease in bitcoin markets spurred mostly by the developments in China, in which top exchanges were forced to introduce trading restrictions to help the government investigate money laundering activity. Aside from that, BTCUSD is under a bit of selling pressure on dollar strength, as traders anticipate a Fed rate hike in March and strong US equity gains on Trump’s tax reform plan.\n\nHowever, there have been several positive developments in the bitcoin industry that are worth noting and might allow it to stay afloat. For one, there’s talk of Iran possibly adopting bitcoin as a reserve currency. Also, bitcoin has been enjoying a lot of interest in Wall Street funds while banking troubles in Europe could shore up demand for alternative currencies once more.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

02/16/2017,"['Based on technical indicators and moving averages, prominent trading and investment platform Investing.com states that it is optimistic for Bitcoin traders to purchase the digital currency for both short and long term profit.\n\nOn Feb. 9, Bitcoin price plunged overnight, decreasing from $1,060 to $964. Bitcoin has already recovered since then, rising back to $1,030 in most major markets.\n\nShock and panic\n\nLast week, the People’s Bank of China halted withdrawals for Bitcoin and Litecoin users of Huobi and OKCoin, two of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in China that control roughly 20 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market with a $50 mln trading volume.\n\nTemporary suspension of Bitcoin withdrawal on Huobi and OKCoin caused a shock in the US Bitcoin exchange market, triggering panic sellers to auction off their funds and Bitcoin on major Bitcoin exchange platforms such as Bitfinex and Kraken.\n\nDespite the resilience of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market and its traders as explained in Cointelegraph’s recent article entitled “Bitcoin Price Roller Coaster: US Panics, China Shows Resilience,” the Chinese market couldn’t withstand the declining value of Bitcoin in the US market, which is substantially larger than the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market.\n\nRecovery\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin began to recover as the Huobi and OKCoin announcements were embraced and as an increasing number of users began to realize that exchanges are simply not secure and efficient platforms to store Bitcoin.\n\nBy law, Bitcoin exchanges are required to build a platform wherein exchange operators are given authority to control user funds. Thus, Bitcoin stored in Bitcoin exchanges can be described more like an IOU, a signed document acknowledging a debt, rather than actual Bitcoin.\n\nLess than a week has passed and Bitcoin is close to its initial all-time high price of $1,060 and is currently hovering at $1,034.\n\nWhat doesn’t kill us makes us stronger\n\nIn consideration of Bitcoin’s resilience to market uncertainty and its ability to recover rapidly in a short period of time, Investing.com suggested that both short and long term trading for Bitcoin are extremely optimistic, categorizing hourly, daily and monthly trading Bitcoin as a “Strong Buy” on its platform.\n\nInvesting.png\n\nTechnical analysis further suggests that Bitcoin price could near $1,050 of the resistance level holds in the short run. Unless major events or announcements that may largely impact the Bitcoin industry and community emerge in the near future, the price trend of Bitcoin looks optimistic, as told by Investing.com amongst other analysts.', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur.

What is behind the positions of governments of developing countries like Uganda and Nigeria?\n\nBefore Uganda, such warnings have come out of some other developing countries like Nigeria.\n\nSo today in Nigeria a lot of individuals now take extra care when making transactions in local banks for Bitcoin-related products or services.\n\nUsers most often clearly advise depositors not to include such in the description of the purpose of a transaction, so as to avoid having their bank accounts blocked or frozen.\n\nQuasi-currencies\n\nA lot of individuals have fallen victim to cryptocurrency scams by investing in what they thought were real and genuine cryptocurrencies.\n\nMany experts and economists consider OneCoin as the current number one scam coin in the world. It does not possess the fundamental characteristics of a genuine cryptocurrency, instead, its followers pursue the cause of OneCoin as a religion.\n\nBut why Bitcoin gets mixed up with that “currency” that is built similarly to other MLM pyramids?\n\nGovernment position\n\nData Architect at Central Bank of Nigeria, Ayodeji Odusote thinks that there are technical differences in the warnings from Nigeria and Uganda. While Nigeria addressed specifically stakeholders in the regulated financial services sector, Ugandan authorities appealed to the wider public.\n\nOdusote notes however that both governments did not make any distinction between genuine and scam cryptocurrencies for a simple reason that ""from a currency perspective, the veracity of a cryptocurrency is irrelevant as it poses a direct threat to the authority of the regulator to control the money supply.""\n\nAccording to Odusote, for both governments, it is irrelevant whether the cryptocurrency is genuine or fake. Both do not serve their financial objectives.\n\nOdusote says:\n\n“The perspective of these regulators, owing to their publications, is strictly monetary. It futile to say something is genuine, yet unacceptable and another is fake, which is also unacceptable. Both are not. So there is no need for distinction.”\n\nBut for regulators who have identified the opportunities offered by the technology embedded in cryptocurrencies, the Blockchain, such distinction might be important.\n\nHypocrisy\n\nCEO of Hyperchain Technologies, Chigozie Ononiwu thinks that linking Bitcoin to Onecoin is wrong in any case. Ononiwu describes Onecoin as a mediocrity compared with Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Ononiwu describes Bitcoin as “innovation”, he suspects policymakers of developing countries in corrupt practices regarding Bitcoin.\n\nOnoniwu thinks some of these leaders may acquire Bitcoins for themselves while introducing measures to keep the people away from doing the same thing:\n\n“They\'re busy stockpiling Bitcoin while scaring everyone off.”\n\nTo avoid problems, Ononiwu suggests that any cryptocurrency offering HYIP should be barred from transactions, and every company dealing in Bitcoin and Blockchain tech should be properly and transparently vetted.\n\nOnoniwu concludes:', ""Mining centralization is probably one of the biggest challenges digital currencies face.\n\n\n\nMany of Bitcoin’s properties, such as censorship resistance and double-spend protection, rely to a large extent on a decentralized mining landscape. But over the years, the Bitcoin mining system has increasingly centralized into fewer hands and fewer geographical regions. There are several explanations for this trend. But one of them is the emergence of specialized mining hardware: ASIC chips and miners.\n\nIn an attempt to solve this issue, scientists at the University of Luxembourg’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) have developed a mathematical algorithm called “Equihash.” Equihash is the brainchild of Prof. Alex Biryukov, head of SnT research group “CryptoLUX” — focused on research and technology transfer in cryptology — and CryptoLUX researcher Dr. Dmitry Khovratovich. The algorithm was first unveiled at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2016 in San Diego.\n\nProbably its most significant success to date, Zcash, the new decentralized and open-source digital currency that aims to set a new standard for privacy and anonymity through the use of groundbreaking cryptography, announced the integration of Equihash in April 2016. In a post titled “Why Equihash?,” Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox and engineer Jack Grigg noted that Equihash has very efficient verification which could enable light clients on constrained devices and Zcash clients inside Ethereum. But the main reason for the enthusiasm of the Zcash tech is, indeed, Equihash’s resistance to ASIC mining.\n\n“Equihash is a memory-oriented Proof-of-Work, which means how much mining you can do is mostly determined by how much RAM you have,” said Wilcox and Grigg. “We think it is unlikely that anyone will be able to build cost-effective custom hardware (ASICs) for mining in the foreseeable future.” Wilcox and Grigg added that it is unlikely that major optimizations of Equihash could give the miners who know the optimization an advantage.\n\nEquihash is a memory-hard problem, more suited to general-purpose computers with lots of memory than to special hardware chips. “If 10,000 miners with a single PC were active, in Zcash the investment to compete with them would be 10,000 times the price of a PC, while with Bitcoin, the investment would be significantly smaller,” said Khovratovich. “The strength of a cryptocurrency comes from the fact that the ledger is globally distributed. Our Equihash algorithm reverses the situation back to this more ideal world.”\n\nAccording to the CryptoLUX scientists, the algorithm permits avoiding centralization of the mining process in the hands of a few first-class miners with specialized mining hardware, thus contributing to the “democratization” of digital currencies based on Equihash.\n\n“Since Equihash is based on a fundamental computer science problem, advances in Equihash mining algorithms will benefit computer science in general,” added Biryukov. “Equihash is so far unique among all the mining algorithms: it is memory-hard on the one hand and very easy to verify on the other.”\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Equihash inventor Biryukov also emphasized that Equihash is a portable algorithm, not limited to specific digital currencies.\n\n“We don't have any formal relation with the Zcash project,” he said. “Equihash is not limited to Zcash, it can be used in any cryptocurrency.” That said, Biryukov did sound cautiously enthusiastic about Zcash. “Compared to many other cryptocurrencies Zcash definitely brings in new features based on state-of-the-art academic crypto. Whether it will scale well or not — the future will show.”\n\nGiven the portability of Equihash, it’s interesting to speculate about its possible integration in Bitcoin itself. “I am not aware of such attempts, but it would be technically easy to do,” noted Biryukov.\n\nFor more details on Equihash, see the research paper “Equihash: asymmetric proof-of-work based on the Generalized Birthday problem.”"", 'Christian Kourtis of Gowling WLG explores how regulation and taxation could damage the popularity of existing digital currencies\n\nIt is safe to say that 2017 will be the biggest yet for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The attention generated by Bitcoin’s sharp increase to above the $1,000 (£800) threshold earlier in the year has led to a renewed focus on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin is interesting, it would be unwise to attach unwarranted significance to it. A currency in its infancy is likely to be volatile. However, when considered in the wider context, its price has consistently increased since 2014-2015 as its volume and market size has grown.\n\nThe draw to cryptocurrencies\n\nIn the face of wavering fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies have seen a surge in popularity – particularly in response to actions taken by governments that threaten the established, “normal” financial system. Taking the raid on Cypriot private bank accounts by the authorities as an example, Cypriots flocked to Bitcoin in response. A similar situation occurred in Spain in anticipation of comparable actions by their national government.\n\nMore recently, India’s decision to demonetise aspects of its currency caused a surge in the reliance on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from across India.\n\nThe role Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have played during these recent examples of disorder in the traditional financial system provides a compelling narrative for their ongoing future role. However, that is not the whole story, and with greater adoption comes the spectre of regulation and taxation, which could impact their desirability.\n\nRegulation and taxation\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies has not gone unnoticed by national governments and regulators with many actively looking at their regulations and taxation structures. While Bitcoin may be the test case, any other currency with hopes of being adopted as part of the mainstream, for example Ripple or Litecoin, should take note.\n\nIt appears that regulation of cryptocurrencies will start with the exchanges, as governments put up barriers to exchanging national currencies to either deter users or to make the cost onerous.\n\nAs an example, earlier in February, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dropped sharply following the announcement from China that two of its major exchanges had suspended Bitcoin and Litecoin withdrawals for one month. The claim made by the exchanges was that the suspension is to enhance security procedures in respect of their anti-money laundering capabilities and other legal risks.\n\nTaxation is another aspect to consider. The Israeli authorities have considered applying capital gains tax to Bitcoin sales; treating them as intangible property rather than foreign currency. The same questions are being asked in each jurisdiction. At present, the UK Exchequer and the New York State Department of Taxation have opted not to make cryptocurrencies subject to sales tax. In contrast, Australia has considered applying such a tax to all digital currency purchases. This will be an important area to monitor as interest grows.\n\nA final thought…\n\nAttempts by national governments to constrict Bitcoin and other mainstream cryptocurrency growth must be approached with caution. Over regulation or taxation of the mainstream cryptocurrencies may see the benefits of these digital currencies stripped away, risking their abandonment by users in favour of newer cryptocurrencies that are truer to the original concept. In this way, cutting the head of this hydra may create more rather than fewer problems.\n\nChristian Kourtis is an associate at the international law firm Gowling WLG.', 'Bitcoin appears to be stabilizing at a new price point.\n\nThe value of tokens on the public blockchain protocol reached a high of $1,039 today, continuing their recent run of stability. At press time, bitcoin has been trading above $1,000 since mid-day on 14th February, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nYet, while promising, the digital currency may need to spend more time above this level before it becomes a new support, analysts told CoinDesk.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of digital asset hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, projected that if the market stays above $1,000 for the next few days, support at this level could be more plausible.\n\nStill, he indicated he expects momentum will build around this point.\n\n""I\'d be astonished if we fell below $1,000 barring any external event,"" he said.\n\nVinny Lingham, former Bitcoin Foundation board member and CEO of identity startup Civic, however, voiced doubts about whether bitcoin could build support above the $1,000 mark.\n\n""It certainly could, but I think it\'s unlikely,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nLingham has previously predicted that the digital currency will consolidate around $1,000 for the next month or two, clarifying today that he believes bitcoin prices will ""for the most part"" fluctuate within $50 of this level.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, also emphasized that this price does not represent a ""huge support level"", but he was optimistic about the general trajectory.\n\n""The more time price spends above $1,000, the stronger that support level becomes,"" he said.\n\n\n\nOne upcoming test, he said, will be if the price declines to retest the $1,000 level, and bounces back above it, providing evidence of support, and potentially, a sign the market could further strengthen.\n\nPrice charts image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Hong Kong, which many consider as the Asian center of financial and technological development, is struggling to see consistent growth in its Fintech and Bitcoin markets.\n\nOther Asian countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore have outcompeted Hong Kong by creating a practical and efficient ecosystem for startups and financial service providers to operate in.\n\nClear policies\n\nChina and South Korea in specific have laid out sound regulations and policies within their Fintech and Bitcoin markets, allowing startups and mature corporations to follow a clear regulatory framework to remain compliant with industry-wide policies and local financial regulations.\n\nSuch clarity in established regulatory frameworks for the Bitcoin industry in South Korea has allowed startups, including leading Bitcoin exchange Korbit, to raise multi-million dollar investment rounds from key players of the South Korean financial and technology industries. To date, Korbit has amassed funding from multi-billion dollar South Korean companies including SK Planet and SoftBank Ventures Korea.\n\nWhile startups in South Korea, China, Japan and Singapore are successfully securing reliable investment partners to form a long-term vision and financial stability, Bitcoin companies in Hong Kong are failing to obtain investment primarily due to the uncertainty in local regulations.\n\nUncertainty\n\nIn an interview with South China Morning Post, Bitcoin entrepreneur James Bang stated:\n\n“The uncertainty is why [Bitcoin companies] could not get investment. Investors don’t like uncertainty.”\n\nLeo Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, further stated that the initiation of Bitcoin operations and trading within Hong Kong shouldn’t be a concern for regulators and that the government should allow the general population to trade and utilize Bitcoin at their own risk, similar to the approach of the central bank of China.\n\nIn the past, the People’s Bank of China consistently emphasized that the government nor the central bank will take any responsibility for risks involved in trading Bitcoin. Upon the issuance of the initial warning, the central bank of China allowed active Bitcoin trading and other activities involving the digital currency within the region.\n\n“I think regulators should be less risk averse, it is not their obligation to shield the Hong Kong economy from people losing money or other negative things,” said Weese.\n\nIn spite of the lack of regulatory framework within the Hong Kong Bitcoin industry, government officials, including information technology legislator Charles Mok, are continuously claiming that it is the limited applicability and practicality of Bitcoin that is preventing the Bitcoin industry in Hong Kong from growing at a similar pace to other countries.\n\nHowever, the logic behind Mok’s claim is evidently flawed as the applicability and practicality are being demonstrated in leading markets such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China, all of which have laid out clear regulatory frameworks for both Bitcoin operators and users.\n\nCointelegraph reported that former Bank of China Governor L H Li believes China should regulate Bitcoin instead of trying to slow down the growth of Bitcoin as it is virtually impossible to stop a decentralized and peer to peer network secured by miners and hash power spread across the world.\n\nA regulated Bitcoin market is important not necessarily for the people but for the government because if Bitcoin moves to underground or over-the-counter markets, it becomes increasingly difficult for the government to oversee its use.', ""Nocks, an exchange and payment processor working closely with Gulden, has dropped Bitcoin support, citing the cryptocurrency’s bad reputation and slow confirmation times.\n\nAccording to a Medium post by Nocks, the processor and its associated cryptocurrency, no longer wish to deal with Bitcoin’s increasingly high fees and slow confirmation times. Additionally, Gulden as a whole, while maintaining a commitment to user privacy, is seeking to move away from anonymity. As such Nocks seeks to tighten security over the kinds of users that use its service through “thorough identity checks, freeze list referencing and much more to ensure a great user-base.”\n\nRijk Plasman, Gulden’s founder, sees the change as an opportunity for a clean slate for the digital currency’s public perception:\n\n“We've been standing on our own since the start. There is no such a thing as Bitcoin popularity with the general public, it's the opposite. Bitcoin has a very negative and hostile reputation, due to money laundering, hackers and black markets. That's something we and our users want to stay far away from. Of course, I am not talking about Bitcoin development, I have huge respect for the people who actually build stuff and try to improve Bitcoin. But unfortunately their community and user base is holding them back. We don't have that problem.”\n\nGulden is seeking to avoid being tied down to Bitcoin’s slow speeds\n\nThe integration with Bitcoin originally allowed Gulden users to seamlessly send and receive payments with users who don’t have any, eventually Bitcoin became too much of a liability. According to Roel Boer, co-founder of Nocks, this was in part because of slow confirmation times.\n\n“About 80 to 90 percent of our Bitcoin transactions required support because the transactions took longer than an hour to either confirm or broadcast to complete a purchase,” says Boer. “So users either requested a refund or we manually processed their payment. In most cases, users pay through a third-party service which causes confirmation times up to 48 hours, something that we just can’t use in our type of business. We’re aiming for a quick settlement and direct results.”\n\nBitcoin’s impressive growth as the standard bearer for cryptocurrency has nonetheless been accompanied by growing pains in the form of a heavy network load and the accompanying symptoms of slower confirmation times and higher fees.\n\nRoger Ver, a longtime advocate of increased block size scaling solutions, points out that Bitcoin’s adoption would be even greater without its currently unsolved scaling issues:\n\nMore people use Bitcoin than ever before, but fewer use it than would have, had the network not become congested. https://t.co/ex475zBMjC — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) February 15, 2017\n\nBoer points out that Bitcoin’s speed has become an issue in particular when compared with more nimble cryptocurrencies such as Gulden. “Though we’ve done Bitcoin transactions for about 16 months and looking back, it wasn’t always like this,” he explains. “At first it was acceptable because we did small transactions that worked perfectly with zero confirmations, accept on broadcast.”\n\n“Now it’s just not feasible economically to keep using Bitcoin this way,” Boer continues. “We were focusing on Gulden anyway since we first launched, so we just decided to cut BTC from the roster. Something we wanted to do along the way anyway, but this felt like a great time to do it.”\n\nAnonymity is still a priority for many cryptocurrency users\n\nVirgil Vaduva, CEO of decentralized ridesharing and emergency response app Cell 411, sees anonymity as a crucial element to safeguard against potential abuse such as government overreach. “We all know that there is a world-wide effort throughout the world by the government is to minimize and eventually eliminate the use of cash and other means of anonymous payments,” he says. “We saw it in India recently and in Europe for years.”\n\n“These efforts are ultimately aimed at tracking all individuals for tax purposes and force users to account for all their income,” Vaduva continues. “It's in essence police-state surveillance tactics for the finance sector. Anonymity and fungibility go hand in hand, and this is why currencies like Monero are fast becoming popular because a segment of the market demands anonymity and privacy. Expecting privacy does not make one a terrorist or an unsavory user. That argument is empty of value and greatly overused. We are not buying it.”\n\nNot every digital currency prioritizing wide adoption and ease of use for the average consumer embraces the notion that anonymity must be sacrificed. Eric Sammons, the consultant for Dash, points out several reasons why maintaining anonymity is an integral element of cryptocurrency.\n\n“Anonymity is vital for a lot of reasons and is an essential characteristic of sound money,” Sammons explains. “A private company might not want to let the world know about a recent acquisition yet, an activist in an oppressive country might not want the authorities to know his financial activities and we all buy personal items we just don't want to broadcast to the world.”\n\n“But at the same time, there are legitimate reasons for some financial transactions to be tracked and monitored; for example, the purchases of a public company or a government,” he argues. “Dash is the best of both worlds, for it offers a transparent Blockchain while allowing individual users the ability to mix their coins such that one cannot trace their origin.”"", 'Emerita Capital, a provider of quantitative analysis for investment assets, believes bitcoin price could hit $3,678 if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the Winklevoss ETF on March 11.\n\nThe company, writing in Seeking Alpha, recommends portfolios hold between 0.2% and 5.0% in bitcoin. It recommends purchasing bitcoin on an OTC spot exchange.\n\nEmerita Capital states at the outset that its views are contrary to many investment and research firms, a factor that has created an attractive return/risk ratio for investors taking positions in the bitcoin OTC market before March.\n\nIt is not the only investment researcher to predict a rush on bitcoin should the SEC approve the Winklevoss ETF. Rob Curran, writing in the The Wall Street Journal, predicted the same thing in a recent article.\n\nEmerita Capital assigns a 35% probability for ETF approval against a 65% probability of rejection, making the final weighted average expected bitcoin price $1645.45, a 67.8% return above the current price.\n\nBitcoin As A Speculative Vehicle\n\nWhile the original intention of bitcoin was to become a digital currency payment network, the most successful use is as a speculative vehicle, the company noted. The cryptocurrency is heavily traded for CNY, USD, EUR and 26 national currencies.\n\nFrom Feb. 24, 2016 to Jan. 22, 2017, the aggregate of bitcoin exchanges had a combined trading volume of 154,713,805.60 BTC, or approximately $141.6 billion at today’s price. Since the end of January, trading volume has declined substantially in China due to new exchange fees after pressure from the Chinese central bank. Nonetheless, the bitcoin price shows robustness and keeps approaching the all-time high of 2013.\n\nEmerita Capital’s main argument for taking positions in bitcoin is based on five pieces of evidence that cover regulation, insider knowledge, market forces, competitive actions and political considerations. The firm believes this evidence has not been described by mainstream investment and research firms.\n\nWhat Winklevoss Actions Indicate\n\nThe firm noted several steps the Winklevosses have publicly taken that indicate progress in conversations with SEC.\n\nOn Feb 19, they created Winkdex, an index to track bitcoin prices that is now divulged by major financial information vendors like Bloomberg and Reuters. This could be a pre-requisite for transparency.\n\nSince Jan. 23, 2015, they have run a spot exchange, Gemini.com. It is possible their intention is to source liquidity for their bitcoin ETF through their own spot exchange. This could be a pre-requisite for orderly trading, capital formation and liquidity access.\n\nThrough Gemini.com, on Sept. 21, 2016, they formed a daily auction process to settle the bitcoin price once a day. This could be a pre-requisite for fair market price fixation.\n\nOn Dec. 8, 2016, they launched a website for investor relationship management and ETF promotion. This could indicate a change of perception in favor of optimism.\n\nOn Feb. 8, 2017, they told the SEC that they secured the services of high-frequency trading firms to provide liquidity and efficiency to the ETF.\n\nAnother positive indicator is that the Trump Administration is anti-regulation, as demonstrated by the Dodd-Frank Act repeal. There are multiple pro-bitcoin enthusiasts involved in the current administration, including Mick Mulvaney, director of the U.S. Office of Budget nominee, Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder, Balaji Srinivasan, 21.co-CEO and potential FDA director nominee, Travis Kalanick, Uber CEO and others.\n\nWhat About Closed End Funds?\n\nThe GBTC bitcoin closed-end fund that floats on the OTCQX exchange has been highly successful as an investment vehicle delivering returns in the triple digits. But the closed-end nature of the fund is presenting friction to market participants. GBTC market prices have reached up to two to three times net asset value.\n\nAn ETF would be a more efficient underlying asset tracker.\n\nEmerita Capital proposes the case for a massive increase in bitcoin accessibility as an investment asset class if an open-end style fund such as the bitcoin ETF begins trading on a major equity exchange.\n\nBuying pressure on the ETF will drive bitcoin demand. The ETF shares will impact the demand of spot bitcoins through their interchangeability.\n\nWhat Public Exchanges Will Bring\n\nBitcoin trading is currently dominated by OTC exchanges operating under no explicit guidelines. A move into public exchanges will:\n\n• Guarantee regulatory oversight for investors\n\n• Increase its visibility as an asset class\n\n• Enhance credibility in the financial scene\n\n• Deliver further consideration of its technical capabilities\n\nSince hedge and endowment funds are sophisticated players inclined to zero beta multi-asset portfolios, they will be the least hesitant to assume positions to attain lower return correlation with equities. Other investors will follow these funds.\n\nPortfolio Recommendation\n\nEmerita Capital recommends between 0.2% and 5.0% of a portfolio to bitcoin, using an OTC spot exchange.\n\nIt recommends avoiding the closed-end fund GBTC since it trades at a substantial premium versus net asset value.\n\nThe firm’s $3,678 estimated target price, should the SEC approve a bitcoin ETF, is based on the calculations of Needham & Co. of $300 million influx in the first week of trading of the fund in addition to Emerita Capital’s assessment of bitcoin’s top eight spot exchanges’ order book depth.\n\nIn case of rejection by the SEC, the estimated bitcoin target price is $551, calculated based on a mean reversion scenario using the weighted average of the last five years of bitcoin prices.\n\nSome have argued the SEC will not want to move forward for a product where most trading is done on Chinese exchanges that do not follow the U.S. AML rules.\n\nEmerita Capital responds that the majority of OTC gold purchase transactions are also happening in China and India. Consumer gold has no AML rules and can be acquired without identification requirements. Such conditions did not present an obstacle for SEC approval of the first gold ETF in 2005.\n\nAlso read: Investors ignore analysts, bet on SEC approving bitcoin ETF\n\nA Black Swan\n\nEmerita Capital believes the probability of bitcoin ETF is higher than what the current market consensus implies. The firm considers the event a potential Black Swan with a profound impact in the investment world.\n\nEmerita Capital is not the only investment firm bullish on a bitcoin ETF.\n\nWilly Woo, a bitcoin and investment blogger who is often quoted in cryptocurrency articles, tweeted his estimate of the bitcoin price if an ETF is approved. He noted markets speculate $500 million to $1 billion will be injected if approval probability is 25 percent. Assuming a fundamental $900 bitcoin price, he estimated the price at $3,231 if $2 billion is invested in the ETF, driving bitcoin’s market capitalization from $14.6 billion to $52.4 billion.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
02/17/2017,"['Within a week since the initial plunge in value resulting from the halting of withdrawals by leading Bitcoin exchanges OKCoin and Huobi, Bitcoin price already recovered beyond its previous all-time high value of $1,060, nearing $1,080 in major markets.\n\nCointelegraph’s recent coverage on the trend in the global Bitcoin exchange market revealed that the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market surpassed the size of the US and Chinese markets, officially becoming the largest Bitcoin exchange market in the world with a staggering 50 percent market share.\n\nThe factors behind Bitcoin price ups and downs\n\nThe Japanese market has been the key factor behind the recovery of Bitcoin price over the past week, as it is evident that traders and investors within the Chinese market shifted over to the Japanese market that has a reliable, secure and regulatory compliant Bitcoin exchange in bitFlyer and a governing entity that has introduced sound policies and regulations for both Bitcoin ventures and users.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin price massively declined in the Chinese market from around $1,060 to $1,032 while Bitcoin exchanges in the Japanese market have seen the facilitation of Bitcoin trades at the $1,080 mark, with a premium in the range of $20 to $50 in comparison to major markets like the US, China and Europe.\n\nOn Feb. 9, Bitcoin price dipped below $960 due to the People’s Bank of China’s heavy involvement with the local Bitcoin market. The central bank of China demanded OKCoin and Huobi, two of the country’s largest exchanges, to overhaul their Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer systems.\n\nOn top of that, the central bank requested the two exchanges to halt withdrawals for one month until the upgrade is complete.\n\nAbrupt announcements from OKCoin and Huobi caused a shock in the US Bitcoin exchange market and Bitcoin price continued to plummet. The global average price of Bitcoin was stabilized relatively quickly however as the Japanese, South Korean and Chinese markets showed resilience to the announcements.\n\nEver since the initial plunge of Bitcoin value on Feb. 9, Bitcoin price has stayed over $1,000 and maintained stability for seven straight days. It has continued to increase in value, specifically in the Japanese and US markets, recording two to four percent daily increases in price over the past few days.', 'With its amazing ability to negate borders, add ""real"" diversification to an investor’s portfolio, while performing the function of a medium of exchange and a store of value, bitcoin is emerging as a new asset class. The currency is being increasingly seen as a lucrative investment option around the world.\n\nSome of the trusted investment options for investors are Bitcoin IRA (approved by the IRS), which allows for bitcoins to be added to a retirement portfolio, Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which is traded OTC (filed with SEC for a NYSE listing), and ARK Investment Management’s ETF (ARKW), which has a small allocation to bitcoin.\n\nFighting Price Volatility\n\nOne major concern is the price volatility of bitcoin.\n\nInvestors can cope with this by implementing a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) based on the investment technique of Dollar-Cost Averaging.\n\nHere’s how it works –\n\nInstead of buying bitcoins via an investment product or on an exchange with a lump sum amount, investors can buy the currency for a smaller fixed amount on a regular basis regardless of the price at that time. Buying bitcoins with a pre-decided amount on a regular basis means that the investor gets more of the cryptocurrency\u200b when the price is lower and vice versa. This approach helps to smoothen the ups and down in the price stream, thereby reducing the risk posed by unpredictable movement in price. Some of the advantages of such investing are:\n\nIt inculcates discipline\n\nIt eases concerns regarding the right timing of buying an asset\n\nOffers convenience and less commitment in terms of the amount of money\n\nIt tends to bring down the average cost of buying based on the principle of dollar-cost averaging which can boost the opportunity to profit over time\n\nConsider the example of an investor buying bitcoin in 2012 on the first day of every month. By the end of the year, his average buy price for bitcoin would have been $7.75, higher than the lowest price at $4.22 during the year, but much lower than the highest price of $13.7. During 2013, his average buy price would have been just $166.52 against the highest price of $1147.25. This technique works particularly well in times of high volatility, the year 2013 being the perfect example. Similarly, for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016, the average monthly price works much better vis-à-vis the price trend of the cryptocurrency. The average holding price over this five-year period works out to be $307.40.\n\nLowest Highest Average Price 2012 $4.22 $13.70 $7.75 2013 $13.28 $1147.25 $166.52 2014 $309.87 $951.39 $545.11 2015 $177.28 $465.50 $265.95 2016 $358.77 $978.01 $551.69\n\nUnocoin, an Indian exchange, was the first exchange to introduce a Bitcoin Systematic Investment Plan.\n\nIn the U.S., investors looking to invest in Bitcoins for a longer term without having to go through the hassle of its safe-keeping can consider buying a Roth IRA offered by Bitcoin IRA called SIPBIT. With a maximum contribution limit of $5,500, investors can allocate $230 fortnightly or $460 on a monthly basis (figures rounded up) to their Bitcoin Roth IRA account. A bitcoin denominated Roth IRA offers a tax-efficient and convenient way to invest in bitcoin with a long-term perspective.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvesting a smaller amount of money toward bitcoin in the modern day is a smarter way to invest and hold the cryptocurrency. It is a great way to ride the swings in price while adding a newer asset class to a portfolio. Investing at regular intervals doesn\'t just brings discipline in investment, it also offers convenience, flexibility and better returns over the long-term by bringing down the average cost of buying, all at a lower risk.', 'Ethereum appears to be making a comeback with its price considerably rising during the past week from around $10 to over $13, settling at around $12.80.\n\nThe second biggest digital currency returns to a market cap of above $1 billion following news that JP Morgan, Microsoft, BP and other household brands are working on launching Enterprise Ethereum, a modified fork of ethereum to be used for private blockchains.\n\nThere were suggestions the household brands will also contribute to the public ethereum blockchain, but no further details were provided.\n\nOn other ethereum related news, Melonport, a “blockchain protocol for digital asset management on the Ethereum platform” – according to the greenpaper, sold out its almost $2 million ICO in about 13 minutes with 99% of the token gone in 3 minutes.\n\nThis is probably the fastest sell out of any ICO, indicating a huge demand to fund innovative start-ups in the ethereum space specifically and the wider blockchain space more generally.\n\nA Boom in ICOs\n\nRather than holding ETH, etherumers appear to prefer parking their currency on eth based tokens which may earn returns through price appreciation and through profit-sharing schemes depending on the ICO’s terms.\n\nThe legality of these arrangements is not very clear. It is probable that any sale under $5 million is fine, but scams should be expected.\n\nI’ve long suggested the setting up of a non-governing body to ensure some sort of quality and accountability, but its implementation probably suffers from the commons problem – it’s in no one individual’s interest to take up the initiative, but it is in everyone’s interest for it to be established.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently very busy, but now that UK is mired in Brexit, USA may take the torch and lead the world in providing some sort of regulation for quality assurance while not hampering innovation.\n\nSpecifically, they could fund the non-governing body and initiate its establishment while inviting many leaders in this space to sit on its board or provide input.\n\nMight Eth Overtake Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin has seen an incredible rise in 2016, but the digital currency has now stagnated as far as the protocol and underlying innovation is concerned. After almost two years of debate on how to increase transaction capacity, no solution appears likely. Bitcoin may therefore continue to operate for much of this year at over capacity – a first in its eight-year’s history.\n\nBitcoin based transaction fees are seemingly increasing exponentially. The user experience has considerably degraded to slow, unpredictable and frustrating. Businesses have long called for a solution, but no one appears to be listening.\n\nThe currency, nonetheless, leads in brand recognition and is reaping the rewards of a billion or more invested in its infrastructure in 2013. Since then, such investments have fallen considerably, potentially stocking up problems in the near future.\n\nIts main use now appears to be that of acting as a hedge, but that seems to be solely based on its brand recognition and an easily copied limited number of coins which can no longer move conveniently or cheaply.\n\nThe currency, therefore, seems ripe for disruption. With the second largest market cap, a well-funded and capable development team, corporate interest, additional functionality in smart contracts, 17 seconds average times for transaction confirmations and plans for unlimited scalability, Ethereum might be best placed for such disruption if it happens.\n\nWhether it will, remains to be seen. It may well be the case that the two currencies have their own niche with bitcoin being like tor – slow, clunky, inconvenient, prioritizing edge cases above all else – while Ethereum might turn out to be bitcoin’s version of Firefox – fast, cheap, convenient, privacy conscious, prioritizing ordinary users while being inclusive of edge cases.\n\nAlthough there are many races in the blockchain space and even races within races, currently, the one between Bitcoin and Ethereum is the most interesting. How this will play, all will be watching as a general realization and awareness now rises that blockchain technology will soon transform the world.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'U.S. corporations that have long resisted bending to the demands of computer hackers who take their networks hostage are increasingly stockpiling bitcoin, the digital currency, so that they can quickly meet ransom demands rather than lose valuable corporate data.\n\nThe companies are responding to cybersecurity experts who recently have changed their advice on how to deal with the growing problem of extortionists taking control of the computers.\n\n“It’s a moral dilemma. If you pay, you are helping the bad guys,” said Paula Long, chief executive of DataGravity, a Nashua, New Hampshire, company that helps clients secure corporate data. But, she added, “You can’t go to the moral high ground and put your company at risk.”\n\n“A lot of companies are doing that as part of their incident response planning,” said Chris Pogue, chief information security officer at Nuix, a company that provides information management technologies. “They are setting up bitcoin wallets.”\n\nPogue said he believed thousands of U.S. companies had prepared strategies for dealing with hacker extortion demands, and numerous law firms have stepped in to facilitate negotiations with hackers, many of whom operate from the other side of the globe.\n\n[How to set up a bitcoin wallet.]\n\nSymantec, a Mountain View, California, company that makes security and storage software, estimates that ransom demands to companies average between $10,000 and $75,000 for hackers to provide keys to decrypt frozen networks. Individuals whose computers get hit pay as little as $100 to $300 to unlock their encrypted files.\n\nCompanies that analyze cyber threats say the use of ransomware has exploded, and payments have soared. Recorded Future, a Somerville, Massachusetts, threat intelligence firm, says ransom payments skyrocketed 4,000 percent last year, reaching $1 billion. Another firm, Kaspersky Lab, estimates that a new business is attacked with ransomware every 40 seconds.\n\nIf you’re hit by ransomware today, you have only two options: You either pay the criminals, or you lose your data. Raj Samani, Intel Security\n\n“If you’re hit by ransomware today, you have only two options: You either pay the criminals or you lose your data,” said Raj Samani, chief technical officer at Intel Security for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “We underestimated the scale of the issue.”\n\nHackers often send out email with tainted hyperlinks to broad targets, say, an entire company. All it takes is one computer user in a company to click on the infected link to allow hackers to get a foothold in the broader network, leading to hostile encryption.\n\n“At least one employee will click on anything,” said Robert Gibbons, chief technology officer at Datto, a Connecticut company that offers digital disaster recovery services.\n\nLaw enforcement counsels U.S. businesses not to succumb to ransom demands, urging them to keep backup copies of their data in case of hostile encryption.\n\n“The official FBI policy is that you shouldn’t pay the ransom,” said Leo Taddeo, chief security officer for Cryptzone, a Waltham, Massachusetts, company that provides network security. Until 2015, Taddeo ran the cyber division of the FBI’s New York City office.\n\nBut practical considerations increasingly are dictating a different approach. “It’s an option to pay the ransom to get back up and running. Sometimes it’s the only option,” Taddeo said.\n\nPaying ransom just invites the next attack. Leo Taddeo, former FBI cyber expert\n\n“But it has downsides,” he added. “Paying ransom just invites the next attack.”\n\nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE\n\nMoreover, 1 in 4 companies that pay ransoms never get their files restored, Gibbons said.\n\n[RELATED: Hacker group finds no buyers for NSA hacking tools]\n\nThe idea of rewarding extortionists with payment makes some technologists see red.\n\n“That makes me super mad,” said Lior Div, chief executive of Cybereason, a Boston-area cybersecurity company. “There are things that are unacceptable, and we need to fight them.”\n\nDiv and his company have done something about the extortion epidemic. They built a product called RansomFree that claims to detect 99 percent of all ransomware strains.\n\nSo far, the free software has been downloaded 125,000 times, the company says.\n\nAs extortionists get more sophisticated, researchers say, they are modifying their malicious code, their infection strategies and the way they collect payments.\n\nOnce they weasel their way into your network, they now take a look around.\n\nThey’ll actually explore your system to see how much money they can squeeze from you. Andrei Barysevich, researcher at Recorded Future\n\n“They’ll actually explore your system to see how much money they can squeeze from you,” said Andrei Barysevich, director of advanced collection at Recorded Future.\n\nAnd they won’t offer any sympathy, no matter how valuable the encrypted data, even if lives are at stake, say, in a health care network. They may even say they are doing nothing evil.\n\n“They actually think they are on the moral high ground. They think the companies should have paid more for security,” said Barysevich, who spoke at a presentation this week at the annual RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco, which bills itself as the world’s leading gathering of cybersecurity specialists.\n\nOne of the reasons midsize and large companies are storing bitcoin for emergency use is that extortionists, once they succeed at penetrating a system, commonly give a deadline for payment before destroying data. But victims can’t rush out and buy bitcoin in a day or two.\n\n“It takes at times a week for (brokers) to process you,” Barysevich said.\n\nSetting up the wallet ahead of time, Pogue said, allows businesses an option that is quick, although perhaps repugnant.\n\n“If they need to go to it, they are not spinning their wheels standing up a bitcoin wallet,” Pogue said.', 'The CEO of Russia\'s largest bank is increasingly bullish about enterprise blockchain.\n\nIn new statements today, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref said that the use of distributed ledger technology by banks and other incumbents could be just two to two-and-a-half years away.\n\nAccording to a report by Russia-based business news platform Prime, Sberbank is developing its own applications of the technology within a special working group headed by members of the domestic government.\n\nGref went on to describe this as a huge step forward for the technology, adding:\n\n""Maybe they are a bit optimistic, but two to two-and-a-half years is the horizon within which we can speak about the application of blockchain commercial operation.""\n\nThe statements follow notable action from Sberbank, which joined a Russia-based fintech consortium in August guided by the direction of the nation\'s central bank.\n\nHowever, Gref\'s personal sentiment about the technology is nothing new.\n\nAs far back as December 2013, Gref has spoken out about bitcoin and public blockchains, going so far as to suggest that the technology not only had potential, but that it shouldn\'t be prohibited by regulators.\n\nTo learn more about the bank\'s work, read our latest interview with Sberbank here.\n\nHerman Gref image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Before I do that, I decided to look into two questions regarding bitcoin\'s role in a portfolio:\n\nWhat is bitcoin\'s correlation with other financial assets? Can exposure to bitcoin be replicated using a combination of existing financial assets?\n\nMy reasoning was that, if possible, it would be preferable to replicate exposure to bitcoin using existing financial assets because there are still substantial risks to owning bitcoin. First, a plot of bitcoin\'s price in both a linear and log scale to place the following analysis in context.\n\nCan Bitcoin Be Considered a Financial Asset?\n\nBefore calculating bitcoin\'s correlation to other financial assets, it\'s useful to take a step back and think of whether bitcoin can be considered a financial asset based on its fundamental characteristics. And if bitcoin is a financial asset, how should it be classified?\n\nA useful framework for thinking about this is in Robert J. Greer\'s paper, ""What is an Asset Class, Anyway?"" In this paper, Greer defines an asset class as ""a set of assets that bear some fundamental economic similarities to each other, and that have characteristics that make them distinct from other assets that are not part of that class.""\n\nHe proposes that any asset can be classified into one of three super classes:\n\nCapital assets. Capital assets are any assets that can generate future cash flows, such as equities which generate cash flows in the form of dividends and bonds which generate cash flows in the form of coupon and principal payments. The defining characteristic is that capital assets can be reasonably valued by discounting future cash flows to the present and, therefore, are sensitive to changes in the discount rate. Consumable transformable assets. These assets can be consumed or transformed into another asset but do not have the ability to generate future cash flows by themselves. In other words, physical commodities. Consumable transformable assets are distinct from capital assets in that they cannot be valued by discounting future cash flows to the present. Instead, an analysis of the asset\'s supply and demand characteristics is more appropriate. Store of value assets. It doesn\'t generate income, and you can\'t consume it, and yet it has economic value. These are assets that are worth something precisely because other humans have also agreed that it\'s worth something. Currencies and collectibles are examples of store of value assets.\n\nIn the real world, not every asset falls neatly into one of the three categories. Gold, for example, is both a consumable asset and a store of value asset. It\'s arguable that U.S. sovereign bonds are both a capital asset and a store of value asset. But it\'s still a useful framework to keep in mind when thinking about portfolio construction.\n\nWhere does bitcoin fall in this framework? Bitcoin can be safely categorized as a store of value asset in that it doesn\'t generate income, you can\'t consume it, and yet it has economic value. Store of value assets are often referred to by other names, including ""safe haven assets"" and ""flight to safety assets"". Thus, we should expect a priori that bitcoin should have a higher correlation to other store of value assets, including gold, other precious metals, and safe haven currencies like the Swiss franc, U.S. dollar, and Japanese yen.\n\nTesting Bitcoin\'s Correlation Using the Brute Force Approach\n\nIn the past few years, ETF offerings have become sufficiently broad to represent virtually all asset classes across all major countries and geographies. ETF historical prices, therefore, represent a fairly high-quality source of asset returns. I wrote about how to obtain this data in a previous post: How to Scrape Data for Over 1,900 ETFs.\n\nI first tested bitcoin\'s correlation to other financial assets using what I call the brute force approach: I calculate the correlation between bitcoin\'s weekly return and the weekly return of all ETFs with over $10 million in assets and plot the results in the following histogram.\n\nThe interpretation is that the correlation between bitcoin and other financial assets is extremely low. Most asset classes have a correlation between -0.1 and +0.1. The few ETFs with correlations outside of this range were mainly explained by the fact that some ETFs were launched recently and thus the correlation between bitcoin and these ETFs was largely spurious in nature.\n\nThis result was a bit disappointing since I was originally hoping to replicate bitcoin\'s exposure using a collection of highly correlated ETFs. On the other hand, this is a strong argument for including bitcoin as a significant part of a portfolio of risky assets. Finding and adding an uncorrelated asset to a portfolio can act as a powerful source of diversification by increasing the portfolio\'s sharpe ratio. There are extremely few assets that are this uncorrelated with other assets and that makes bitcoin extremely desirable from a portfolio construction perspective.\n\nTesting Bitcoin\'s Correlation Using the Refined Approach\n\nI decided to look into bitcoin\'s correlation further using a refined approach by calculating the one-year rolling correlation between bitcoin\'s weekly returns and the weekly returns of selected ETFs. There is evidence that bitcoin has become a more mature asset class over time in that its volatility has reduced and it has started to react more to macroeconomic factors and geopolitical events rather than things that are specific to bitcoin itself.\n\nBelow I plot of the one-year rolling correlation between bitcoin\'s weekly returns and the weekly returns of a selection of risky assets followed by a plot of a selection of safe assets.\n\nThe interpretation is that even looking at a one-year rolling window, the correlation remains low with many correlations oscillating between positive and negative. Current correlation is still low even though bitcoin has had time to mature into a legitimate asset class.\n\nRemember, I had expected a priori that bitcoin would have a higher correlation to these safe, store of value assets. Originally, I had hoped to replicate bitcoin exposure using a combination of gold, US sovereign bonds, and foreign currencies. These results strongly suggest that this is not possible and that bitcoin is a unique, uncorrelated asset class that is not strongly affected by the macroeconomic factors that drive most asset classes.\n\nDoing this analysis has given me conviction that bitcoin should be a part of my passively held, long-only portfolio. First, there aren\'t that many store of value assets in the first place. There\'s gold, US sovereign debt, safe haven currencies, and that\'s it. Second, it\'s surprising that bitcoin\'s correlation is this low, even among other store of value assets.\n\nAt the same time, there are strong theoretical arguments that bitcoin will serve as a hedge against harmful geopolitical events due to its decentralized nature. There\'s a growing body of empirical evidence of this also with bitcoin price spiking in response to both Brexit and Donald Trump\'s win.\n\nBitcoin is uniquely positioned to hedge against geopolitical risks but remain unaffected by the macroeconomic factors that drive other store of value assets.\n\nExposure to bitcoin can be obtained either by buying bitcoin directly, through the upcoming bitcoin ETF (Pending:COIN), or the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX:GBTC).\n\nThe code for this post can be found on my Github.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

At the time of report, ether was trading at $12.71.\n\nPrivacy coins taper off\n\nMonero, a privacy-oriented digital currency that leverages ring signatures to conceal user identities, also provided strong evidence that the rally enjoyed by altcoins earlier this week is now over.\n\nThe privacy oriented digital currency rose roughly 12% from $12.20 on 14th February to $13.74 on 15th February, its highest price in more than a month, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.\n\nHowever, monero lost much of its recent gains when it dropped to $13.26 later in the 15th February session, and failed to mount any notable recoveries since that time.\n\nInstead, the digital currency has moved largely within a reasonably tight range between $13.30 and $13.60.\n\nElsewhere, dash, a digital currency that offers users privacy and instant transactions, rose 8.6% to $19.66 on 15th February, but fell back to $18.75 later that session, CoinMarketCap figures show.\n\nBitcoin back in focus?\n\nAs for what caused the altcoin rally to end, one simple explanation is that cryptocurrency traders have once again become interested in bitcoin.\n\nFar and away the market\'s largest asset, bitcoin has seen its price climb more than 5% since falling to $1,001 early in the 15th February session, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data shows.\n\nAt the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,056.92, 2.2% higher for the data, BPI figures reveal.\n\nThis recent uptick in price has coincided with a notable increase in volume, as market participants traded 16,000 bitcoins worth of transactions through Bitfinex in the 24 hours through 21:30 UTC.\n\nThis compares to an average of 9,700 bitcoins per session over the last seven days, Bitcoinity data shows.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of the digital asset hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, explained in this way:\n\n""Since bitcoin jumped up again, the alts have cooled off.""\n\nMelting snowman image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Unfortunately, the Bitcoin ecosystem is not exempted from this. Many Ponzi schemes have been built around Bitcoin and unsuspecting investors have lost their wealth in different circumstances.\n\nA developing ill within the crypto environment is the selling of substandard education to an unsuspecting public. This has come in the form of seminars, tutorial sessions and incoherent study materials. The promoters of these programs ride on the emotions of previous investors who have lost money, with claims of teaching them what they should have known before investing. For the newbies, it is their fear of being hurt that is usually exploited.\n\nThe struggle for authority\n\nNawaf Abdullah of eBitcoinics.com thinks that the major motivation behind this developing trend is the quest for relevance within the ecosystem, as the battle for control and authority within the Bitcoin environment continues.\n\nAbdullah tells Cointelegraph that even among crypto enthusiasts there are different categories of people who pursue their individual goals using the disruptive technology. There are those who are primarily concerned about the future of the technology and its numerous use cases, then the network marketers whose priority is to sell a given product or service. There is also the group that will do just about anything to flinch whatever they can from the unsuspecting public.\n\nIt is the final group who are the ones most likely to engage in HYIPS and various get-rich-quick programs.\n\nWhat can the community do?\n\nHowever, Abdullah notes that these activities, in whatever form they appear, have a direct effect on the entire ecosystem, and therefore calls on every genuine industry leader to play a significant part in creating a proper brand for the technology.\n\nAbdullah says:\n\n“It is up to every leader involved within the crypto world to know that any step taken tends to affect all of us, whether positive or negative. We have seen governments and institutions trying to control this technology, but thanks to decentralization, such has not been possible. Therefore, we have the responsibility to uphold the genuineness of what we have.”\n\nAbdullah explains that at eBitcoinics.com their priority remains passing on the proper education to everyone within the community, getting them well equipped for the world out there where all sorts of information will definitely be thrown at them.\n\nThe post-truth attitude\n\nAnother danger posed by this trend of having the wrong education propagated is the fact that if not curbed at its early stage, there may come a time when the truth may sound like a lie and vice versa. Therefore, the people need to be taught how to identify what is real and what is not in this fast-moving era of innovations.\n\n“Today we have lots of educational forums, groups on social networks and different bodies creating serious awareness and all these could be places the lots can make use of,” says Abdullah. “In Africa, we have seen what CDIN is doing wholeheartedly to make the world of cryptocurrencies a better place and that’s what encourages us at eBitcoinics.com to fully pledge our support to such good movements, to help make cryptocurrencies a better topic to be discussed in Africa.”\n\nIt all goes down to personal responsibility\n\nAbdullah continues by advising every newbie in the industry to take advantage of the endless availability of information on the Internet. According to him, personal research is the responsibility of anyone who hopes to make the most of the disruptive technology.\n\n“It is by inquisitive research that anyone can discover genuinely available resources for proper education,” says Abdullah. He concludes by telling Cointelegrah that at eBitcoinics.com their mission is to reach every household in Ghana, Nigeria and Africa as a whole with the proper information about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\nTo achieve this, platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook and their own website have been employed in addition to regular meetups at physical locations.\n\nAlso, mechanisms are in place to launch their strictly educational portal, where anyone who wants to learn about money and its role in the world economy and why cryptocurrency is the immediate future can find every necessary resource.', 'Roger Ver’s fight against Chinese bitcoin exchange OKCoin is intensifying as the noted bitcoin investor attempts to have the business liquidated in a Hong Kong court.\n\nThe move comes after months of legal wranglings that have already seen the exchange lose one court case. OKCoin\'s alleged lack of response to the judgement has now prompted Ver to take further action that could ultimately see the company closed.\n\nVer first sued OKCoin in September, seeking $570,000 plus unspecified damages in a breach-of-contract suit tied to a dispute over the Bitcoin.com domain.\n\nThat conflict deepened amid accusations of forgery, as well as impropriety on the part of OKCoin – allegations that exchange representatives swiftly denied.\n\nIn the end, Ver went to court, suing OKCoin\'s Hong Kong entity. At the same time, Ver and attorney Daniel Kelman prepared a suit against the exchange, as well as its chief executive, Star Xu, over the alleged forgery of Ver’s signature. That suit is pending trial.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by CoinDesk, OKCoin never responded in court to the breach-of-contract suit. On 17th November, the court handed down a final and interlocutory judgment awarding the $570,000 to Ver.\n\nYet, according to Ver and Kelman, OKCoin has yet to respond to both the court\'s decision, as well as further entreaties.\n\nAs such, the two say they intend to go ahead with a request for the Hong Kong court to liquidate OKCoin\'s local entity in a bid to obtain the funds. According to Kelman, a liquidation petition is currently being drawn up.\n\nHe went on to explain:\n\n""OKCoin just stopped responding. It became a one-sided discussion, which basically means sue us. Sue us and stop talking, so they didn’t really give us much of a choice.”\n\nDocuments provided to CoinDesk indicate that, after the November judgment, OKCoin’s legal representation in Hong Kong responded by letter on 23rd December, asking that they set aside the original court decision. According to Kelman, they sent a response in turn, requesting an offer – which they never received.\n\nA statutory demand letter was later served to OKCoin’s Hong Kong office on 24th January, reiterating the $570,000 judgment handed down by the court along with $13,867 in accrued interest.\n\nAccording to Ver, the exchange never responded to that letter, which was also sent to its legal representatives in Hong Kong.\n\nThe delivery of that letter triggered a 21-day notice period, which ended this week on 13th February.\n\nWhen reached for comment, OKCoin said in a statement:\n\n""This case is still under legal proceedings. There is no result in the matter to discuss.""\n\nNext steps\n\nThe development marks the latest chapter in a dispute that, after exploding across social media last year, has largely faded from public view.\n\nDisclosed emails at the time portrayed an increasingly contentious back-and-forth between Ver and OKCoin representatives – a situation that worsened following the allegation of contract signature forgery, which Ver has since stressed is fact.\n\nFormer OKCoin exec Changpeng Zhao later backed up Ver, going on to allege that the exchange inflated its trade volumes with bots and had manipulated the outcome of an audit conducted in August 2014.\n\nAt the time, Xu provided several refutations of Zhao\'s claims.\n\nAmidst that environment, Ver pledged that he would take his case to court, formally filing suit in September. Things went quiet, while Ver turned Bitcoin.com into a bitcoin-focused content platform and mining pool and OKCoin continued with its exchange business.\n\nHowever, the latest developments could lever the situation into the public eye once again, depending on the court’s decision.\n\nIf the request is successful, the court in Hong Kong will push the exchange into liquidation – and from there, the situation could become potentially messy.\n\n“[Then] their company in Hong Kong, that all their customers have an agreement [with], that all the customers trust with their money – regardless of who holds that money – the court is going to put them into liquidation and order all that money back and make everyone a creditor unless OKCoin actually shows up in court to settle this thing,” Kelman told CoinDesk.\n\nAs for what will happen after that, the path is less certain.\n\nOKCoin owns business entities in China and Singapore, which could be impacted by the outcome in Hong Kong should the judge approve the liquidation. OKCoin may request that the suit be moved to China, where it keeps its headquarters.\n\nThe timing of these latest developments arguably couldn\'t be worse for the firm. OKCoin has recently come under pressure – along with the rest of China’s cryptocurrency exchange sector – from regulators in the country, including the People’s Bank of China.\n\nSince then, OKCoin has ceased margin trading, added exchange fees and halted withdrawals pending upgrades to its internal systems.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin wallet platform and exchange, will be used by local police to sell Bitcoin.\n\nNikki Larson, finance director of the Vernon Hills Finance Department, received approval from village trustees in late January. Upon the approval of trustees, Larson immediately began the process of selling Bitcoin by establishing an official agreement with the FBI.\n\n""They\'re used to facilitate transactions online, but because the village doesn\'t have a use for Bitcoins we\'re recommending that the village share be accepted and then subsequently converted into US currency,” said Larson.\n\nWhy Coinbase?\n\nCoinbase was selected by Larson as the trading platform to sell Bitcoin on behalf of Vernon Hills. Larson described Coinbase as a “police friendly” trading platform and revealed that the police department’s asset forfeiture account will be linked to the village’s Coinbase account.\n\nBitcoin sold on Coinbase for US dollars will be transferred to the asset forfeiture account.\n\nAlthough Larson and the Vernon Hills Finance Department could continue using the police asset forfeiture account to process the conversion of Bitcoin in the future, Larson intends to create a specific bank account to link to Coinbase.\n\nConsidering that many darknet activities and theft using Bitcoin were discovered by local police, Kim Christenson, a spokesman for the Vernon Hills police department, said in a statement that the police expects to see an increase in illicit activities involving Bitcoin in the future.\n\nChristenson stated:\n\n""The Vernon Hills police department is currently working two active investigations in which Bitcoins were used by criminal organizations. Criminal activities involving Bitcoins are primarily focused on \'darknet markets\' and theft, though officials in countries such as the United States also recognize that Bitcoins can provide legitimate financial services.”\n\nBitcoin industry’s good guys\n\nOver the past few months, Coinbase has been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service despite operating as one of the very few exchanges that are compliant with US regulations. Coinbase is notably the only Bitcoin exchange in the world to obtain New York’s BitLicense, which is known as an inefficient and impractical regulatory framework to the Bitcoin industry.\n\nBrian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, revealed in a statement that the company will not hesitate in spending over a million US dollars in protecting user privacy by declining the request of the IRS to submit user accounts and sensitive information of Coinbase traders.\n\nArmstrong wrote:\n\n“We will likely incur a legal cost of between $100,000 and $1,000,000 in the process of defending our customers from this overly broad subpoena; funds which could be put to better use building innovative products or hiring more employees. This heavy-handed approach by the IRS punishes one of the good guys.”\n\nLike Armstrong noted, Vernon Hills amongst other police agencies have acknowledged Coinbase as “one of the good guys.” Larson went as far as describing Coinbase as a “police friendly” Bitcoin exchange, emphasizing the work of Coinbase in being fully regulated and compliant with policies.']"
02/18/2017,"[""Bitcoin Unlimited blocks mined have reached a new high, passing SegWit and indicating that a hard fork may be just around the corner.\n\nOf the last 144 blocks over the last 24 hours, blocks mined by the Bitcoin Unlimited client have reached 28.5 percent of the network total. This is the second time Unlimited has passed SegWit adoption this month and the first time Bitcoin Core blocks mined have dropped below 75 percent of the network total.\n\nBitcoin’s network load and resulting scaling issues have been the source of debate and controversy in the community. In particular, the impetus to hard fork Bitcoin to raise the block size limit beyond one megabyte has been a central issue to this debate.\n\nA new high in Bitcoin Unlimited’s adoption, which would allow miners to mine blocks larger than one megabyte, may indicate that the block size limit may be raised soon with the goal of alleviating Bitcoin’s network congestion problems.\n\nBitcoin’s scaling problems have taken their toll\n\nThe Bitcoin network’s activity has increasingly pushed the limits of its capacity recently. Over the last year, average block size, median confirmation time and mempool transaction count have all risen significantly. BitcoinFees.info has charted transaction fees over the last six months, which have seen a steady increase, especially this year.\n\nNow, the average fee to have a transaction included in the next six blocks or roughly one hour is $0.37, higher than many card processors’ fees.\n\nFor reference, the popular point-of-sale system Square charges 2.75 percent on swiped transactions, or roughly 28 cents on a ten-dollar transaction- a couple of pints of beer, for example. That same transaction with Bitcoin would cost 37 cents and take over an hour to confirm.\n\nUser emsiak recently posted on Reddit in /r/Bitcoin about his troubles attempting to move a total of 0.05BTC that had accumulated from micropayments from web advertising revenue, but was unable to as the suggested fee was larger than the transaction amount.\n\nUser coinspace encouraged Bitcoin users to concentrate all micropayments, noting that “[d]ue to fees, any output worth about $0.1/0.1mBTC or less is worthless.”\n\nMore companies and users switching to other coins\n\nAs a consequence of Bitcoin’s scaling issues, more and more companies are exploring alternatives for payment methods of both reduced cost and faster transaction times.\n\nErik Voorhees of streamlined cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift.io has publicly mused about the challenges presented by Bitcoin’s fees, stating that “the higher it gets, the less useful the system becomes.”\n\nHe has also admitted to holding Ethereum to use for payments because of Bitcoin’s issues:\n\nI'm finding myself holding some extra ETH to use as payments, since Bitcoin is becoming too expensive/delayed :( — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) February 10, 2017\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Nocks, primarily used as an accompaniment facilitating the use of Dutch-based coin Gulden, recently dropped Bitcoin support altogether.\n\nThis was partially because of issues surrounding Bitcoin’s purported reputation as a darknet market currency but also because of its untenable transaction fees and times, which stand in stark contrast to Gulden, which has attempted to make a name for itself as an everyday payment method."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The revolution that spread to other Arab countries, is rooted in an absence of economic freedom. Paradoxically, the regime that came to power as a result of the revolution for freedom, now suppresses Bitcoin.\n\nTunisian Bitcoin entrepreneur and enthusiast, Mohamed Jaziri, shared his view on the situation with Cointelegraph:\n\n""Tunisia is a country that applies capital controls. We have an inflationary currency that is constantly trending down.Tunisians have no right to possess any kind of foreign currency (no dollar no euro, no yen...). So Tunisians cannot go on Amazon or eBay and shop online. Bitcoin is a huge opportunity for Tunisians to get back their financial freedom and be able to protect themselves from inflation.""\n\nHowever, the Tunisian state continues to be a pain in the neck of Bitcoin users by maintaining a lackadaisical attitude.\n\nIn November 2015, the Bitcoin community in Tunisia had a conference with government officials to discuss Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Jaziri, the government sees it as a threat not as a technology, especially central bank officials who vehemently oppose it and still see it as an impediment.\n\nNaziri says:\n\n""They are not going to issue a law to make it forbidden but they are not going to authorize any business to operate in this field either. I launched an exchange that was working very well but I had to close it down because of government pressure.""\n\nIrrespective of all these government subjugation and denial of Economic Freedom, Tunisians sees Bitcoin as a timely solution to their Financial exclusion. Many Tunisian users rely on it as a store of value, for remittances and gambling online.\n\nFrom all indications, the Tunisians did not see any reforms after the Arab Spring and the subsequent change of regime. The country has 50 percent of its economy in the informal sector. It is still less that in most African economies that have 80 to 90 percent of trade performed in the Black Market.\n\nBitcoin price here is around 20 to 30 percent more than in other countries because of the local currency, the Dinar, is not a free currency, therefore Bitcoin dealers charge 20 to 30 percent premium to offset this non-convertibility risk of the Dinar.\n\n""In any country that applies capital controls the demand for Bitcoin is high and is going to increase as time goes on,"" Jaziri explains.\n\nLooking for opportunities\n\nThe situation seems inimical, but the Satoshi lover believes the indomitable spirit of the Tunisian people cannot be suppressed and Bitcoin will continue to bloom in the Arab League nation:\n\n""Bitcoin will grow because it is useful for Tunisians looking for financial freedom. It is a must in Tunisia, we do not have any other way to transfer money freely or engage in cross-border transactions. Tunisians don\'t have access to PayPal and Credit cards. Neteller used to be available but not anymore. The only alternative for us is Bitcoin.""\n\nJaziri is also certain his country can be at the forefront of Bitcoin penetration in the continent that is saddled with so many economic, political and social quandaries. Currently, the youths who are endowed with skills and ideas are unable to release all their capabilities and launch projects and ventures.\n\n""I think it is possible, we have great potential within the youth. They know a lot about Bitcoin and all emerging technologies. Unfortunately, they are scared of their government, Bitcoin is still gray and government officials like it to be that way,"" he inferred.', 'This is a paid press release.

There was a perfect structure formation for a recovery. The best part was a close above the $1000 level, and also above the 100 simple moving average (H4).

On February 15, the OpenBazaar development team officially completed the review and merging process of the pull request, integrating Tor into the network.\n\nThe integration of Tor is a part of a larger network reconstruction led by the OpenBazaar development team in order to increase efficiency of the network, change the coding language of the platform, introduce built-in bitcoin wallets for users and provide enhanced privacy to OpenBazaar users.\n\nSince the establishment of OB1, a commercial company composed of OpenBazaar developers and founding members backed by prominent early stage venture capital firms including USV and A16Z, the OpenBazaar software has undergone significant improvements and alterations. With the focus set on building a new version of OpenBazaar for advancement in p2p trade experience, the OB1 team and other members within the OpenBazaar community have been testing various elements of the software to maximize the technological potential of OpenBazaar.\n\nAs noted by OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman in the past, the development team behind OpenBazaar allocated a significant amount of resources to facilitate the migration of the network to the peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol IPFS. OpenBazaar developer Sam Patterson stated in an online bitcoin community that the move to IPFS was important for OpenBazaar as it was compatible with Tor, unlike its previous 1.0 version.\n\nIn September of 2016, Patterson wrote:\n\n“This is possible because we are switching to IPFS for 2.0, which is compatible with Tor, unlike the current 1.0 build.”\n\nUtilizing IPFS network as the basis of OpenBazaar also largely impacted the way stores operated on the OpenBazaar platform, as it no longer required store operators to be online 24/7 in order to have their stores and directories shown in the network. This improvement of the network and the change of the coding language from Python to Go allowed OpenBazaar 2.0 to become increasingly efficient for both users and merchants as well as transform into a more decentralized marketplace.\n\nLike bitcoin, the digital currency used as the main payment method on OpenBazaar, privacy and decentralization are two attributes that represent the OpenBazaar network and platform. Thus, even if the integration of Tor meant an overhaul of the base protocol and network, the OpenBazaar development team worked to release its 2.0 software to ensure each user is protected and offered with necessary privacy measures.\n\n“An ideological pillar we share with many of our users is that people have a right to privacy in their daily lives, a principle that has gotten tangled up a bit since internet use has gone mainstream. We want buyers and sellers to have as much control over their online trade as possible,” wrote the OB1 team.\n\nImage Via: Kernel\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Quite a few merchants are accepting bitcoin payments as we speak. That is not surprising as cryptocurrency is the only global payment solution available today. eGifter, a company selling digital gift cards in exchange for bitcoin, made some rather unusual changes. They only accept payments from Coinbase wallets, rather than using a normal payment gateway. A rather worrisome development hat raises a lot of questions.\n\nDigital gift cards and bitcoin go hand in hand these days. Quite a few platforms offer gift cards in exchange for bitcoin, which has worked out great over time. However, it appears eGifter is turning its back on this decision in a rather strange way. Whereas the company used to accept bitcoin payments through a regular payment processor page, that is no longer the case.\n\nAs of right now, the only way to use bitcoin on eGifter is through Coinbase. To be more precise, users need to own a Coinbase account to complete the payment. A rather strange development, as it seems to indicate eGifter experienced some payment issues in the past. Then again, forcing customers to open a Coinbase account seems rather unusual, to say the least. This move will cost eGifter quite a few customers moving forward, that much is certain.\n\nA Bad Business Decision By eGifter?\n\nAccording to one Reddit user, this decision is made by eGifter due to ongoing issues. The company has allegedly cited the high fees and unreliable confirmation times are a big problem. That is not entirely surprising, as the network congestion causes a lot of problems for all bitcoin users. It is only normal companies feel the brunt of these problems in the long run. eGifter may only be the first of many companies rethinking their bitcoin strategy moving forward.\n\nUsing Coinbase of all exchanges may seem a bit strange, though. The company is facing an IRS John Doe summons, during which they may be forced to turn over customer details. While people who use eGifter have been nothing to hide per se, it is perhaps not the best exchange to use for bitcoin payments. Then again, they offer a separate and secure wallet service which makes it easier to complete payments.\n\nUnfortunately, this decision also means Coinbase is now becoming more of a centralized bitcoin payment solution. Putting more power into the hands of one company is the last thing bitcoin needs right now. It is unclear if eGifter will enable alternative bitcoin payment options moving forward, albeit it seems unlikely. All things considered, a strange and troublesome solution that can affect bitcoin in a negative way.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'It would appear even more US companies are stockpiling bitcoin to fight off cyber attacks. This type of behavior is not entirely new, but it appears to become even more prevalent as of late. Rather than upgrading cybersecurity measures, US companies would rather pay criminals in bitcoin. A very troublesome development that will only invite more criminal activity moving forward.\n\nIt is not advisable to stockpile bitcoin in case a cyber attack occurs. Criminals from all over the world use a wide range of tools to infiltrate enterprises. Once they do so, the enterprise will receive a request to pay a ransom in bitcoin. Since hardly any company keeps cryptocurrency on hand, that causes a bit of a problem.\n\nTo combat this issue, US companies are now buying bitcoin in case an attack would occur. That is anything but the right approach, as it only invites more cyber attacks moving forward. Losing valuable corporate data is a big problem, everyone can understand that. Openly inviting criminals to do their worst and pay their demand in bitcoin, however, is an incomprehensible decision.\n\nStockpiling Bitcoin is Not Advised For Companies\n\nDealing with this moral dilemma is anything but easy for US companies right now. Then again, looking to pay off criminals once they infiltrate a system is equal to taking three steps backward. Paying means helping the bad guys and rewarding them for illegal behavior. It is the same as negotiating with terrorists, which is something no American would ever do, or so they claim. Incident response planning in the corporate sector should never include stockpiling bitcoin to meet ransom demands.\n\nTo put this into perspective, the average ransom demand sits between US$10,000 and US$75,000. Even at current prices, that equals to stockpiling bitcoin in large quantities. Once criminals become aware of which companies are easy to exploit, they will continue hitting them with malware attacks. This unusual strategy will not work out in the end, as it only serves to enrich hackers. A better option would be to beef up existing security protocols. Doing so is not only the only morally right course of action, but also the much cheaper option in the long run.\n\nLast but not least, paying the bitcoin ransom is no guarantee to have company files decrypted again. So far, nearly 25% of all malware attacks remained unresolved after the bitcoin payment was made. It is expected this number will go up over time, especially when companies are so eager to pay bitcoins for criminals. Stockpiling bitcoin is not the answer to these threats, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"

For example, the most notable Bitcoin-accepting brands in the retail sector, the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Virgin Galactic, Expedia and Overstock, actually rely on third parties like BitPay and Coinbase to phone-in their support of Satoshi Nakamoto\'s famous ""internet money"".\n\nPut another way, all the above brands only accept Bitcoin that\'s been turned into dollars (or pounds) beforehand. It might sound like nit-picking but it\'s a frustration for cryptocurrency advocates. A company like Microsoft could significantly enhance the popular image of Bitcoin by handling it directly, accounting complications and all.\n\nTrue support for cryptocurrency is fairly rare, with the casino niche arguably the poster child for Bitcoin integration across a business. Vegas Casino, an iGaming site founded around the numerous benefits of Bitcoin, is a good example. The casino operator has more than 270 different slot machines available to play, all of which accept Bitcoin exclusively.\n\n\n\n\n\n""Elon Musk - The Summit 2013"" (CC BY 2.0) by Heisenberg Media\n\nSelf-Driving Cars\n\nNotions of Tesla\'s sympathy for Bitcoin come from the fact that two dealerships (one in Newport Beach, California, and a second in Tampere, Finland) have traded the cryptocurrency for electric cars made by the Palo Alto-based company. However, in the case of the one sold in the United States, the Model ""S"" in question was offloaded by a Lamborghini showroom.\n\nThat\'s not to say that Bitcoin and Tesla won\'t make good bedfellows one day; in fact, Musk\'s involvement with self-driving cars is perhaps the best evidence yet that Bitcoin (or, at least, the technology behind it, a type of database called ""blockchain"") is predisposed to a relationship with Tesla Motors.\n\nPart of the appeal of self-driving cars is their shareability. Owners could potentially earn money and offset the initial cost of buying a Tesla by introducing their vehicle into a ""fleet"" of cars that other people can hire. As posited by Musk himself, it\'s a theoretical, autonomous, and crowdsourced taxi service that runs on micropayments.\n\n\n\n\n\n""Electric car charging station"" (CC BY 2.0) by Håkan Dahlström\n\nImmutable Records\n\nThe immediate question is one of security – why would anybody freely hand over the keys to their car to strangers? Well, that’s where blockchain comes in. The system creates immutable records, which means that ownership deeds, ignition codes or ""keys"", and journey details are permanently locked into a database.\n\nTo paraphrase The Economist, blockchain technology is a way of ensuring trust between people who have never met.\n\nAs far as paying for services is concerned, micro transactions on the blockchain could be sent directly to the owner of the car, without the delays associated with routing money through a bank or similar third party. A ""buy-to-lease"" system could also offset the cost of purchasing the vehicle in the first place while creating novel options for initial financing.\n\nBlockchain and self-driving cars are the perfect mix of mad science and radical economics. It\'s just a shame that the autonomous motorway is still a few decades from realisation.', 'Besides the global influx of new users, government wars and restrictions against Bitcoin appears to be toughening the resilience and character of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin has exhibited a very strong price character so far in 2017 despite a number of setbacks. This is expressed by the manner in which its price has always shown good strength in recovery.\n\nAlena Vranova, co-founder of SatoshiLabs / TREZOR, says:\n\n“All those setbacks, hurdles and government restrictions are a blessing, making Bitcoin more resilient. The fact that Bitcoin hit $1000 for the second time in its short history also strengthened its position even more and set expectations quite high for this year.”\n\nTwo factors supercharging Bitcoin value\n\nSimon Dixon, BnkToTheFuture.com CEO, believes that Bitcoin’s continued strength as a global store of value has been supercharged by two factors in 2017.\n\nFirstly, Dixon notes that banks and financial instructions around the globe waved the Blockchain flag throughout 2016 and many more are starting to realize that Blockchains are pretty useless without Bitcoin’s proof of work.\n\nThe result, according to Dixon has been a wave of Blockchain applications that are worse than their existing solutions and a realization that Bitcoin is actually the only interesting thing about Blockchain.\n\nSecondly, Dixon says that governments are essentially subsidizing the growth of Bitcoin, driving people to it by waging war on their national cash supply and adding more and more friction to fiat money in their war on money laundering that is affecting everyday people that are not laundering anything.\n\n“These two factors are driving more and more people to buy some Bitcoin and experience what it is like to own their own money,” concludes Dixon.\n\nBitcoin is conquering new levels\n\nMichael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins, describes Bitcoin as having a breakout year in terms of new users and continued adoption on a global scale.\n\nVogel tells Cointelegraph that 2017 is proving to be a very exciting year for Bitcoin, despite having seen major regulatory uncertainties in China with some exchanges halting withdrawals.\n\nVogel explains:\n\n“Speaking from my viewpoint at Netcoins, a large portion of our customer base continues to be new customers that are discovering Bitcoin for the first time and have made the decision to load up their new Bitcoin wallet. In fact, January was a record month for traffic at our Virtual Bitcoin ATMs.”\n\nVogel thinks that the overall upward trend in Bitcoin price is as a result of the influx of new users globally. This is because, despite hiccups and negative press, the global Bitcoin trading and transaction volumes continue to grow. This is reflected in the 24-hour volume history of main Bitcoin exchanges over the past year.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Over the past few years, Paul Krugman, “economist” and University of New York professor, continuously criticized Bitcoin and its decentralized nature, describing it as an anti-social network because it does not depend on a state-owned or controlled money supply.\n\nTo start with, Bitcoin can be perceived as an abstract financial and technological concept within the traditional frame of Economics and Finance. The Bitcoin network represents the potential of peer-to-peer and open financial networks that eliminate the necessity of the third party institutions or governing entities in order to efficiently facilitate payments between users in a practical ecosystem.\n\nConventional “economists” such as Krugman have been introduced to state-owned, controlled and manipulated currencies, assets and stores of value for an immense period of time that they often struggle to understand the necessity of digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nIn his blog he writes:\n\n“At the end of 2013, I wrote a post titled “Bitcoin is evil,” riffing off Charlie Stross’s “Why I want Bitcoin to die in a fire.” Charlie and I both keyed in on the obvious ideological agenda: Bitcoin fever was and is intimately tied up with libertarian anti-government fantasies.”\n\n“Bitcoin is antisocial” because “it is not state-owned” - wait, what?\n\nThe “Bitcoin is antisocial” argument has been the core of Krugman’s criticisms against the cryptocurrency. Ironically, however, Bitcoin has demonstrated the highest level of user freedom, as it relies on a peer-to-peer protocol as its foundation.\n\nAnother ridiculous statement of Krugman that he frequently pushes in mainstream media outlets such as the New York Times, for example, is that “Bitcoin is not state-owned,” which misleads users and investors on the primary purpose of Bitcoin. Basically, he says that Bitcoin was created to weaken the global banking system.\n\nWell, seriously? In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced with the sole purpose of providing financial freedom, sovereignty and independence to users. So far, it has succeeded in offering an unprecedented level of financial freedom to the general population, proving that financial networks can exist without the involvement of governments and the existence of authority.\n\nGovernments abuse the power over the cash-based monetary system\n\nBitcoin serves as evidence that peer-to-peer networks can exist and that users are responsible enough to lead a peer-to-peer protocol in a civilized manner.\n\nThe global financial system utilizes cash as its basis. Banking systems and financial services are deployed on top of the monetary framework, offering digitalized methods of transacting cash. The role of the government within a cash-based monetary system is to provide enough supply of physical cash to support the economy.\n\nGovernments have abused this power over the cash-based monetary system to print fiat money at their demand. Termed as “quantitative easing,” central banks print a certain amount of cash and distribute that among banks. While governments claim that this new set of printed money ends up at the bottom of the economy, in actuality, billions of dollars created on an annual basis are sprinkled on top of the economy for top-tier organizations and financial institutions.\n\nBitcoin has proved that a state-owned money supply is redundant and unnecessary. In a social network, a peer-to-peer protocol like Bitcoin, each individual plays a role in maintaining an autonomous financial network.\n\n\u200b', 'Anyone with an interest in bitcoin will have heard the phrase \'cryptographic hash function\' at some time or other. But what exactly does it mean, and how is it connected to cryptocurrency?\n\nHash functions are an essential part of, not only of the bitcoin protocol, but of information security as a whole.\n\nIn the following article we\'ll take a look at some simple examples of how they work, with a simple demonstration, too.\n\nWhat\'s a hash function?\n\nIn the abstract, a hash function is a mathematical process that takes input data of any size, performs an operation on it, and returns output data of a fixed size.\n\nIn a more concrete example, this can be used to take a sequence of letters of any length as input – what we call a string – and return a sequence of letters of a fixed length. Whether the input string is a single letter, a word, a sentence, or an entire novel, the output – called the digest – will always be the same length.\n\nA common use of this kind of hash function is to store passwords.\n\nWhen you create a user account with any web service which requires a password, the password is run through a hash function, and the hash digest of the message is stored. When you type in your password to log in, the same hash function is run on the word you\'ve entered, and the server checks whether the result matches the stored digest.\n\nThis means that if a hacker is able to access the database containing the stored hashes, they will not be able to immediately compromise all user accounts because there is no easy way to find the password which produced any given hash.\n\nSimple hash functions in Python\n\nYou can experiment with hash values using Python, a programming language installed on Mac and Linux operating systems by default. (This tutorial will assume you\'re using some version of either OS X or Linux, as using Python on Windows is more complicated.)\n\nFirst, open a terminal, type python and hit ENTER.\n\nThis will put you into the Python REPL, an environment where you can try out Python commands directly as opposed to writing a programme in a separate file.\n\nThen, type the following, pressing ENTER after each line, and TAB where marked:\n\nimport hashlib def hash(mystring): [TAB] hash_object = hashlib.md5(mystring.encode()) [TAB] print(hash_object.hexdigest()) [ENTER]\n\nYou have now created a function, hash() , which will calculate and print out the hash value for a given string using the MD5 hashing algorithm. To run it, put a string in between the parentheses in quotation marks, eg:\n\nhash(""CoinDesk rocks"")\n\nAnd press ENTER to see the hash digest of that string.\n\nYou will see that calling the hash function on the same string will always generate the same hash, but adding or changing one character will generate a completely different hash value:\n\nhash(""CoinDesk rocks"") => 7ae26e64679abd1e66cfe1e9b93a9e85 hash(""CoinDesk rocks!"") => 6b1f6fde5ae60b2fe1bfe50677434c88\n\nHash functions in bitcoin\n\nIn the bitcoin protocol, hash functions are part of the block hashing algorithm which is used to write new transactions into the blockchain through the mining process.\n\nIn bitcoin mining, the inputs for the function are all of the most recent, not-yet-confirmed transactions (along with some additional inputs relating to the timestamp and a reference to the previous block).\n\nIn the code example above, we\'ve already seen that changing a small part of the input for a hash function results in a completely different output. This property is crucial to the \'proof of work\' algorithm involved in mining: to successfully \'solve\' a block, miners try to combine all of the inputs with their own arbitrary piece of input data in such a way that the resulting hash starts with a certain number of zeroes.\n\nAs a basic demonstration, we could try \'mining\' with our Python hash function by manually adding exclamation points after ""CoinDesk rocks!"" until we find a hash that starts with a single zero.\n\n>>> hash(""CoinDesk rocks!!"") 66925f1da83c54354da73d81e013974d >>> hash(""CoinDesk rocks!!!"") c8de96b4cf781a6373766c668ceac0f0 >>> hash(""CoinDesk rocks!!!!"") 9ea367cea6a2cc4a6f5a1d9a334d0d9e >>> hash(""CoinDesk rocks!!!!!"") b8d43387d98f035e2f0ac49740a5af38 >>> hash(""CoinDesk rocks!!!!!!"") 0fe46518541f4739613b9ce29ecea6b6 => SOLVED!\n\nOf course, solving the hash for a bitcoin block – which at the time of writing must start with 18 zeros – requires an extremely large amount of computation (and so the combined processing power of all the computers in the network still takes approximately 10 minutes to solve a block).\n\nIt\'s the need for this large amount of processing power that means new bitcoins get mined over a long period of time, not all at once.\n\nIn order to earn bitcoins through mining, you need to put in the huge amount of work necessary to solve a block – and by earning that reward, you\'re locking in all of the new transactions into a block, which is added to the permanent record of all previous transactions: the blockchain.\n\nAny crypto basics you\'d like explained next?

One study by Infoblox found that ransomware increased 3,500 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Ransoms paid also went up 10 times during that period. (Here’s a chronicle of ransomware attacks).\n\nChris Young, CEO of Intel Security, said last week at a private dinner and in his keynote speech at the RSA security conference that ransomware was first detected in 1989, but it didn’t explode until recently. In the past, it was easier for law enforcement to catch the perpetrator as they tried to pick up the ransom.\n\n“It wasn’t until the advent of Bitcoin in our society that ransomware was able to take off,” Young said. “Because now, as an attacker, I can anonymously monetize my target.”\n\nImage Credit: RSA\n\nHe added, “The weaponization of data becomes a real threat to all of us. I’d argue it’s quite likely to be our next advanced, persistent threat.”\n\nBitcoin, the crypto currency introduced in 2008, enables two parties to exchange money without knowing who the other one is. During the past year, security firm Kaspersky identified ransomware as the biggest cybersecurity threat.\n\nAt first, cyber criminals used ransomware schemes against unsuspecting consumers. The criminals stole their passwords, locked down their computers with cryptography, and then demanded ransoms in the hundreds of dollars to unlock the computers. Faced with no choice, the victims paid the ransoms in Bitcoin. And that helped the problem grow and become much more lucrative, said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, at the dinner.\n\nThe ransomware threat has been growing. A ransomware app even made it into the Google Play store in January.\n\nYoung said that the growing number of attack types has also come with new attack surfaces, as the number of devices that we use in our daily lives is growing well beyond computers and smartphones. The Internet of Things devices, such as security cameras or TV webcams, are also vulnerable to viruses and other attacks. And they can be used as stepping stones to larger, more threatening attacks.\n\nAnd ransomware is moving on to bigger targets. The focus is increasingly on places like hospitals, which have restrictions on what they can do with patient data. The bad guys find out where the computer backups are stored, they penetrate them and encrypt them, and then they hold the data for ransom.\n\nCyber attackers held an Austrian hotel network for ransom. The criminals demanded $1,800 in Bitcoin to unlock the network while preventing guests from checking in and out of the hotel and locking them out of their guest rooms. The hotel paid up.\n\nA crypto ransomware attack also hit San Francisco’s Municipal Transportation Agency as an infection spread across the Muni system’s networks, taking down ticketing systems. The criminals asked for $73,000 in exchange for restoration of the Muni data.\n\nImage Credit: RSA\n\nEd Skoudis, instructor at the SANS Institute, predicts that the crypto ransomware perpetrators will go after small to mid-sized banks next.\n\n“One of the biggest problems in the last couple of years has been the explosion of crypto ransomware,” Skoudis said in an RSA talk. “Crytpo ransomware is so much more powerful, especially when it uses public key cryptography.”\n\nCrytography is useful in enabling secure communications and ecommerce, but there are 150 active families of crypto ransomware today, Skoudis said. Companies say this is one of their biggest fears, he said, and many more increasingly sophisticated attacks against networks are expected.\n\nYoung, meanwhile, worries about the attack targets in homes, thanks to the Internet of Things.\n\n“The target is now the weapon,” Young said. “Now we have to turn our attention to data being weaponized against us. What we used to think about protecting — we now have to be protected against. It’s the strangest irony. The target is now the weapon. We’ve given the enemy all of the scale they could possibly want by connecting our homes with smarter, better, faster devices.”\n\nImage Credit: nomoreransom.org\n\nAnd yes, I’m still waiting for some good news on this front.\n\nTo prevent ransomware attacks, companies and individuals have to make themselves into harder targets. If one workstation gets attacked, it shouldn’t make the whole network and its servers vulnerable.\n\n“If your organization gets hit with ransomware, who is going to decide whether to pay the bad guys?” he said. “Your business principles might get hit by the business reality.”\n\nYoung said that the fragmented cybersecurity industry must work together.\n\n“We’re the most fragmented sector in all of IT,” he said.\n\nThe industry has formed the collaborative Cyber Threat Alliance group, and it has created No More Ransom, a site that helps victims of ransomware recover their data.', 'The United States Senate has confirmed Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican and a long-time bitcoin supporter, as President Trump’s budget director, a positive signal for bitcoin. Mulvaney has a reputation as a fiscal hawk and is expected to play a key role in the administration’s plans to make changes in Washington, D.C., according to The New York Times.\n\nMulvaney has been interested in bitcoin since 2014 after participating in a Small Business Committee hearing on bitcoin. He said it could influence monetary policy. He has also accepted bitcoin donations.\n\nHe and Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, launched the bipartisan Blockchain Caucus in September.\n\nOther pro-bitcoin enthusiasts in the current administration include Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder who served on Trump’s transition team, Balaji Srinivasan, 21.co-CEO and potential FDA director nominee, and Travis Kalanick, Uber CEO who joined Trump’s team of advisors.\n\nA Narrow Confirmation\n\nThe Senate confirmed Mulvaney by a 51-to-49 vote along mostly party lines. Arizona Republican John McCain joined Democrats in opposing the nomination. McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, objected to Mulvaney’s support for military spending limits. McCain said it would be irresponsible to place the future of the defense budget in Mulvaney’s hands.\n\nMulvaney will lead the Office of Management and Budget with a full agenda, since the administration has to prepare a budget and decide whether to raise the debt limit. The administration has also pledged to introduce a tax plan soon.\n\nMulvaney favors big changes in Medicare and in raising the Social Security eligibility age, a position Trump opposed during the presidential campaign. Mulvaney’s positions on government spending also are not consistent with Trump’s promises to invest in infrastructure and the military.\n\nMulvaney blamed Democrats and a handful of Republicans for the government shutdown under the Obama Administration.\n\nWhere Mulvaney Differs From Trump\n\nDuring the nomination proceedings, Mulvaney defended his plan to support entitlement program cuts that Trump said he would protect.\n\nSpeaking before the Senate homeland security and budget committees, he acknowledged that his positions on the national debt and spending are not in sync with Trump’s campaign pledges and statements from some advisers.\n\nMulvaney also said during the nomination proceedings he will continue speaking out about the rising costs of Medicare and Social Security.\n\nMulvaney said he favors raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70, but he said he would not cut benefits for current recipients. He said he supports means testing to qualify for Medicare.\n\nDemocrats warned that the nomination indicated Trump was changing his stated intention to protect entitlements.\n\nA Fiscal Hawk\n\nMulvaney has questioned the need to raise the national debt ceiling, saying he believed the government should prioritize payments if there is a danger of breaching the debt limit.\n\nMulvaney, elected to Congress in 2010, is known as a strident deficit hawk. He was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus and a leader in the group’s attempts to remove then-House Speaker John Boehner in 2015.\n\nHe supported the government shutdown over the Affordable Care Act and was willing to do it again two years later in an attempt to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nMulvaney backs the “penny plan” to cut 1 percent of federal spending each year for five years.\n\nHe is among those lawmakers who have opposed infrastructure spending. Trump’s advisers have not said how the government will pay for a proposed infrastructure package that could reach $1 trillion.\n\nTrump’s plan to cut taxes could reduce federal revenue by trillions over the next decade, independent analysts have said. Mulvaney has said reforming the tax code could create growth when asked if tax cuts should be allowed to add to the deficit.\n\nHe said Trump should first consider the impact on the overall economy. The best way to cut the deficit or balance the budget is to build economic growth, he said.\n\nAnother option is to reduce spending. Trump is considering cutting the Energy and Commerce departments, along with eliminating arts programs.\n\nmage from Flickr/Gage Skidmore.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Remitano, a Vietnam-based P2P platform for trading bitcoin, has expanded its services across the English-speaking world.\n\nThe company is targeting bitcoin exchangers, investors and users of remittance services, beginning with Asian countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia and China.\n\nLeading sources of traffic on Remitano besides Vietnam are Nigeria and Malaysia.\n\nFocus: Fraud Prevention\n\n“Our new platform will help bring bitcoin to everyone, by means of preventing fraud and scamming among the bitcoin community,” said CEO and co-founder Dung Huynh. “Bitcoin fraud is a problem that is deterring people from partaking in this exciting market, hampering its overall potential.

02/20/2017,"['Bitcoin price is maintaining a strong position at $1,060, which was considered an all-time high value for four straight years since 2013, prior to the fall of Mt. Gox.\n\nA large factor behind the speedy recovery and strong performance of Bitcoin price has been the resilience of the Chinese market and the development of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market, that has transformed into a global powerhouse over the past few months.\n\nThe Japanese market outpaced the US and Chinese Bitcoin markets\n\nOn Feb. 17, in an article entitled “Size Matters: Japan Becomes Largest Bitcoin Exchange Market, Beats China and US,” Cointelegraph reported that the Japanese market outpaced the US and Chinese Bitcoin markets to become the largest Bitcoin exchange market in the world with a $135 mln daily trading volume and a 50 percent market share.\n\nThe exponential growth of the Japanese Bitcoin market can be attributed to two major events: the introduction of efficient regulatory frameworks by the Japanese government and the temporary suspension of Bitcoin withdrawals by two leading Chinese Bitcoin exchanges Huobi and OKCoin.\n\nTraders from China moving to Japanese Bitcoin exchanges\n\nWhile many feared that the Bitcoin price would be largely affected by the suspension of withdrawals and the People’s Bank of China’s deep involvement in the local Bitcoin exchange market, the global Bitcoin exchange market continued to prosper, with many traders from China moving to Japanese Bitcoin exchanges and the rest migrating to peer-to-peer platforms such as LocalBitcoins to trade Bitcoin directly on a peer-to-peer basis.\n\nAs a result, the volumes of both Japanese Bitcoin exchanges including bitFlyer and LocalBitcoins China exploded. This past week, restrictions of the PBoC pushed the LocalBitcoins China trading volume to 5,000 Bitcoins per week, which is equivalent to $5.3 mln in weekly trades.\n\nWhy Bitcoin price fell and recovered quickly\n\nTo understand how and why Bitcoin price fell and recovered quickly in the past few weeks, it is important to acknowledge that Chinese traders and investors have realized many methods exist apart from local Bitcoin exchange trading platforms to purchase or sell Bitcoin.\n\nPeer-to-peer trading platforms such as LocalBitcoins is one of many ways to trade Bitcoin and migrating to properly regulated markets like Japan is also a favorable method.\n\nThis recognition from local investors and traders on the global Bitcoin trading market allowed the Bitcoin price to recover and maintain a strong position at $1060.\n\nThe Chinese government and Bitcoin exchanges have also announced the formation of a regulatory alliance focused on Bitcoin, to discuss potential regulatory issues and growth-related conferences with the local Bitcoin community.\n\nThe announcement from Chinese financial regulators led Chinese investors and traders to become more optimistic towards the relationship between local exchanges and regulators, instead of fearing the involvement of PBoC.', 'The much-anticipated bitcoin ETF, which has been going through the bureaucratic process for now more than three years, will likely be rejected according to a Bitmex prediction contract launched almost two weeks ago.\n\nSince its listing, the market has always given Winklevoss’ ETF a less than 50% chance, usually standing at around 40% for much of the past week, falling to as low as 18% yesterday.\n\nThere were suggestions its sharp drop was due to a bug, but Greg Dwyer, Business Development Manager at BitMEX, told CCN:\n\n“There have been no bugs with the ETF prediction market and it is operating exactly as intended. It is currently trading in a range between 24 – 37%. That is, the price represents the probability of the ETF being approved by the SEC come March 11.”\n\nSpencer Bogart, Vice President of Equity Research for Needham & Co, gave the ETF only a 25% chance of approval.\n\nThe main reason appears to be due to bitcoin’s volatile nature, but stock markets have previously crashed, some company stocks have instantly become worthless and some have instantly jumped in price.\n\nFurthermore, Kevin Lu, a hedge fund analyst, describes in a detailed article for Seeking Alpha how “Bitcoin is a unique, uncorrelated asset class… and that makes bitcoin extremely desirable from a portfolio construction perspective.”\n\nThe SEC’s thinking on the matter is not quite clear. We have reached out for comments, but have received no response in time for publishing.\n\nSEC personnel has just changed or is in the process of changing. As such, the decision might be made in somewhat chaotic circumstances with the new personnel potentially not fully up to speed on the fairly complicated matter.\n\nTo illustrate, SEC’s page still lists the old chair, but President Trump has chosen a new nominee, Walter J. Clayton, described by the New York Times as “the Wall Street Lawyer” and as “the insider’s insider.” It further states:\n\n“He had a front-row seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013.”\n\nWhether that experience makes him more favorable to bitcoin or more against it, remains to be seen, but the new administration does have some bitcoin supporters in its cabinet and emphasizes de-regulation with the aim of fostering economic growth. However, Clayton himself, a law graduate, has not previously made any comments on bitcoin.\n\nHe will soon be familiar with the digital currency, if he is not already, and will most probably be a very influential figure in this space. The ETF decision, whether approved or rejected, will have considerable implications. Equally, and perhaps more importantly, he might eventually want to give some sort of guidelines on the currently booming ICO markets.\n\nFinally, the new administration might wish to allow margins and futures trading on regulated exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini for its refusal by inaction so far has forced many to use somewhat shady and seemingly amateurish exchanges which has led to losses, opening the relevant agencies to criticism for failing to protect the public and worse, for indirectly causing the losses.\n\nWhether they will take any such action is too early to say, but we might soon get a glimpse of the new administration’s approach towards digital currencies, the blockchain space and, more widely, the Fintech industry.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Following in the footsteps of the Philippines and China, the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and its Central Bank plan to provide a clear regulatory framework on the usability of Bitcoin and operations of digital currency exchanges in the near future.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2017, the Central Bank of UAE published a document entitled “Regulatory Framework For Stored Values and Electronic Payment System” with a vision of leading market adoption digital payments and fintech technologies within the UAE.\n\nIs Bitcoin legal in UAE?\n\nOne section of the document called D.7.3 explicitly prohibited the usage of virtual currencies, disallowing digital currency transactions and trading. The document led to various controversial discussions within the UAE Bitcoin and fintech industries, as leading companies inquired the Central Bank if the bill considers Bitcoin and other digital currencies in existence.\n\nThe section read:\n\n“Virtual Currency(s) is not recognized by this regulation. Exceptions are made to a digital unit that: a) can be redeemed for goods, services, and discounts as part of a user loyalty or rewards program with the Issuer and; b) cannot be converted into a fiat /virtual currency.”\n\nIn response, Mubarak Rashed Khamis Al Mansouri, the governor of the Central Bank of the UAE, announced that the document doesn’t, in fact, consider digital currencies like Bitcoin, trading platforms, companies and Blockchain technology.\n\nAl Mansouri further noted that the Central Bank of the UAE is in careful consideration of legalizing Bitcoin and developing necessary regulatory frameworks for businesses and exchanges to comply with.\n\nIn late 2016, the government of Dubai also emphasized that government officials and political leaders will come together to discuss the potential of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology within the realm of finance and particularly the financial industry and ecosystem of the UAE.\n\nA government statement read:\n\n“The Supreme Legislation Committee in the Emirate of Dubai (SLC) has announced that it will discuss the present and future of the legislative and legal frameworks related to cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin during a workshop on 'Virtual Currency: Fact and Law.' In cooperation with the Dubai Electronic Security Center (DESC), the session will be held on Nov. 20, 2016, amid high-level attendance of local and federal government entities.”\n\nA case similar to that of the Philippines\n\nThe legality of Bitcoin is nearly identical to that of the Philippines prior to the release of BSP Circular No.944, a document released by the central bank of the Philippines recognizing Bitcoin as a remittance network and legitimate payment method.\n\nGovernment officials and regulators of the UAE are optimistic towards Bitcoin and seeing great potential in Bitcoin businesses, exchanges and market. UAE central bank governor, as well as other important figures within the UAE financial industry, have announced publicly on several occasions that the government is close to releasing a nationwide regulatory framework on Bitcoin to ensure the digital currency market prospers under careful oversight of the government.\n\nThis approach is also similar to the strategy of the Chinese government, which has allocated a significant amount of resources in regulating Bitcoin with practical and efficient regulations to ensure Bitcoin users remains in the exchange market and choose not to operate in black or underground markets.\n\nAs of now, Bitcoin is a commodity, as it is in Australia and a few other countries. Bitcoin is legal to use and the UAE government will soon release appropriate regulations in the near future."", ""Two reports by Credit Suisse suggest that Bitcoin is three times more volatile than oil and 11 times more than the post-Brexit pound sterling.\n\nThe Swiss bank’s first article, published earlier this month titled “Is Bitcoin Safe?” seeks to advise on the resilience of the virtual currency as an asset.\n\n“Bitcoin does carry some unique risks,” analysts from its global marketing research department state.\n\n“The value of the cryptocurrency has been three times as volatile as the price of oil and 11 times more than the post-Brexit exchange rate between the dollar and the British pound.”\n\nIn line with banks the world over, Credit Suisse champions the appeal and security of the Blockchain, commenting that “it's only when you add people to the mix that things start to get complicated.” The same, it says, is true about Bitcoin trading in the absence of “bad actors.”\n\nCuriously, the article was followed a week later by another titled “Forget Bitcoin, but Remember Blockchain?” which described the world of Bitcoin as “complex and expensive.”\n\nThis time Blockchain received special attention as “the more powerful potential disruptor,” while Bitcoin was not praised at all.\n\n“Yet for all the hype, European Tech analysts from Credit Suisse's Global Markets Research department say Bitcoin is not the end of cash, debit cards and digital payment systems such as PayPal,” the bank writes."", 'Typos aren\'t just a headache — they can sometimes have very costly consequences.\n\nOn Friday, digital currency Zcoin announced that a typographical error had let an unidentified attacker make a profit of around $400,000 (£320,000).\n\nZcoin is similar to Bitcoin — it\'s a digital currency powered by cryptography, and without any single central bank. It\'s based on Zerocoin, a software protocol that was developed to to provide its users with ""complete financial privacy and anonymity.""\n\nBut in implementing it, the Zcoin made a single screw-up. ""Yesterday, our team found a bug in our implementation of Zerocoin,"" Zcoin community manager Reuben Yap wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""A typographical error on a single additional character in code allowed an attacker to create Zerocoin spend transactions without a corresponding mint.""\n\nIn other words, they got a single letter wrong in their code — and this let a hacker steal coins by cashing out from single transactions multiple times.\n\nYap emphasises that there\'s nothing wrong with Zcoin\'s cryptography — it was just the typo that was the problem. ""The exploit happened due to the bug in the code and not from any weakness in the cryptography. The bug from the typo error allowed the attacker to reuse his existing valid proofs to generate additional Zerocoin spend transactions,"" he wrote.\n\nIn short: It\'s human error, they argue, rather than any fatal flaw in the Zcoin project.\n\nThe still-unidentified attacker was able to steal around 370,000 Zcoins — around $680,000-worth (£546,000) at current exchange rates, according to CoinMarketCap. Almost all of these have already been sold on, netting the attacker a profit of around 410 bitcoin — $437,000 (£351,000) — according to Zcoin.\n\nThe attacker evaded detection for weeks by slowly making payments and withdrawals. ""From what we can see, the attacker (or attackers) is very sophisticated and from our investigations, he (or she) did many things to camouflage his tracks through the generation of lots of exchange accounts and carefully spread out deposits and withdrawals over several weeks,"" Yap wrote.\n\n""We estimate the attacker has created about 370,000 Zcoins which has been almost completely sold except for about 20,000+ Zcoin and absorbed on the market with a profit of around 410 BTC.

The annual conference is a major expo for digital security firms. (Photo: Tim Johnson / TNS)\n\nSan Francisco — U.S. corporations that have long resisted bending to the demands of computer hackers who take their networks hostage are increasingly stockpiling bitcoin, the digital currency, so that they can quickly meet ransom demands rather than lose valuable corporate data.\n\nThe companies are responding to cybersecurity experts who recently have changed their advice on how to deal with the growing problem of extortionists taking control of the computers.\n\n“It’s a moral dilemma. If you pay, you are helping the bad guys,” said Paula Long, chief executive of DataGravity, a Nashua, N.H., company that helps clients secure corporate data. But, she added, “You can’t go to the moral high ground and put your company at risk.”\n\n“A lot of companies are doing that as part of their incident response planning,” said Chris Pogue, chief information security officer at Nuix, a company that provides information management technologies. “They are setting up bitcoin wallets.”\n\nPogue said he believed thousands of U.S. companies had prepared strategies for dealing with hacker extortion demands, and numerous law firms have stepped in to facilitate negotiations with hackers, many of whom operate from the other side of the globe.\n\nSymantec, a Mountain View, Calif., company that makes security and storage software, estimates that ransom demands to companies average between $10,000 and $75,000 for hackers to provide keys to decrypt frozen networks. Individuals whose computers get hit pay as little as $100 to $300 to unlock their encrypted files.\n\nCompanies that analyze cyber threats say the use of ransomware has exploded, and payments have soared. Recorded Future, a Somerville, Mass., threat intelligence firm, says ransom payments skyrocketed 4,000 percent last year, reaching $1 billion. Another firm, Kaspersky Lab, estimates that a new business is attacked with ransomware every 40 seconds.\n\n“If you’re hit by ransomware today, you have only two options: You either pay the criminals or you lose your data,” said Raj Samani, chief technical officer at Intel Security for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “We underestimated the scale of the issue.”\n\nHackers often send out email with tainted hyperlinks to broad targets, say, an entire company. All it takes is one computer user in a company to click on the infected link to allow hackers to get a foothold in the broader network, leading to hostile encryption.\n\n“At least one employee will click on anything,” said Robert Gibbons, chief technology officer at Datto, a Connecticut company that offers digital disaster recovery services.\n\nLaw enforcement counsels U.S. businesses not to succumb to ransom demands, urging them to keep backup copies of their data in case of hostile encryption.\n\n“The official FBI policy is that you shouldn’t pay the ransom,” said Leo Taddeo, chief security officer for Cryptzone, a Waltham, Mass., company that provides network security. Until 2015, Taddeo ran the cyber division of the FBI’s New York City office.\n\nBut practical considerations increasingly are dictating a different approach. “It’s an option to pay the ransom to get back up and running. Sometimes it’s the only option,” Taddeo said.\n\n“But it has downsides,” he added. “Paying ransom just invites the next attack.”\n\nMoreover, 1 in 4 companies that pay ransoms never get their files restored, Gibbons said.\n\nThe idea of rewarding extortionists with payment makes some technologists see red.\n\n“That makes me super mad,” said Lior Div, chief executive of Cybereason, a Boston-area cybersecurity company. “There are things that are unacceptable, and we need to fight them.”\n\nDiv and his company have done something about the extortion epidemic. They built a product called RansomFree that claims to detect 99 percent of all ransomware strains.\n\nSo far, the free software has been downloaded 125,000 times, the company says.\n\nAs extortionists get more sophisticated, researchers say, they are modifying their malicious code, their infection strategies and the way they collect payments.\n\nOnce they weasel their way into your network, they now take a look around.\n\n“They’ll actually explore your system to see how much money they can squeeze from you,” said Andrei Barysevich, director of advanced collection at Recorded Future.\n\nAnd they won’t offer any sympathy, no matter how valuable the encrypted data, even if lives are at stake, say, in a health care network. They may even say they are doing nothing evil.\n\n“They actually think they are on the moral high ground. They think the companies should have paid more for security,” said Barysevich, who spoke at a presentation this week at the annual RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco, which bills itself as the world’s leading gathering of cybersecurity specialists.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2m1WaKh"", 'Baton Rouge’s first ATM for Bitcoin brings a tangible interchange for users of the decentralized, digital currency. But it remains unclear how much of a market exists for Bitcoin in the Baton Rouge area.\n\nEarlier this month, Will Haynie, a New Orleans day trader who operates Bitcoin ATMs with his brother, installed a Genesis Coin ATM machine at American Market, a grocery store at 5251 Nicholson Dr.\n\nHaynie has other such machines in New Orleans and has plans for one more in either Shreveport or Baton Rouge in the near future. The machines allow for a one-directional transaction, where users can purchase Bitcoin for cash but not receive cash for their Bitcoin.\n\nQuantifying the Bitcoin market locally is challenging. Haynie says his ATMs have had solid traffic so far, but declined to provide specific numbers. The currency is geared toward younger people, Haynie says, noting the ATM is near the LSU campus. Hayne collects an 8% fee on transactions.\n\nUsers don’t need ATM machines to buy Bitcoin. They can already purchase the currency by getting an online account on a large exchange, but Haynie says the ATMs streamline the process. Users must set up a digital wallet and go through either an SMS verification or have their driver’s license scanned, depending on the size of the transaction. Then, users insert cash and get Bitcoin.\n\n“It’s internet cash,” Hayne says. “Anything you can pay for online, you can pay for with Bitcoin … a lot of big companies are accepting it.”\n\nCurrently, one Bitcoin is worth around $1,065, and users can buy a fraction of a single Bitcoin. The digital currency has no authority and is not run by any bank. Bitcoin has gained worldwide exposure over the last several years, and several Baton Rouge companies have since announced they would begin accepting the currency.\n\nBryan Jeansonne, a local real estate lawyer, announced in early 2014 he would begin accepting the currency, and a handful of other businesses followed suit. The Republican Party of Louisiana even began accepting Bitcoin donations.\n\nJeansonne says he had hoped to attract people from other countries where currencies can be unstable, and the low fees made the currency appealing.\n\n“We do still accept it,” he says. “But no one has ever used it.”\n\nGrant Bourque, a local software engineer, first got Bitcoin several years ago, and is now involved with a Facebook page for local Bitcoin users. He says the technology behind the currency drew him to Bitcoin. Though he mostly saves his Bitcoins, he uses some to buy things like presents, ebooks, games, shirts and the like. A few years ago, Bourque went to a Bitcoin conference and paid for his tickets with the currency.\n\n“I appreciate the creativity that went into creating a global digital cash system that no single entity controls,” Bourque says in an email. “I think it is a cheaper and more secure way to send money to anyone over the internet.”\n\n—Sam Karlin', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team.\n\nThe following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered exclusively to our subscribers.\n\nA relatively quiet and traditionally isolated market is about to set a precedent that could change the blockchain sector.\n\nLast week, CoinDesk met with a group of representatives from some of Japan’s blockchain startups and enterprise players. Conversation revolved around the upcoming regulation of cryptocurrencies, and the impact it would have on industry business models.\n\nThe consensus seemed to be that the new rules (a requirement to get a license from the Financial Services Agency, register with the anti-money laundering authorities and submit to periodic audits and inspections) would be good for the sector. Bestowing legitimacy will get both people and businesses more comfortable with alternative currencies, increasing volume, investment and network effects.\n\nBut that's not to say there isn't a cost.\n\nOne of the main risks is that the legislation ends up having the same effect as New York’s 'BitLicense', driving out businesses and stagnating the local ecosystem. And while you could argue that the additional stability and security is worth the loss of innovation and choice, the resulting consolidation is a step towards centralization in a sector based on decentralization.\n\nOn the other hand, a likely consequence is that large financial firms will take an interest in the cryptocurrency business, looking to diversify their offerings and broaden their client base.\n\nAlready, finance giant SBI has invested in exchanges BitFlyer and Kraken, and announced plans to set up its own. FX broker Money Partners Group invested in TechBureau. GMO Internet set up a cryptocurrency wallet. And, this week, three of Japan’s largest financial institutions participated in BitFlyer’s latest funding round.\n\nThe inflow of institutional funds will not only add liquidity and respectability to the sector. It will also give startups the impetus to both strengthen their business at home and grow internationally.\n\nA new direction\n\nWhile that impact will be significant, a potentially more far-reaching one will be the change in banking practices that could result.\n\nWe see frequent reports of bitcoin startups in other high-tech, allegedly innovative, financial centers having to shut down because banks won’t work with them.\n\nHere, we have banks actually investing in or creating bitcoin businesses. The example set by Japanese banks could encourage a new tone in the global cryptocurrency sector.\n\nWe have become used to seeing banks dedicate resources and attention to blockchain projects. Although some have started experimenting on private versions of public blockchains, on the whole, banks have stayed away from bitcoin and its peers.\n\nAn increased interest in a different store of value, combined with a focus on improved processes, could lead to new innovations and use cases.\n\nDon't dismiss Japan\n\nTo put this into perspective, we are looking at the potential symbiosis of two sectors that are both global leaders.\n\nTokyo is one of the top five financial centers worldwide. Furthermore, Japan recently overtook China as the largest bitcoin market.\n\nCould this lead to a 'co-opting' of alternatives to fiat by the gatekeepers of the fiat system? Possibly, but the question misses the point.\n\nAn eventual mingling of the two was always inevitable, either as a stepping stone or as an end goal. If the example set by Japan spreads, we could be at the threshold of that phase.\n\nThis will imply a cultural shift on both sides.\n\nHowever, the fundamentals of bitcoin are unlikely to change. The fundamentals of traditional banking could.\n\nRed and blue paint splash via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Many vendors on AlphaBay, which is the darknet’s largest market, sell information such as credit card numbers and login details for Netflix and other online accounts.\n\nOne of the most interesting pieces of information that can be bought on the darknet markets—and many online hacker forums for that matter—is a hacked Xfinity account from Comcast. With someone else’s Xfinity account information, a person can watch live TV and On Demand programming, but more importantly, the login details can be used to gain access to Xfinity WiFi hotspots in the United States, which essentially means nearly free internet.\n\nHow It Works\n\nSo what does someone have to do to gain access to a hacked Xfinity account? Not much.\n\nAfter downloading Tor and visiting one of the darknet markets, a simple search for “Xfinity” will bring up a variety of vendors who are willing to sell account information. On Alphabay, a seemingly reputable vendor is selling lifetime access to Xfinity accounts for $5.\n\nOnce the account details are sent over in a timely fashion, they can be tested on the nearest Xfinity WiFi access point. Anyone who lives in an apartment building will likely be able to find such an access point from the comfort of their own home. If the account details don’t seem to be working, a quick support message to the vendor will result in login details for another hacked account being sent over.\n\nIn addition to Xfinity, darknet vendors also sell access to hacked login credentials for Netflix, Spotify, and many other subscription services.\n\nWhat are the Downsides?\n\nWhile using someone’s hacked Xfinity account details to gain access to the internet won’t seem like a real choice to some, others have found the dirt cheap price to be too good to ignore.\n\nIt’s extremely unlikely that these purchases will actually lead to free internet for an entire lifetime. That said, $5 for even just a few months of Internet access can be attractive to someone who simply cannot afford their own subscription.\n\nXfinity login credentials have been known to last months before the true account owners realize what’s up, but sometimes it can be annoying to have to message a vendor for replacement account details every now and then. Then again, those who are on extremely tight budgets are willing to go the extra mile to get that cheap internet access. The concept is similar to those who are willing to go through the process of torrenting a movie rather than simply paying for it on iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon.\n\nIt’s unclear what steps Comcast is taking to track down those who are using hacked account credentials to gain access to Xfinity hotspots at this time.\n\nBitcoin Incentivizes Better Security Practices\n\nPerhaps one of the most underappreciated attributes of bitcoin is its ability to incentivize normal people to care more about computer security—ransomware is likely the best example of this phenomenon. With ransomware, the financial incentives for hackers to put malware on as many devices as possible have increased.\n\nIn the case of hacked accounts sold of the darknet, the account owners don’t have much of an incentive to better protect their login credentials. After all, someone else using the account to access WiFi hotspots or Netflix doesn’t prevent the account owner from using the services as well (in most cases).\n\nThe companies behind these online services are the ones who may be incentivized to implement better security practices for their customers. People gaining access to these services via hacked accounts means less revenue and increased costs for Netflix, Comcast, and other service providers.\n\nNetflix and Comcast could implement some form of two-factor authentication to curb the use of hacked accounts, but it seems the issue hasn’t become a major problem for them yet.']"

That’s attracted American retail traders to Bitcoin exchanges offering leveraged trading and derivative products based on Bitcoin price movements. But, that’s likely in contravention of CFTC regulations for American retail traders.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requires American retail traders to buy leveraged or margined financial products on-exchange, and that includes Bitcoin derivative products. Most retail Americans trade leveraged Bitcoin financial products off-exchange.\n\nThere is one exception to the general rule. American retail traders may buy leveraged off-exchange forex contracts, providing it’s with a National Futures Association (NFA) registered Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer (RFED), or a bank registered with a U.S. bank regulator.\n\nThe CFTC considers Bitcoin a “currency,” but not a “foreign currency.” The CFTC says Bitcoin is not forex, so it doesn’t fall under the forex exception. The CFTC also refers to Bitcoin as a “commodity.”\n\nThe North American Derivatives Exchange, Inc.

On Dec. 16, 2016, Nadex filed a Self-Certification to Delist Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin exchanges try to escape CFTC jurisdiction\n\nBitcoin exchanges have sought exemption from CFTC jurisdiction in claiming traders are “making and taking delivery” of each trade on their “exchange,” by transferring the title into Bitcoin wallets.

While many investors remain skeptical, over the past 12 months, bitcoin has quadrupled in value, clearing $1,100. The cast provides updates on this digital currency and how a bitcoin ETF could change the game.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on Feb. 14, 2017.\n\nChris Hill: Here\'s something we haven\'t talked about in ... I don\'t even remember the last time we talked about bitcoin, but we\'re going to talk about bitcoin.\n\nI feel like, if he\'s listening over in Germany, Matt Koppenheffer is smiling, if not outright laughing at me, because I\'ve been bearish on bitcoin from the start, and over the past year, the price of bitcoin has quadrupled. It broke the $1,000 mark last week, and it\'s dipped back down. But you\'re someone, like Matt Koppenheffer, who\'s been pretty bullish on bitcoin. First, before we dig into the news with bitcoin, tell me why. Why the bull case for bitcoin? Because, to me, it just seems like Monopoly money, it seems like a made-up currency, and as I have admitted before, the fact that the Winklevoss twins were involved in this doesn\'t help the bull case, in my opinion.\n\nSimon Erickson: Right. This is kind of an ethereal discussion here, Chris. There\'s a lot of speculation in bitcoin right now. We don\'t have any stocks tied to this --\n\nHill: Not yet. We\'ll get to that.\n\nErickson: Yes, exactly. But it is a very interesting story. Just, generally, my personal thesis, disclaimer, I own one bitcoin, have had quite a year with that. [laughs]\n\nHill: Congratulations, that\'s worked out well for you.\n\nErickson: But, I think there\'s just a lot of transactional friction in the way that we buy and sell things today. Think about it, we\'re built off of a financing infrastructure. You have a bank account that you have a credit card that ties into, you pay your statement at the end of the month, and every step along the way, somebody is taking a small piece of this. But it\'s the way that we built it out over the last several decades. And if you build a digital infrastructure correctly, as bitcoin did and Blockchain is trying to do, you don\'t need a lot of those steps. It\'s basically digital cash. I always think about it as, you\'re handing a digital dollar to somebody, and that\'s it. There\'s no statements. There\'s no financing. There\'s no APR at the end of the year, anything like that. But to do that, there\'s a lot of regulators who don\'t like that because you can do bad things with that. You can\'t track the person giving you the cash at the end of the day and various other things. That\'s had bitcoin held back on what its true potential, possibly, could be. But at the end of the day, you\'re starting to see more and more transactions using bitcoin all across the globe, not just in the United States, but in China and Japan and a bunch of different places. Because bitcoin is going to tap out at 21 million bitcoins, once they\'re mined, you have a fixed supply and increasing demand, and that\'s pushing the value of each one bitcoin up over the years.\n\nHill: We\'ve seen this run up over the past 12 months, and you look at the fact that the SEC is considering three separate potential bitcoin ETFs. Considering approval of any one of the three. Let\'s say one of them gets approved -- what kind of run-up are we going to see then? Because if we\'re seeing this run-up now ... this actually gets me, I don\'t want to say bullish on bitcoin, but it gets me slightly less bearish as an investor, because ETFs are a way that a lot of people invest if they\'re looking to get exposure to something without really having the concentrated upside and, therefore, downside of a single stock. I\'m not looking to buy a bitcoin, but I\'m slightly more interested in a bitcoin ETF. What happens if they actually approve one of these things?\n\nErickson: Sure. On the continuum of uncertainty, it goes down a notch. If the SEC is going to say, ""This is alright, to create bitcoin ETFs,"" and they have until March 11th, I believe, to approve of this, but the people who said, ""No way, this is too early, I have so many questions about this even being possible,"" those people will start saying, ""You know, this still sounds speculative to me, but I think it\'s interesting now that the SEC is behind it."" Basically, anything new, almost all of innovation has got a zillion questions when it first gets introduced that, over time, as it grows and gets more and more approvals or people behind it, the questions tend to either linger or go away. And I think that\'s what you\'re seeing with bitcoin. That\'s what the SEC decision is going to have an impact on this.', 'Timing the market is difficult. If it were easy, everyone would do it. That’s why many traders turn to technical analysis for an edge.\n\n\n\nAll any trader has is the left side of the chart (past) to try and determine the right side of the chart (future). Fortunately, all markets are essentially comprised of human behavior; therefore, markets have memory. It’s this memory that comprises a basis for support and resistance zones. For example, large candle wicks (pricing trends representing the psychology of participating traders) can reflect emotional, exuberant and irrational human behavior which is exhibited either by buying beyond the sustainable market price, or by selling far below fair market value.\n\nNewer traders, including me back in 2013, often buy the parabolic, emotional, FEAR OF MISSING OUT highs, and then sell the lows, again out of fear. This is obviously the exact opposite of trying to “buy low and sell high.”\n\nLet’s paint some support (green) and resistance (red) on the current weekly chart. I’m using Brave New Coin’s $BLX index, which aggregates all bitcoin markets globally. Bitcoin is in a current state of upheaval because of fluctuations in the rankings of countries and exchanges with the highest trading volumes, the most liquidity, the optimal signals to follow and the highest probabilities of where price may go in the future. Aggregating all the data between the currencies and exchanges in one index means better signals and more realistic, fair-market prices.\n\nI’ve added zones of resistance (red) at the All-Time High (ATH) candle wicks from 2013. This is where one might expect selling, based on prior price history. Price is currently in this large zone of heavy resistance, so one would EXPECT large amounts of volatility and repeated attempts to, with steadily increasing momentum, break the previous ATH. This zone represents previous irrational exuberance where some buyers were inevitably trapped in a position. If those buyers have not already sold, many will be looking to sell bitcoin at break even.\n\n\n\nThe trend is your friend, right until the end. Luckily, bitcoin is currently in a multi-year bull trend as exhibited by this weekly chart. Don’t fight the trend! Meaning, you’ll make more money going long or buying than you will going short, or selling. Investors, those with a longer timeline, look for growth opportunities like this, ideally at the bottom of the trend; whereas traders, who are often in and out of a trade within hours, days or weeks, can find a way to make money in any market.\n\nYou’ll also notice a zone of support, which had previously been resistance, represented by the large candle wick in April 2013. Once this resistance broke convincingly in October 2013, bitcoin entered price discovery mode, searching for a new ATH in parabolic fashion. Once established, support was rechecked months later, which held, paving the way for the beginning of a new bull trend.\n\nThere is also a yellow line representing 50 percent of the entire distance between established support and resistance. This is a key zone which helps determine whether or not support or resistance will be tested. If price holds above or breaks 50 percent of the resistance and support zone, there is often a test of the resistance zone. If price holds below or breaks 50 percent of the resistance and support zone, there is often a test of the support zone. This is known as Dow Theory, which essentially states that any large price move will retrace 50 percent of the move and make a decision from there.\n\nHere are those same principles applied within the macro trend on the daily timeframe.\n\nWe can convincingly see that with each test of support, price has bounced higher and proceeded to break the previous local top, or resistance. This is exactly what to look for in an established trend. You’ll also notice that the 50 percent zone often gets rechecked as support. If previous resistance, turned support, fails to hold as support, then the entire trend is in jeopardy. Additionally, my revised Dow Theory holds true except in the case of January 2016 when support was not tested again for the second time.\n\n\n\nCurrently, price is attempting to reach for a previous local high, which also represents price near ATH. If/when ATH does break, the market reenters price discovery mode, which may or may not occur in a parabolic fashion, similar to 2013, albeit unlikely. Without getting too technical, there is confluence of resistance at ~$1800, which would be a definite take profit target as a trader. This can be determined by adding 50 percent above the current zone of resistance at ~$1200.\n\nEach move upward in the current trend has yielded a 50 percent move or greater.\n\n1. November 2015 - 57 percent move from previous resistance;\n\n2. June 2016 - 58 percent move from previous resistance;\n\n3. January 2017 - 51 percent move from previous resistance.\n\nAn interesting point of psychological resistance has been the USD price of gold, relative to bitcoin. In 2013, during the parabolic price discovery phase, the established high was ultimately slightly lower than the current price of gold ($XAUUSD) at the time.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/f672tulF/\n\nThis may have been just a coincidence until it happened a second time in January 2017. Whether or not bitcoin can truly become “digital gold” from a price perspective remains to be seen.\n\nCurrently, on the four-hour timeframe, there is no immediate resistance until the previous local top at $1173.\n\nWe can also predict that previous resistance of ~$1077 is now support, until proven otherwise. So should price pull back, this would be the immediate target.\n\nSummary\n\n1. All markets have memory and because of this, traders can use the past history of support and resistance to predict future support and resistance with a high probability.\n\n2. Bitcoin price is an ongoing multi-year bull trend. Price is leaning heavily bullish in the near, medium and far term with a realistic target of $1800 within the coming months and definitely within the next twelve months.\n\n3. The psychological barrier of the previous ATH, as well as gold parity, are two of the closest checkpoints before “price discovery” mode beyond previous ATH.\n\n4. If/When ATH does break, expect wild volatility. A large candle wick with high volume on the daily chart will signify the end of the near term trend. This is known as a “blow-off top.”\n\n5. After the blow-off top, expect a retest of previous resistance of ATH at $1176, which would then be support.', ""It’s hard being a criminal. Surveillance techniques and forensic science are constantly being improved and people are working full-time to destroy your livelihood. That’s why many criminals around the world probably celebrated when the cryptocurrency bitcoin was launched back in 2009.\n\nWith untraceable internet currency, crooks could finally enjoy the anonymity of cash without risking being caught red-handed out in the physical world. This beautifully idyllic criminal vision could have been the future, if it wasn’t for the damn meddling Danes.\n\nIt seems unlikely that bitcoin is the future of crime after Berlingske reported that the Danish police brought down drug traffickers by tracing bitcoin transactions.\n\nIn January this year, courts in the Danish city Herning, found the defendant in a narcotics case guilty and sentenced him to eight years of prison due to traced bitcoin transactions. This is the second case in Denmark where bitcoin-tracing evidence has played a major role in the trial.\n\nDenmark is leading the way\n\nKim Aarenstrup, the head of Denmark’s National Cybercrime Center (NC3), said in an interview with Berlingske that these two convictions prove that Denmark is currently leading the way in cyberpolicing and that this new technology is a major milestone for police work.\n\nWe are pretty much unique in the world at this moment, because nobody else has been able to use this type of trace as evidence before. Everybody is looking towards Denmark in this field, and we are in close dialog with several other countries at the moment, so that we can further develop the methods and teach them how we operate.\n\nThe new specialized IT-system, developed by Danish law enforcement agencies, is based on comparing the information of two different types of bitcoin transactions. First, transactions where bitcoins are used to purchase goods are analyzed by exploiting the possibilities of blockchain technology, which bitcoin is based on. This information is then compared with listings of bitcoin-buyers and bitcoin-sellers.\n\nThe comparison is then used to identify the people involved in particular dealings. Aarenstrup didn’t want to go into specifics of how far-reaching this new method is, but one can imagine that it must be substantial since the FBI and Europol are already using the system.\n\nChanged world for criminals\n\nJesper Klyve was the prosecutor in both cases where a bitcoin-trace was one of the main evidences. In his opinion there is nothing wrong with bitcoin as a currency and that people who use it are not automatically entangled in illegal activities, but that one cannot deny the fact that it makes illegal dealings easier.\n\nKlyve says that in the past, a person had to have the necessary contacts to buy drugs, but this has completely changed with the introduction of the dark web and bitcoin. Now almost anybody can go online and buy a kilo of amphetamine and pay for it with a cryptocurrency. However, this might all change due to police’s new bitcoin-tool and Klyve is optimistic that it will provide interesting possibilities.\n\nIt is common that drug deals made on the dark web are sent by regular mail — like in the first case bitcoin-tracing was employed in Denmark — which can make it considerably harder for the police to bust criminals. But Klyve is certain that this new technology will completely change that. Now, if a suspect receives drugs by post — which he denies he ordered — the police can go over his bitcoin transaction history and see whether he has sent bitcoins to anyone recently.\n\n“All transfers that have ever been made are coded into the bitcoin-system. Therefore, you can at any given time log in and search in the system and try to identify individual users,” said Klyve in an interview with Berlingske.\n\nIt has been pointed out before that bitcoin is probably less beneficial to criminals than originally thought, but the two verdicts in Denmark are a clear indicator that cyberspace isn’t safe from the long arm of the law. Perhaps, it is finally time for criminals to find a new livelihood.\n\nDansk gennembrud: Narkohandlere kan ikke længere gemme sig bag bitcoins on Berlingske\n\nRead next: iPhone 8 might pack 'revolutionary' front camera that snaps 3D selfies"", 'BITCOIN\n\nTaking cues from the Philippines and China, the government of the United Arab Emirates says it is considering forming a regulatory framework that will focus on the usability of bitcoin and operations of digital currency exchanges.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, the Central Bank of UAE published a document, the “Regulatory Framework for Stored Values and Electronic Payment System,” containing its “vision of leading market adoption” of digital payments and fintech technologies within the country. One section of the document explicitly prohibits the use of virtual currencies, which, of course, resulted in controversial discussions and companies asking the central bank if the bill considers bitcoin and other digital currencies currently in existence.\n\nCentral Bank Governor Mubarak Rashed Khamis Al Mansouri confirmed that the document doesn’t consider digital currencies, but he stressed that the central is carefully considering legalizing bitcoin as well as “developing necessary regulatory frameworks for businesses and exchanges to comply with.”\n\nThe legality of bitcoin in UAE is a case similar to that of the Philippines, before the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) recognized the digital currency as a remittance network and legitimate payment method. And the Central Bank of UAE releasing a nationwide regulatory framework on bitcoin will be an approach similar to that of China, which recently started regulating the digital currency to ensure that traders remain in the exchange market.\n\nThe Central Bank of UAE may take cues from researchers from the Bank of Canada, who recently said digital currencies like bitcoin need government intervention for it to grow.\n\nIn their report, Canadian Bank Notes and Dominion Notes: Lessons for Digital Currencies, the researchers pointed out the similarities between digital currencies and private bank as well as government-issued bank notes, which means that digital currencies can draw from the experience on how to function.\n\n“We conclude that well designed and managed private digital currencies could circulate widely but only with appropriate government regulation to ensure their safety, soundness, and uniformity,” the researchers said.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin hit $1,099 price point during early Tuesday morning’s trading.\n\nComments', 'Blockchain Capital, one of the most prolific investment companies in the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem, has hired Spencer Bogart to take over as managing director and head of research. Bogart was previously employed at Wall Street firm Needham & Company, where he focused his research and analysis on bitcoin as a digital asset.\n\n\n\nWho is Spencer Bogart?\n\nBogart is perhaps best known in the Bitcoin community as the author behind Needham & Company’s various reports on Bitcoin and blockchain technology. While most Wall Street analysts are lambasted by bitcoin believers due to their misunderstandings of the digital asset, Bogart’s knowledge of the technology has won him general praise from much of the community.\n\n“We are excited to hire Spencer Bogart as managing director and head of research at Blockchain Capital,” Bart Stephens, a managing partner at the venture capital firm, told Bitcoin Magazine. “Spencer is the most respected and widely followed Wall Street research analyst to cover blockchain technology and Bitcoin. His industry research report on the blockchain, as a technology, was a seminal piece of research and is a reference point for hedge fund managers, other venture capitalists and sophisticated investors around the globe.”\n\nIn addition to his report on blockchain technology, Bogart has also released notes and reports on the future price of bitcoin and the prospects of approval for a potential bitcoin ETF.\n\nBogart’s New Role at Blockchain Capital\n\nAccording to Stephens, Bogart will continue to release public reports and other writings as part of his role at Blockchain Capital.\n\n“Spencer has a talent for deep due diligence in a nascent industry — blockchain technology,” said Stephens. “He has excellent company contacts and will be a valuable member of the Blockchain Capital investment team. Blockchain Capital will be publishing industry research reports, white papers and blog posts detailing our nuanced views on the industry.”\n\nBogart will also be working closely with Jeremy Gardner, who is best known for his work on the Augur project.\n\n“My job, in addition to being an EIR [entrepreneur-in-residence] at the firm, is as a sort of ‘blockchain mercenary,’ working closely with entrepreneurs, researchers and executives across industries,” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine. “As a result, I have been able to gain insights that Spencer will be able to infuse into his analysis.”\n\nAccording to Bogart, he will be focusing more on early stage Bitcoin companies than he has in the past, but he will also continue his research on bitcoin as an asset.\n\nBogart on the Importance of Bitcoin as an Asset\n\nWhile many Wall Street firms have been looking at the technology behind Bitcoin rather than the digital asset itself, Bogart views the bitcoin token as having a significant role in the ecosystem.\n\n“I think the role and significance of bitcoin the asset is wildly underappreciated within the broader blockchain industry,” he told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\n“This entire industry is still relatively early in its development and at this point I think the major opportunity in the space is around owning bitcoin the asset and funding the companies that are bringing this industry to fruition,” Bogart added.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Local publications including the Shanghai Observer reported that the PBoC told the two exchanges they were in violation of local regulations and failed to meet industry-wide standards.\n\nThree weeks after the PBoC made its initial request to Huobi and OKCoin for a KYC and AML system upgrade, OKCoin and Huobi officially suspended Bitcoin and Litecoin withdrawals for one month. Depending on the upgrade, the two exchanges stated that the suspension could either be cleared before the one month period or could potentially last longer than the original one-month timeline.\n\nOn Feb. 9, when Huobi and OKCoin released their official statements, Bitcoin price plunged overnight from $1,054 to $988. While the Chinese market showed resilience to the PBoC-OKCoin and Huobi controversy at first, the US market and its leading exchange such as Bitfinex and Kraken began to demonstrate the rapid resurgence of panic sellers and traders.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin price has continued to recover and is very close to reaching its all-time high price. Bitcoin has already surpassed this year’s all-time high price established in late January. Although the Bitcoin price recovery can be attributed to the exponential growth of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market, Cointelegraph revealed that peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading has been on the rise.\n\nAlmost immediately after withdrawals on Huobi and OKCoin were disabled, LocalBitcoins China trading volumes began to surge, surpassing all-time high trading values at $5.8 mln weekly trading volume.\n\nToday, Bitcoin price officially hit its third highest weighted average price, surpassing this year’s peak.

The market, however, seems to disagree.\n\nPrivate? Really?\n\nTo begin with, researchers at the Bank of Canada made a fundamental error in studying and evaluating Bitcoin if they considered Bitcoin as a “private digital currency.” The Bitcoin network is an open peer-to-peer protocol where there is no central authority or governing entity. Looking at Bitcoin as a centralized and private network is a severely flawed technical perspective.\n\nUnlike actual “private digital currencies” like Blockchain tokens being developed by leading banks and financial institutions, the Bitcoin network is maintained by miners across the globe who contribute computing power to verify transactions and developers within an open source development ecosystem wherein anyone can contribute to the development of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t need regulation\n\nBitcoin doesn’t need regulation to survive or prosper. Central authorities including the Chinese government chose to regulate Bitcoin because they prefer to oversee the Bitcoin market rather than having it operate in underground markets that are significantly more difficult to regulate.\n\nCompanies operating within the Bitcoin industry such as Bitcoin exchanges, service providers and development firms are struggling to deal with inefficient and impractical regulations specifically in regions such as New York that require startups to obtain an expensive license to operate.\n\nKnow your customer and Anti-money laundering policies are also impractical for Bitcoin exchanges to comply with, as exchanges are pressured to transform their infrastructures into a centralized architecture in order to meet the demands of central authorities.\n\nIn China, when the People’s Bank of China halted withdrawals of OKCoin and Huobi users, two of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the country, the majority of traders moved on to LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer trading platform wherein people directly trade Bitcoin without the presence of a third party service provider or mediator.\n\nProject Jasper\n\nResearchers at the Bank of Canada are likely describing Bitcoin as a “private digital currency” as they are developing on an altcoin of their own called Project Jasper.\n\nDevelopers of Jasper want to offer an impression to the general public that centralized Blockchain networks like Project Jasper demonstrate virtually no differences to decentralized networks like Bitcoin. However, the global Bitcoin market has already evolved to a point where most users and people have developed an awareness of Bitcoin as a decentralized currency and open network.\n\nA part of the white paper released by the Bank of Canada read:\n\n“Government issued digital currency will not drive out existing private digital currencies, and government intervention will be required for privately issued and government-issued digital currencies to be a uniform currency.”\n\nAlready, Blockchain consortia including R3 have given up on developing centralized Blockchain platforms and networks due to serious security issues and potential compromisations.

The global summit will help bring together various stakeholders including government, regulators, exchanges and investors. It is notable that this summit comes at a time when in the first week of February the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India’s central bank, issued a fresh warning to investors about dealing with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFuture of Bitcoin in India\n\nAfter the demonetization of 86 percent of the Indian currency in circulation, announced on Nov. 8, 2016, there has been a rising interest in Bitcoin in India. This has raised a question about regulation and laws surrounding Bitcoin, considering it is still operating in a legal vacuum.\n\nWe talked with Santosh Parashar, joint director and Head-Corporate Affairs and Capital Market Division of ASSOCHAM, about the future of Bitcoin. He says:\n\n“The future of Bitcoin/cryptocurrency in India is expected to gain momentum. We, at ASSOCHAM, prompted to hold the first global summit by any business chamber in India, given the aftermath of the demonetization drive in India when Bitcoin’s exchange rate rose above $1000 and also the corporate and banking sector in India had never before focused on the use of the Blockchain technology.”\n\nBitcoin getting a bad rap\n\nThe demonetization drive in India brought black money into focus and the demonetization was being pitched as a crusade against tax evasion and other such financial vices. During the course of the demonetization, the rising prices of Bitcoin in India led to many in the media covering the cryptocurrency in a negative light.\n\nThe focus was predominantly on tax evaders using Bitcoin to move their ill-gotten wealth out of the country. Efforts like the global summit being organized by ASSOCHAM can lead to a wider and more accurate understanding of what Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are in India.\n\nThe participation of government and central bank regulators can be a big positive in this regard. Regarding the negative press, Santosh says:\n\n“The recent negative press surrounding Bitcoin might have distressed the newly joined wallet users but this does not seem to have affected those who have enjoyed the high return in recent past.”\n\nHe adds: “Keeping in mind the dire need of clarity of thoughts on Bitcoin, Blockchain and the associated risks as well as for the advancement of know-how on innovations happening in Blockchain technology amongst the stakeholders, including government, regulators and investors in the country, the Department of Corporate Affairs, ASSOCHAM is organizing a Global Summit on Bitcoin & Blockchain, The State of Cryptocurrency - Opportunities and Challenges for Indian Economy, on March 3, 2017 in New Delhi, India.”\n\nWe were also informed that there are also plans for further summits in Mumbai and Bangalore.\n\nNo more fearing the unknown\n\nASSOCHAM and other such organizations have an important role to play as they have the ability to suggest policy papers to the government of India and regulators. Kumar Gaurav, chairman of Auxesis Group, who is also due to speak at the global summit, says:\n\n“The biggest concern is fear of the unknown, and like many other developing countries, India also does not have a clearance on cryptocurrencies and is working on it. Lack of experts and researchers who can advise the government correctly is making the situation worse.”\n\nThis lack of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Kumar adds: “As innovators and early adopters, it\'s our responsibility to do it and use these technologies in a way that they can do more good rather than cause damage to society. To start with, there are plenty of well-researched publications and reports on cryptocurrency by reputable organizations such as the ECB’s report on “virtual currency schemes” in 2012 and 2015. Also, we have to start separating the fact and myths as soon as possible to differentiate between scam coins and Bitcoin. A few days ago, the Bank of Uganda counted all of them in the same category which shows their negligence in understanding cryptocurrencies.”\n\nRegulatory framework\n\nOne of the primary issues in India and the one that the Reserve Bank has been constantly talking about is the safety and security of investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Not only are the safety of investments an issue but there are other concerns as well.\n\nThe global summit will focus on security and data in the Blockchain and discuss topics like unauthorized spending, double spending, race attack, history modification, deanonymization of clients among other topics.\n\nAnother potential upside to this summit is possible clarity on regulations in India surrounding Bitcoin. Santosh reveals:\n\n“The summit is also expected to bring out relevant suggestions and recommendations for draft policy and guidelines, which may facilitate even to the regulators to address the issues in the light of comments received, coming out of complex issues and a plethora of information on the subject.”\n\nIs Bitcoin’s official status going to change in India?\n\nWill Bitcoin gain some kind of official foothold in India?\n\nKumar Gaurav says pragmatically: “Bitcoin and VCS came into government attention very recently. The RBI and Indian Government are trying to understand it better and weigh its implication before it comes with any legislative clarity. Meanwhile, the RBI has not banned or taken any harsh action against Bitcoin but has only issued a warning which is related to consumer protection. I can share some more insights on it after my planned visit to New Delhi to meet with Indian regulators.”', 'Your first step to building a free, personalized, morning email brief covering pertinent authors and topics on JD Supra:\n\nSign up using *\n\nAlready signed up?

02/23/2017,"['CLOSE A motion graphic explains what Bitcoin is and how Bitcoin works. Keith Carter and Ashley M. Williams, USA TODAY Network\n\nEditor\'s note: The pricing in this story is from Feb. 23. Bitcoin prices have since risen to $1,293.35 on Coindesk.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — What\'s backed by no government, created by a mysterious, unknown inventor and reached an all-time high Thursday? If you said the cryptocurrency bitcoin, you\'re clearly in the know.\n\nBitcoin, launched in 2009, is decentralized digital currency that is traded from person-to-person, rather than through banks, and has no issuing or regulating country.\n\nOn Thursday it hit an all-time high of $1,163.59 according to CoinDesk.com, which tracks bitcoin prices. The previous high was $1,129.86, touched on January 4.\n\nA couple of factors seem to be pushing the digital currency upwards.\n\nThe confirmation of Mike Mulvaney as director of the federal Office of Management and Budget last week helped, as Mulvaney is a long-time supporter of bitcoin. He helped found the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. Blockchain is the technology that digital currencies such as bitcoin are based on.\n\nThere\'s also anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the first of three exchange-traded funds to launch. The deadline for approval for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF is March 11. If it goes through, the fund will create an easy way for investors to get a taste of bitcoins, without having to go through the trouble of buying them on the open market.\n\nLast month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz suggested the United States should just phase out paper money all together and move towards a digital economy using digital currencies to help end corruption and tax evasion.\n\n""Countries like the United States could and should move to a digital currency,” he said, “so that you would have the ability to trace this kind of corruption. There are important issues of privacy, cyber-security, but it would certainly have big advantages.”\n\nThe digital currency hit $1,163.00 in November of 2013.\n\nBitcoin prices hit a record high Thursday.

That’s taking it a step closer to becoming one of the first major central banks to issue digital money that can be used for anything from buying noodles to purchasing a car.\n\nFor users transacting over their smartphones or laptops, a PBOC-backed cryptocurrency probably wouldn’t seem much different to existing payment methods such as Alipay or WeChat. But for sellers, they would get digital payments directly from the buyer, lowering transaction costs as the middleman is cut out of the process.\n\nAt the same time as it builds up its own capabilities, the PBOC is increasing scrutiny of bitcoin and other private digital tenders. It doesn’t want a bitcoin bubble to blow up. And since currencies have historically been issued by the state, not private players, it doesn’t want to cede the cryptocurrency space to companies it has no control over.\n\nChinese people have embraced online payments for just about everything. To buy a can of Coke, thirsty commuters scan QR codes on their smartphones rather than feed coins into a vending machine. At Lunar New Year gatherings, money is exchanged via a few presses on a smartphone instead of crisp notes handed over in red envelopes.\n\nAll of that poses a challenge to the PBOC’s status as the central bank of both the digital and physical realms. So if you can’t beat them, join them.\n\n""Getting to know more precisely how much banks lend, where the money goes and the pace of credit creation is key to curbing money laundering and making monetary policy more effective,"" said Duan Xinxing, vice president of Beijing-based OKCoin Co., one of the country’s biggest bitcoin exchanges. Issuing digital currency will make it easier for the PBOC to monitor risk in the financial system and track transactions economy-wide, he said.\n\nOKCoin is among cryptocurrency exchanges that has recently taken steps to halt bitcoin withdrawals amid efforts to clamp down on capital outflows.\n\nIn January 2016, the PBOC said it will have its own cryptocurrency ""soon,"" but there has still been no formal start date announced. In the meantime, there’s been strong advocacy from senior officials, including Fan Yifei, one of the PBOC’s deputy governors.\n\nPBOC makes the case for taking the lead on digital currencies\n\nIt’s not just China that’s heading away from cash. Late last year, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 86 percent of notes in tender in a bid to target corruption and push the use of digital payments. Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bundesbank and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are examining digital currencies.\n\nPrinting money and combating counterfeiters is expensive for a country of 1.4 billion people, especially the costs of managing circulation and transactions. Adding digital currency to cash in circulation can improve the speed, convenience and transparency of transactions.\n\n""Cutting costs is an obvious benefit, but the impact of shifting to blockchain-based digital money from the current payment structure goes beyond that,"" said Larry Cao, director of content at the CFA Institute in Hong Kong. ""There’s a potential you can pay anybody in the system, any bank, and any merchant directly. Blockchain will change the whole infrastructure. This is revolutionary.""\n\nBlockchain is basically a digital ledger that contains the payment history of each circulation of the unit. If the PBOC’s version is widely adopted, that would challenge existing intermediaries such as banks and payment services like Alibaba affiliate Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat -- two leading online payment networks.\n\n""I won’t say banks and payment companies will disappear, but their role would definitely change,"" said William Gee, a risk assurance practice partner at PwC China in Beijing. ""They need to find their new role in the new payment ecosystem, and we will probably see some innovative business model in this sector.""\n\nReal-time data\n\nFor the PBOC, using blockchain, the technology that underpins the digital currency bitcoin, will allow it to trace transactions and collect ""real-time, complete and authentic"" data to compile precise monetary indicators such as money supply growth, OKCoin’s Duan said.\n\n""The transparency of economic activities in every corner in the country will significantly improve,"" Duan said. ""The central bank will have unprecedented knowledge of how the economy runs.""\n\nSo instead of relying on monthly surveys of businesses, or collations of spending from the statistics authority, the PBOC and therefore the government would have real-time readings on the pulse of consumers. Policies could then be fine tuned on a day-to-day, even hour-to-hour basis, giving an unprecedented level of precision to monetary management.\n\nA PBOC research paper last year outlined how digital money could work:\n\nThe PBOC creates cryptocurrency and transfers it to commercial banks when more liquidity is needed\n\nConsumers would top up digital currency from modified automated teller machines or from bank tellers and store it in a crypto wallet on their mobile phone or other device\n\nFor purchases, consumers wire from their person wallet to the merchant’s account\n\nThe merchant deposits the cryptocurrency into their commercial bank account\n\nThe cryptocurrency would be part of the overall money supply, replacing part of the outstanding paper tender, a separate paper published in the central bank’s magazine said in September.\n\n""Talking about the impact of digital money now is like trying to predict how the Internet would transform lives in the 1980s,"" OKCoin’s Duan said. ""We know it’s going to be huge. It has the potential to change the entire economic infrastructure. We’re just not sure about when and how.""\n\n— With assistance by Yinan Zhao, and Lulu Yilun Chen', 'Bitcoin was never really anonymous, and it seems the Danish police have caught on to that fact. According to reports by Danish newspaper Berlingske, law enforcement in the Scandinavian country has figured out how to apply blockchain analysis to hunt down and prosecute darknet market vendors.\n\n\n\n""The perspective is groundbreaking,"" Kim Aarenstrup, head of the National Cyber Crime Centre (NC3) of the Danish National Police, told Berlingske. ""Where the investigation previously hit a dead end, we can now proceed.""\n\nBlockchain Analysis\n\nBitcoin has been presented as an anonymous digital currency for a long time. But this is not really accurate. While payments are not made to real-world identities, they are made to Bitcoin addresses that are publicly available on the blockchain. If such an address can be tied to a real-world identity, all anonymity is lost. That\'s why some refer to Bitcoin as ""pseudonymous"" rather than anonymous.\n\nBy applying blockchain analysis and combining this with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies by bitcoin exchanges, Danish police are able to track down darknet market users.\n\n""We are pretty much unique in the world at this point because no one else has managed to use these tracks as evidence,"" Aarenstrup told Berlingske. ""Everyone is looking toward Denmark in this field, and we are in close dialogue with a number of other countries right now so we can further develop methods and teach them how we do it here.""\n\nMore specifically, it seems the Danish police are using blockchain analysis to close a sort of legal loophole utilized by users of darknet markets like AlphaBay and Silk Road . Contraband - often illegal drugs - are typically shipped to the home addresses of darknet customers. But if the package is intercepted by the police, the buyer can simply deny having ordered anything.\n\nNow, NC3 claims to have developed special software that applies blockchain analysis to prove that the delivery address matches a specific Bitcoin transaction. This has led to two convictions over the past few months.\n\nCybercrime\n\nIn part due to its perceived anonymity, Bitcoin has grown to be a wildly popular payment method for cybercriminals. In a report published last year, Europol - the law enforcement agency of the European Union - said more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends are made with bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking to Berlingske, Aarenstrup acknowledged that the ease of use of bitcoin is a growing concern:\n\n""Bitcoin - and virtual currency in general - is widely used in the trafficking of weapons and drugs, and in ransomware and extortion cases. It is used a lot by criminals.""\n\nUnsurprisingly, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a central point of focus for cybercrime units worldwide. Only last month, a joint initiative of Europol, Interpol (the intergovernmental organization facilitating international police cooperation) and the Basel Institute on Governance (an independent not-for-profit competence center specializing in financial crime) indicated that they would up the efforts to counter bitcoin money laundering.\n\nAnd Danish authorities have been paying attention to the digital currency for some time now as well. A 2015 strategic analysis report by the Danish National Police mentioned bitcoin as a key focal point to counter cybercrime.\n\nThe success of the new Danish tracking method appears to have already been embraced by international organizations: both the FBI and Europol are already using the system, according to Berlingske.\n\n""I would just say to those out there in the criminal community that they need to be careful because we can follow them. They should not think they can hide from the police anymore,"" Aarenstrup concluded.', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur.

FPPS works by calculating a standard transaction fee within a certain period of time, adding it into the current bitcoin block reward of 12.5 BTC. This reward is then distributed to miners according to traditional Pay Per Share (PPS) model.\n\nThe new FPPS method includes both the advantages of traditional PPS and a significant additional boost in earnings by the inclusion of bitcoin transaction fees. This new FPPS settlement mode can increase BTC.com pool’s miner's earnings with amounts varying by the amount of transaction fees included in a block.\n\n“We are dedicated to providing the simplest, most efficient and convenient settlement mode for miners, to benefit and serve them as much as we can” noted BTC.com’s Director Mr. Kevin Pan. “FPPS is a superior settlement mode to what is currently being offered in the market” added Mr. Chris Zhu, BTC.com’s Senior Product Manager. “Essentially it is sharing the transaction fees included in the block with miners, providing them with more revenue in a stable way. We hope more pools will follow our example in putting the miner’s interest first.”\n\nMiners participating in BTC.com’s mining pool do not need any extra configuration to activate the new FPPS mode, and all accounts will automatically be upgraded to FPPS to begin benefiting from the additional profit. Miners not currently part of BTC.com can easily join by creating an account at https://pool.btc.com.\n\nBTC.com’s mining pool aims, through continuous innovation and increasing standards, to further reduce the threshold of entry into the Bitcoin mining industry, and to promote decentralization. Alongside the newly created FPPS mode, BTC.com pool also provides fully open-source codebase for Bitcoin mining pools to use, multi-node deployment, a high-speed broadcast network, BTC smart agent and BTC pool mobile app.\n\nBTC.com is a fast-growing and world's leading universal provider of Bitcoin data, mining pool and secure multi-platform Bitcoin wallet.

In contrast, there is no or very low fee for large transactions. So, the current system is loaded in favour of the rich,"" he added.\n\nSaurabh Agrawal added: “It is absolutely important to check the \'bad\' use of CC. Industry has to play an important role in shaping the future of CC and blockchain. Almost no country including India has declared Bitcoins or CCs as per se illegal. And therefore we (DABFI) believe that it is our responsibility to self-regulate itself strictly to check any \'bad\' use of the new system, work with the regulatory authorities and create awareness about the benefits of CC.”\n\n\n\n""Bitcoins and virtual currencies, just like any other cash, are known to be also used for illicit purposes.

DABFI would also warn ordinary people who do not understand the digital currency market not to be lured into \u200etrading Bitcoin as is volatile.""', 'CoinScope, a tool that provides aggregated data about bitcoin nodes, has been made open source.\n\nThe code was made publicly available on GitHub on 22nd February. The project, which has been around since 2015, is somewhat akin to Bitnodes, the node data tool operated by startup 21 Inc that seeks to map the bitcoin network by measuring the amount of nodes connected at any given time.\n\nAs detailed in a 2015 presentation by developer Andrew Miller at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Montreal, the tool\'s aim isn\'t to reduce the anonymity of nodes on the network. Rather, according to Miller, CoinScope\'s purpose is to provide a vehicle to assess the health of the network itself.\n\nThe white paper drafted in connection with CoinScope describes how one using the tool can see the bitcoin network in a new way by uncovering relationships between nodes and mining pools – a process that yields intriguing data points about the network\'s composition.\n\nThe paper notes:\n\n""We introduce a ""decloaking"" method to find influential nodes in the topology that are well connected to a mining pool. Our results find that in contrast to bitcoin\'s idealized vision of spreading mining responsibility to each node, mining pools are prevalent and hidden: roughly 2% of the (influential) nodes represent three-quarters of the mining power.""\n\nThe main technological aspect that makes the decloaking possible through the CoinScope tool is an element dubbed AddressNode.

At the start of the week, we noted that we hoped price would continue to run as the week matured, and that if it did, we would be ready to get in and out of the markets as and when we broke the 1000 level. This break happened, and brought 1100 into play. We highlighted the latter as a key level to watch overnight, and – as the Asian session kicked off this morning – 1100 broke, and has given us plenty to go at in the process for today’s European session.\n\nWe can open our range out a little bit this morning, and look for some degree of sustained momentum to carry things higher in the bitcoin price as price action plays out.

A stop loss on the trade at 1110 will ensure that we are taken out of the position in the event of a bias reversal.\n\nConversely, a close below support will signal short towards 1090.

Read more...\n\nBlockchain technology was introduced to the world by the popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Since then, various altcoin and blockchain platforms have cropped up claiming to solve a range of problems. These platforms have met limited success until now. However, when it comes to the use and application of the blockchain technology, Bitcoin still leads the way by working as advertised.\n\nThe success of Bitcoin as a blockchain asset was reiterated by Nikita Smirnov, the vice president of Vnesheconombank – a Russian state-run banking institution. Smirnov’s comments, made at the business brunch event “Blockchain for the Banking Sector” organized by the Kommersant was picked up by Russian media and cryptocurrency news publications.\n\nNikita Smirnov used a unique analogy while explaining the influence of Bitcoin on the world. He compared the relationship between Bitcoin and the society to the symbiotic relationship that exists between humans and bacteria. He was quoted in the media saying,\n\n“Bitcoin is the world’s only blockchain technology that is being widely used. It has existed for several years, and even though there have been attempts to break [hack] it, it has resisted them and sustained. If we ask whether any other algorithm has established the kind of reliability of distributed consensus as Bitcoin, then the answer is probably no. If we consider the current scenario, then the only really successful blockchain is Bitcoin.”\n\nSmirnov’s comments come at the time when R3, the fintech company leading the global banking consortium for blockchain technology is receiving flak for mentioning the possibly of moving away from distributed ledger technology. Unlike custom private and permissioned blockchains currently under development, Bitcoin blockchain offers better levels of security and stability. The strength of the community and the total hashing power of the network also plays a significant role in making Bitcoin blockchain better than its other counterparts.\n\nThe Russian banking and financial industry are also actively involved in the research and development of blockchain technology for banking applications. The country’s institutions have come together to set up their own version of blockchain consortium working in close collaboration with the central bank and payments body.\n\nIn the past week, the head of Sberbank predicted the rise of blockchain technology in the next 2-3 years. At the current rate of development, the distributed ledger technology will have a significant footprint in the global economy.\n\nRef: RNS | Image: Shutterstock', ""Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world, according to Pew Research Center, there are about 1.6 bln Muslims in the world and they make up roughly 23 percent of the world’s population.\n\nThe majority of the world’s Muslims live in Asia Pacific in countries like Indonesia and India even though traditionally areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa are traditionally associated with Islam.\n\nFintech according to Sharia\n\nThere are unique needs of Muslims when it comes to banking and finance.\n\nThe Islamic Canonical Law, popularly known as Sharia is based on the teachings of the Quran and prohibits certain activities such as acceptance of specific interest which is considered usury (Riba) or investments in businesses which are contrary to Islamic acceptance for example alcohol.\n\nRecent interest in Islamic banking has risen with even the International Monetary Fund’s executive board holding the first ever discussion on Islamic Banking.\n\nFintech and developments around Blockchain have been taking the world by the storm. The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and developments in Blockchain have also touched the Islamic world.\n\nIn fact, the UAE has already got a Bitcoin exchange by the name of BitOasis and they also offer services like a Bitcoin Wallet. BitOasis also offers services in Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. There are also services in the APAC region like Bitcoin Indonesia and Coinbox in Malaysia that offer Bitcoin-related services.\n\nWhat does Islam think about Bitcoin\n\nAccording to the paper “Bitcoin in Islamic Banking and Finance” by Charles W. Evans,\n\n“The relationship between a distributed, autonomous Blockchain management systems (BMS) like Bitcoin—also referred to as a 'virtual currency'—and Islamic Banking and Finance (IBF). It shows that a BMS can conform with the prohibition of riba (usury)—as Bitcoin does—and incorporate the principles of maslaha (social benefits of positive externalities) and mutual risk-sharing (as opposed to risk-shifting). With regard to maslaha, the world's unbanked number in the billions and represent the majority of the world's adults.”\n\nIs Bitcoin Halal? Yes but modern currencies are not\n\nIn order to deeply understand this topic, we talked with Matthew J. Martin of Blossom Finance, a fintech startup based in Indonesia.\n\nBlossom Finance offers microfinance services that help entrepreneurs and small businesses. Matthew is a Muslim American based out of Indonesia and has worked with fintech startups like Boku and Xoom in the past. He told us that Bitcoin can be considered both a currency and a payment network and this distinction is important because the Sharia principles that apply vary.\n\nMatthew explains,\n\n“As a payment network, Bitcoin is halal. In fact, Bitcoin goes beyond what more conventional closed banking networks offer. Unlike conventional bank networks which use private ledgers where there's no guarantee that the originator actually owns the underlying assets, Bitcoin guarantees with mathematical certainty that the originator of the transfer owns the underlying assets. Conventional banks operate using the principle of fractional reserve, which is prohibited in Islam.”\n\nWhat is more Bitcoin may be more Halal than modern fiat money. Matthew puts it quite clearly as he remarks, “Bitcoin is more halal than any currency in wide circulation today but probably still falls short of the strict and narrow definition of money in Islam. Modern sovereign currencies are based on debt with usury - this is strictly prohibited in Islam. Therefore, all modern money is not halal. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not based on debt - it's based on a proof of work - and this is at least not haram (impermissible).”\n\nBitcoin’s new stability works in its favor\n\nIn understanding how Sharia looks at money, we are told by Matthew that there is a concept of Gharar (uncertainty) and contracts shouldn’t be unnecessarily uncertain. While Bitcoin was rather volatile in the past, there is stability now seen in Bitcoin over the last few years.\n\nThere are also possibilities in Islamic Banking that may work in favor of Bitcoin as well. In the case of Bitcoin, there are two benefits that are clearly visible.\n\nIf Bitcoin is indeed more halal and fiat currencies are haram due to the way they originate, then creating settlement systems in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could make a great deal of sense.\n\nThen there is also the case of microfinance, a field in which Matthew’s company works. He thinks here the possibilities are more realistic,\n\n“I think the immediate opportunities lie in micro - microfinance and micro-takeful, for example. I also see huge potential in the use of smart contracts for cross-border crowdfunding and also Islamic modes of financing, such as mudaraba/musharakah (profit sharing) and muraba. I think there's also an interesting angle for micro-takeful (sharia-compliant insurance) to use crypto.”\n\nMay Bitcoin be considered money according to Islam?\n\nAn interesting question is whether Bitcoin is money according to Islam.\n\nIslam supports intrinsic commodities that can be used as currency. Paper or electronic money can also be used but they should be backed by an intrinsic commodity. So is Bitcoin money then? Matthew says No,""]"

Japanese Bitcoin trading platforms facilitated trades at $1,230 per Bitcoin at its peak today, with a $10 premium.\n\nIndian Bitcoin exchanges including Zebpay revealed that Bitcoin price surpassed the previous all-time high trading margin set in India. Zebpay noted that at today’s peak, Bitcoin was traded at 84,756 Indian rupees, or $1,271, four percent higher than the global average Bitcoin price.\n\nIn the short run, Bitcoin price will most likely demonstrate an increasing trend due to extensive mainstream media coverage and rising number of panic buyers purchasing Bitcoin to avoid economic uncertainty. With the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market and its leading exchange BitFlyer presenting itself as a regulated global Bitcoin powerhouse, analysts expect Bitcoin price to continue its rising trend.\n\nDennis Davitt, the portfolio manager at Harvest Volatility Management, noted in an interview with CNBC that the era of governments attempting to demonstrate their authority over Bitcoin is nearly over, as people are beginning to understand the decentralized nature and safe haven asset like characteristics of Bitcoin.', 'News\n\nPhoto via Michael Wuensch & LoggaWiggler\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $1,172.09. Traders are happy because the SEC is expected to rule on a Bitcoin ETF by March 11. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports China Is Developing its Own Digital Currency.\n\nAfter assembling a research team in 2014, the People’s Bank of China has done trial runs of its prototype cryptocurrency. That’s taking it a step closer to becoming one of the first major central banks to issue digital money that can be used for anything from buying noodles to purchasing a car.\n\nAt the same time as it builds up its own capabilities, the PBOC is increasing scrutiny of bitcoin and other private digital tenders. It doesn’t want a bitcoin bubble to blow up. And since currencies have historically been issued by the state, not private players, it doesn’t want to cede the cryptocurrency space to companies it has no control over.\n\nChinese people have embraced online payments for just about everything. To buy a can of Coke, thirsty commuters scan QR codes on their smartphones rather than feed coins into a vending machine. At Lunar New Year gatherings, money is exchanged via a few presses on a smartphone instead of crisp notes handed over in red envelopes.\n\nAll of that poses a challenge to the PBOC’s status as the central bank of both the digital and physical realms. So if you can’t beat them, join them.\n\n“Getting to know more precisely how much banks lend, where the money goes and the pace of credit creation is key to curbing money laundering and making monetary policy more effective,” said Duan Xinxing, vice president of Beijing-based OKCoin Co., one of the country’s biggest bitcoin exchanges. Issuing digital currency will make it easier for the PBOC to monitor risk in the financial system and track transactions economy-wide, he said.\n\nOKCoin is among cryptocurrency exchanges that has recently taken steps to halt bitcoin withdrawals amid efforts to clamp down on capital outflows.\n\nIn January 2016, the PBOC said it will have its own cryptocurrency “soon,” but there has still been no formal start date announced. In the meantime, there’s been strong advocacy from senior officials, including Fan Yifei, one of the PBOC’s deputy governors.\n\n“Cutting costs is an obvious benefit, but the impact of shifting to blockchain-based digital money from the current payment structure goes beyond that,” said Larry Cao, director of content at the CFA Institute in Hong Kong. “There’s a potential you can pay anybody in the system, any bank, and any merchant directly. Blockchain will change the whole infrastructure. This is revolutionary.”\n\nReal-time data\n\nFor the PBOC, using blockchain, the technology that underpins the digital currency bitcoin, will allow it to trace transactions and collect “real-time, complete and authentic” data to compile precise monetary indicators such as money supply growth, OKCoin’s Duan said.\n\n“The transparency of economic activities in every corner in the country will significantly improve,” Duan said. “The central bank will have unprecedented knowledge of how the economy runs.”\n\nSo instead of relying on monthly surveys of businesses, or collations of spending from the statistics authority, the PBOC and therefore the government would have real-time readings on the pulse of consumers. Policies could then be fine tuned on a day-to-day, even hour-to-hour basis, giving an unprecedented level of precision to monetary management.\n\nCapital Flight\n\nBitcoin is a primary means of capital flight out of China. How long will that last?\n\nHere’s one key thought on bitcoin from the article: “OKCoin is among cryptocurrency exchanges that has recently taken steps to halt bitcoin withdrawals amid efforts to clamp down on capital outflows.”\n\nWhen China launches its own cryptocurrency, will it ban Bitcoin transactions?\n\nIf so, what happens to the price of Bitcoin?\n\nContrary Indicators\n\nThe launch of a Bitcoin ETF reminds me of those waiting for the launch of JDSU Leap Options in 2000 so they could “load the boat”.\n\nDuring the 1990s, JDS Uniphase stock was a high-flyer tech stock investor favorite. Its stock price doubled three times and three stock splits of 2:1 occurred roughly every 90 days during the last half of 1999 through early 2000, making millionaires of many employees who were stock option holders, and further enabling JDS Uniphase to go on an acquisition and merger binge. After the telecom downturn, JDS Uniphase announced in late July 2001 the largest (up to then) write-down of goodwill. Employment soon dropped as part of the Global Realignment Program from nearly 29,000 to approximately 5,300, many of its factories and facilities were closed around the world, and the stock price dropped from $153 per share to less than $2 per share.\n\nBlockchain Technology\n\nI like the blockchain technology behind digital currencies like Bitcoin. Blockchain is perfectly suited for recording mortgages, deeds, autos, etc.\n\nTitle insurance companies will cease to exist, at least as stand alone title companies.\n\nScalability\n\nEvery transaction is recorded on the blockchain so the requirement of resources to process and store the information continually grows.\n\nThis poses a scalability issue for high volume transactions. Recording every payment would certainly constitute high volume.\n\nScalability Articles\n\nIf blockchain can scale to the point where governments can ban cash and record every transaction, expect instant tax collection and loss of privacy.\n\nDigital Downside\n\nThe government will know where every penny is at every second. The government will know every monetary transaction in real time. You will no longer be able to give the babysitter, gardener, bartender, a friend, or anyone else an extra penny without the government knowing. Sales tax collection and VAT tax collection will be instantaneous. Governments can impose negative interest rates and other confiscation schemes at will.\n\nIf cash is banned, the blockchain will record every penny you spend, and who you gave it to.\n\nMoney laundering will become much more difficult, but the cost will be a loss of privacy, threats of negative interest rates, and other cash confiscation schemes.\n\nDISCLOSURE: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors, and do not represent the views of equities.com.

Satoshi Nakamoto – a gifted programmer- is considered to be the main inventor of Bitcoin.\n\nDifference between Bitcoins & Paper Currencies\n\nThe main distinction between Bitcoin trading and paper currencies is that Bitcoin can be created (mined) with only a limited quantity. Whereas, paper currencies are usually printed by central banks in large quantity just to settle national debts and fiscal deficits etc. which consequently leads to widespread inflation and poverty.\n\nBitcoin History\n\nBitcoin saw many ups and downs during its brief history. In this article we will try to cover major Bitcoin crashes with the help of an infographic.\n\nThe history of Bitcoin dates back to January 3, 2009 when the blockchain was officially launched. On February 2011- for the first time in history, Bitcoin’s value achieved parity with American dollar. On June 19 2011, Bitcoin suffered a $3 nosedive within minutes, decreasing the price of cryptocurrency to less than $16 after Mt. Gox was hacked. A similar situation happened again on February 11, 2012 when the Bitcoin plunged by $2 to almost $4 after Paxum stopped accepting Bitcoin. Again on March 1 2012, Bitcoin fell sharply by $4.89 as 46000 Bitcoins were stolen in Linode hacking.\n\nOn August 17 2012, Bitcoin plunged $3 to less than $11 after Pirateat40 stopped accepting Bitcoin payments. Another crash happened on April 10 2013 when Bitcoin plunged $60 to just $122 as increased trading volume disrupted Mt. Gox servers. On August 30 2013, Bitcoin crashed $131 to $126 within minutes as Tradehill announced closure. Similarly on December 5 2013, Bitcoin nosedived $300 to $840 as China banned financial institutions from using Bitcoin. The history of Bitcoin is full of such crashes. You can go through all such crashes in our infographic.\n\nAfter so many hacking attempts and attacks on major Bitcoin exchanges, Bitcoin stakeholders have beefed up security of Bitcoin wallets due to which intensity of such incidents decreased noticeably lately.', 'The Bitcoin price could soon surpass gold’s on a permanent basis supposing they both continue with their current market performance.\n\nGold hit a three-month high of $1260 at the end of business day on Thursday, Feb. 23, as a steady flow of safe-haven demand from traders and investors continued worldwide while Bitcoin topped $1170 around the same time. Civic CEO Vinny Lingham, gives Bitcoin about a month or less to consolidateits price in the $1300 range.\n\nIt’s Trump, not China\n\nA report says ongoing uncertainty and some anxiety regarding the new US president and his administration’s new and potentially aggressive policies continue to support the gold market. Similarly, the latest rally in the Bitcoin market has been described by an analyst at Lux Research Inc., Mark Bünger, as likely unconnected to China but rather to some of the policies of US President Donald Trump.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Trump factor is pinned on the documents - minutes of the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 session of the Federal Open Market Committee - released on Wednesday that shows that the Federal Reserve could be giving a strong indication that another interest hike could come sooner due to some of the changes brought by the new administration.\n\nThat Bitcoin has been going more mainstream as additional companies have now been accepting it as a form of payment, according to equity strategist at Miller Tabak, Matt Maley, on CNBC\'s ""Trading Nation,"" will support its push to overtake gold.\n\nThe media hype trailing the all-time high record in the Bitcoin price has gone far and wide in the last few days. The noise is likely to reach even further than could be captured because a rise in the price of Bitcoin has been known to magnetize new users. Gold isn’t as new to court similar attention.\n\nETF factor, France uncertainty\n\nThere is a likelihood that the first Bitcoin exchange traded fund or ETF could be approved. When it does get the approval on March 11, Bitcoin has been tipped to gain value.\n\nAlso, Chinese Bitcoin exchanges which contribute significantly to the global trading of the currency have had some aspects of their operations restricted pending their upgrade of the KYC/AML system. A slight change in Bitcoin price is expected as soon as they resume full operation.\n\nGlobal political uncertainty particularly in the case of France’s far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, of the National Front Party, ahead of the coming presidential election is also key to determine if and when Bitcoin price will beat gold’s.', 'Sichuan, a province of China, is transforming into a global Bitcoin mining capital primarily due to its cheap electricity, low population density and cold climate.\n\nChina’s southwestern provinces, such as Sichuan, are seeing an exponential growth of Bitcoin mining facilities and centers as companies continue to search for mountainous regions with high altitude to cool down mining equipment without allocating additional resources.\n\nAccording to major local publications, including the China Money Network, more than 20 mining companies and 10,000 Bitcoin miners are located within Sichuan’s Mabian Yi Autonomous County, a cold and mountainous region with just over 215,000 residents and Kangding, a region within Sichuan well known for its natural beauty.\n\nDecreasing electricity costs\n\nOne of the major reasons behind the rapid growth of mining companies within the Sichuan province is the decreasing electricity costs, as mentioned by various respected Bitcoin experts including Andreas Antonopoulos and Chandler Guo in the past.\n\nIn an interview with Ether.Camp, Bitcoin miner and investor Chandler Guo revealed that electricity in China has become so cheap due to rising supply and decreasing demand that electricity companies are coming to local miners to purchase ASIC chips and mining equipment to allocate unconsumed electricity to Bitcoin mining\n\nFrom the perspective of electricity companies, it is an intelligent and resourceful method of profiting from a surplus of electricity, as they receive Bitcoin in return which is highly liquid especially within a market like China which operates a well developed and regulated Bitcoin exchange market.\n\nGuo stated:\n\n“Today, the energy companies are jumping on the Bitcoin mining business. Before that, we [miners] bought electricity from them [energy companies] to mine Bitcoin. Today, the seller who is selling electricity to us, they’re mining Bitcoin by themselves. [Energy companies] don’t sell electricity to us, they buy mining equipment from us. A lot of energy companies are becoming Bitcoin miners. Even small energy companies can buy at least 1 to 2 petahashes.”\n\nNoise cancellation\n\nAnother major issue which miners and mining facilities struggle to deal with is noise resulting from high intensity and performance mining equipment. A manager of Mabian Tianjia Network Technology, a Chinese mining company, stated that mining facilities are migrating to remote regions with a limited number of residents so that they won’t have to deal with noise complaints.\n\n""This room has 1,500 Bitcoin mining machines, our largest in this location, and can produce nearly 10 Bitcoins every day,"" said a manager at Tianjia.\n\nWith a cold climate, very cheap electricity and low population density, remote provinces in China such as Sichuan are transforming themselves into global Bitcoin mining hubs.', 'Ann Pettifor, leading economist and author of ""The Production of Money"" told Business Insider that bitcoin is flawed as money because it is a ""finite asset.""\n\nSpeaking about the origins and usage of bitcoin, she said: ""Bitcoin was invented by some big bad guys on the dark web as a secret currency, for which they could exchange goods and services.\n\n\n\n""The idea was similar to the gold standard which is that you would have a finite asset - which is your bitcoin, which would then increase in value over time because it is finite.\n\n""The problem with a finite asset is that the economy is not finite, and if you have a limited amount of money to match this almost unlimited capacity of people in the economy to do things, money doesn\'t work.""\n\nProduced by Joe Daunt. Filmed by David Ibekwe.', 'The recent news that the Danish police have become the first in the world to hunt down Internet drug traffickers by analyzing related transactions is, in a way, a positive for the image of the top digital currency in the world, Bitcoin.\n\nWith its latest rise to an all-time high in several markets, there is a tendency for the cryptocurrency to attract more users.\n\nSome of them use Bitcoin for criminal purposes, so the recent arrest in Denmark is a good move for the image of the currency. Not to demonstrate that it can be controlled by the police in any country but to show that it is possible to track transactions made with it, especially if and when they need be.\n\nThe head of the Danish police’s cyber crime unit NC3, Kim Aarenstrup, told Berlingske that the police has a system in place to analyze Bitcoin transactions which have already helped them bring two drug trafficking convictions.\n\nTools for law-enforcement\n\nThe not-for-profit research institute, RAND Europe, noted in a 2016 report that looked into the characteristics of vendors, buyers and other actors involved in the online drugs trade, that the number of transactions of illicit drugs on the cryptomarkets has tripled, with revenues doubling. The report described Bitcoin as the most popular cryptocurrency used on cryptomarkets to make purchases.\n\nThough researchers in the US had earlier announced they had created an analysis tool for US law enforcement that can be used to overcome the challenges of criminals using Bitcoin for transactions, the Danes consider themselves “much unique in the world at this point, because there are not really any others who have managed to use these trails as evidence.”\n\nAccording to the Danish prosecutor who made the conviction, Jesper Klyve, the Danish system worked by correlating transactions where Bitcoins are used to buy illegal goods, with transactions listed on the Blockchain as well as other information about users.\n\nFor the researchers at Sandia, a US-Federally Funded Research and Development Center which has delivered essential science and technology to resolve the most challenging security issues in the US for more than 60 years, “figuring out how to effectively combat illicit Bitcoin commerce and reduce its perception as a tool of criminals can encourage more people and companies to adopt Bitcoin for legitimate purposes.”\n\nThe team set up a research environment to experiment with other algorithms that can de-anonymize illicit Bitcoin users using a mix of traditional and novel investigative techniques, along with existing financial regulation and innovative policy and process tools. The de-anonymization will enable law enforcement to link Bitcoin addresses to a specific alias and they will know all of the Bitcoin addresses they need to deal with.\n\nWith more countries likely to adopt similar systems to filter illicit use of Bitcoin as time goes by, the negative perception of the digital currency may follow a downward trend.', 'European regulators should embrace cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the prime minister of Malta argued in a speech yesterday.\n\nSpeaking at the CEPS Ideas Lab in Brussels on 23rd February, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat argued that governments in the European Union should ""double down"" on the tech, which he pointed out is slowly catching on amongst the bloc’s financial institutions, according to a transcript published by Live News Malta.\n\nMuscat\'s remarks were in the context of reinvigorating the EU, which has faced rising socio-economic pressures in recent years. He also proposed that leaders in the bloc create financial mechanisms to invest in areas that may be inclined to leave the EU, as was with the case of the UK\'s so-called ""Brexit"" vote last year.\n\nThough prefacing his statements by saying that he is opting to advocate for ""outright insane"" sounding ideas, Muscat argued that ""the rise of cryptocurrencies can be slowed but cannot be stopped"".\n\nHe went on to tell event attendees:\n\n""My point is that rather than resist, European regulators should innovate and create mechanisms in which to regulate cryptocurrencies, in order to harness their potential and better protect consumers, while making Europe the natural home of innovators.""\n\nAmong the firms in Europe testing the tech is Malta’s primary stock exchange, which in December formed an internal ""Blockchain Committee"" dedicated to exploring how the exchange might utilize the tech.\n\nThe exchange further indicated its intention to set up a domestic blockchain consortium in Malta, aimed at creating a basis for the development of new applications.\n\nImage via Wikimedia\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In addition to an estimated doubling of the block size limit, SegWit is also viewed as a key improvement for layer-two solutions such as the lightning network and TumbleBit.\n\n\n\nOne of the key criticisms of SegWit up to this point has been the fact that the increased capacity enabled by this upgrade is not implemented as soon as the change is activated; however, it’s now looking much more likely that SegWit could offer a nice bump in capacity shortly after activation.\n\nIt should be noted that this critique of SegWit’s increase in the block size limit looks at Bitcoin only from a bird’s-eye view. On an individual user basis, the benefits of increased capacity are seen as soon as the user upgrades. In other words, it’s unclear if the “slow” nature of SegWit’s increase to the block size limit on a macro level even matters.\n\nWhy Segregated Witness Is Not an Instant Block Size Limit Increase\n\nThe reason that it was originally thought that Segregated Witness would not offer much in terms of increased capacity right out of the gate is that wallets, exchanges and other creators of transactions must also complete their own upgrades before the benefits of SegWit could be seen on the network.\n\nSince each user must effectively opt in to the increased capacity offered by SegWit, the growth in capacity would be seen when users start using SegWit transactions rather than when the protocol change is initially activated.\n\nIt should be noted that some Bitcoin Core contributors have downplayed the amount of time it would take for service providers to implement SegWit-related changes into their own software.\n\nAnother common argument against the capacity increase offered by SegWit has been that none of the in-progress lightning networks are ready for production use. While there aren’t any bitcoin wallet providers that have implemented lightning payments in their own software, Lightning Labs did recently release an alpha version of their lightning network daemon.\n\nWork is also progressing on an implementation of TumbleBit.\n\nMajor Wallet Providers Are Ready for Segregated Witness\n\nSince the issue of SegWit’s slow block size limit increase was first raised over a year ago, many different companies and projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem have become SegWit-ready or are at least prepared to implement the change if and when it is nearing activation. Perhaps most notably, Blockchain.info has implemented the necessary changes to allow their users to make SegWit transactions once the change is activated.\n\n.@kyletorpey inch up to activation & all can push blocksize to ~2MB. silver lining to drama/delay: more segwit ready, more scale out of gate — Adam Back (@adam3us) February 18, 2017\n\nAccording to BitGo CTO Ben Davenport, their customers would find the movement to SegWit outputs to be a rather straightforward process. He told Bitcoin Magazine that once BitGo has has rolled out new SegWit addresses for their wallets, customers would be able to update their software development kits. At that point, it would just be a matter of their customers spending through the existing non-SegWit UTXOs in their wallets.\n\n“Customers have every incentive to upgrade as it cuts their fees in half,” added Davenport. “And our customers’ wallets are very active, so old outputs would be quickly spent. I estimate BitGo alone could free up about 60 KB more block space.”\n\nWith a 1 MB block size limit, 60 KB basically amounts to 6 percent of the maximum potential block size. The effective increase in block space availability would be greater than Davenport’s 6 percent estimate if SegWit transactions were used in that newly freed-up space.\n\nAlthough BitGo is not yet SegWit ready, Davenport claims the bitcoin wallet provider could make the necessary changes in a matter of weeks. “We haven’t prioritized it, as we see little chance of it activating soon,” he explained.\n\nWhile Blockchain.info’s impact on SegWit adoption as a creator of a large chunk of total bitcoin transactions is obvious, there’s an added bonus to BitGo’s adoption of the improvement. Due to the way the upgrade works, SegWit’s impact on capacity is increased as more people use multisignature transactions. This is relevant because multisig is essentially BitGo’s bread and butter.\n\n""Although Davenport claims BitGo accounts for roughly 6 to 7 percent of all daily transactions on the Bitcoin network, he estimates that the company also accounts for greater than 80 percent of all multisig transactions.""\n\nSegregated Witness Is Still Awaiting Activation\n\nOf course, SegWit’s activation on the Bitcoin network is far from a done deal. Miner support for the proposed improvement has stagnated at roughly 25 percent, and the current implementation calls for support from 95 percent of the network hashrate.\n\nIn recent months, nearly every bitcoin exchange and wallet provider of note has at least stated their intention to implement the necessary changes to prepare for the activation of SegWit, but many mining pool operators have yet to signal support for this change.\n\nNote: This article has been updated to correct BitGo\'s share of daily transactions on the Bitcoin network.', 'Privacy focused altcoin DASH has partnered with payments platform BlockPay to enable its use for point-of-sale (POS) purchases of goods and services.\n\nThe collaboration is only the latest in a series of high-profile gains for the coin, which is trading at all-time highs of $26 Friday.\n\nMunich-based BlockPay’s POS tool facilitates cryptocurrency as a payment method, providing stiff competition to card companies through its lack of merchant fees.\n\nAlthough the platform supports Bitcoin and Ethereum among others, CEO and co-founder Christoph Hering said in a press release that Bitcoin was “unsexy” for everyday use.\n\n“The slow transaction speed, the high transaction fees and the speculative nature of Bitcoin make it very unsexy for everyday consumption,” he commented. “We added Dash because we see a huge potential in the very active Dash community and in the underlying scaling technology of Dash.”\n\nThe comments appear to be ironic, given the trading price of the top altcoins - including DASH - increased only due to Bitcoin hitting unseen highs.\n\nNonetheless, enthusiasm in the asset is showing no signs of wavering, as BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes demonstrated when DASH launched on the exchange last week.\n\nDASH and BlockPay’s relationship meanwhile goes back some time, having received an initial release in August last year.']"
02/25/2017,"['But why isn’t China simply clamping down hard on the whole bitcoin thing?\n\n“You have a government that likes to retain control, and bitcoin is a decentralized currency outside of the control of any nation-state,” Christopher Burniske, blockchain products analyst at New York-based ARK Investment Management, told Salon. “So that right there is a bit threatening, but at the same time China is working to be recognized as a global leader in technology and economics and the political fallout from outright banning or confiscating bitcoin is arguably too great.”\n\nBurniske said China may have other motives for not taking a hardline stance, such as working to develop its own form of digital currency, informally known as ChinaCoin. Early last year, the country’s central bank said it was mulling a rollout of its own digital currency.\n\nThe amount of bitcoin bought using the Chinese yuan has plummeted to less than 5 percent this week, thank to efforts by domestic exchanges to cool bitcoin trading activity with a one-month ban on making withdrawals and per-transaction fees that went into effect this month. Traders expect China’s central bank to eventually impose regulations on local bitcoin trading, too, which helped to push the price of bitcoin down. Currently the market is unregulated in China, but traditional financial institutions are barred from dealing in bitcoin.\n\nWith so much less bitcoin trading activity from mainland China, why has the value of the currency bounced back to a record high?', 'About The Author\n\nJoseph Young is a finance and tech journalist based in Hong Kong.

More gains are possible going forwards in BTC/USD.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price continued to gain pace against the US Dollar and moved above the $1100 resistance.\n\nThe last week’s highlighted bullish trend line on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD is still active with support at $1060.\n\nThe recent new high at $1194 was a nice move, and suggests more gains in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price grinded higher against the US dollar for a move towards $1200. More gains are possible going forwards in BTC/USD.\n\nBitcoin Price Buy Dips?\n\nThere was a solid buying interest for Bitcoin against the US Dollar, as the price moved past $1100. The BTC/USD pair was almost able to challenge the $1200, and traded as high as $1194 (data feed from SimpleFX). Once there was a break above the last swing high of $1114, the price gained pace and moved past $1180. Later, it found resistance near $1194 and started a correction.\n\nDuring the dip, the price moved below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $916 low $1194 high. However, the downside correction was strong, which pushed the price towards $1080 where it found support. The same level was also the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $916 low $1194 high. So, we can say it may have completed a correction pattern and could trade back towards $1150.\n\nIf there is an extension of the correction, the price might test the last week’s highlighted bullish trend line on the 4-hours chart at $1060. The 100 simple moving average (H4) is also positioned just below the trend line. Overall, it looks like the price is well supported on the downside, and buying dips near $1080 and $1060 might be considered.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is in the bullish zone, but slightly reducing the slope.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI has corrected from the overbought levels, and testing the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1060\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1140\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

According to Malta’s Prime Minister, Europe should embrace bitcoin sooner rather than later. Turning Europe into the bitcoin continent would be quite intriguing, to say the least. Whether or not this will happen, remains to be seen, though.\n\nIt is quite an intriguing statement by the Prime Minister of Malta, to say the least. Europe has remained rather quiet on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as of late. That is not entirely surprising by any means, although things may change in the near future. If it is up to the Prime Minister of Malta, that will be a very positive change for bitcoin moving forward. In his opinion, Europe should simply become the bitcoin continent.\n\nCan Europe Become The Bitcoin Continent?\n\nRest assured such a statement catches many people by surprise. It is unsure where his sentiment comes from, even though Malta has kept an open mind towards bitcoin for quite some time. Especially where the local gambling industry is concerned, bitcoin seems to be well-received so far. Other than that, bitcoin usage is virtually non-existent in the region, as far as most people are aware of.\n\nTo put this statement into perspective, one has to understand a few things about the Euro. When it was first introduced, a lot of people felt a unified coin for all of Europe would be quite powerful. Despite the Euro surviving multiple crises, the currency has not brought European countries closer together by any means. In fact, the monetary system has taken a significant hit, leaving consumers with far less purchasing power than they had before. The Euro has not “failed” entirely, but it didn’t improve the situation either.\n\nIt is impossible to stop the rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. European regulators would do well to innovate and create a landscape for bitcoin rather than oppose it. A bold statement that will not sit well with quite a few regulators, that much is certain. Making Europe the home of bitcoin is quite a risky move, although it somewhat makes sense as well. It would be interesting to see what happens if European regulators decided to look into this approach.\n\nAlthough this concept sounds quite intriguing, it is doubtful Europe will stop opposing bitcoin. To be more precise, central banks throughout the continent have a history of blocking bitcoin transfers. Especially the UK is a guilty party in this regard. What would more intriguing is how the EU could embrace bitcoin, now that the UK is no longer part of it. Big changes will come to the EU economy and looking into cryptocurrency could be an option.', 'On Jan. 15, 2016, former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn left the Bitcoin community and industry with a highly controversial blog post entitled “The resolution of the Bitcoin experiment.”\n\nDeclaring Bitcoin dead\n\nMainstream media outlets including Fusion, Business Insider, Yahoo and Wired, which urgently awaited for negative Bitcoin headlines to pick up, led the “Bitcoin is declared dead narrative,” happily announcing that “prominent Bitcoin developer declared the digital money dead.”\n\nFusion, in particular, published an article entitled “Prominent Bitcoin developer declares the digital money dead,” describing Bitcoin as a failed experiment. It is an appropriate period to look back at these false narratives and misreporting of the Bitcoin industry as Bitcoin price recently reached its new all-time high at $1,220 in major Bitcoin markets including the US, Japan and China.\n\nAmid his exit, Hearn announced to the Bitcoin community that he had sold all of his Bitcoins. He noted that experiments or projects like Bitcoin could fail and told his followers that it isn’t an intelligent decision to invest in “what you can’t afford to lose.”\n\n“I have sold all my coins”\n\nHearn further emphasized that he knew Bitcoin could fail all along and continued to imply that he served the Bitcoin community, industry and open source development network solely for the benefit of the Bitcoin industry.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n“But despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short-term, the long-term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.”\n\nFor innovative and revolutionary projects or technologies like Bitcoin to succeed, it is important to help guide them through their early stages in development.\n\nIt can be argued that Bitcoin is still in its earlier stages of development as solutions like Segregated Witness (SegWit), TumbleBit, MimbleWimble, which are presumed to drastically scale the Bitcoin network and provide an unprecedented level of anonymity, are still inactivated and unimplemented.\n\nExponential growth\n\nSince the exit of Hearn, the market and industry of Bitcoin have seen exponential growth. Regulators have begun to treat Bitcoin as legal tender and legitimate money transfers, Bitcoin wallet user base surged, trading volumes have increased massively and the demand for Bitcoin is skyrocketing.\n\nIn early January of last year, around the time Mike Hearn allegedly sold all of his Bitcoins, Bitcoin price was in the mid-200s, around $250. Currently, Bitcoin price is being traded in the range of $1,180 to $1,220 in most major markets.\n\nWhile influential figures like Hearn have failed to understand and realize the potential of Bitcoin and its impact on the global financial network, some high-profile investors such as multi-billion dollar investor Tim Draper have nearly doubled their investments in Bitcoin.\n\nRecently, Fox revealed that Draper’s $19 mln Bitcoin investment is now worth $35 mln, leaving Draper with a $16 mln profit. Draper secured 32,000 Bitcoins in a bear market and kept to this date despite various events that have emerged, including the halving of Bitcoin price.\n\n“[I’m] very excited about Bitcoin and what it can do for the world. Bitcoin is as big a transformation to the finance and commerce industry as the Internet was for information and communications. If Bitcoin were here in 2008, it would be a stability source for our world economy. Everybody should go out there and buy a Bitcoin,” Draper told Fox.\n\nDraper also has funded various Bitcoin exchanges and ventures in growing markets such as Coinplug, which were struggling to secure million dollar investments at the time.\n\nThere are some individuals like Hearn that are not capable of understanding the potential of Bitcoin and its current impact on the global financial network. For some, the open source network of Bitcoin and how it provides an alternative financial infrastructure to users is simply incomprehensible.\n\nHowever, it is becoming more evident that the market is beginning to accept Bitcoin as a digital currency, store of value, digital gold or a settlement network. Users are utilizing Bitcoin as whichever forms of money or assets they wish. If the Bitcoin industry and market continue to grow at this rate, Bitcoin will overtake reserve currencies and establish itself as a true global digital currency.', 'The cryptography world has been buzzing with the news that researchers at Google and CWI Amsterdam have succeeded in successfully generating a \'hash collision\' for two different documents using the SHA1 encryption algorithm, rendering the algorithm \'broken\' according to cryptographic standards.\n\nBut what does this mean in plain language, and what are the implications for the bitcoin network?\n\nHash collisions\n\nAs laid out in a recent CoinDesk explainer, a hash function (of which SHA1 is an example) is used to take a piece of data of any length, process it, and return another piece of data – the \'hash digest\' – with a fixed length.\n\nOne way that hash functions are used in computing is to check whether the contents of files are identical: as long as a hash function is secure, then two files which hash to the same value will always have the same contents.\n\nHowever, a hash collision occurs when two different files hash to the same value.\n\nGiven the mathematical laws that govern hash functions, it is inevitable that hash collisions will occur for some values of input data (because the range of data you could put into the hash function is potentially infinite, but the output length is fixed).\n\nFor a secure hash function, the probability of this should be so small that, in practice, it is not possible to make a sufficient number of calculations to find it.\n\nThe significance of the Google/CWI team\'s results is in the fact that they were able to create a hash collision by finding a much more efficient method – 100,000 times more efficient in fact – than simply guessing every possible value of data.\n\nIt\'s the efficiency of this method that means SHA1 is now officially broken. (These results are outlined in more depth on SHAttered.io, with an explanation of systems affected.)\n\nThe SHA1 bounty\n\nOn 23rd February, a sharp-eyed Redditor on the /r/bitcoin page made a post pointing out that a long-standing bounty for discovering just such a SHA1 collision has now been claimed.\n\nThe bounty – aimed to discover vulnerabilities in the algorithm – was originally announced by cryptography researcher Peter Todd in a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum in September 2013, but remained unclaimed until this week.\n\nThe challenge consisted of a script, written by Todd, which would allow anyone to move the bitcoins from the bounty address to an address of their choice if they could submit two messages which were not equal in value, but resulted in the same digest when hashed.\n\nIn addition to Todd, other contributors also donated to the bounty fund, raising a total of 2.5 bitcoins.\n\nAccording to the researcher, the timing of the claim – slightly after publication of the collision attack – suggests that it was a third party who had read the Google team\'s research and made use of the results, rather than one of the original researchers, that took the reward.\n\nTodd said:\n\n""If it was the authors themselves, we would have expected the bounty to be claimed just prior to the announcement being published. As it happened, that wasn\'t the case.""\n\nRamifications for bitcoin\n\nIt\'s important to stress that the cryptography underpinning the bitcoin network, which makes use of the more secure SHA256 algorithm, is not directly affected by the discovery.\n\nBut, besides enriching the mystery bounty recipient, the SHA1 collision vulnerability does pose a concern for the bitcoin development community, since its Git version control system uses SHA1 to generate the hash digest for commits.\n\n""The consequences aren\'t that we have to stop using Git immediately,"" Todd said, ""but it will make it more important to review other people\'s work, because a third party could try to push a malicious commit in.""\n\nThe vulnerability here is that an attacker could theoretically create two different versions of a code commit that would appear to be the same when hash values were compared – though for now, given the vast number of computations still needed to find a collision, it\'s highly unlikely that could happen.\n\nAs well as SHA1, Todd has placed similar bounties on the RIPE MD160 and SHA256 hash functions – both of which are necessary for the integrity of the bitcoin standard, and would therefore be calamitous for the network if compromised.\n\nTodd concluded:\n\n""If you claim that bounty, you better go spend your bitcoins pretty quick.""\n\nBinary code image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The environmentalist association Legambiente, and several partners, have since been collaborating on a crowdfunding campaign for those affected.\n\nLegambiente (League for the Environment) is the most widespread environmental organization in Italy, with 20 Regional branches and more than 115,000 members. It is acknowledged as “association of environmental interest” by the Ministry of the Environment; it represents the UNEP National Committee for Italy, it is one of the leading member of the European Environmental Bureau, and of IUCN - the World Conservation Union.\n\nThe bitcoin based campaign was Legambientes first foray into bitcoin donations, thanks to Helperbit. 59 percent of the campaigns goal, over eight bitcoins, have already been raised. Five of those bitcoins were donated by insurance giant Swiss Re.\n\n- Helperbit\n\nHelpbit is an Italian startup that uses Blockchain technology to allow people to donate digital and local currencies to charities and people in need all over the world, while tracking the donations and the manner in which they are used.\n\nThe company co-founders Guido Baroncini Turricchia, Davide Gessa, Davide Menegaldo, Roberto Tudini, Vincenzo Aguì and Gianluca Carbone, initially came up with the idea for their platform in 2009, after reading news about the ineffective management of charitable funds following the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake in Italy.\n\nIn 2012, the Italian il Fatto Quotidiano reported that the five million euros donated by Italians to help with building reconstruction were transferred to a guarantee fund, which locked up the funds for nine years.\n\n“The lack of transparency that characterizes the traditional systems allows donative streams to be drained along their way to those who need it,” Helperbit states. “The lack of transparency puts people off donating and we want to unlock this unexpressed donative potential.”\n\nHaving officially launched in 2015, Helperbit now offers a bitcoin platform that allows people to donate digital and local currencies to charities and people in need all over the world. Donors can trace the funds and the manner in which they are used, offering true transparency.\n\n- Helperbit\n\nThe recent fundraising campaign provided a specific case study for the Helperbit platform. The campaign funds are being offered to local entrepreneurs. “We want to support and promote their economic activities and finance projects presented by those that, in front of the tragedy of the earthquake, want to react, investing on new corporate initiatives in those areas,” Helperbit explains.\n\nAmong the many affected locals, the earthquake in central Italy has taken away everything Ilaria and Lorenzo have. The owners of Società Agricola Etiche Terre S.S., moved to the region less than a year ago to start the production of saffron, garlic and black truffle.\n\nThe farmers recently uploaded the first invoice on the Helperbit platform, activating a refund request from Legambiente. Much of the process is visible in the public Bitcoin Blockchain, including the proof of expenditure with a cryptographic reference to the invoice.\n\nThe document certifying the request and the transaction are now inextricably linked in the immutable and decentralized public register, giving the opportunity to verify the sender, the recipient and the justification. The process provides a higher level of transparency and increases donor participation. They know precisely how the funds are spent.\n\n“Donors should be able to decide how their donation is used. Organizations that act properly should not be affected by few bad behaviors,” states Helpbit. “Our aim is to offer tools that allow the system to work with a complete audit of economic flows.”\n\nEach campaign Helperbit runs uses multisignature technology. Recipients get as many multisignature keys as is appropriate for their organization. “This reduces drastically the risk of theft and misuse of the donations,” Helperbit explains. Donors also receive a key. Helperbit Donors can fund their accounts by either sending bitcoin or simply use their own debit cards. Organizations can accept bitcoin or local currency.\n\nThe platform won second place in the iBank Challenge 2016 competition in December, taking home €11,000 after beating out all but one of the 83 contestants. The contest was promoted by the Italian Banking Association and organized by its own R&D laboratory, ABI Lab.\n\n- Helperbit\n\nVaious Charities including the Red Cross and Greenpeace have accepted bitcoins for individual fundraisers in the past, but typically they do not explore accepting bitcoin permanently as the size of the market is still too small. Unfortunately, few if any of these attempts have exposed the major charities to the technological benefits of using a blockchain.\n\nBitgive’s GiveTrack is one of very few similar attempts at tracking charity funding from donor to recipient. The platform has many of the same features as Helperbit, and has successfully run several campaigns. The Water Project raised $11,000, more than their $10,000 goal.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

What appears to be more worrisome is the inability of certain governments and other presumably reliable platforms to distinguish between the good and bad eggs within the system.\n\nGovernments need cryptocurrency experts\n\nWith the Bitcoin price reaching an all-time high and showing strong character in terms of value, the entire crypto space has become more attractive and the influx of newcomers has become very significant.\n\nCointelegraph wrote how certain governments have bundled suspicious creations and authentic cryptocurrencies together, with the Bank of Uganda putting OneCoin and Bitcoin in the same trash bucket as an example of such.\n\nOrganized scams\n\nFounder and CEO at Cashaa, Kumar Gaurav, thinks that such a situation is possible because governments do not turn to the experts who can advise them appropriately. If they did, Gaurav is certain that they would realize that OneCoin has nothing to do with Bitcoin. He describes OneCoin as an organized scam.\n\nGaurav says:\n\n“OneCoin has nothing to do with Bitcoin, it is probably the most well-known scam in the sphere, and it has been for a couple of years. Their representatives keep trying to introduce people to their scheme, sometimes without knowing what they are doing, and without knowing what Bitcoin actually is.”\n\nGaurav also retains the opinion that these governments may have to look for experts abroad for research and suggestions on policy making when it comes to the disruptive technology.\n\nSwiscoin not genuine?\n\nAccording to Gaurav, not only governments, but some platforms considered reliable happen to recognize non-qualified entities as cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt the time of writing, Swiscoin was listed on CoinMarketCap as a genuine cryptocurrency although Gaurav insists that it is a scam like OneCoin.\n\nAccording to Gaurav, conference organizers are giving some suspicious cloud mining companies a platform as sponsor or “expert” speakers, although they have nothing to do with innovation, research or other useful knowledge.\n\nThe danger of being scammed comes from scamcoins as well as from companies which pretend to be involved in a legitimate cryptocurrency, but are offering services that rip people off, says Gaurav. This fact contributes to institutions getting a wrong opinion about legitimate cryptocurrencies:\n\n“When not even some actors in the sphere can make the distinction yet, then it is no surprise that some less-informed governments do not make this distinction either and are either treating legitimate coins as illegitimate or the other way round.”\n\nGaurav suggests that in order to avoid mixing up genuine entities with elements of scam, institutions first have to educate themselves and look at previous institutions’ statements.\n\nHe notes that there have been plenty of well-researched statements and reports on cryptocurrency by well-known institutions, which have been around as early as the ECB’s on “virtual currency schemes” in 2012.\n\nStill not a scam?\n\nAleksandar Matanovic does not agree totally that Swiscoin can be considered a scam. He identifies certain features of Swiscoin that may qualify it as a true cryptocurrency. These features include the possibility to buy mining equipment for Swiscoin, so there might be some real mining going on (unlike those who perform “centralized mining”), their claim to be open source and the fact that they are listed on some external exchanges, although with very low trading volumes.\n\nMatanovic notes that these three qualities differentiate Swiscoin from those that are obvious scams.\n\nCryptocurrencies and MLM can live together\n\nAleksandar Matanovic makes it clear that just because some businesses use MLM for growing its user base doesn’t automatically make it a scam. However, he expresses his dislike for most of the MLM “cryptocurrencies” not being honest about what they really are.\n\nMatanovic says:\n\n“They are mostly claiming that they are the “new Bitcoin” while in fact, they have no similarities with Bitcoin except for having “coin” as a part of their name.”\n\nHe explains that as long as propagators are honest about what they are and are not misleading people and the value of their coin is decided by the laws of the market and not by internal price manipulation, then there is nothing wrong if there is an MLM element to it or if the product is not even a cryptocurrency at all. “Just don’t claim to be a cryptocurrency if you are not one.”\n\nMatanovic says:', 'Wirtschaft\n\nAlternative zu Bitcoin: China testet eigene Digitalwährung\n\nDigitalwährungen wie Bitcoin sind effizient bei der Zahlungsabwicklung und entziehen sich staatlicher Kontrolle. Chinas Zentralbank möchte die Vorteile der Technologie nutzen, ohne die Nachteile in Kauf zu nehmen.\n\nChina könnte bald das erste Land mit einer eigenen Digitalwährung als gesetzlichem Zahlungsmittel werden. Chinesischen Medienberichten zufolge hat die Zentralbank gemeinsam mit einigen der größten Geschäftsbanken einen ersten Versuchslauf für eine selbstentwickelte Variante der Blockchain-Technologie erfolgreich abgeschlossen. Ein Datum für die Einführung der Währung gibt es allerdings noch nicht.\n\nDie neue Digitalwährung soll nach dem Willen der Notenbank sowohl in Konkurrenz zur besonders in China populären Digitalwährung Bitcoin treten als auch den Bargeldverkehr teilweise ablösen. Bitcoin basiert ebenfalls auf der Blockchain-Technologie, bei der die Informationen über sämtliche Zahlungsvorgänge bei den Empfängern und Sendern selbst gespeichert werden, somit entfallen sowohl ein zentrales Register als auch die Notwendigkeit für Konten bei Banken.\n\nAllerdings gibt es einen entscheidenden Unterschied zwischen Bitcoin, das von einer privaten Community betrieben wird und komplett anonyme Transaktionen ermöglicht, und der neuen chinesischen Währung. Denn letztere soll komplett von der Zentralbank kontrolliert werden. Das würde nicht nur den Kampf gegen Geldwäsche und Kapitalflucht erleichtern, sondern eine Nachverfolgung sämtlicher Geldströme in Echtzeit ermöglichen. Das wiederum würde der Zentralbank ganz neue Möglichkeiten zur Analyse und exakten Steuerung ihrer Geldpolitik bieten.\n\nAuch für die Nutzer soll die neue Währung Vorteile bieten: Anders als Bitcoin soll sie, wie ""Bloomberg"" berichtet, gesetzliches Zahlungsmittel werden. Das heißt, alle Händler, Banken, Behörden und anderen Institutionen wären verpflichtet, sie anzunehmen. Verglichen mit elektronischen Zahlungen mit dem chinesischen Yuan, die in China bereits sehr populär sind, dürfte die Blockchain-Technologie effizienter und billiger sein, da Gebühren von Banken oder Zahlungsabwicklern wegfallen.\n\nAuch Bundesbank forscht zu Blockchain\n\nChinas Behörden gehen derzeit verschärft gegen Bitcoin vor. Auf chinesischen Internetplattformen werden etwa 90 Prozent der weltweiten Bitcoin-Transaktionen abgewickelt. Die Regierung befürchtet, dass Anleger dort nicht nur Geld aus illegalen Geschäften waschen, sondern angesichts der anhaltenden Abwertung der Landeswährung auch versuchen, unter Umgehung der strengen Kapitalverkehrskontrollen ihre Yuan außer Landes zu schaffen. Die Schaffung einer eigenen Alternative unter offizieller Kontrolle ist ein weiterer Schritt, um die Verwendung von Bitcoin einzudämmen.\n\nSetzt sich die Digitalwährung der Zentralbank in China tatsächlich durch, dürfte das weitreichende Konsequenzen für Bitcoin-Besitzer auf der ganzen Welt haben. Aus dem Land fließt nicht nur derzeit offenbar das meiste Geld in die bislang populärste Ditigalwährung. In China stehen auch mit Abstand die meisten Computer, die in aufwendigen Rechenoperationen immer neue Bitcoin-Einheiten schaffen und damit das Wachstum der Währung ermöglichen.\n\nIn einer ersten Ankündigung hatte die Zentralbank im vergangenen Jahr bereits von einer ""praktischen und einer weitreichenden historischen Bedeutung"" ihrer Pläne gesprochen. Der nun abgeschlossene Testlauf zeigt, dass Chinas Währungshüter ihren Kollegen in anderen Ländern weit voraus sind. So beschäftigen sich unter anderem die Notenbanken von Singapur, Schweden, Kanada und auch die Bundesbank mit möglichen Anwendungen der Blockchain-Technologie. Konkrete Pläne für die Einführung neuer Währungen haben sie bislang allerdings nicht präsentiert.\n\nQuelle: n-tv.de']"
02/26/2017,"[""Even China can't kill bitcoin\n\nSharelines\n\nEvery time a government sets out to abolish something people like, the well-liked thing moves to where it can’t be stopped. This has happened with prohibition, gambling, the war on drugs and digital piracy. Now it's happening in China, where the government has been trying to crack down on bitcoin.\n\n\n\nAs part of an effort to control capital outflows, the Chinese central bank required bitcoin exchanges to suspend withdrawals until they could update their compliance systems. Trading on the exchanges took a big hit, but the bitcoin activity resurfaced on less formal over-the-counter venues.\n\n\n\nBlocking local bitcoins would be no solution, in part because people can use virtual private networks to access it anyway. Also, plenty of trading happens on lesser-known sites and on micro-messaging services such as WeChat and QQ. The latter already have their own payment systems, allowing users to build chatbots to automate trading activity. For those who prefer a more familiar trading interface, decentralized exchange software such as Bitsquare can construct an order book based on outstanding offers accumulated from other participants.\n\n\n\nChina is not alone. Peer-to-peer trading took off in Turkey after the country’s only bitcoin exchange ceased to operate, and in Venezuela after the leading exchange had its bank account closed. Russia has some of the most active unofficial bitcoin markets in the world, thanks to the country’s longstanding regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAlthough centralised exchanges provide benefits, such as bringing together large quantities of buyers and sellers and guaranteeing payment, they’re not necessary for the currency’s existence. Bitcoin users don’t own physical coins, or even digital ones. They own permanent transaction histories recorded on a global ledger, replicated by participants all around the world. Even if a government shuts down every bitcoin node in its country, a bitcoin user can still transact as long as a single node is accessible overseas.This puts regulators in a tough spot. It’s hard to control something that exists nowhere and everywhere at the same time. With peer-to-peer transactions, there are no servers to shut down, no kingpins to arrest, no warehouses to bust. Regulators can only go after local bitcoin exchanges and service providers, effectively impairing their own ability to see what's going on.Attempts to stamp out bitcoin serve only to remind users why a decentralised currency needs to exist in the first place. Bitcoin gained prominence because its peer-to-peer payment system allows people to conduct financial transactions that can’t be censored by third parties. Users are free to transact with anyone, as long as they control their own private keys.The fact that many people still give third-party service providers custody of their bitcoin accounts is mostly a relic of our existing acclimation to banks. When regulators try to restrict bitcoin exchanges, they reduce trust both in the government -- which can't seem to keep its hands in its own pockets -- and in any kind of third-party financial service provider that might be beholden to the government.The best way to curb the use of bitcoin is to convince people that they don’t need the cryptocurrency. If Visa and Mastercard started processing payments for darknet markets and remittance customers, the demand for bitcoin would fall off a cliff.But that’s about as likely as China offering to ease capital controls. The U.S., for its part, could reform money laundering rules that effectively bar a subset of the population from the banking system. When regulations create barriers that prevent legitimate businesses from serving certain customers, less-legitimate businesses rise to meet the demand outside the regulatory system.Markets can’t be regulated out of existence. The next best thing might be to let them operate in the open. - Bloomberg View"", 'Bitcoin is having a great year so far. At the beginning of 2017, the cryptocurrency’s price was hovering around $1000 before falling as low as $760. But since then, Bitcoin price has recovered and crossed the $1000 mark yet again.\n\nLike any other tradable asset, Bitcoin price is also bound to speculation. At the same time, various other factors drive the demand and supply of the digital currency. Until now, the increased trade volumes in the Chinese market was one of the driving factors behind Bitcoin’s price. However, the recent crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges by the country’s central bank has led to a significant decrease in Bitcoin trades in the Chinese market.\n\nWith almost all leading Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges freezing Bitcoin withdrawals, the number of people trading on these platforms has reduced, resulting in a fall in the cryptocurrency’s supply to meet the international market’s demands. This, in turn, is influencing the rise in Bitcoin value.\n\nThe supply-demand situation is further worsened by the hopes of Bitcoin ETF’s approval on March 11, 2017. People, both existing cryptocurrency community members, and other investors are increasingly buying into the digital currency as Bitcoin’s price is expected to increase even further. According to few media outlets, Bitcoin ETF’s approval will see Bitcoin’s price rising to $3,200 — more than double the current price.\n\nOn the other hand, there are skeptical views about the approval process, and a significant portion of the Bitcoin community believe that the chances of approval are slim. Meanwhile, there is an increased demand for Bitcoin in Latin American and African nations as well. The rise in Bitcoin usage among the people in Venezuela and Nigeria has already been reported in cryptocurrency and mainstream news.\n\nAnother active market for Bitcoin lies in Japan. The Japanese government has already imparted Bitcoin with the status of a legal tender. The relevant regulations are expected to enter into effect later this year. The digital currency’s legal status in the country has also boosted cryptocurrency- related activity in Japan.\n\nAll these things put together shows that the rising Bitcoin price is due to multiple factors and any effects, positive or negative will become visible by mid-march.\n\nRef: Seeking Alpha | Image: NewsBTC', ""Bits, the units of information that underlie any digital currency, have only two values: zero or one. Perhaps it's time investors were reminded that buying bitcoin is a similarly binary wager.\n\nThe virtual asset is trading at a record, shrugging off a campaign by the People's Bank of China to control trading. Underpinning its rise is the hope that American entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will succeed in their attempt to create the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nOn March 11, the twins are expected to receive a final decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on whether they can list their ETF. A favorable outcome would create a precedent and pave the way for other providers. There are two more funds seeking a review from the regulator -- one of which already trades over the counter -- and talk abounds of many more.\n\nInvestors who have driven bitcoin's price above its November 2013 high of $1,137 are betting that the advent of bitcoin ETFs will spur demand for an asset class with limited supply and cause prices to extend their climb.\n\nHigh Hopes Investors are betting that the first SEC-approved bitcoin ETF could spur demand Source: Bloomberg\n\nWhat they may be missing is the possibility that the Winklevoss twins will fail. A contract created by Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, a cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, to bet on the possibility of approval of the Winklevoss ETF, showed favorable odds of only 34 percent on Monday.\n\nOdds of SEC approval 34%\n\nIn spite of employing lawyer Kathleen Moriarty, a legend in the ETF world, the Winklevosses have been forced to wait since July 2013 as the regulator takes its time to determine whether the digital currency can be considered an asset class. Even the lawyers working for the twins initially didn't want to take the case because they thought bitcoin might be a Ponzi scheme.\n\nAll the while, the twins have been amending their filing in an attempt to convince the SEC. The latest bull run started shortly after their most recent addendum, registered on Jan. 20, which among other things requested a larger initial issue size for the fund.\n\nAlong the way, they've added settlement systems in order to establish the bitcoin price and determine the net asset value of the ETF at the end of every day. (Conveniently, that process will happen on the Gemini exchange, owned by the Winklevosses.) They've also added insurance, so potential hacks shouldn't be an issue.\n\nYet for all their bending over backward, they have yet to win an endorsement from the regulator, which still operates mostly on legislation enacted in 1933. The U.S. government simply may not be ready to give the stamp of approval to bitcoin that allowing an ETF would imply.\n\nIn the more likely outcome of an SEC rejection, bitcoin could quickly drop back to the sub-$800 levels tested after China's latest crackdown was unveiled in January. That would be a drop of about a third from the current price. Meanwhile, the upside in the event of approval is unclear.\n\nThe launch of the first Gold ETF was hardly bullish. For the first year of its existence, the metal's price actually dropped. Eventually, it took off, but more as a result of the turmoil unleashed by the global financial crisis than on its own merits.\n\nFall to Rise In the first year of the pioneer gold ETF, the yellow metal's price actually dropped Source: Bloomberg\n\nPut simply, the downside for bitcoin is potentially much bigger than the upside -- at least in the short term. The digital currency's future has never been this binary. Unlike with programming code, though, one of the two alternatives isn't zero: It's a deeply negative number.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\n(Updates fifth paragraph with Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange contract.)\n\nTo contact the author of this story:\n\nChristopher Langner in Singapore at clangner@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nMatthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.net"", ""While bitcoin traders have many tools they can use to evaluate the cryptocurrency market, one of the most tried-and-true methodologies is what's called technical analysis. Using this approach, traders can get a better sense of market sentiment and identify key trends, and, with this information, make better-informed predictions.\n\nTechnicians (sometimes called 'chartists') take a practical approach, looking at a security’s history (using price charts) and applying various analytical tools to get a better sense of how the market feels about that particular security.\n\nWhile 'fundamental analysis' – the counterpart to technical analysis – is more interested in determining what a security 'should' be worth, technicians are only concerned with a security’s actual price movements. By looking at bitcoin’s price history, technicians attempt to identify well-known patterns such as 'support' and 'resistance'.\n\nLaying the foundation\n\nTo get a better understanding of technical analysis, it is important to grasp the basic concepts of Dow theory, which has provided the foundation for this practical method for evaluating securities.\n\nDow Theory provides a few basic assumptions:\n\n1. The market discounts everything. All past, current and even future information is already factored into existing asset prices. In the case of bitcoin, this would include variables such as past, current and future demand, as well as any regulations affecting the digital currency.\n\nThe current price reflects all existing information, including the knowledge and expectations of all market participants. As a result, technicians seek to interpret what the price is saying about market sentiment to make educated predictions about what prices will do going forward.\n\n2. Prices movements are not completely random. Instead, they frequently follow trends, which can be either short-term or long-term. Once a security forms a trend, it is more likely to follow that trend than go against it. Through technical analysis, technicians seek to identify trends and profit from them.\n\n3. 'What' matters more than 'why'. Technicians focus more on a security's price history than the specific variables that have created this price movement. While any number of factors could have caused a security's price to move in a certain way, technicians take a more direct approach by looking at supply and demand.\n\n4. History has a tendency to repeat itself. Market psychology is predictable, and traders often respond the same way when provided with similar stimuli. Digital currency markets, for example, have frequently provided bullish responses to key events such as news evidencing rising adoption or greater visibility.\n\nIdentifying trends\n\nIdentifying trends, or the general direction in which a security is moving, can be very helpful for bitcoin traders. However, singling these trends out can be a challenge. Digital currencies can be highly volatile, and looking at a chart of bitcoin's price movements will likely show a series of highs and lows.\n\nHowever, technicians know that they can look past the volatility and identify an uptrend when they see a sequence of higher highs and higher lows. In contrast, they can single out a downtrend when they identify a string of lower lows and lower highs.\n\nThere are also sideways trends, in which a security experiences little in the way of upward or downward movement.\n\nTraders should know that trends come in many lengths, including short-term, intermediate, and long-term.\n\nMoving averages\n\nOne technique bitcoin traders can use to more easily identify trends is to use 'moving averages', which help smooth out a digital currency's price fluctuations so market participants can get a better sense of where the price has been going.\n\nThe most basic kind of moving average is the 'simple moving average', which is determined by calculating a security’s average price over a specific time period. Traders might look at what bitcoin has done over a five-day or 20-day period, for example.\n\nA similar tool that bitcoin traders can use is the 'exponential moving average', which gives greater emphasis to more recent price values when calculating an average.\n\nBy analyzing moving averages, traders can get a better sense of when momentum shifts. For example, if a five-day moving average falls below a 20-day moving average, this development could point to a bull market turning bearish. Should the opposite take place, with the shorter average rising above the longer average, the converse is true.\n\nChart 1: A five-day moving average (SMA 5) repeatedly surpassing a 20-day moving average (SMA 20):\n\nSupport and resistance\n\nAnother crucial tool is the analysis of support and resistance levels. By identifying these levels, bitcoin traders can help get a better sense of the supply and demand surrounding the digital currency.\n\nThe support level is effectively the price at which a large number of traders are willing to buy a security, since they believe it is 'oversold' (ie sold at a price below its perceived true value). As the security approaches this price, market participants step in and purchase it, creating a 'floor'.\n\nFor example, if bitcoin prices trade above $1,000 for several days, any retreat to this price level might prompt market participants to believe the currency is oversold and therefore start buying.\n\nChart 2: Support level (in green):\n\nThe counterpart to support is resistance, which is a price level where a large number of traders are motivated to sell a security because they think it is 'overbought' (ie overvalued due to many traders buying at excessively high prices).\n\nFor example, if bitcoin prices trade below $1,000 for several sessions, moving toward $1,000 might prompt a significant number of traders to enter sell orders for the security, thereby creating resistance.\n\nChart 3: Resistance (in green):\n\nBitcoin sometimes fluctuates between levels of support and resistance, which work together to create a range. This is called 'rangebound trading', and creates opportunities for traders to buy bitcoin when it is near the bottom of the range and sell when it is close to the top.\n\nChart 4: Ranges of support and resistance:\n\nHowever, should bitcoin prices exit a trading range, this can result in robust trading activity, significant volatility and a new trend.\n\nFor example, if bitcoin prices break through a price level that previously served as resistance, this price frequently ends up serving as a support level. Alternatively, the opposite could happen, with the digital currency’s price falling below support, resulting in this level becoming a new resistance level.\n\nVolume's key role\n\nBitcoin traders should keep in mind that volume plays an important role in evaluating price trends. High volume points to strong price trends, while low volume indicates weaker trends. If bitcoin prices experience a large gain or loss, traders should be sure to examine volume.\n\nFor example, if bitcoin enjoys a long uptrend and then declines sharply one day, it is worth checking out volume to get a better sense of whether this downward movement represents a new trend or simply a temporary pullback.\n\nGenerally, rising prices coincide with increasing volume. If bitcoin prices enjoy an uptrend, but the currency’s upward movements take place amid weak volume, this could mean that the trend is running out of gas and could soon be over.\n\nChart 5: Volume rising as the price climbs:\n\nCriticisms of technical analysis\n\nWhile technical analysis can be a valuable tool in a bitcoin trader's arsenal, those considering using it can benefit from being aware of the criticism brought against this particular approach. Much of this criticism comes from the 'efficient market' hypothesis, which is the idea that market prices reflect all available information.\n\nIf this assertion is valid, then there is no value to be had from conducting analysis in an effort to determine when securities are undervalued or overvalued. Efficient market hypothesis has both its critics and advocates, and arguments can be made either for or against the idea.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is up to each individual bitcoin trader to consider both sides and determine what they believe.\n\nKey considerations\n\nBy leveraging technical analysis, bitcoin traders can gauge market sentiment, identify trends and potentially make better-informed investment decisions. However, there are a few key variables they should keep in mind.\n\nFor starters, technical analysis is a very practical approach, looking only at a security’s price and volume.\n\nAs a result, relying on technical analysis could potentially cause a trader to either miss out on opportunities to buy bitcoin when it is undervalued or, alternatively, purchase the digital currency when the price may be inflated, at least according to the fundamentals.\n\nTo manage this risk, bitcoin traders can potentially combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis. For example, if a bitcoin trader concludes that technical indicators and patterns are telling him to buy, he can help affirm this by evaluating some fundamental data, such as the approaching SEC ruling on the Winklevoss ETF.\n\nAlternatively, a bitcoin trader could leverage fundamental analysis to determine whether bitcoin is undervalued or overvalued and then harness technical analysis to calculate the best point to either buy or sell the digital currency.\n\nTrading chart image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The blog was in response to public comments claiming that R3 has only recently recognized that blockchain technology will not address wholesale financial industry needs.\n\nThe blog noted R3 is flattered by the attention Corda has recently received after sources noted that the words “No block chain’ because we don’t need one” was used in an R3 presentation. The blog said R3 has from the beginning referred to Corda as a distributed ledger platform and not a traditional blockchain platform.\n\nSome Claim R3 Admits Defeat\n\nThe Merkle ran a story with a headline, “R3 Admits Defeat, Stops Blockchain Development.”\n\nA tweet stated, “R3 concedes defeat: “No Block Chain, because we don’t need one. GAME OVER!” The tweet included screen shots of the R3 presentation stating why Corda doesn’t need blockchain.\n\nComments piled on on Reddit. One stated: “Good thing it only took a huge group of massive corporations and tens of millions of dollars to figure out that they could just keep using their old tech!”\n\nR3 Cites Semantics\n\nR3’s blog took issue with these comments. It observed that over time, any type of distributed ledger incorrectly became known as a blockchain. R3 recognized early on that blockchain could not be applied to wholesale financial markets without careful consideration.\n\nWhen R3 launched in 2015, it was among a handful of companies inspired by blockchain technology and its possible application to wholesale financial markets. Blockchain was the most frequent example of distributed ledger technology in mainstream consciousness.\n\nOver time, the term “blockchain” was associated with any distributed ledger, even as the technology evolved to meet different user needs.\n\nMany of the articles about Corda referred to it as a blockchain-based technology.\n\n“While we were almost certainly guilty of slipping into this semantics trap now and again, we’ve said from the beginning that Corda is a distributed ledger platform, not a traditional blockchain platform,” the blog stated.\n\n“The marketing team at Canon must have spent countless hours working out how to stop people referring to all copy machines as Xeroxs,” it further noted.\n\nAlso read: R3 consortium’s blockchain initiative: What makes ‘Corda’ different?\n\nR3: We Used The Right Term\n\nRichard Brown, technology chief at R3, stated on Dec. 27, 2016:\n\n“Corda is a distributed ledger platform designed from the ground up to record, manage and synchronize financial agreements between regulated financial institutions. It is heavily inspired by and captures the benefits of blockchain systems, without the design choices that make blockchains inappropriate for many banking scenarios.”\n\nBlockchains are specific software pieces made to handle virtual currency transactions. R3 realized early on that it could not be blindly applied to financial markets without considering changes needed to meet privacy, regulatory and scalability issues.\n\nCorda was built to address financial services industry needs. It is inspired by and captures benefits of blockchain systems, but designed to meet the needs of regulated financial institutions.\n\nThe Merkle article noted that R3 still maintains a team with technological knowledge and will be able to come up with software that could improve the financial industry.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'This essay is an updated chapter from Luis Buenaventura’s Reinventing Remittances with Bitcoin, available for free in e-book and print form now.\n\nIf you’re just joining the Bitcoin train, it’s probably hard to imagine what the world of early 2014 was like. The largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, Mt. Gox, had just imploded and about $450 mln in customer funds had gone missing.\n\nThe market reaction to this catastrophic failure was both immediate and prolonged: Bitcoin price would tumble down a series of cliffs from a $1200 peak to a $180 floor over the next 12 months, shaking all but the hardiest of investors.\n\nUsing Bitcoin as a mode of transmission rather than a store of value\n\nPreventing such a precipitous loss of value was one of the primary goals of Bitreserve, the startup launched by Halsey Minor in late 2013. Unlike most of the community, the founder of CNET wanted to emphasize Bitcoin’s use as a mode of transmission rather than a store of value, which immediately put him at philosophical odds with purists and crypto-anarchists.\n\nBitreserve’s product strategy was to mimic the function of a Bitcoin wallet, while actually storing your coins’ value in your preferred fiat currency. Sending Bitcoin to a Bitreserve wallet would instantly peg it against, say, the US Dollar price at the time of transmission.\n\nIf the USD price for Bitcoin was $1,100 and you deposited 1 BTC, your Bitreserve account balance would read “$1,100” in perpetuity. When you wanted to spend some of those Bitcoins, Bitreserve would look up the USD-BTC price at that moment, and dynamically convert your dollars to Bitcoins as needed.\n\nThis meant that you avoided losses if the Bitcoin price happened to fall, but the converse was also true. When the price started to rise — as during the bull markets of late 2016 and these recent weeks — your money would be left behind, languishing in its fiat prison.\n\nBitreserve raised close to $10 mln before going through a major revamp in mid-2015. Anthony Watson, the former CIO of Nike, took over the CEO position, and rechristened the company “Uphold.com.” It maintained the original vision of Bitreserve but did so with greater reach and a brighter color palette.\n\nImportantly, they launched the Uphold Connect API, which allowed startups to build their own third-party financial products on top of their expanding network. Uphold was now essentially a wallet-as-a-service platform, allowing young entrepreneurs to build verticals without making large investments in the underlying infrastructure.\n\nTwo of those entrepreneurs were Antonio Garcia and Ruben Galindo Steckel, the founders of AirTM. “A year ago, [these] two young guys from Mexico City interned at Uphold’s San Francisco office,” writes Tim Parsa, Uphold’s head of Global Strategy and Markets, on the company blog. “A few months later they presented an idea for an app built on top of Uphold’s open API.”\n\n“Human ATM” and pegged currency balances\n\nAirTM combines two interesting ideas: Abra’s “human ATM” concept and Uphold’s pegged currency balances. It currently enables the flow of funds and exchange of currencies in some 62 countries, including Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, the US and China. Co-Founder Ruben Galindo Steckel explains that their focus is in helping people in “harsh currency regimes” who are in need of basic financial services.\n\nAirTM works by first connecting its customers with local “cashiers” in their country who can accept their cash deposits. Once the customer hands over their cash, the cashier will then send an equivalent amount of BTC to that customer’s balance on AirTM/Uphold.\n\nOnce “in the cloud,” the customer can manage their funds as they see fit. This strategy allows AirTM’s users to maintain their money in any currency they desired, which in the case of Argentina and Venezuela, usually means anything other than their own.\n\nHaving cashiers that are based in one or more of their supported countries allows AirTM to essentially facilitate self-service remittances. As long as the sending customer has money in the cloud, they can forward it to any beneficiary anywhere in the world. That beneficiary will then coordinate with their own local community of cashiers to receive funds in their desired currency.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises about AirTM is the average size of their transactions. According to Co-Founder Galindo Steckel, it’s just $36.\n\nThe global average remittance size is much higher, close to $200. The fact that AirTM’s average is small seems to indicate that they’ve found a way to sustainably facilitate micro-remittances via Bitcoin. That segment that has proven to be largely unreachable for traditional remittance providers like Western Union, whose $4 flat fees force customers to wait and batch their transactions instead of sending them as needed.\n\nWhen asked what other services AirTM had in store for its users, Galindo Steckel lists “debit cards, microloans and a mobile app” as near-term improvements that the team was already hard at work on.', 'A lot of people rely on the Coin Dance charts to check weekly bitcoin trading volumes. The platform tracks LocalBitcoins, Paxful, and BitSquare traders all over the world. In the most recent update, various new national currencies were added for all supported platforms. This change will give cryptocurrency enthusiasts a better overview of how things are developing in specific regions.\n\nAdding more national currencies to track for bitcoin trading volumes is a great move by Coin Dance. LocalBitcoins trades are the most popular as far as charts go on the platform. Enthusiasts can now track trades in 8 new different national currencies. The addition of the Naira is quite intriguing, as it goes to show the country is generating a ton of value. Then again, this is mostly due to the MMM Global Ponzi Scheme, which only accepts bitcoin deposits in Nigeria.\n\nTracking Bitcoin Trades In More National Currencies Than Before\n\nOther interesting countries to keep an eye on are Peru, Vietnam, and Indonesia. All of these regions can benefit from bitcoin adoption in one way or another. While it remains to be seen if bitcoin trades on LocalBitcoins can impact these economies, it is good to have more information at our disposal. The Coin Dance team also enables tracking of additional national currencies for BitSquare, in the form of CAD and NZD. Peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platforms are becoming more popular, that much is certain.\n\nAdditionally, the team added new currencies for the Paxful exchange platform as well. Tracking trades in CNY, JPY, NZD and AED is of great interest for sure. The United Arab Emirates have been relatively quiet on the bitcoin front so far. Then again, that does not mean the country is not warming up to bitcoin. Judging from the charts, it is evident there is some weekly Paxful volume in AED for quite some time now.\n\nIt is impossible to deny bitcoin makes an impact all over the world. While the trading volume may be smaller than people expect, it is worth keeping track of. It also goes to show peer-to-peer trading platforms are invaluable to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Centralized exchanges can be scrutinized by governments, whereas decentralized platforms do not hold onto customer funds.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'With cascading disruption and decentralization in the blockchain space the order of the day, IOHK, a leading blockchain research and development company, and the University of Edinburgh are to invest between $500,000 and $1 million (m) a year in the project located within the School of Informatics at the Scottish institution that was founded in 1582.\n\nGoing forward there are plans for more such centres to be opened this year and into 2018, including ones slated for Greece and the United States.\n\nThe signing of the partnership deal between IOHK, an engineering company that builds cryptocurrencies and blockchains for academic institutions, corporations and governments, and the Scottish university to establish the institution’s first blockchain centre to boost research into cryptocurrencies and solve business problems around blockchain technology, follows a recent partnership struck less than two weeks ago with the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan\'s leading technology university.\n\nIt also comes after the School of Informatics, one of seven schools in the College of Science and Engineering at Edinburgh and one of the largest in Europe, won a share of £350m (c.$437m) investment in UK science and engineering postgraduate training in 2013. This enabled it to host two Centres of Doctoral Training and co-host a further centre with Heriot-Watt University, a public university in Edinburgh established in 1821 and the world\'s first mechanics\' institute.\n\nEdinburgh University, as the sixth oldest university in the English-speaking world, has been associated over the years through its alumni and academic staff, with some of the most significant scientific contributions in human history.\n\nThese include laying the foundations of quantum mechanics (Max Born), the theory of evolution (Charles Darwin), invention of the telephone (Alexander Graham Bell) as well as the classical theory of electromagnetism (James Clerk Maxwell) to name a few amongst the notables.\n\nStart-Ups & Spin-Outs\n\nAs well as attracting investment into the School, which offers undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses in Informatics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cognitive Science, Computational Science and Software Engineering, the facility has encouraged over 60 start-ups and spin-outs over the past seven years.\n\nIOHK, which was founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood in 2015 and initially incorporated in Hong Kong, is “committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to 3 billion or so people who don’t have them” according to a blurb on their website.\n\nOver the past two years IOHK has grown and is today dispersed around the globe. In addition to a key office in Japan, there are a number of people involved with the organization based in London and other parts of Europe as well as in Russia, South America, the US and China. Over the next 12-24 months it is understood that the company will be expanding beyond these territories.\n\nBlockchain Tech Lab’s Roadmap\n\nWhile the investment in the Blockchain Technology Laboratory is to be split between the university and IOHK, the majority is of being funded by the engineering company. The centre will be lead by Professor Aggelos Kiayias, Chair in Cyber Security and Privacy at the University of Edinburgh and IOHK’s Chief Scientist, along with IOHK\'s CEO Hoskinson.\n\nThe lab will be inter-disciplinary so that professors from other fields will contribute and be able to train undergraduate to post-doctoral and professor level. Ultimately the plan is to scale up, so they collaborate with a global network of academics based in IOHK\'s other centres such as in Tokyo and beyond that the company has plans to open later this year and into next.\n\nBlockchain R&D\n\nAcademics and students are to be brought together to collaborate on blockchain research and development with a focus on what are described as ""industry inspired problems"". In so doing talent will be nurtured in the blockchain space by having world class teaching offered by the university\'s professors. There is also a desire to bring in governments for wide-ranging collaborations.\n\nCommenting on the partnership Hoskinson said: ""It will develop IOHK’s core business area, cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related technologies, and nurture and develop the global talent in these areas in the United Kingdom.”\n\nThe research lab in Scotland will also serve as the headquarters for IOHK’s growing network of global university partnerships. Illustrative of this, Tokyo Institute of Technology launched a similar centre with IOHK in mid February 2017.\n\nAs the lab\'s Director, Professor Kiayias is responsible for organizing collaborations with fellow academics at the university and to oversee researchers and students from undergraduate to PhD level in a broad range of topics related to blockchain systems. Research collaborations will be interdisciplinary and will include - beyond cryptography and computer science - economics, game theory, regulation and compliance, business and law.\n\nThe lab will provide a direct connection between developers and researchers, helping to get projects live faster and aims to ""pursue outreach projects"" with entrepreneurs in Edinburgh’s local technology community.\n\nRecruiting and outreach will begin immediately and the full facility will be operational from summer 2017, which will be located in the School of Informatics’ newly refurbished Appleton Tower.\n\nProfessor Kiayias speaking in the wake of the collaboration on blockchain technology between the School of Informatics and IOHK, said: “Distributed ledgers is an upcoming disruptive technology that can scale information services to a global level. The academic and industry connection forged by this collaboration puts the Blockchain Technology Lab at Edinburgh at the forefront of innovation in blockchain systems.”\n\nIOHK indicated that it is committed to developing industry standards and best practices that progress the field of cryptography. In contrast to other industry-university partnerships, IOHK’s collaboration with Edinburgh ensures that all funded R&D will be ""open source and patent-free.""\n\nJeremy Wood, IOHK’s co-founder, claimed: “Our partnership with the University of Edinburgh provides unique opportunities for current students to become the next generation of blockchain and cryptography leaders.""\n\nHe added: ""As a headquarters for IOHK’s international academic research community, we expect to see the university facilitate innovative projects that drive how businesses and governments approach blockchain and cryptocurrencies.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Albeit that is not entirely surprising, things are getting out of hand as of late. Looking at the chart on blockchain.info, the total transaction fees paid to miners have surpassed US$150,000 in 2017. That is a ridiculous amount, yet it will keep increasing steadily until the block size issue is resolved.\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin, it was evident transaction fees would overtake block rewards at some point. To be more precise, his code indicated this would not occur for the next 100-or-so years. Unfortunately, things are working out very differently. Transaction fees have grown exponentially as of late, which does not bode well for those looking to use BTC as a currency.\n\nTransaction Fees Are Growing Exponentially\n\nOver the past two years, the total transaction fees on the network have increased fiftyfold. Such explosive growth is rather strange, yet it also highlights an underlying problem. With the block size remaining one MB for now, paying a higher transaction fee slowly becomes the new normal. For miners, this is somewhat good news, as they will earn slightly more money in the process. For consumers, this makes using bitcoin more expensive than it needs to be.\n\nAlbeit an increase in transaction fees shouldn’t surprise anyone, these numbers are rather worrisome. Keeping all transaction fees combined below the US$10,000 level seemed very likely for some time. In fact, things only got out of hand from 2016 onwards. As the bitcoin network grows, more transactions take place, all of which need to be included in network blocks.\n\nGiven the “limited space’ every block has, network congestion occurs more often than before. Bypassing this artificial blockage requires paying higher fees. In the end, this scenario creates an endless circle that will force users to pay more fees until a solution is found.\n\nSolving the problem is not an easy task, though. It is evident the current situation can’t be maintained for much longer. Removing the block size altogether is one option, according to some Reddit users. Scaling bitcoin remains a critical problem that requires action sooner rather than later. These political games have gone on long enough, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
02/27/2017,"['Bitcoin is a digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoins are “mined” by individuals and companies running sophisticated computers solving mathematical problems. Bitcoins have a number of defining characteristics including:\n\n• It is decentralized meaning there are not any institutions controlling the currency.\n\n• It is transparent because of blockchain technology.\n\n• It is fast way to transfer funds and the transaction fees are diminutive.\n\nWhile bitcoins are used as currency to purchase services and products, they are also a potential asset class. According to Angelo Robles, founder and CEO of the Family Office Association, “We’re seeing a growing number of single-family offices – especially those with greater assets – invest in less traditional assets such as bitcoin. There are a number of overlapping rationales for these single-family offices to invest in bitcoins. For example, there’s a fixed supply of bitcoins, more businesses are accepting the currency, and more and more investors from hedge funds to institutional players are looking at bitcoins as a way to diversify a portfolio. Also, bitcoin benefits by being first on the scene and establishing a beachhead of sorts.”\n\n“Investments in Bitcoin and its related assets – which are uncorrelated to other assets in the traditional family portfolio – can provide diversification, but investors need to understand the risks,” says David Berger, Chairman of the Digital Currency Council. “Bitcoin will have a binary outcome – it’ll either be a grand slam or it’ll crash – and there will be lots of volatility along the way. I don’t view Bitcoin as suitable for a family seeking wealth preservation, but see it more similarly to a high risk high reward venture investment and as a way to diversify a portfolio.”\n\n“While a growing number of single-family offices are investing in bitcoins and other decentralized digital currencies, some are choosing to invest in companies that are building the technology and infrastructure,” says Berger. “The ecosystem developing around this new asset class is growing very quickly.”', 'A customer of an Australian bank walks away after withdrawing money from an ATM next to a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nBlockchains track, record, and secure transactions made within the virtual currency Bitcoin. They can also help defend many critical systems from devastating cyberattacks.\n\n—Given the recent cyberattacks on critical infrastructure around the world such as the Christmas 2016 power outage in Ukraine, which left more than 200,000 people in the dark, the task of protecting vital systems and networks has become an issue of pressing global importance.\n\nMeeting that challenge requires improving digital security standards and practices across all industries. It also demands investing in the newest and most promising technologies such as blockchains.\n\nThough Bitcoin gets most of the press, the technology undergirding it – blockchains – has the potential to transform business, and maybe even revolutionize cybersecurity.\n\nA blockchain is simply an online ledger, e.g., a distributed database of who owns what. The database is separated into transactions, called blocks. Once a new block is added to the chain, the data in the block cannot be changed, the digital equivalent of etching a Bitcoin transaction in stone.\n\nFrom making businesses more efficient to recording property deeds to securing medical devices, a range of huge organizations are investigating in new ways to deploy blockchain technology. Startups in the space have attracted more than $1 billion in funding. Even the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon\'s experimental brain trust, is researching blockchain technology to ""create an unhackable messaging system.""\n\nBut to date, relatively few firms are exploring the application of blockchain technology to help safeguard critical infrastructure. That needs to change, both on the part of US business leaders and policymakers.\n\nOne example of this kind of innovation is already underway. The cybersecurity firm Guardtime uses blockchain technology to secure Britain’s power grid, including its nuclear power plants and flood defenses. Guardtime uses blockchain technology known as Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) to detect “unauthorized changes in software configurations [by] ... providing a complete chain of the history of the data that is generated and transmitted.”\n\nEstonia is also using Guardtime\'s approach and looking into ways blockchains can authenticate marriage records and health data. US critical infrastructure operators and policymakers could learn from Estonia’s experimentation, while understanding the limitations of the technology.\n\nThe anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto outlined the protocol that leveraged peer-to-peer technology to create Bitcoin. It\'s a deceptively simple innovation that ""set off a spark that has excited, terrified, or otherwise captured the imagination of the computing world and has spread like wildfire."" Netscape cocreator Marc Andreessen called the innovation “the distributed trust network that the internet always needed and never had.”\n\nIndeed, blockchains have the potential to, according to the Economist, “transform how people and businesses cooperate.” Such an outcome is by no means predetermined with an array of technological, economic, political, and governance issues to be overcome.\n\nUndoubtedly, there is significant hype associated with blockchains, and they will be improperly deployed in some scenarios where a more traditional ledger might be suitable. However, in security, there is frequently a need for an authentic log of data, transactions, and records. If the authenticity of such records is mutable by a few authorities, then there is concern that targeted foul play can lead to untrustworthy records. Alternately, in some scenarios there are few clear authorities that should be trusted to establish authenticity – and those authorities may not themselves have mutual trust – meaning that a more grassroots approach is necessary.\n\nStill, the promise of this technology, especially in the context of enhancing cybersecurity in critical infrastructure systems, deserves our sustained attention. In other words, a sustainable blockchain edifice will not be built overnight, it will take ongoing attention by numerous stakeholders – including policymakers – over a period of years, perhaps decades. But by starting now, block-by-block, we can build trust in an age that has to date been defined by increasing cyber insecurity.\n\nScott Shackelford is an associate professor of business law and ethics at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business, as well as director of the Ostrom Workshop Program on Cybersecurity and Internet Governance, and Cybersecurity Program Chair of IU’s MS in Cybersecurity Risk Management.

This means there is little risk that bitcoin users’ wallets will be impacted by a change in monetary policy – or that their savings will be taken away completely.\n\nThird, bitcoin is encrypted. Each ""coin"" has a ""private key"" – a secret number known solely to the individual who created it. Only the owner of a coin’s private key is able to spend those funds, and must confirm that a transaction is legitimate via a mathematically generated signature.\n\nFinally, bitcoin is not just a currency – it is also a payment system. Bitcoins can be created and transacted – at high speeds and low costs – within the same network. All transactions are then detailed on a huge ledger called the blockchain, which is visible to all.\n\nIs bitcoin anonymous?\n\nNot exactly. While real-life identities are not used, all payments are made to bitcoin addresses – virtual pseudonyms – that are publicly stored on the blockchain. Users can complicate this by setting up multiple bitcoin addresses, but this still does not provide complete anonymity.\n\nWho can create bitcoins?\n\nIn theory, anybody with a computer.\n\nIt takes a lot of computer power (and time) to run the blockchain effectively but as there is no central authority, it is no single person or organisation\'s responsibility to expend the power, time and money necessary. This is where the so-called ""miners"" come in - they opt to provide their own computer power and time, along with their own energy costs, in hope that a pay-off (of course in the form of bitcoin!) will make it worthwhile.\n\nWhy has bitcoin hit an all-time high?\n\nNobody seems sure, though there are several possibilities.\n\nBitcoin has traditionally been considered an asset that -- like gold, the Swiss franc and Japan\'s yen -- tend to perform well when stock markets, which are considered riskier, sell off.\n\nPerhaps unusually though, several US benchmark stock indices – including the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 – all registered record highs last week.This could indicate that bitcoin is beginning to act in-line with stock markets, as more businesses view it as a credible form of payment.\n\nAnother factor at play is the recent regulatory crackdown by Chinese authorities. Bitcoin has proved incredibly popular in China and the Chinese market accounts for much of the world\'s bitcoin trading volumes, but this has long been a thorn in the government’s side. Earlier this year, Chinese regulators implemented tighter controls on the currency but bitcoin rallied regardless. Some speculate that the crack-down wasn\'t as widely anticipated. Others say that plenty of trading happens away from regulated exchanges making it hard for authorities to control.\n\nBusiness picture of the day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 show all Business picture of the day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/7 Bitcoin saw a volatile week in which it reached highs of $11,000 before dropping down by more than a fifth on Wednesday.\n\n2/7 Jeremy Corbyn told investment bank Morgan Stanley that it is right to regard him as a threat.\n\n3/7 RBS announced plans to close 259 branches, costing 680 jobs, in response to customers migrating towards online and mobile-banking services. In total, 62 RBS branches and 197 NatWest outlets will be shuttered by the middle of next year.\n\n4/7 Thousands of Morrisons staff are due a payout after a court ruled that the supermarket was liable for a huge data leak. Disgruntled colleague Andrew Skelton leaked the payroll data of nearly 100,000 staff in 2014, including names, addresses, bank account details and salaries. Morrisons had denied liability in the case, which had been brought by 5,518 current and former staff.\n\n5/7 Mark Carney warned that Brexit could reduce the bonuses bankers receive after Britain leaves the EU\n\n6/7 Victoria Beckham’s fashion business received a cash injection of £30m from an investment firm spearheaded by the man behind the rise of French bakery Paul in the UK. Funding from private equity group NEO Investment Partners will go towards opening more Victoria Beckham-branded stores and expanding the fashion retailer’s online presence, the company said.\n\n7/7 Fortnum & Mason faces recruitment crisis as EU nationals look to leave UK, according to their chief executive Ewan Venters\n\nThe bitcoin community is also awaiting news from the US, where the Winklevoss brothers hope that their bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) – the first of its kind in the US – will receive regulatory approval. The cryptocurrency’s record high may suggest that traders are preparing for a positive verdict at the hearing on 11 March. That could result in more investors being able to snap up bitcoin.', 'A rare addition to Russia’s Bitcoin ATM count has appeared in the country’s second city of St. Petersburg.\n\nThe machine, operated by cryptocurrency exchange Bitlish, provides Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Zcash purchasing facilities with an automatically-updating exchange rate.\n\nThe machine can be found in a shopping center at Sredny Prospekt V.O. 36, located on the city’s Vasilevsky Island.\n\nThe installation is likely a result of Bitlish’s push for more ATMs in Russia, which due to legal concerns has hosted only a couple of machines. The exchange demonstrated its fleet of ATMs at a recent conference in Moscow, but as yet no official information is available regarding any of their locations. No Russian machines are currently on CoinATMRadar’s listings.\n\nA request for confirmation and more information about the ATM did not immediately return a reply from Bitlish.\n\nThe installation in itself is a sign of changing times regarding Russia’s relationship with cryptocurrency. Having previously de facto banned it as a “surrogate” alternative to the ruble, the country’s central bank this year signaled a new perspective. Constructive regulation, it said, would be its policy going forward, and an all-out ban would be counterproductive if even possible.', 'Last week Bucharest hosted d10e, the leading conference on decentralization. John McAfee, a cybersecurity legend and a CEO of MGT Capital Investments, was among the conference key speakers. He shared his thoughts on the future of decentralization in cryptocurrency and cyber security space.\n\nDecentralization is indeed often seen as paramount for privacy and cybersecurity in the 21st century. Especially with the continuously coming news about billions of accounts being hacked in centralized systems.\n\n“I am 100 percent certain that it could not be Russians”\n\nAccording to US intelligence officials, it was certainly Russian hackers who made repeated attempts to get into country’s major state institutions, including the White House and the state department to interfere in last year’s presidential elections.\n\nMcAfee says that there is (surprise!) a chance that it was not Russians. In his opinion, it would be nearly impossible to determine the source of the hack if the hacker has had any sophistication whatsoever.\n\nMcAfee says:\n\n“If it was the Russian state that did the hack, I know well that the Russian state is sophisticated enough to, first of all, not to use a piece of software that is a year and a half out of date and has been updated five times, secondly, not to leave the Russian language inside the code, and third, not to leave the compile, date and time, which leads us to the conclusion that the hacker was in Moscow. I am 100 percent certain that it could not be Russians for these very reasons.”\n\nHackers were sending out phishing emails hoping that someone would click providing an access to the data. John Podesta, the Chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign was one of those who unintentionally helped sneak into tens of thousands of his emails, which were published on the WikiLeaks website before the election subsequently damaging Clinton’s campaign.\n\nThe US officials are certain that Russians again were the only ones who had a motive to interfere in these presidential elections but so did many Americans, or Chinese, or anybody else for that matter.\n\nFor a second, let’s look at the hackers that actually have been caught, for example, a 15 years old Ukrainian boy, who hacked the Federal Bureau of Investigation and took the names, addresses, fingerprints, photographs, phone numbers, social security numbers of every single undercover FBI agent and published them on the dark web.\n\n“I want to be the first person to be hacked”\n\nAlright, most of us are not involved in political games and have no sensitive data that could alternate the outcome of state elections, but we are still concerned about our security and privacy. So, what does one do to protect themselves and their data?\n\nMcAfee says:\n\n“It is actually the matter of what we don’t do, rather than what we DO do. I have a phone, a smart phone and I am aware enough to know that everybody in the world is listening over my smartphone. Especially since I published my phone number in Business Insider last year. Why did I do that? Because I invite hackers in. Once they are inside my system, I get a chance to work on the software and techniques. I am sort of the world number one target for hackers. If there will be a hack tomorrow, I’ll have to find out how they did that. So I want to be the first person to be hacked with any new software, so I can keep up to date with what hackers are thinking, with what they are doing.”\n\nWe are using all kinds of smart devices – almost everyone is equipped with a smartwatch, tablet, and smartphone. As a result, we get submitted to all kinds of phishing schemes, compromises of screen capture.\n\nBeyond that, a microphone on our devices is almost always on, which exposes us to being listened to. McAfee emphasizes that all organized hacking groups have really sophisticated data analysis systems:\n\n“It is not the human who is listening to you, it is not the human who is watching you upfront, it is the software that is looking for keywords. A simple phrase “I’ll meet you at a Congress tomorrow” provides hackers with a set of keywords. Some human is going to meet another human tomorrow at this time at this place – one of them might be an American congressman. Beside that we are being listened to, we are being watched and monitored by the computers, there are many hackers in the world and we are all compromised. These massive data analysis systems are listening to us, filtering, watching, looking for keywords.”\n\nOur mobile phones and computers designed to spy on!\n\nIn the last few years, we have managed to build and develop genius decentralizing technologies, take Blockchain for example, but the question puzzling many is whether these technologies are secure enough from cyber criminals.\n\nMany in the financial industry are so enthusiastic to rip out old systems and replace them with quicker and cheaper Blockchain technology, but is it that bullet-proof?\n\nMcAfee explains that what we have done for the distributed systems, and more specifically, things like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, what we have done by depending upon the existing mobile devices and personal computers is the equivalent of when the automobile was invented, but we still used horse carriages to move them around.\n\nHe continues:\n\n“That’s exactly where we are – for cryptocurrency to be universally accepted we cannot rely on existing facilities. It is madness, it makes no difference how secure your system is or how clever you have been in creating a hack-proof application, hack-proof Blockchain, or a hack-proof cryptocurrency, it doesn’t matter if you are running them on a device designed to spy on.”\n\nIn his opinion, cryptocurrencies have to evolve into a separate hardware, into a separate software. If we want this technology to be secure, we have to change the paradigm; we have to realize that along with developing applications we have to develop a new platform, we cannot use the existing facilities:\n\n“It is the equivalent of building a missile defense system and choosing to float it in the ocean so all I have to do is sink your platform - yes, your missile defense system is bulletproof, but in this case, it is totally useless.”\n\nOn fake news\n\nRecently there has been booming of fabricated news stories presented as serious journalism, which is not only helping some writers to make money, what is worse – they are influencing and shaping public opinion.\n\nThe printed press is being taken over by the Internet. If something is happening somewhere, the first source to turn to for updates is the online news platforms. How do we find, however, a reliable source of information that we can turn to for facts?\n\nMcAfee comments:\n\n“What everyone is doing now is kind of stealing the news and making it look like the subject of the news is a horrific person. If we just dig enough into the story, we are all going to be shocked, but that sells and that’s the tragedy of it. We do not take the time to cross-reference the things we read, the things that we see on the Internet, we just blindly suck it all in. But we can’t do that anymore, we have to start taking responsibility for ourselves, for our actions, not just in terms of understanding the fake news, but more importantly for protecting ourselves, protecting our privacy and protecting our security.”\n\nMcAfee shares his concern that a few people actually do that, as we would rather abdicate this responsibility to our smart devices and software because of being afraid to take our own responsibility.\n\nTo tech devs: “Wake up, see the reality”\n\nThere have been a lot of discussions about the ongoing decentralization in various industries. McAfee thinks, however, that what we are actually building is moving in the opposite direction:\n\n“Yes we are decentralizing technologically, but there are people who think: “Yeah, great! Keep doing that, because I know how to put it all back together to own you forever, your children and your grandchildren”, he explains. “We have to wake up and see the truth of this.”\n\nAll those developing decentralizing technologies are for sure building wonderful things that will change the world (and actually are already changing the world). McAfee says that it is important, however, to keep both feet on the ground to be able to understand own limitations as well as the limitations of technology:', 'Earlier this month, the Filipino government issued regulatory guidelines concerning Bitcoin use in the country. The guidelines were welcomed by startups in the country, as official clarity and endorsement of the cryptocurrency are expected to help companies that had previously operated in a regulatory gray area.\n\nIn its Guidelines for Virtual Currency (VC) Exchanges, the Bangko Sentral stated that it “recognizes that Virtual Currency (VC) systems have the potential to revolutionize delivery of financial services, particularly for payments and remittance, in view of their ability to provide faster and more economical transfer of funds, both domestic and international, and may further support financial inclusion.”\n\nThe Bangko Sentral also noted that it considers virtual currencies at risk for use in money laundering and terrorist financing and said it will not endorse Bitcoin or other VCs as currency, given that they are not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or backed by commodities.\n\nThe guidelines instituted reporting and security standards, though these will likely need to be expanded as the use cases for Bitcoin grow in the country.\n\n“The circular is a big first step forward,” said Miguel Cuneta, cofounder of Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI) and Bitcoin Organization Philippines (BOP). The latter group has held numerous discussions with Bangko Sentral during the past several years on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies’ potential roles in the Philippines’ development.\n\n“The BSP knows that Bitcoin as a technology will be almost impossible to regulate, and they basically sat down with us and hammered down the best possible way to regulate, and in effect, legitimize, the industry itself,” Cuneta said. “What they did was to regulate the points of entry and exit of Bitcoin and other crypto to Philippine pesos, which makes a lot of sense on their end. Of course, there is also consumer protection and anti-money laundering to consider, and they made provisions for that, too.”\n\nOut of the shadows\n\nHowever, some questioned whether the regulations were expansive enough. The government circular primarily addresses Bitcoin’s use in remittances, but leaves out other uses - a gap which could create long-term problems in the fintech industry, according to Luis Buenaventura, chief technology officer of Bloom Solutions (formerly head of product at SCI) and author of the book “Reinventing Remittances With Bitcoin.”\n\n“I do fear that new concepts that come down the road will be stifled by this,” Buenaventura said. “I fear it will deter people from using blockchain and Bitcoin in their startups, or they’ll fly under the radar.”\n\nBuenaventura said that compliance standards for remittance companies are stringent, and small startups that use Bitcoin in their processes but don’t provide remittance services will likely be unwilling or incapable of putting resources toward meeting those standards. Those that don’t abandon the concept may find themselves in the same gray zone the recent discussions and circular were designed to eliminate.\n\nThe push for regulatory clarity was driven “primarily so Bitcoin could come out of the shadows,” Buenaventura said. “We weren’t operating in the shadows because we wanted to.” Without official government acknowledgement of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Buenaventura said startups who use the technology often struggled to work with traditional financial institutions.\n\n“Every Bitcoin startup in the entire region has problems with their banks,” he said. In some cases, access to funds would be paused and in others, the businesses would not be given access to banking services period. “One of the excuses they give is, ‘No legislation covers you guys, so we’re not comfortable covering you,’” Buenaventura said.\n\nThat’s why the circular represented real progress, even if it was narrow in its scope. As Sam Kaddoura, chief financial officer at SCI, put it, the official regulation “legitimizes Bitcoin.”\n\nBuenaventura also said it was significant, given that the government is expending resources to address issues that cover a very small sector of businesses at the moment.\n\n“They’re making a long-term bet that this will have some effect down the road,” he said. “I guess we’re a noisy minority.”', 'Bitcoin price looks poised to break down from its consolidation pattern as volatility is returning to the markets.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has previously consolidated inside a symmetrical triangle formation and is showing signs of breaking out.\n\nPrice looks ready to head back south as it is trying to move below the 100 SMA dynamic support.\n\nOscillators are also hinting that bearish momentum is building up.\n\nBitcoin price looks poised to break down from its consolidation pattern as volatility is returning to the markets.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA on the 1-hour time frame, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The 100 SMA also lines up with the symmetrical triangle support but bitcoin price seems to be crashing below this area at the moment as signs of rally exhaustion are seen on the longer-term charts.\n\nStochastic is heading south from the overbought zone, which means that buyers are taking a break and allowing sellers to take control. Similarly, RSI is turning lower so bitcoin price could follow suit and test the next area of interest at the 200 SMA dynamic support. A move below the $1100 area could complete a double top formation on this time frame and signal further losses.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe US dollar regained some ground against its peers, including bitcoin, even after US President Trump admitted that they are not ready to announce tax reform plans just yet. He did hint that they would unveil their spending plans for infrastructure and security in his upcoming speech in front of the joint sessions of Congress later today.\n\nData from the US economy has been mixed but policymakers continue to talk about the need to hike interest rates sooner rather than later, thereby driving up demand for the US currency versus bitcoin price as well. The big event for today is likely to be Trump’s testimony, although headlines from China could also move the markets as well. Note that industry PMI readings are up for release midweek and this tends to influence overall market sentiment.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Meet the two SEC commissioners who will decide whether to approve or reject the bitcoin ETF.\n\nDr. Michael Piwowar is a rare specimen, so being the only trained economist among a chamber full of lawyers at the SEC. He earned a Ph.D from Penn State University, served in President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers and then became slightly more political, joining as a staffer for Republican Senators, not unlike Kara Stein, the second commissioner, who was an aid to a Democratic senator.\n\nPiwowar appears to have been introduced to the blockchain around July 2016. In a speech at the Quadrilateral Meeting in London, he briefly mentions it by name, stating he learned from the “discussion of blockchain technology and virtual currencies,” then swiftly moves on to banking regulations, but not before stating that he was pushing for a FinTech roundtable.\n\nThat roundtable was held in November 2016 when Piwowar remarked that “our financial regulatory structure is a fragmented, sometimes contradictory, alphabet soup.” He urged the SEC to take a leading role, stating “[t]he great potential of FinTech should not be hindered by our current regulatory structure,” before adding:\n\n“[T]he Commission should take the lead regulatory role in the FinTech space. Many of the firms pursuing FinTech are already SEC registrants, and others are providing services that are squarely within the Commission’s oversight, such as investment advice and trading and settlement functionalities. And we are the only agency with a mission that explicitly includes facilitating capital formation. In that regard, our recent crowdfunding initiatives provide us the relevant experience and expertise for understanding the regulatory challenges.”\n\nIt appears fairly obvious the commissioner is a big fan of the wider Fintech space. Whether that extends to bitcoin, specifically, is not very clear. However, it appears likely that, regardless of the commissioner’s own views on bitcoin, he probably will lean more towards giving the market freedom to trade and thus approve the ETF.\n\nKara Stein\n\nThe second commissioner, Kara Stein, has a more traditional background for the SEC. A Yale law graduate, and a Democrat, Stein appears to have been aware of bitcoin as early as November 2015, and probably earlier, when she gave a speech at Harvard Law School on technology innovation, including blockchains. Striking a somewhat cautious tone, Stein says:\n\n“For every innovation promising benefits, there are potential uncertainties and drawbacks. The Commission and market participants should be working together to surf this wave of innovation, rather than being overcome by it.”\n\nExcept for mentioning bitcoin by name, Stein says little, if anything, regarding the digital currency, but appears to have a somewhat favorable view of blockchain technology. Stein states:\n\nIt could be used to overhaul areas like securities clearing and settlements, payment processing by banks, and cumbersome loan transactions. It has the power potentially to increase quality and facilitate trust.\n\nIn particular, Stein appears to believe that blockchain technology can add transparency and thus potentially increase the effectiveness and enforceability of regulations. Stein says:\n\n“While I am not advocating for the adoption or effectiveness of blockchain technology, it appears to offer potential. One can imagine a world in which securities lending, repo, and margin financing are all traceable through blockchain’s transparent and open approach to tracking transactions. That could revolutionize regulators’ approach to monitoring systemic risk in these areas, including the oversight of collateral reuse, to name just one potential use.”\n\nHow Will They Likely Decide?\n\nThe SEC’s treatment of the currency might be indicative of the wider regulatory attitude by the United States. So far, they have been very restrictive, especially when compared to UK. Regulated exchanges, such as Coinbase and Gemini, for example, are still not allowed to provide margins or futures for no apparent reason.\n\nThe new administration might usher in a new attitude and there are some indications that might be the case. Piwowar, the current SEC acting chairman, appears favorable to this space, using a language more at home with UK regulators than US regulators when describing the Fintech industry. His attempts at further clarification regarding crowdfunding rules are also helpful. One hopes he continues further, especially in the context of eth based ICOs.\n\nAs such, although it is difficult to fully judge, it appears he is probably more in favor of approving, rather than rejecting, the ETF, so leaning towards giving the market greater freedom, especially considering that decisions on whether to invest on the ETF would probably be made with the aid of experienced and sophisticated brokers/advisors.\n\nStein, on the other hand, uses the more traditional US regulatory language which often emphasizes responsible innovation, implying in a subtle way that we are somehow irresponsible. It’s difficult to say what her views are on the Bitcoin ETF, but if I was a betting man, I’d say she leans more towards rejection.\n\nHowever, a vote for rejection would probably be a very difficult decision for either of the two commissioners, unless there is a very good reason, as this is a significant event and would probably act as an indication of how US authorities now view this space.\n\nAfter their double taxation with the IRS, the disastrous BitLicense, their continued refusal to allow very responsible exchanges to provide margins and futures, another blow by US regulators would probably invite calls for responsible regulations. As such, Stein might heed her own words:\n\n“Just like the role we played in the development of the Internet, the U.S. should strive to be at the center of how the new financial market is framed and regulated. We are at a similar moment in time for financial markets. If we do not lead, someone else will.”\n\nThat someone has been the UK on the regulatory front and China in regards to margins and futures trading, but, American citizens have driven much of this innovation, therefore, we’d all like them to benefit and enjoy responsible regulators.\n\nWhether they will be able to, in regards to the ETF, rests solely on these two individuals who have to decide whether they will lead or whether they will instead continue to send the new generation’s innovation away. We could find out at any time, with a conclusive decision no later than 11th of March, now just under two weeks.\n\nImages from Shutterstock and the SEC.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
02/28/2017,"['Marco Streng’s computer servers are what make Ethereum tick.\n\nThousands strong, they whir day and night, solving the complex math riddles that are essential to verifying transactions on the hottest new platform in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Without these machines, or those deployed by Streng’s biggest rivals, there would be no Ethereum.\n\nBut mining, as the practice is called, is costly and inefficient and, frankly, a bit weird. And Ethereum’s developers have always envisioned a time in which the cumbersome process of brute-force computing would be replaced by a system that relies simply on collateral. That time, some four years after the network was first proposed, is now. The developers want to put this “proof-of-stake” model, called Casper, into place by year-end.\n\nThe stakes are high. If Ethereum is going to take advantage of the potential that companies like JPMorgan, Microsoft and IBM see in its underlying transaction technology, the blockchain, as the potential backbone that could reshape modern business and finance, it needs to gain wide adoption to become something of a de facto standard.\n\nWithout mining, Ethereum “will be more usable, more secure and more scalable too,” said Vlad Zamfir, who’s been working on Casper since 2014.\n\nSecure Transactions\n\nThe main draw of the blockchain is that it’s a cryptographically secured list of transactions that can be shared, which backers say could dramatically improve how financial services, supply-chain and health-care industries are run. (Think immediate settlement of bank transfers and securities trades, as well as near-real-time tracking of food products or research samples.) Ethereum also allows for the use of “smart contracts,” or pieces of computer code that make the terms of such agreements operate automatically.\n\nMiners have been critical to the growth of Ethereum. The market for ether, the digital currency used to pay miners who support the network, has soared 90 percent this year alone. It’s the second-most popular cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, which has gained 24 percent in the same span, setting records almost every day as investors look to hedge against potential global uncertainty and hope for a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund to get regulatory approval.\n\nEven before Ethereum was first released in 2015, developers had envisioned moving away from the mining-based model, known among tech geeks as “proof-of-work.”\n\nTougher Computations\n\nAs the network gets more popular, the computations the miners need to complete to validate transactions get harder and harder. Not only has this created the potential for bottlenecks, like those already plaguing bitcoin, but it’s also set off an environmentally taxing arms race among the biggest miners, which run server farms consuming vast amounts of electricity.\n\nAnd to many techno-utopian enthusiasts, using all that computing power to continually solve what amounts to pointless problems is a big waste.\n\nThat’s where Casper comes in.\n\nRather than rewarding miners with the most computing power, the “proof-of-stake” model requires that users put up collateral if they want to collect fees for validating transactions. The more collateral you put up, the more money you can get paid for verifying transactions.\n\nIt would take power away from miners like Streng, who have to approve software changes, and make it easier to implement improvements on the fly. A handful of bitcoin miners in China have already hamstrung some attempts to increase that cryptocurrency’s capacity. (Miners can’t vote against the switch.)\n\nThe move will make Ethereum “more attractive in large-scale applications,” said William Mougayar, author of “The Business Blockchain.”\n\nHyperledger, a blockchain venture with more than than 100 members including IBM, JPMorgan and American Express, could adopt Ethereum’s “proof-of-stake” model if it’s successful, according to Brian Behlendorf, the consortium’s executive director. It could also help put the network in “a league of our own,” Andrew Keys, head of global business development at startup ConsenSys, the world’s largest Ethereum-centric blockchain software engineering company.\n\nNo Sure Thing\n\nMaking “proof-of-stake” work is hardly a foregone conclusion.\n\nCasper’s rollout has been delayed before. And the use of deposits potentially increases the risk of hacking. (While Zamfir said he’s working to make sure hackers can’t steal deposits, he couldn’t rule out the possibility, however remote, that an attack could, in effect, delete the money.)\n\nStreng, who stands to lose out if Casper is implemented, is wary.\n\n“There’s a lot of incentive for people to game the system,” he said.\n\nTrust in Ethereum was badly shaken last summer, when a hacker stole millions from a project called the DAO. Developers had to rush to implement a software change, which ended up splitting the Ethereum community in two. Now, each operates its own, separate blockchain.\n\nZamfir says the benefits outweigh the risks. One of the biggest is “transaction finality.” Unlike most blockchain technologies, which require multiple verifications, settlement on Casper can occur much faster. With some enhancements, the feature could ultimately enable Ethereum to process more payments faster -- a key selling point for financial companies.\n\n‘Early Stages’\n\nMona El Isa, a former Goldman Sachs trader who runs Melonport AG, which builds software for fund managers who invest in digital assets on Ethereum, is confident that developers can work out any kinks with Casper.\n\n“In these early stages of this new technology, you can’t expect everything to go right,” El Isa said.\n\nIf Casper ultimately happens, Streng says it won’t be the end of the world. He can redeploy his servers to mine other cryptocurrencies or become a depositor on Ethereum instead. But he isn’t holding his breath just yet. Implementing such a sweeping change isn’t going to be easy and it’s still possible the plan could be scrapped altogether, he says.\n\n“The developers have very bright minds,” he said. Nevertheless, “they wouldn’t risk the Ethereum network, in my opinion.”', 'While Bitcoin, and particularly Blockchain, awareness and interest are on the rise, in the global scheme of things these are still relatively novel and new technologies.\n\nBitcoin averages about 300,000 transactions per day at present, compared to Visa’s approximately 150 mln daily, indicating an adoption gulf before digital currency reaches wide use as the money of the future. As such, marketing and educational efforts are critical to the advancement of digital currency. Efforts such as the Decentralized Marketing Network work to increase awareness of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.\n\nEducate\n\nAccording to Robert Genito, CEO of Genitrust, which heads peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading platform Wall of Coins, a marketing strategy is vital to establishing a trusted presence:\n\n“Yes, it is obviously important to have a trusting image for your service to the community.”\n\nAmanda B. Johnson, host of video show Dash: Detailed, which is funded by the Dash treasury, explains that the purpose of a robust marketing operation is to educate potential users rather than sell them:\n\n“My goal is to educate about Dash\'s benefits -- in addition, to explain why those benefits are able to exist and how competitors stack up. If all this is done in friendly and accessible language, people really appreciate that you\'ve done so much homework for them. Top it off with links to resources to learn more and you\'ve provided a valuable service to the busy person.”\n\nWord of mouth as the best marketing strategy\n\nWhile a streamlined marketing strategy spearheaded by a company or community behind a technology can help educate and convince new users, ultimately word of mouth is what differentiates between artificial hype and actual solid tech. According to Rijk Plasman, founder of Dutch-based digital currency Gulden, the most effective marketing is the firsthand experience of satisfied customers:\n\n“We believe the only marketing that works at this stage is word of mouth because crypto isn\'t easy to use yet, it comes with challenges. So you want to be informed about it by someone you trust.”\n\n“People expect something that is at least as easy as what they are used to already, so extensive marketing would at this stage only result in disappointment. That is if you want to reach the general public, if you target the crypto community then it\'s a whole other story. Then you only have to sell lies and you can call it marketing, as long as the result is a short-term pump.”\n\nConfrontational, competitive attitudes are hurting the cryptocurrency field\n\nMarketing strategies between the teams and communities of Blockchain businesses and technologies, however, can become confrontational. Andreas Antonopoulos famously blamed delays in Bitcoin’s development partly on community trolling. Genito believes the confrontational attitude between business hurts productivity:\n\n“Business co-operation is the weak spot. People are still locked into this ""competitive"" mindset. Competing currencies, business competition, etc.”\n\nAccording to Genito, cooperation and collaboration is a lacking component in the world of cryptocurrency, and that focusing on working together, instead of in conflict, will solve many of the field’s larger problems:\n\n“You can market all you want, but the world we live in is based on cooperation. We must coordinate our efforts together, and the crypto companies and leaders who lack cooperation are where you find crypto embezzlement, large-scale hacks, the need for new business angels/pivots (ie: Circle), or services that become stale and less useful.', ""Bitcoin is showing no sign of dropping below its all-time highs.\n\nAfter trading above $1,000 for more than two weeks, the bitcoin price has now provided what analysts believe is ample evidence the digital currency's price has established a floor at this level.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been enjoying its longest stretch above $1,000 in history, a period it began on 14th February.\n\nDuring this period, bitcoin prices have been pushing steadily higher, reaching a new all-time high of $1,186.33 on 23rd February and then rising to new record levels over the following sessions, according to the USD CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nThe digital currency most recently hit a fresh all-time high today, when it reached $1,210.16 at 03:00 UTC, BPI figures show.\n\nAt the time of report, bitcoin prices had pulled back slightly from this level, trading at $1,196.38.\n\nPotential upside\n\nMany market observers have emphasized that bitcoin prices could soon enjoy significant upside if the SEC approves the proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, an investment fund which has an approval deadline on 11th March.\n\nTraders have already incorporated this event into bitcoin prices, according to several analysts.\n\nHowever, many market observers have projected that the proposed fund has low odds of receiving authorization from the government agency.\n\nInvestor and serial entrepreneur Vinny Lingham, for example, gave the fund 10-15% odds of being approved in a recent blog post, while Spencer Bogart, former analyst with investment bank Needham & Co LLC, has indicated the ETF's odds of approval are less than 25%.\n\nWhile acceptance could fuel sharp price gains, a rejection could push bitcoin prices lower, analysts say.\n\nStill, amid this uncertain situation, bitcoin prices have been experiencing little volatility in the last few days, moving largely between $1,170 and $1,210 even as they have enjoyed a steady, upward climb.\n\nPrice charts image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While Coinbase says it has “no objection to” this procedure, maintaining a “redundant” fiat reserve would be “impractical, costly and inefficient.”\n\n“The Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions (DFI) has communicated regulatory policies which we believe will render continued Coinbase operations there impractical,” the company wrote in a blog post.\n\nCustomers are now asked to withdraw all funds from their wallets and close their accounts.\n\nThe move by legislators is unusual in coming just days after the State approved the creation of a working group to study how Blockchain technology could benefit the local economy.\n\nRepresentatives voted for House Bill 1481 to be passed unamended.\n\n“...[T]he purpose of this Act is to establish a working group consisting of representation from the public and private sectors to examine, educate, and promote best practices for enabling Blockchain technology to benefit local industries, residents, and the State of Hawaii,” an extract from the Bill’s text reads.', 'To prevent servers and computers from being encrypted with Bitcoin-demanding ransomware, major US corporations are purchasing Bitcoin to make sure they quickly react to malware encryption.\n\nSince early 2016, a time lock system for Bitcoin ransomware has become quite popular. Designers and developers of ransomware purposely include a time frame, usually one week, to pressure victims into paying Bitcoin ransom.\n\nRansomware principles\n\nDespite the emergence of readily accessible cloud-based platforms, many companies, particularly large-scale corporations, still operate local servers, databases and computers to store important data. Corporate data, including the personal information of users, financial data of clients and confidential company documents, are stored in these local servers which are vulnerable to ransomware or malware attacks when connected to the Internet.\n\nRansomware can be deployed or installed onto servers or devices through a wide range of methods. The most popular method of ransomware deployment is the mass distribution of malicious URLs and files, which automatically installs ransomware to a particular device if the user downloads or opens the URL. Then, the ransomware runs in the background of the server and device, encrypting every piece of information in the device.\n\nBitcoin ransom wallets\n\nPogue, Chief Information Security Officer of Nuix, an information management technology company, says companies are opening Bitcoin wallets and purchasing Bitcoin in case company servers or computers are compromised with ransomware encryption. Companies with larger sets of important financial or personal data are considering Bitcoin as a crucial and necessary response method.\n\nAccording to Pogue, thousands of US companies have already set up Bitcoin wallets and purchased the digital currency to pay ransom to Bitcoin-demanding ransomware distributors. Since their servers and devices contain sensitive material which is valuable to their clients, Pogue explained that companies are taking this strategy very seriously.\n\nPogue writes:\n\n“A lot of companies are doing that as part of their incident response planning. They are setting up Bitcoin wallets.”\n\nHowever, Paula Long, CEO of DataGravity, noted that the strategy of acquiring Bitcoin to prevent ransomware attacks can be a moral dilemma for many companies, as they are purposely purchasing the digital currency to support cyber criminals.\n\nHelping the bad guys\n\nWhile the FBI and other law enforcement agencies encourage companies not to settle Bitcoin ransom as it is guaranteed that the criminals or ransomware distributors will send decryption keys to their victims, Long believes it is the responsibility of the company to secure corporate data for their clients and partners.\n\n“It’s a moral dilemma. If you pay, you are helping the bad guys. You can’t go to the moral high ground and put your company at risk,” said Long.\n\nSince the rapid development of ransomware, companies and analysts have started to claim that the intent of ransomware distributors are always negative. But, in some rare cases, there have been ransomware developers who spread Bitcoin-demanding ransomware in order to help people in need.\n\nThere were also cases in late December of ransomware distributors providing free decryption keys to victims who are running businesses to help others in need. For instance, an individual going by the online alias “SwervinErvin” received a free decryption key from a ransomware developer after sharing his company’s mission of helping poor children.', 'Bitcoin entrepreneur and evangelist Vinny Lingham has warned any quick price rises could trigger “another bubble” in the virtual currency.\n\nIn a blog post on Monday, Lingham wrote that a bull run in the event of the first Bitcoin ETF getting approval could have longer-term detrimental effects than many envisage:\n\n“I quickly realized there was bigger issue [than the ETFs] at play here — the upcoming potential for another Bitcoin bubble!”\n\nAs Bitcoin price currently hovers around $1200, Lingham believes the price already includes around $150 of optimism over the ETF successfully surviving March 11.\n\nA positive decision would send Bitcoin price towards $2000 with a $1300 floor. However, growth may not stop there, and any further advances would reintroduce volatility and a bubble mentality, similar to what happened in 2013.\n\n“I’m hoping this post serves as a warning to those who are welcoming another spike in Bitcoin. $1300 is a significant psychological price point,” he continued.\n\n“This is the point that arguably no one who had previously bought coins during the last “bubble” is under water. Sure, some people may have taken some losses and sold the coins, but as a whole everyone who didn’t believe in Bitcoin now starts to believe again. Therein lies the danger.”\n\nLingham, meanwhile, has authored many posts on the future of Bitcoin and how to ensure its use is sustained and manageable, leading to decreased volatility and successful use cases.\n\nDuring a price surge caused by Chinese trading in early January, Lingham tweeted that Bitcoin should become first a store of value, secondly proven as a digital commodity and only then adopted as a digital currency.', 'Former British prime minister David Cameron has said that bitcoin and blockchain technology have the potential to improve both financial inclusion and government transparency, according to reports.\n\nCameron, who served as prime minister from 2010 to 2016 before resigning in the wake of the Brexit vote, made his comments at the opening of new London offices for bitcoin startup Blockchain earlier this week. According to Business Insider, Cameron conceded his limited knowledge of the tech, but stated his belief that it could have a significant impact beyond finance, particularly in regards to public services.\n\nHe reportedly said:\n\n""Obviously you\'ve got amazing opportunity using blockchain technology in areas like banking and finance and insurance, but I think some of the public policy applications are potentially transformational.""\n\nAt the same time, Cameron pointed to the tech’s potential to give those without financial access the ability “to be able to have property rights, to be able to carry out transactions”.\n\n“Your opportunities, for instance in the remittances markets – a huge market, to help people have lower transaction costs and better property rights, are massive,” he went on to say.\n\nThe event wasn’t Blockchain’s first encounter with the ex-PM. The startup was among a group of businesses representing the UK\'s fintech space during a state trade mission to Asia, which Cameron undertook in 2015.\n\nIn this week\'s remarks, Cameron voiced support for the use of blockchain tech in improving the transparency of governments, enabling the development of “a sense of trust in the institutions that we use”.\n\n""I think you\'re on the brink of a very exciting revolution in all of those areas, which as someone involved in public life is very interesting,” he concluded.\n\nImage courtesy of Blockchain\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

No digital currency business – and frankly, no commercially viable business anywhere – has the capital to supplement every customer bitcoin with redundant dollar collateral.\n\nAs a result, Coinbase has now made it mandatory for Hawaii-resident users to close their accounts within the next thirty days. The exchange will also halt new account signups in America’s newest state “for the indefinite future.” Customers can either send their bitcoin to an alternative wallet or swap the cryptocurrency for fiat before their accounts’ closure.\n\nThe exchange adds that it hopes to open shop in Hawaii in the future by working with policymakers to change the law or by encouraging the DFI’s commissioner to “revisit” the existing policy discretion under Hawaii law.\n\nCoinbase’s exit comes at a time when Hawaii is considering a bitcoin- and blockchain-friendly bill, one that aims to establish a working group toward the exploration of digital currencies and blockchain technology in Hawaii’s public and private sectors.\n\n“Digital currencies such as bitcoin have broad benefits for Hawaii. A large portion of Hawaii’s tourism market comes from Asia where the use of bitcoin as a virtual currency is expanding,” the bill’s text read.\n\nThe digital currency exchange said it was “heartened” that members of state’s House of Representatives had introduced the bill and added that it would look forward to working with them.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Experts say Canada has shown considerable potential in these early days of blockchain — and they believe it’s key for the country to help create conditions to keep the momentum going.\n\nWith such activities available to be seen by a blockchain’s many collaborators, the system is inherently secure, making it far less vulnerable to tampering, hacking and corruption than current systems, which depend on information being managed by intermediaries.\n\nLike a giant digital bulletin board, blockchain creates an online ledger or database where records — financial transactions, for instance — can be shared, moved and maintained on a transparent network, all without compromising security.\n\nBlockchain, as it’s known, holds a vast amount of promise for transforming business sectors and the lives of ordinary people around the world, although some say it’s too early to say how broad the technology’s reach could be.\n\nOTTAWA—An emerging technology has caught the eye of the innovation-obsessed federal government — a platform so packed with potential, many experts believe it could comprise the foundation for the next generation of the Internet.\n\nThe attendees at the meeting explored the feasibility of Canada becoming a global hub for the blockchain “revolution,” according to the agenda.\n\nIn December, senior government officials, including then-international trade minister Chrystia Freeland, met to discuss the concept with executives from companies, big banks, regulators and the tech sector.\n\nOttawa has taken notice; widening the path for more blockchain development would fit nicely with the Trudeau government’s stated goal of increasing innovation as a way to help jump-start Canada’s lacklustre economy.\n\n“Basically, blockchain technology represents nothing short of the second generation of the Internet,” said Alex Tapscott, who co-hosted the roundtable.\n\nTapscott, CEO of blockchain advisory firm Northwest Passage Ventures, believes the technology represents a potential foundation for an innovation economy in Canada, and could prove instrumental in sparking a new industrial revolution.\n\nBlockchain is the technology behind bitcoin, a digital currency without links to governments or banks, enabling people to engage in anonymous online transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nIts possibilities stretch far beyond cutting out the middleman in financial transactions, which often create higher costs for users and extra delays from processing times.\n\nThey range from improving the efficiency of government services, to developing robust electronic-voting systems, to building reliable land-registry systems. It can also slash costs for international cash transfers and keep personal data out of the hands of profiteering third parties.\n\nSome believe blockchain will have the power to counter inequality and help deliver more prosperity to poorer parts of the world.\n\nFederal departments are in the process of working to understand the concept and are at the early stages of creating policies around it, particularly in areas such as privacy, banking and cybersecurity, said one government source who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nCanada is ranked third in the world behind the United States and the United Kingdom when it comes to blockchain startups, said the source, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe Bank of Canada has promoted its efforts to study the technology in collaboration with big banks, Payments Canada and the financial innovation company R3 Lab and Research Centre.\n\n“By some weird accident, Canada and Toronto have actually emerged already as one of the leading areas in the world in blockchain innovation,” said Tapscott, who co-authored a book with his father Don entitled “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World.”\n\n“But that lead won’t last unless we can get everybody working off of the same plan sheet and driving in the same direction.”\n\nJeremy Clark, a blockchain expert from Montreal’s Concordia University, said regulators can help the technology expand in Canada — something he believes would lift economic growth.\n\n“The more these bodies can do to sort of pave the road, I think that would give Canada an edge over other countries,” said Clark, who has closely studied how blockchain can be used in electronic voting systems.\n\n“Canada can be a leader. Will it be the world leader? I’m not sure. I think the U.S. probably has us beat, but absolutely Canada can be one of the top-5 countries developing blockchain technologies.”', 'Many of the technologies we now take for granted were quiet revolutions in their time. Just think about how much smartphones have changed the way we live and work. It used to be that when people were out of the office, they were gone, because a telephone was tied to a place, not to a person. Now we have global nomads building new businesses straight from their phones. And to think: Smartphones have been around for merely a decade.\n\nWe’re now in the midst of another quiet revolution: blockchain, a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called “blocks.” Consider what’s happened in just the past 10 years:\n\nThe first major blockchain innovation was bitcoin, a digital currency experiment. The market cap of bitcoin now hovers between $10–$20 billion dollars, and is used by millions of people for payments, including a large and growing remittances market.\n\nThe second innovation was called blockchain, which was essentially the realization that the underlying technology that operated bitcoin could be separated from the currency and used for all kinds of other interorganizational cooperation. Almost every major financial institution in the world is doing blockchain research at the moment, and 15% of banks are expected to be using blockchain in 2017.\n\nThe third innovation was called the “smart contract,” embodied in a second-generation blockchain system called ethereum, which built little computer programs directly into blockchain that allowed financial instruments, like loans or bonds, to be represented, rather than only the cash-like tokens of the bitcoin. The ethereum smart contract platform now has a market cap of around a billion dollars, with hundreds of projects headed toward the market.\n\nThe fourth major innovation, the current cutting edge of blockchain thinking, is called “proof of stake.” Current generation blockchains are secured by “proof of work,” in which the group with the largest total computing power makes the decisions. These groups are called “miners” and operate vast data centers to provide this security, in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. The new systems do away with these data centers, replacing them with complex financial instruments, for a similar or even higher degree of security. Proof-of-stake systems are expected to go live later this year.\n\nThe fifth major innovation on the horizon is called blockchain scaling. Right now, in the blockchain world, every computer in the network processes every transaction. This is slow. A scaled blockchain accelerates the process, without sacrificing security, by figuring out how many computers are necessary to validate each transaction and dividing up the work efficiently. To manage this without compromising the legendary security and robustness of blockchain is a difficult problem, but not an intractable one. A scaled blockchain is expected to be fast enough to power the internet of things and go head-to-head with the major payment middlemen (VISA and SWIFT) of the banking world.\n\nThis innovation landscape represents just 10 years of work by an elite group of computer scientists, cryptographers, and mathematicians. As the full potential of these breakthroughs hits society, things are sure to get a little weird. Self-driving cars and drones will use blockchains to pay for services like charging stations and landing pads. International currency transfers will go from taking days to an hour, and then to a few minutes, with a higher degree of reliability than the current system has been able to manage.\n\nThese changes, and others, represent a pervasive lowering of transaction costs. When transaction costs drop past invisible thresholds, there will be sudden, dramatic, hard-to-predict aggregations and disaggregations of existing business models. For example, auctions used to be narrow and local, rather than universal and global, as they are now on sites like eBay. As the costs of reaching people dropped, there was a sudden change in the system. Blockchain is reasonably expected to trigger as many of these cascades as e-commerce has done since it was invented, in the late 1990s.\n\nInsight Center Business in the Era of Blockchain Sponsored by Accenture How technology is transforming transactions.\n\nPredicting what direction it will all take is hard. Did anybody see social media coming? Who would have predicted that clicking on our friends’ faces would replace time spent in front of the TV? Predictors usually overestimate how fast things will happen and underestimate the long-term impacts. But the sense of scale inside the blockchain industry is that the changes coming will be “as large as the original invention of the internet,” and this may not be overstated. What we can predict is that as blockchain matures and more people catch on to this new mode of collaboration, it will extend into everything from supply chains to provably fair internet dating (eliminating the possibility of fake profiles and other underhanded techniques). And given how far blockchain come in 10 years, perhaps the future could indeed arrive sooner than any of us think.\n\nUntil the late 1990s it was impossible to process a credit card securely on the internet — e-commerce simply did not exist. How fast could blockchain bring about another revolutionary change? Consider that Dubai’s blockchain strategy (disclosure: I designed it) is to issue all government documents on blockchain by 2020, with substantial initial projects just announced to go live this year. The Internet of Agreements concept presented at the World Government Summit builds on this strategy to envision a substantial transformation of global trade, using blockchains to smooth out some of the bumps caused by Brexit and the recent U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. These ambitious agendas will have to be proven in practice, but the expectation in Dubai is that cost savings and innovation benefits will more than justify the cost of experimentation. As Mariana Mazzucato teaches in The Entrepreneurial State, the cutting edge of innovation, particularly in infrastructure, is often in the hands of the state, and that seems destined to be true in the blockchain space.']"
