04/01/2017,"[""The United States Senate voted late Friday night to pass H.R. 0401, titled America’s Plan to Restore Individual Liberty and Financial Openness for Our Localities and States. That bill, which President Donald J. Trump has vowed to sign when it reaches his desk later this evening, will effectively end the use of the Dollar as official U.S. currency, and replace it with Bitcoin and a “basket” of other digital currencies. In a surprising show of bipartisan solidarity, the bill passed both the House and Senate without a single dissenting vote.\n\nThe law includes provisions that repeal the Coinage Act of 1792 - which created the United States Dollar and designated it as the young nation’s lawful tender - as well as all subsequent currency legislation. The Act also establishes a commission to determine how the Treasury and other government agencies will be reorganized to ensure that the transition is accomplished with a minimal amount of disruption to bureaucrats' vacation plans.\n\nThe bill also mandates the return of the popular Firefly television show, which was mistakenly cancelled more than a decade ago before it had even completed its first season.\n\nWhile the new law will come as a surprise to many Americans - since there was no formal or informal debate, and reports indicate that lawmakers have yet to see the actual bill - government sources insist that this change is necessary. According to one official who spoke on condition of anonymity,\n\n“Look, everyone here in Washington D.C. has known for some time that our fiat currency system was unsustainable. We’ve spent decades manipulating the dollar to prop the system up, and all that we’ve got for our troubles is an endless cycle of boom and bust. Our brilliant central planners just aren’t as brilliant as we thought they were.”\n\nOther officials have cited the dollar’s use as a vehicle for funding terrorism and money-laundering schemes, as well as a host of other lesser crimes. The dollar's status as a reserve currency for nations around the world has caused it to become a primary vehicle for financing terror and criminal activity, and experts now grudgingly admit that it is simply too difficult to track in its physical form.\n\nA senior analyst at one government agency explained,\n\n“We’ve examined this problem from every angle, and we were left with two choices: switch to digital dollars, or abandon the dollar altogether and let the free market take over. In the end, digital dollars just weren’t realistic, since Bitcoin and other digital currencies were still going to be used by people here and around the world. We tried to beat them, and failed; time to join them.”\n\nAccording to reports, the Treasury Department will be issuing directives in the next thirty days that will provide instructions about how dollars can be properly turned into authorities and exchanged for digital currency. Meanwhile, officials in the capital have nothing but praise for the new law. As a spokesperson for President Trump noted,"", ""The Bitcoin scaling debate is rapidly heating up. The several-year-long confrontation might be reaching a turning point over the coming weeks. With the support for the Bitcoin Unlimited proposal reaching an unprecedented high of over 37 percent of network’s total hashpower, a contentious hard fork of the cryptocurrency, i.e. a hard fork performed without the consensus of the majority of the network, becomes a possible scenario.\n\nThe most important question for the average member of the community then becomes “what do I do to minimize my potential losses if a fork does happen?” and that’s what I will be trying to find the answer to in this article. But first, let’s start with a quick refresher on how we found ourselves here.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nThe beginning of the Bitcoin scaling debate can be traced back to around 2014-15. It is back then that the Bitcoin community at large has started paying attention to the fact that there is a limit to the transaction capacity of the network. That limit is, at the very most, seven transactions per second, and that is entirely too low for a large enough user base.\n\nThe fears have justified themselves: two years later, the Bitcoin network is clearly unable to handle the frequency of transactions which is demanded by the fast growing audience. The users have been experiencing incredible wait times for the past several months, as the mempool - the buffer of yet-unconfirmed transactions - is setting new records almost every week.\n\nThere is virtually no disagreement that Bitcoin has to be adjusted somehow, in order to make it technically possible for the user base to keep growing. The point of contention - and we are talking about an all-out war of opinions here - is how it should be done.\n\nThe two main solutions proposed to the scaling problem today are Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Bitcoin Unlimited (BU). Both are already finished, as far as software is concerned. However, before anyone can firmly say that one of them has been adopted by the network, they have to receive the majority of support from the miners. That turned out to be really hard to achieve, as both updates are facing major opposition on different grounds.\n\nAs one would imagine, the dispute originally took the form of competition between two rivaling technologies - more on that here. However, it seems that neither of the solutions is perfect from the technological standpoint, and that is reflected by both sides failing to take a decisive advantage in the debate.\n\nAfter it became clear that a technical consensus might not be achieved, the conflict has become highly politicized. The majority of the decision-makers involved have taken firm sides and are refusing to back down under any circumstances.\n\nOne glaring example of the political nature of the scaling debate is the fact that there is not one, but two subreddits dedicated to Bitcoin on the Reddit.com platform: /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc, both communities being vehemently opposed to each other.\n\nThe /r/btc community was created as a response to the alleged practice of the moderators of /r/Bitcoin - the original Bitcoin subreddit - of banning members for expressing negative criticism of SegWit and/or support for BU. Today, both pages are filled with mutual accusations of stupidity, immaturity and propagandism.\n\nThis whole scaling debate situation looks a lot like a mess, and it is not limited to Reddit. Twitter has become a battleground for prominent community experts from both sides of the fence to proclaim their strong opinions and fling mud at each other, if indirectly.\n\nThe recent news of a bug being discovered in the code of Bitcoin Unlimited isn’t helping either. The malfunction cost miners $200,000, and the sloppiness the developers have handled the situation with are not reassuring. This isn’t the first time that a software deficiency has been discovered in BU and possibly not the last one. All that sparks justified doubts regarding whether the technology is really ready to go live.\n\nThose doubts don’t seem to be stopping miners, as Bitcoin Unlimited is now the most favored proposal, judging by the share of network’s hashrate signaling for its support - 37.2 percent at the time of writing. If that number reaches 50 percent or higher, it is not unlikely for a contentious hard fork to take place, i.e. the miners deciding to go ahead and switch to BU, hoping that the rest of the community will be basically forced to follow them.\n\n\u200b\n\nNow, there is a vast number of potential scenarios a contentious fork could result in, and listing them all is far beyond the scope of this article. If you’re interested, feel free to read this great piece, which goes to great lengths to describe the possible outcomes.\n\nWe’ll leave judging the prudence of conducting a BU hard fork to the much more qualified technology experts from the community. The question we are going to try to answer is what should the average Bitcoin user do, in order to minimize the damage to their wealth in the case that miners do follow through and split the network via a contentious hard fork.\n\nContingency measures for everyday users\n\nThere are two primary ways in which a potential network split could affect the Bitcoin holders: via the so-called replay attacks and via the value of coins. Consequently, there are several contingency measures which can be used to secure your wealth during the period preceding a potential hard fork and immediately after it.\n\nFirst, the replay attacks. They are a form of attack on a freshly split network when the two Blockchains are not too different from each other. When a person sends their Bitcoins to someone, an attacker may replicate the same transaction on the other Blockchain - Bitcoin Unlimited, in this case - and it will be accepted by the network.\n\nThus, the user may unknowingly and unwillingly lose their coins on the alternative Blockchain just by sending transactions across the first one. In order to prevent this, it is advisable to refrain from conducting any Bitcoin/Bitcoin Unlimited transactions at all, until the majority of industry experts confirm that the software vulnerabilities that allow the replay attacks are fixed.\n\nAnother important advice is to always be in control of the private keys to your funds - which may mean withdrawing your coins from an online exchange or wallet to a software wallet stored on your PC.\n\nOne of the very purposes of Bitcoin is to give its users complete reign over their coins. By delegating that control to any third party, even one you deem trustworthy, such as an exchange, or a web wallet service, you subject your coins to unnecessary risk. Thar risk is even more unwarranted during such a turbulent time as a contentious hard fork.\n\nIn fact, that advice can be applied at all times, not just during a hard fork. Here is how Anthony Di Iorio, the CEO & Founder of Jaxx, puts it:\n\n“Most important thing is that users are in control of the key to their funds. Just like what happened with Ethereum, we at Jaxx didn't support [Ethereum Classic] right after the fork but since users are in control of their keys with Jaxx, once we integrated ETC their funds were accessible. If using an exchange or a wallet where users are not in control of their keys, they are at the mercy of the decisions made by the company holding the keys.”\n\nThe second potential danger comes from the fluctuating value of the coins. The moment a hard fork takes place, all the people holding Bitcoins receive the equivalent amount of coins on the alternative Blockchain - effectively doubling the amount of coins in circulation. That is because all the records on both Blockchains are identical up until the point of the fork.\n\nBeing left with two sets of coins, some people will want to dump the ones they find less promising. That may provoke more people into panicking and also trying to sell before the price - as they expect - drops too much. Speculators may exploit that panic, looking to make a short-term profit. All that commotion creates a lot of uncertainty and volatility on the market, which is bound to last for some time after a hard fork takes place.\n\nUnder such conditions, the least risky strategy is to just hold onto your coins on both Blockchains and wait it out. It’s impossible to predict which one of the alternatives will be the most successful, and taking sides may result in a massive loss if you choose wrong. A much safer solution is to wait for the market to calm down, see which coin comes out on top and go from there.\n\nIn other words, if you truly believe in the eventual success of Bitcoin, your best bet is to keep holding. No matter how dire the short-term consequences of a fork can be, the community will eventually sort it out, like it always did.\n\nHere is what Bas Wisselink, the co-founder and trainer at Blockchain Workspace, has to say about the value of staying calm in troublesome times:"", 'China’s largest gold deposit in history was discovered in the province of Shandong earlier this week. Local publications reported that the newly found gold mine will add over US$22 billion worth of supply to the gold market.\n\nShandong Gold Group, a Chinese gold mining company affiliated with the provincial government of Shandong, officially revealed in a press conference held on March 28 that the institution found a gold deposit of over 382.5 tons in the Laizhou-Zhaoyuan region of northwest Jiaodong Peninsula.\n\nThe area, which is better known to the public as Xilin, is said to have specific geological characteristics necessary to develop major gold deposit clusters. According to the representatives of Shandong Gold Group, the company will be able to produce gold at full capacity for 40 years, gaining the provide over $22 billion in profit.\n\nLocal publications including People’s Daily which attended the press conference of Shandong Gold Group reported:\n\n“Currently, 382.58 tons of gold reserves have been prospected with an average gold grade of 4.52 g/t. And 550 tons of gold resources with more than $22billion (RMB150billion) potential economic value can be expected in two years. If producing on a scale of 10,000 tons every day, the gold deposit can produce gold continuously at full capacity for 40 years.”\n\nBitcoin as a More Reliable Store of Value and Safe Haven Asset\n\nSince early 2016, the vast majority of short and mid-term investors of bitcoin have begun to perceive bitcoin as a wealth protection tool that is practical for avoiding economic decline and financial instability. As a result, large investment firms, as well as high profile traders, began to hold bitcoin to prevent potential variables such as increase of interest rate, reserve currency devaluation and stock market performance from affecting their portfolio of assets.\n\nTwo of the major reasons investors are appealed to bitcoin are the digital currency’s decentralized nature and fixed supply. Since only 21 million bitcoins can exist and that monetary supply can’t be altered due to the decentralization and governance system of bitcoin, investors consider bitcoin as a reliable store of value in avoiding short-term loss and gaining long-term success.\n\nDue to bitcoin’s strong mid and long-term performance in terms of price, investors have begun to consider bitcoin as a safe haven asset. In other words, an asset expected to retain its value or even increase in times of market turbulence.\n\nGold, another asset which investors often turn to in economic instability, has proven to be a less efficient safe haven asset in comparison to bitcoin due to its inflationary nature. For instance, the discovery of the Shandong gold deposit immediately added $22 billion to the gold market and supply unexpectedly and such abrupt addition of supply will inevitably lead to the decline of gold price.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s supply is fixed and such abrupt expansion of supply isn’t possible in a digital currency like bitcoin that was introduced with a fixed supply from the beginning.\n\nFor any safe haven asset or currency, rarity and scarcity are vital for long-term price surge and stability. Bitcoin has proven itself as reliable store of value, settlement network and safe haven asset for over 9 years of its existence. Hence, investors are starting to describe bitcoin as digital gold or gold 2.0.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price after a sharp correction against the US Dollar found support near $960, and now BTC/USD is trading above $1000 with a positive bias.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price after a downside move towards $889 found buyers and recovered against the US Dollar.\n\nThis past week’s highlighted two bearish trend lines with resistance near $1010-1030 on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD was cleared.\n\nThe price might dip a few points towards $1030, but likely to find buyers.\n\nBitcoin price after a sharp correction against the US Dollar found support near $960, and now BTC/USD is trading above $1000 with a positive bias.\n\nBitcoin Price Bullish Trend\n\nThis past week, we saw a dive in BTC price towards $980 against the US Dollar. Later, the price found support and managed to recover above $1000. However, there was a major hurdle near $1040, as highlighted in this past week’s analysis. The same level represented the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1120 high to $889 low. Moreover, the 100 simple moving average (4H) was aligned at $1030. The price was able to break these hurdles for an upside move.\n\nThe most important break was above two bearish trend lines with resistance near $1010-1030 on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD. It has opened the doors for more gains in the near term. The price is lacking momentum at this moment above $1100. So, there is a chance of a minor dip towards the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $889 low to $1104 high.\n\nThe same broken resistance near $1040-20 might now act as a support and prevent losses. Buying dips may be a good idea as long as the price is above the 100 simple moving average (4H) and $1020.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is now well placed into the bullish slope.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is comfortably moving above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1020\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1100\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

This time round, bitcoin was trading high amid optimism that the SEC could soon approve a bitcoin ETF for retail investors.\n\nStill, bitcoin didn't enjoy this superior position for long. According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), prices have fallen sharply since the eventual rejection – a trend that continued amid uncertainty about the future of its technical roadmap.\n\nDays of glory\n\nOverall, bitcoin's price managed to trade higher than gold until 7th March, when prices fell below $1,200, BPI figures show. Gold prices, in comparison, closed at $1,215.86, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nBitcoin once again surpassed gold on 10th March, the day of the SEC decision, when its price surged to an all-time high of more than $1,300.\n\nHowever, as the SEC rejected the proposed fund, bitcoin prices plunged, nearing $1,000. As a result, bitcoin once again traded south of gold, which closed the day at $1,204.64.\n\nBitcoin again popped up to surpass the precious metal on 12th and 16th March. The digital currency didn't stay north of gold for long, and it fell below its precious metal counterpart later on 16th March.\n\nWatch this space\n\nWith the prices diverging, it may be that this ends the latest attempt for the digital currency to live up to its often-used descriptor, 'digital gold'.\n\nIn fact, though, bitcoin and gold have frequently shown little relationship in terms of their price movements.\n\nWhile the two assets have frequently displayed a strong price correlation during times of economic crisis, this relationship has often deteriorated once economic conditions calmed down. (A prior analysis of gold and bitcoin prices conducted by ARK Invest's Chris Burniske failed to reveal a strong relationship between bitcoin and gold.)\n\nStill, today there are several retail products that investors can use to trade gold. Bitcoin, on the other hand, lacks such securities.\n\nAs a result, the bitcoin-gold price relationship could change quite a bit going forward – and remains one to watch.\n\nGold bars image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Under the new interpretation of the law, this has been expanded to include cryptocurrencies.\n\nObscure law meant for board games also exempts virtual currencies\n\nThe Monopoly Act was introduced with the intent of preventing the imitation money, used in board games such as Monopoly, from falling under government scrutiny.\n\nParker Brothers, the company behind Monopoly, lobbied heavily for the law to pass, as imitation bills from collector\'s editions of the game began to draw high value on the market.\n\nAfter one collector was arrested for tax evasion after procuring employment in exchange for these collector\'s edition Monopoly notes, Parker Brothers feared their value would plummet, sinking sales.\n\nNixon turmoil\n\nThe Monopoly Act was passed and signed into law Aug. 5th of 1974, barely noticed during a time of political turmoil and a mere four days before Richard Nixon became the first American president to resign from office.\n\nThe wording of the bill, however, provides an unintended loophole for cryptocurrency:\n\n""No token, bill, virtual currency, or counterfeit money, whose purpose it is to parody legal tender or otherwise serve as a novelty, and where such can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, shall be subject to taxation, regulation, or licensing by any branch of government, but shall instead enjoy free and unrestricted exchange. (emphasis added)”\n\nOn Friday, a federal judge ruled that cryptocurrencies are, by virtue of lack of a physical form and issuing bank, by definition virtual currency and as such current financial regulations do not apply.\n\nNo luck for similar regulatory relief in Zimbabwe and Venezuela\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency field enjoys a period of unregulated economic activity in the United States, for now, those in certain third-world countries have not experienced similar good fortune. Both Zimbabwe and Venezuela have enacted regulations that would treat any token traded as a store of value or used for compensation for goods and services as money, regardless of the object itself.\n\nThese laws were put in place in both countries following times of drastic hyperinflation when citizens resorted to trading fake currency and game tokens because they held value better than government-issued money.\n\nFake news!\n\nUPDATE: In response to this article, US president Donald Trump has denied the legality of unregulated cryptocurrency activity, criticizing Cointelegraph via Twitter:', 'Controversial OneCoin has been declared a genuine cryptocurrency and ordered to be listed on coinmarketcap.com with immediate effect.\n\nCourt landmark decision\n\nThe declaration followed the decision of Manuel Lin Miranda, Federal Circuit Court judge in California on Friday, March 31, 2017. The case which lasted a period of 14 months saw OneCoin creator, Dr. Ruja Ignatova and her team cleared of all allegations due to lack of substantive evidence by the prosecutor.\n\nA confident Ignatova tells Cointelegraph that the victory in court is not hers but a victory for the humanity and the cause of liberty.\n\nIgnatova says:\n\n“This is not my victory, it is a victory for the entire people of the world.

Having invested over NGN10 mln in the project, he says that the hopelessness encountered before now took a toll even on his health. Worst of it all according to him is the mockery and blame received from the people around him over the last couple of months.\n\n“It is a great turn-around. Somehow, I knew a day like this would come, my tears have now turned to joy. Our goal is to overtake Bitcoin and we are almost there. We are the new billionaires in town, thanks to our leader Dr. Ruja Ignatova.”\n\nPanic across board\n\nThe entire crypto ecosystem has been thrown into panic as no one knows what to expect anymore. This development completely exhumes the almost completely buried question of how much of government interference can be experienced within the crypto environment.\n\nUnprecedented price volatility is far from being expected in the next couple of days across major cryptocurrencies because this is just a huge joke!', 'The cryptocurrency ecosystem, created with the launch of Bitcoin in 2009 has gone mainstream, sans the recognition as legal tender by most governments in the world. Bitcoin and other altcoins like Dash are on the verge of creating a global economy without geographical barriers. Similar to heavyweight financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan in the conventional fiat economy, few cryptocurrency platforms and businesses have established themselves as recognized, trusted organizations/institutions. According to a renowned venture capitalist in cryptocurrency circles Fred Wilson, Coinbase is one such company.\n\nAccording to a leading business news outlet, the managing partner at Union Square Ventures, Fred Wilson equated Coinbase to the likes of leading Wall Street institutions while speaking at a conference organized by StockTwits on Thursday. He was quoted saying,\n\n“They (Coinbase) are like J.P Morgan or Goldman Sachs for blockchain. “\n\nFred’s speech at the Stocktoberfest is an indication of his trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and its portfolio company. Founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase is among the early Bitcoin businesses to provide online wallet service. The company eventually expanded to offer Bitcoin exchange service and merchant solutions. Now, under the brand GDAX, Coinbase also operates a trading platform supporting multiple cryptocurrencies.\n\nContinuing, Wilson also spoke about the advantage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over conventional financial instruments like stocks and bonds. The suggestions Wilson offered is also something he practices. Wilson has made a significant investment in the likes of Coinbase and other crypto-startups through Union Square Ventures. He also personally holds cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. In Wilson’s words, he owns a small percentage of his net worth in cryptocurrencies. Wilson further said,\n\n“If I were a trader, a stock trader or hedge fund person, I might think of having 5% of my assets in something like this; it’s still early days; I don’t think you want to go all in on it, but I think you want to be in it.”\n\nCoinbase has had its problems with the platform, operations and even the IRS. Wilson believes that the company represents security, trust, safety, etc., but at the same time, doesn’t discount the chances of theft, fraud and other challenges that continue to remain, just like in the early days of Wall Street.\n\nThe comparison ultimately means that the cryptocurrency industry is gaining the much-deserved traction from the investor community and it is going to rise in the coming years to hold a commanding position in the global economic system. The benefits, challenges, and opportunities remain the same for all established cryptocurrency platforms and are not limited to Coinbase alone.\n\nRef: Fortune | Image: NewsBTC', 'SingularDTV, a blockchain entertainment studio and rights management platform building a decentralized entertainment industry on the Ethereum blockchain, is moving forward with plans for a science fiction TV series about how decentralization will bring new systems that guide the world into the next level of human evolution, having tabbed writer/director Michael Blieden as a consulting producer to advise the company on its launch event taking place in Q2 of 2017.\n\nBlieden has worked on television programs such as “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine for Fox,” “Sirens” for USA, “Up All Night” for NBC, as well as live specials for comedians Zach Galifianakis and Joe Rogan, in addition to music videos for Fiona Apple and Kanye West.\n\n“We’re thrilled to have Blieden on board,” said Zach LeBeau, SingularDTV’s CEO. “His experience and energy are extremely valuable and we look forward to great things to come.

And here is where the adaptation of the Blockchain worked perfectly to realize the idea.\n\nBlockchain and digital currencies as a solution\n\nAccording to Taro Watanabe, operating officer at Digital Garage, the company is building a real-time exchange system that enables end-users to use the loyalty points just like a currency based on the Blockchain technology in conjunction with Blockstream and one of three major credit card companies as well as their business partner Credit Saison.\n\nThus, end-users can instantly exchange their loyalty points into other digital value which can be used at any location. The same system can be used for regional currencies. It means that the Blockchain-based Digital Garage product can work globally and potentially everywhere digital currencies exist and are accepted.\n\nDigital Garage also has plans to develop a system that will release machine automated contracts - i.e. help the execution of contracts based on the regulations and business practices in Japan based on the Blockchain technology.\n\nAs for loyalty support service, they intend to partner with major credit card companies, local governments as well as local shopping districts so that they will encourage their customers to use their exchange service which runs on top of Digital Garage platform.\n\nUsers can exchange loyalty points and/or local currencies for a service and/or a product at their choice in real-time which is not provided so far in Japan. In addition to that, they are already providing many payment methods provided by third-parties including Alipay, PayPal or other standard payment systems.\n\nBitcoin is the most secure digital currency\n\nDigital Garage is confident that Bitcoin is the most secure digital currency at this point since it is based on the Blockchain technology which has yet to be tampered with since its invention.\n\nTaro Watanabe believes that public Blockchain technology based on Bitcoin will bring fundamental change to the financial business model.\n\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n\n“Public Blockchain technology based on Bitcoin has a strong capability for security and stability; we believe the current situation is a transitional period that needs more scaling in functionality. Bitcoin Core’s open source community is challenging this and proceeding with the development of the scaling function for uses other than virtual currency.”\n\nIn fact, Digital Garage has all the cards at hand to be a trigger in the development of Bitcoin usage and boost Blockchain in Japan. They plan to contribute to the Bitcoin Core open source community, expand the developer community first in Japan and then promote the idea of Blockchain as a social infrastructure through development and education.', 'Man, if anything needs the “now I get it” treatment, it’s Bitcoin. You hear about it all the time in financial and technical circles—but most people really don’t grasp it.\n\nBitcoin is an alternative kind of currency. It’s entirely digital—there’s no paper money, there’s no coins, nothing physical, not even a plastic card for your wallet. Your bitcoins are stored on your computer or your phone. If your hard drive crashes without a backup, you lose your bitcoins.\n\nThis arrangement has some stunning advantages over traditional currency or credit cards:\n\nBetween buyer and seller, there’s no bank or credit-card company involved, no middleman who can charge fees. The entire Bitcoin banking system is a global peer-to-peer network, running Bitcoin software.\n\nWhen you buy something from someone in another country, there’s no waiting to convert currencies—and again, no fees.\n\nAll transactions are essentially anonymous, which is super convenient if you’re a drug dealer or arms dealer.\n\nThere’s a whole lot of really cool, really complicated math involved in Bitcoin, designed to keep it secure and to prevent Bitcoin inflation.\n\nFor example: the complete record of all Bitcoin transactions—a massive digital ledger called the blockchain—is stored on all Bitcoin users’ computers, rather than being held by a central authority.\n\nBitcoin was born in 2009, the proposal of an anonymously written white paper. There’s no government to decide when to print new money in this case, so new bitcoins are “mined”—created—through a complex scheme you can read about here. In essence, anyone can create new bitcoins, but don’t think you’ll get rich that way. The job requires massive, expensive, high-horsepower computers that must slog through gigantic calculations to “mine” new money. The complexity of the math involved is adjusted so that it’s just barely profitable to mine bitcoins, and so that only a few bitcoins come into existence every 10 minutes.\n\nThis production will stop when there are 21 million bitcoins on earth, which is supposed to happen around 2140. After that—that’s all the bitcoins there’ll ever be.\n\nSo how do you get bitcoins? Same way you get euros or yen or pesos: You buy it with traditional currency like dollars. You can use online exchanges like Bitstamp and Coinbase. At this writing, one bitcoin costs about $1,078.\n\nWhat to do with bitcoins\n\nWhen you get a Bitcoin address—something like an email address—you also get a complex password known as a private key, which you need to access your stash.\n\nAt that point, you can transfer money to other people by sending it to their Bitcoin addresses.\n\nYou can also pay for goods and services at some merchants, like Subway and Xbox; they’re delighted when that happens, because they don’t lose 3% of the transaction in credit-card fees. But in the big picture, the list of places that accept Bitcoin is fairly small. And you don’t get any particular benefit by paying for something this way.\n\nBitcoin as an investment\n\nThe good news is that since Bitcoin’s creation eight years ago, its value has gone up by quite a bit—from well under a penny to over $1,000 per bitcoin today.\n\nThe bad news is that its value is incredibly volatile. Remember this past January, when it dropped by a fifth in a day? Good times.\n\nShould you dive in?\n\nSo: Bitcoin is fascinating, but it’s not very useful, at least not to most people. Some people love it, for sure, like investors with a taste for risk, tech-savvy early adopters, technically-minded libertarians, and criminals.\n\nBut keep in mind that there are lots of exciting ways to lose all your bitcoins. Like if your hard drive crashes without a backup, and you lose your private key. Or if you get a Bitcoin virus, of which there are now many. Or if your Bitcoin exchange goes out of business, which has happened plenty; in fact, 18 of the first 40 exchanges had gone under as of 2013, taking all their clients’ money with them.\n\nRemember, this whole thing is largely unregulated. If you buy something with a credit card and you get ripped off, you can call an 800 number and the credit-card company will get your money back. But if you get ripped off with a Bitcoin transaction … sorry! You voted for no middleman, remember?\n\nIn the meantime, for most people, Bitcoin is a fascinating development that’s a worthy topic of study—just not for ownership.', 'Even though Monero is taking a serious beating in the bitcoin trading market right now, it’s US Dollar value remains intriguingly steady. In fact, there is a small gain on the charts compared to 24 hours ago, indicating Monero and other altcoins have become quite resilient to market fluctuations. One XMR is still worth US$19.9, which appears to the somewhat of a floor for this currency.\n\nMonero Shows Its Resilient Side\n\nIt is quite interesting to see how altcoins continue to stumble as soon as bitcoin’s value goes up. What is even more peculiar is how far things are less worrisome than most people would like to think they are. It would be better if altcoins and bitcoin could gain value at the same time, as they are not mutually exclusive by any means. Then again, it will take at least a few more years until such a scenario becomes reality.\n\nFor Monero holders, not looking at the XMR/BTC chart would be the best course of action right now. XMR, as well as any other altcoin, is on a very slippery slide right now, thanks to bitcoin’s most recent value gains. This type of behavior has been prevalent for quite some time now and some things will never change. Then again, Monero seems to be bouncing back slowly, which is a positive development.\n\nTo put this news into perspective, the XMR/BTC trading pair suffered from a 413% loss decline in the past 24 hours. That is not all that surprising, as things could have been a lot worse. In fact, XMR dipped to 0.0177 BTC at one point, yet it seems to have stabilized around the 0.01878 mark for the time being. If Poloniex managed to stay online during these periods of increasing trading – rather than spewing 502 errors – things are looking quite for Monero.\n\nThe XMR value has successfully maintained its US$20 range for the time being, even though it dipped slightly below that value as of right now. There is no reason to panic, though, as US$19.9 is still a very strong price per XMR at this time. With over US$1m and 323,000 EUR in 24-hour trading volume, there is no reason to think the XMR value will drop below US$19.5 anytime soon.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Ever since the litecoin developers implemented SegWit signaling, things have been progressing at an accelerated pace. Even though activating Segregated Witness requires 75% network consensus, it appears things are much closer where litecoin is concerned. As of right now, 59% of network blocks signal SegWit, which is quite an improvement compared to a few days ago.\n\nLitecoin SegWit Signaling is Picking Up Speed\n\nIt is interesting to see popular altcoins do what bitcoin fails to achieve so far. The introduction of Segregated Witness signaling for bitcoin has been met with a bit of criticism and lots of agitation. Albeit the economic majority want is nothing to do with Bitcoin Unlimited, the mining pools clearly favor this bitcoin fork. It is evident coming to a conclusion and resolution will not happen anytime soon, unless the UASF takes place.\n\nOver in the litecoin world, things are progressing at a more steady pace by the look of things. As of right now, 59% of all network blocks signal the activation of Segregated Witness, which is a lot higher compared to the support bitcoin has in this regard. Ever since one of the largest litecoin mining pools started signaling SegWit, things have started picking up for litecoin. it will be interesting to see if this trend can be sustained over the next few days and weeks.\n\nKeeping in mind how Litecoin SegWit activation requires “just” 75% network consensus, It is obvious this solution has a very real chance of activating over the next few weeks. After all, 75% consensus makes a lot more sense compared to requiring 95%, which is what the bitcoin developers have proposed. If SegWit were to activate on the litecoin network, it will be interesting to see what this means for the future of this popular altcoin.\n\nMoreover, the litecoin price seems to be doing quite well as of late. Ever since the improved SegWit signaling statistics became evident, Chinese investors have been pushing up the LTC price once again. After a few weeks of hovering around the 0.04 BTC mark, litecoin is now sitting around the 0.065 BTC mark without any issues. At the same time, the bitcoin value continued to climb, indicating litecoin is preparing for another bull run and increase its value once SegWit activates.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'While the debate continues within the Bitcoin community, several altcoins have experienced a significant surge in overall value. Cryptocurrencies such as Dash and Ethereum have conquered new levels in price and market capitalization at a time that coincides with the struggles of Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency seems to be undergoing a significant adjustment in fixing its problem of scalability.\n\nRipple climbs 100 percent\n\nMost recent among the rising altcoins is Ripple (XRP) which climbed over 100 percent in value within 24 hours on Friday, March 31, surpassing Dash to become the number three cryptocurrency. On April 1, the dramatic rise continued.\n\nRipple Head of XRP Markets, Miguel Vias, tells Cointelegraph:\n\n""While the recent surge in XRP is certainly influenced by Bitcoin\'s scalability issues, much of the recent momentum is due to the announcement that MUFG joined Ripple\'s steering group, GPSG. Unlike other digital assets, XRP has a clear use case and people are beginning to recognize that.""\n\nA major partnership\n\nOn Thursday, March 30, 2017, MUFG’s banking arm The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) publicly announced that it is joining Ripple’s Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG).\n\nRipple’s GPSG is an interbank group for global payments system that is based on distributed financial technology and was launched in September 2016.\n\nAt the time of launch, the Ripple GPSG was described as the group that will oversee the creation and maintenance of Ripple payment transaction rules, formalized standards for activity using Ripple and other actions to promote the implementation of Ripple payment capabilities as the network continues to grow.\n\nAdvancing technology\n\nOther banks that have already joined Ripple’s GPSG include Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Santander, Standard Chartered, Westpac Banking Corporation, Royal Bank of Canada and CIBC.\n\nInnovations within the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) ecosystem continues to thrive as more altcoins are expected to rise in value due to technology adoption and a growing user base.', 'Russia and China have been in cahoots for quite some time now. Not only have both countries developed a payment network to rival SWIFT, they are also looking to rid of the US Dollar. A new alliance between both nations will focus on a gold-backed trading standard. Bypassing the US Dollar is quite an ambitious goal, but it is not entirely impossible either.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Russian Central Bank opened an overseas office in Beijing. That is quite a significant development, to say the least. A stronger Beijing-Moscow alliance can create a major break-up in the financial sector, that much is certain. Strengthening economic ties between both nations is nothing new, yet it goes to show bigger things are at play behind the scenes. There is even a rumor of how both countries want to introduce a new gold-backed trading standard.\n\nAnyone who has followed the history of the US Dollar will know the currency was decoupled from the gold standard. Although financial experts have claimed this “mistakes” should be undone, protests have fallen on deaf ears so far. This new alliance between China and Russia aims to take advantage of the weakened state of the US Dollar. In fact, it becomes possible to bypass the world’s leading currency altogether. Doing so will have catastrophic consequences for the global financial ecosystem.\n\nThe Return of a Gold-backed Trade Standard\n\nMoreover, both countries will collaborate on solving technical issues surrounding China’s gold imports from Russia. This news also relates to how Russia will issue federal loan bonds denominated in Chinese yuan moving forward. Russia is the world’s fourth-largest gold producer and stronger ties with China can have all kinds of consequences. Having two of the world’s largest gold suppliers team up against the US Dollar will certainly be interesting to watch. China has made it evident they want to issue a gold-backed currency at some point in the future.\n\nKeeping in mind how the Russian Ruble continues to appreciate in value against the US Dollar, interesting things are bound to happen. Although China may suffer from slower economic growth, Russia could prove to be a valuable ally. Trade turnover between Russia and China has increased in 2017, which is a positive development. It is expected bilateral trade and investment between both nations will continue to grow over the coming years.\n\nReverting back to a gold-backed trade standard decreases yuan and ruble volatility. Both currencies’ exchange rates are coupled to the US Dollar right now. However, if both countries could bypass the US Dollar altogether, their national currencies will remains table or gain in value. Both nations have plenty of gold reserves, whereas the United States has slowly liquidated some of its gold assets. The world of finance will never be the same if these plans come to fruition, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Also, the gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect stronger bullish pressure. The 100 SMA also recently held as dynamic support and might continue to keep losses in check.\n\nStochastic is heading north so bitcoin price might follow suit. RSI is also on the move up to show that buyers are in control of price action. However, the former is dipping into the overbought zone already, warning that a slowdown in bullish momentum could be seen and that sellers could take over soon.\n\nIf profit-taking happens at the $1200 area, bitcoin price could retreat to the nearby support at $950-1000. A break below this area could signal a sharper drop to $800. On the other hand, a move past $1200 could take price back up to its all-time highs and beyond.\n\nMarket Events\n\nBitcoin investors seem to be enjoying a revival of confidence as more and more exchanges and platforms are rejecting Bitcoin Unlimited, which is a new version of the software that could render old bitcoin invalid. This move confirms that bitcoin holdings are not likely to lose their value in the near future, attracting more investment activity once more.\n\nReports are showing that key bitcoin experts have reached a grand consensus on the scalability issue, removing risks involved in the hard fork. At the same time, the presence of risk aversion in other financial markets owing to Brexit and Trump administration uncertainties is keeping bitcoin supported.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

But at least a few Cornell University researchers from the Institute for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts have turned some of their attention toward permissioned implementations in an effort to improve them.\n\nRather than an open system like bitcoin that anyone can join, private blockchains rely on a set number of known participants to verify transactions and bundle them into so-called \'blocks\'.\n\nCurrent implementations, though, leave something to be desired, the researchers argue.\n\nSimplicity is an important, if dull sounding, piece that Cornell University principal research scientist Robbert van Renesse stressed many private blockchain implementations are missing.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Being able to scrutinize technology is the cornerstone of scientific discovery, I think. That peers can understand what’s going on is important. It doesn’t have to be everybody, but if it’s just a handful of people there might be some reason for concern.""\n\nThat may well be the case for current private blockchain implementations, according to Renesse, as the distributed algorithms that private blockchains rely on are rather complex.\n\nAt least, that\'s the claim.\n\nScrutable blockchains\n\nPrivate blockchains generally depend on technologies that predate bitcoin, such as practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), to come to agreement about the history of transactions. There are many different ways for private blockchains to reach agreement and, if research from Cornell is of any indication, certain ways of doing so have been under-explored.\n\nRenesse argued that the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger\'s flagship implementation, Fabric, one of the best-known permissioned blockchain protocols, is an example of one that\'s too complex.\n\n""The code for the protocol consists of tens of thousands of lines of code. Analysis of the correctness properties is 40 or 60 pages,"" Renesse said.\n\nThe result? Only a few people understand how it works.\n\nRenesse has been researching so-called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) for decades. Although it sounds befuddling to those not immersed in the science, nodes in a network are notoriously bad at working together. They\'re clumsy; some fail, while others stop spontaneously.\n\nPut simply, there are a range of problems, and the study of BFT, in particular, deals with some of the more irregular ones.\n\nNow, Renesse is building on a protocol, Bosco, that he developed in 2008.\n\nOriginally, he said, he didn\'t think of it as anything more than a ""toy protocol"", but, now that private blockchains are gaining ground – and the entire field of distributed systems is taking off as a result – Renesse is researching how it could be used in a permissioned setting.\n\n""I had a look at Bosco and asked, \'How impractical is this exactly?\',"" he said.\n\nIn contrast to something like Fabric, he argued, the algorithm is much simpler – it takes two pages to outline its security guarantees and it can be implemented in 1,000 lines of code.\n\n""This is a protocol that I can explain to high schoolers,"" he said. ""I\'m pretty confident that after staring at it for a few days they can understand it inside and out.""\n\nSeeking simplicity\n\nIC3 co-director Elaine Shi is working on a similar project.\n\n""I’m a big believer in simplicity,"" she said, making the same point as Renesse, unprompted and during a separate conversation. She\'s working on another project, dubbed \'Sleepy\', which, like other permissioned implementations, ditches bitcoin\'s proof-of-work system, which is used to establish the validity of transaction blocks.\n\nIt is ""extremely simple,"" she said, adding that it has ""strong robustness properties,"" meaning that the nodes don\'t fail so easily. Further, it doesn\'t require global coordination, where every node needs to agree on an action.\n\n""For a consortium, you want to use something that is more manageable,"" she said, pointing out that other private blockchains, such as Chain Core, don\'t have this property.\n\nIt\'s a process that they\'re rolling out step by step. Shi mentioned that she and PhD student Phil Daian have been working with Parity, an ethereum client written in Rust. Parity can support a variety of modes of consensus (including their own private protocol as proof of authority (PoA)). So, the Cornell team is testing how Sleepy works in this setting.\n\nShi used PoA as a guinea pig for comparisons to Sleepy, arguing that Sleepy has better security guarantees, which were spelled out in a white paper released last fall.\n\n""Proof of authority doesn’t make sense when there’s something clearly better,"" she said.\n\nStep by step\n\nHowever, where might these tools might be rolled out? It\'s a question that\'s been long asked of enterprise blockchains in general.\n\nFor Sleepy, Shi and the Cornell team are starting with collaboration with Parity, but the aim is to eventually incorporate it into other frameworks as well.\n\nRenesse\'s implementation might not be far enough along for that yet.\n\n""I implemented [Bosco] on a plane ride from Beijing to Newark,"" he said, adding that the next step is to do a more ""proper"" evaluation.\n\nThere could be a couple drawbacks to the system, however.\n\nBosco perhaps could run into more node crashes, where nodes stop responding to requests and fail to participate. PBFT guarantees data consistency as long as less than one third of nodes are faulty, while Bosco has a lower threshold of one fifth of the nodes.\n\nRenesse cited another problem that affects all private blockchain systems: that a ""malicious bank"" could bring the entire system to a halt by flooding it with spam.\n\nHe doesn\'t consider this a potentially major a problem, though, because participants can simply agree to throw out the bad actor. Despite the drawbacks, Renesse thinks Bosco could give banks and institutions another option.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Banks are most likely to run a protocol and accept the occasional mistake or occasional disgruntled employee that tries to do something bad.""\n\nTech workers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

04/03/2017,"['Bitcoin price surpassed $1,130 on most global Bitcoin exchanges including Bitfinex and Bitstamp earlier today as a result of the Japanese government’s recognition of Bitcoin as a legal payment method under its new set of regulatory frameworks.\n\nOn April 1, a Bitcoin legalization bill drafted and proposed by the Japanese Financial System Council (FSC) was taken into full effect. According to The Japan Times, the bill was proposed in December of 2015 with the intent of preventing unregulated Bitcoin exchanges like Mt. Gox from mishandling user funds and operating with weak Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems.\n\nIn 2015, the FSC noted that the proposed bill would require Bitcoin exchanges and service providers to be approved by the country’s largest financial regulator the Financial Services Agency before offering services to the public. The approval process entails an extensive overview of KYC and AML systems.\n\nSince then, the FSC has been collaborating with the Financial Service Agency and other lawmakers to draft appropriate and practical regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin exchanges and companies in order to recognize Bitcoin as a legal payment method within the country. On April 1, the bill was activated and Japan officially recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nAlmost immediately after the bill was taken into full effect, Bitcoin price began to surge. More importantly, the activation of the bill meant that consumption tax for Bitcoin trading will be exempted starting July of 2017. The official legalization of Bitcoin and the exemption of tax for traders led to the surge of price in the Japanese market and the global Bitcoin exchange market.\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin price within the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market most likely had a significant impact on the global Bitcoin exchange market due to Japan’s 34.46 percent market share over the global market. According to various sources, the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market handles over $120 mln in daily trading volume.\n\nBitcoin price in most major Bitcoin exchanges including Bitfinex surpassed the $1,133 mark earlier today, helping Bitcoin price to recover from a week-long decline resulting from the unresolved scalability issues of Bitcoin.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith positive regulatory approach coming from Bitcoin’s largest exchange market and Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation nearing as the 95 percent activation threshold is close to being met, Bitcoin price is expected to increase by large margins in the mid-term.\n\nThe likelihood of SegWit being activated on Litecoin allowed the digital currency to surge substantially in terms of market cap. Analysts expect to see a similar trend in Bitcoin in the upcoming weeks.', 'Bitcoin miner support for SegWit has continued to rise slowly over the past few days, currently sitting at 30%, but remains far from the needed 95% to activate the proposal. There is also a growing push for Litecoin, an alternative digital currency, to activate SegWit as well, currently sitting at 57% support.\n\nIn either case, a successful soft fork and the subsequent advantages of SegWit activation on scaling and block size should be beneficial for all digital currencies, merely as proof of concept. Sure, the testnet exists and shows validity of the proposal, but until a digital currency protocol with a billion dollar market capitalization is SegWit-functional, it’s harder for miners, nodes, users and traders to truly understand the benefit. Follow the BTU and SegWit proposal signaling breakdown per block here.\n\nEven after a SegWit soft fork, a hard fork with another derivative of the bitcoin protocol is not out of the question. So long as there is 51-75% miner support, the hard fork may still occur. Whether the benefits of SegWit are enough to keep the hard fork possibility at bay remains to be seen.\n\nOn the weekly chart, the price of bitcoin appears to have found support and will now range between the local low and all-time high.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index, a measure of momentum, gives the price plenty of room to continue upward past the previous all-time high (ATH). With a bullish fundamental event like SegWit activation, which begins to solve scalability problems, a substantial jump in price could be expected.\n\nThe next technical resistance appears to be the 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci extensions at ~$1600 and ~$2000 respectively. These levels ought to be easily obtainable should scaling become fixed.\n\nThe logic for this assumption is that, with the current 1MB ceiling, the rate of transactions per block has effectively stagnated. With a marginal increase in block size leading to the ability for future off-chain transactions through the Lightning Network, the network as a whole would become much stronger and more useful to the general public. Price banging on an ATH while banging on the block size ceiling should be seen as no coincidence.\n\nThe most important active pattern at the moment is the building inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. On this daily timeframe chart, you can see how this is a repeating fractal pattern from the downward move in January. This should signal a bullish reversal once the neckline is cleanly broken. The right shoulder does not need to meet the same horizontal support as the left shoulder and is often diminutive, as is seen in the previous pattern.\n\nSummary\n\n1. Despite the growing support for SegWit, I still expect a push for a hard fork, allowing Bitcoin Unlimited to compete with SegWit. How this will affect the price of either asset is really an open question, but should Segwit hold up to its promises as a viable scaling solution, BTU will likely not live on for long. The soft fork vs. hard fork timeline and order will be very important for the price in the coming months.\n\n2. Bitcoin’s price found support on a previous resistance zone. The next resistance zone will be between the previous and current ATH.\n\n3. With block size expansion, expect the probability of a price expansion as well.\n\n4. There is an active chart pattern on a high timeframe calling for bullish reversal. A convincing candle close above the current horizontal resistance should yield a price of ~$1350 within the next month.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Private. Easy. Safe. Tidy. pic.twitter.com/QHjU5pisGe — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) April 3, 2017\n\nMicropayments for content is one of bitcoin’s most talked about uses. The Aspen Institute’s Walter Isaacson has called it journalism’s “savior,” while the creator of Javascript, Brendan Eich, is building a variety of technologies to turn it into a reality. The thinking is that bitcoin provides a low-cost way to send tiny amounts of value over the internet, free of the fees levied by the “antiquated banking system,” as Isaacson put it.\n\nKim Dotcom’s idea is to allow any publisher on the web to easily charge readers tiny amounts for content with “one line of code” on their website. This service would eventually extend beyond individual files or streams to entire websites, he says in his demo video.\n\nThe odds are stacked against Kim Dotcom’s new venture. He’s launching Bitcache as a service for a rebooted version of his original enterprise Megaupload, which allowed users to upload large files, and others to download them for free, or pay a fee as a member for quicker speeds. Consumers are now spoiled for choice when it comes to free, or paid, options for sharing large files—just look at Dropbox or any other cloud storage service. The internet landscape today is nothing like 2005, when Megaupload was founded.\n\nBut if Kim Dotcom can get his new service to the scale of the 150 million users he amassed with Megaupload, he could be the one to unlock bitcoin’s potential as a payments layer for digital goods of all kinds.\n\nRead this next: Bitcoin’s civil war threatens to blow up the cryptocurrency itself', 'Bitcoin startup Blockstream has unveiled new technology for shielding data on a blockchain.\n\nExpanding on an old technique used to hide transaction amounts, the company has developed a new scheme dubbed \'confidential assets\' to conceal the types of assets in a transaction. Revealing just how the tech works, the startup has released a new paper today, co-authored by Blockstream developers Andrew Poelstra, Adam Back, Mark Friedenbach, Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.\n\nUsing confidential assets, viewers of a blockchain would be able to see a transaction\'s senders and receivers, but not what kind of asset is traded – whether bitcoin, stocks, gold, or something else.\n\nSo why is hiding asset types important?\n\nBanks have made it known that they aren\'t thrilled that blockchains make certain information public, and have been increasingly exploring various ways of making their holdings private while still taking advantage of the ability to share the database of transactions with others.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Blockstream CEO Adam Back framed confidential assets as a technology to help enterprises overcome what he called this ""awkward tradeoff"".\n\nTokyo-based marketing company Digital Garage has been revealed as the first partner to use the new tech, as a part of Blockstream\'s Elements sidechains initiative, with plans to use it to shield loyalty points.\n\nBlockstream core tech engineer Greg Sanders described confidentiality as a ""key requirement"" for Digital Garage, as well as other companies using blockchain tech.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""The companies care a lot about their privacy. You don\'t want that [transaction data] out in the open because it\'s basically showing your books to everyone. Confidential assets allows companies to move these assets on a publicly verifiable blockchain, but hide the amounts and the types of assets being moved around at the same time.""\n\nHowever, the tech is not yet being used in a production setting.\n\nVerifiable but private\n\nBlockstream has been exploring the enterprise blockchain world over the past couple of years, including joining the Hyperledger consortium and deploying private blockchains on top of bitcoin.\n\nIt\'s also been testing privacy features on Elements sidechains, including using ‘confidential transactions’ – a technique first proposed by Back – to shield transaction amounts from non-participants in the system.\n\nIn a nutshell, the system uses cryptography to prove that people are getting their money, even while the details aren’t revealed to everyone. Yet anyone, including nodes, can verify that the transaction is valid.\n\nConfidential assets extends this concept to shield multiple assets.\n\nHowever, there is a downside of both confidential transactions and confidential assets – they require much more space on the blockchain than standard transactions.\n\nBoon to privacy\n\nConfidential assets is currently being tested on a Blockstream Elements sidechain, though it can potentially be ported elsewhere.\n\nAccording to Back, though, while the system works on a sidechain, it\'s is not suitable for bitcoin proper, since the digital currency\'s code doesn’t support other asset types.\n\nHowever, some other projects now use confidential transactions, including MimbleWimble and the privacy project ValueShuffle. And if developers of such projects chose to, they could effectively upgrade to support confidential assets instead.\n\nIn conclusion, Back described the new technology as a part of a larger push for adoption of bitcoin and blockchain technology, saying:\n\n""And to the extent that confidentiality would be an impediment to companies adopting the technology, and just user privacy rights as well, it’s important that we be able to provide confidentiality so that the industry can adopt blockchain technology and start deploying the advantages without being held back by confidentiality concerns.""\n\nVenetian blind image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

During that time, trading of the BFX token was halted and all margin positions were liquidated.\n\nThe move follows the August 2016 hack of the exchange, in which investors were given a 36% haircut to compensate for a hack that drained 120,000 BTC from the exchange’s reserves. The BFX tokens thus represented an equity obligation to return the 36% back to platform users sometime in the future.\n\nNotably, this isn\'t the first internal BFX buyback orchestrated by Bitfinex, as the exchange purchased 1% of the tokens in September 2016.\n\nThe $1 face value tokens had traded between $0.49 and $0.65 for most of 2016, surrounded by doubts that the exchange would never be able to recoup the nearly $72m in value lost following the security breach. That price increased to $0.89 by 1 March 2017 following a strong period of heavy trading volume in the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThe announcement posted on the company\'s webpage expressed gratitude for the patience of the community and continued support.\n\nBitfinex wrote:\n\n""We are tremendously grateful to all of our customers and new shareholders for helping us get to this point.""\n\nAs of 21:00:00 UTC, CoinDesk has confirmed BFX tokens are being redeemed at the stated $1 face value.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That discussion has led to talk of a 'hard fork' of the core software – a possibility that could split the digital currency into two rival coins.\n\nFears over the issue seemed to have hit prices late last month, as bitcoin once again exchanged hands at sub-$1,000 prices mid-to-late March.\n\nWhile it's never easy to directly link events in the real world to movements on the price charts, it would seem that bitcoin traders are shrugging off concerns over the scaling issue and still seeing the core value in the cryptocurrency.\n\nChild with wings image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He has worked with leading media and news agencies in the technology and finance industries, offering exclusive content, interviews, insights and analysis of cryptocurrencies, innovative and futuristic technologies.', ""Bitmain, the major Chinese ASIC producer, has launched a third mining pool: ConnectBTC opened to the public today. AntPool and BTC.com already belong to the Bitmain group of mining pools. This new pool is part of Bitmain’s Israeli research and development (R&D) center, Bitmaintech Israel, and as such, is the first mining pool based in the Middle-Eastern country.\n\n\n\n“There is a very strong tech and cryptocurrency industry in Israel, and we’re proud to now open the first Israeli Bitcoin mining pool,” ConnectBTC manager Gadi Glikberg told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nConnectBTC\n\nGlikberg was previously the vice president of sales for Spondoolies Tech, the Israeli ASIC producer that shut down in mid-2016. Bitmain CEOs Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan decided to set up the R&D center in Tel Aviv shortly after, where Glikberg took on a managing role.\n\nGlikberg believes the new pool’s main differentiator is that ConnectBTC provides detailed real-time information and analytics to connected miners (or “hashers”). This should give them a better understanding of their machine’s performance without having to develop custom internal monitoring tools themselves.\n\n“Think of miners as servers that are working at 100 percent CPU 24/7,” Glikberg explained. “Modern data centers use expensive monitoring tools to monitor the status of the servers, so they can respond quickly when a server goes down or doesn't perform as expected. Most miners don't have such external tools and they rely either on the pool or on a proprietary tool such as a script that they build themselves.”\n\nConnectBTC will instead be providing this to miners as a standard service, Glikberg said:\n\n“ConnectBTC provides a high detailed user interface, specifying real-time detailed information about the status of each miner, so miners can review and quickly identify any potential problem with their unit.”\n\nConnectBTC has been operating in closed beta since December and has amassed a small amount of hash power since. Glikberg expects that level to grow over the coming months.\n\nBlock Size and Scaling\n\nBitmain and its pools have been at the center of Bitcoin’s scaling debate lately. The company’s co-CEO Jihan Wu in particular is a vocal supporter of Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative protocol implementation designed to let miners and users change their block size settings.\n\nAntPool is currently the largest mining pool on the Bitcoin network, representing some 15 percent of all hash power, and started signalling support for Bitcoin Unlimited several weeks ago. BTC.com represents an additional three percent, but hasn’t signalled support for Bitcoin Unlimited as of yet. It’s been suggested that Bitmain effectively exerts influence over the hash power of other Bitcoin Unlimited signalling pools as well — though this is has so far been denied by Bitmain and the pools.\n\nConnectBTC was fully developed by Bitmaintech Israel, independently of any other pool. Glikberg expects the pool will operate fairly independently for now, similar to BTC.com. This also means the pool won’t signal support for Bitcoin Unlimited for the time being, nor for other scaling solutions such as Bitcoin Core’s proposed Segregated Witness soft fork.\n\n“For a lot of us, it seems like the block size debate is the most important topic in the world, but for miners, the most important thing is to keep their machines running with minimal down time,” he said. “Miners have a vast interest in stability, just like most players in the industry. I think that's why we are seeing a lot of hashing power staying on the fence. At the moment, the pool is not voting either way. I think that large part of the miners are still undecided about the best way to go.”\n\nThough, as for a potential future direction, Glikberg didn’t exclude the possibility that his pool may decide to support a block size limit increase later on.\n\n“We are talking to many miners, and we hear more or less the same thing — miners want to see bigger blocks and at the same time don’t feel comfortable with any proposed solution. I'm sure that once miners feel comfortable enough with any proposed solution, they will signal for it.”"", 'The past few days have been quite interesting for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. Various currencies have seen their value increase over the weekend, which is far more uncommon than most people give it credit for. As a whole, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased as well, which is a positive development.\n\nCrypto Market Cap Reaches New All-time High\n\nBased on the statistics provided by Coinmarketcap, it is good to see so many cryptocurrencies gain value over the weekend. For the longest time, bitcoin and altcoin gains seemed to be mutually exclusive, yet that no longer appears to be the case as of late. It also goes to show the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to mature and traders are diversifying their portfolios.\n\nIn fact, the current total cryptocurrency market capitalization sits at US$27.544 billion. That is quite an increase compared to the same period last year, when the market cap sat at just over US$8.197bn. It is evident in the past twelve months have been critical for cryptocurrency, although it is not just bitcoin appreciating in value. In fact, bitcoin’s market cap “only” represents 67.1% of the total market cap right now, which is far lower than most people would expect.\n\nParticularly the past 24 hours have been quite interesting for a few different currencies. Significant gains have been recorded for Ripple, as XRP gained 104.07% in value all of a sudden. The total gains would have been much higher if the Poloniex exchange had not encountered unexpected issues during the best period of XRP trading. At one point, XRP was trading well above the 7,000 Satoshi mark, before plummeting back to 4,100 once Poloniex slowly resumed their services again.\n\nOther currencies saw intriguing gains as well. Ethereum and Monero held up quite well, with Litecoin even slowly gaining value once again. The big “loser” of the weekend was Dash, as the current crashed down to the US$57 mark, down from its previous high of over US$100. Then again, this situation may recover moving forward, as it seems all currencies are going full steam ahead once again. In the end, the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to grow, and more money has poured in by the look of things.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The Bitcoin ATM scene continues its steaming expansion with 53 new machines opening in March, according to data from Coin ATM Radar.\n\nThe site, which logs official launches of ATMs worldwide, registered even more in February, with 86 serving users in an industry only just beginning to find its audience.\n\nThere are now almost 1,100 machines in total, not including those which may exist but which have not made it to listings.\n\nAn example of such machines was those appearing in Russia in February and March, which have since been formally recognized.

At the same time, independent manufacturers are reducing in number.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs a method of buying and selling Bitcoin, however, ATMs still lack the appeal of online methods and point-of-sale payment options such as BitPay.\n\nFees are likely to be a major factor in slowing growth, with rates of 8-10 percent per transaction not uncommon.']"
04/04/2017,"['While bitcoin has recently suffered some defeats in the U.S. at the hands of the SEC, not all news has been bad news. In a major move for bitcoin legitimacy, Japan has recognized bitcoin as a legal payment method on April 1. (And no, it wasn’t an April Fool’s prank.)\n\nAs part of the new law that has “legalized” bitcoin in Japan, the nation’s Financial Services Agency has put capital requirements, along with cybersecurity and operational stipulations, in place for bitcoin exchange, said CoinDesk. Additionally, bitcoin exchanges in Japan will now be required to conduct employee training programs and submit to annual audits.\n\nWith this news, the price of bitcoin broke out of its slump post-SEC denial amid growing fears of a hard fork, rallying to rise over $100 in the first three days of April. At the time of writing, one bitcoin was worth $1,135.07, up 3.30 percent from Sunday’s close.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied the second bitcoin-based ETF bid up for consideration — the Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.’s NYSE Arca exchange’s request to list and trade the SolidX Bitcoin Trust. Once again, lack of oversight, regulation and the potential for fraud in the broader bitcoin space worked against the proposed ETF.\n\nThe government of Japan’s move to legalize and regulate bitcoin could set a precedent internationally among nations looking to work digital currency regulation into their respective legal and financial systems.\n\nSwitzerland has become a highly bitcoin-friendly nation as of late, with FINMA’s plans to clarify regulation, railway ticketing systems’ recent adoption of bitcoin ATM functionality and Ernst & Young’s Switzerland office adding a publicly accessible bitcoin ATM. Additionally, the government of Australia set out to create accounting standards for bitcoin in November of last year, said CoinDesk.\n\nIn the U.S., the SEC still sits on one remaining bitcoin ETF proposal, though given the outcomes for the prior two, things look grim for the viability of Grayscale Investments LLC’s Bitcoin Investment Trust.', 'For eight years, Bitcoin — “magic internet money” as its fans like to call it — has defied its detractors and survived numerous stumbles to become worth more than $1,100 a coin.\n\nBut in the last couple months, a two-year-long standoff over how to increase the transaction capacity on the network — aka “the block size debate” — has escalated to a crisis point, with two sides threatening to use their versions of a nuclear option to get their way.\n\nIncreasingly, it has looked as though this “trustless” technology (which purportedly replaces trust in institutions with trust in software) could eventually be doomed by the mistrust between the main bitcoin stakeholders.\n\nOn Monday, the infighting got worse when word leaked about a new proposal being touted as a way to “save bitcoin in one fell swoop.”\n\nBut because the group proposing it did not follow the typical protocol of suggesting it in developer communities and instead reached out to the media first, the community immediately turned to a number of conspiracy theories — for instance, one side speculated that the group had secretly been paid $300,000 by the other side to develop the proposal.\n\n“There’s an impasse right now and instead of people coming to an agreement, the whole community is splintering,” said Vinny Lingham, well-known for his bitcoin price predictions who is also now vocal about his pessimism regarding bitcoin because of the discord. “Everyone is taking aggressive positions. … It’s the nature of narcissism with really smart people. Everyone thinks they’re right.”\n\nHowever, after the rumors forced the proposers to go public with their idea early, reception on Reddit and Twitter was mixed, ranging from suspicion and skepticism to cautious optimism that the proposal, for an addition to bitcoin called extension blocks, had technical merit.\n\nThe proposal manages to address the demands of both sides, Emin Gun Sirer, Cornell associate professor and co-director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts, wrote in an email: “Clearly, the block size debate has devolved into a complex chess game with moves and counter-moves from two sets of entrenched interests. This latest move is technically very clever, and politically brilliant.”\n\nHowever he recognized the risk that the current divisions could outweigh the technical considerations, writing, “If recent history is any guide, we can expect the two camps to still find much to dislike about this proposal. Though given how carefully this compromise has been crafted, disagreements will most likely stem from non-technical root causes” — for instance, the attempt to sidestep protocol and engage the media before the development community.\n\nThe Proposal: Extension Blocks\n\nWhen people talk about the block size debate, there’s what it’s about — the size of blocks, or how many transactions can be processed at any given time — and then there’s what it’s really about — in this case, control of bitcoin. (This is a point I explored in my story on the game theory of bitcoin and also discussed further in my latest podcast.)\n\nLet’s first discuss what it’s about. The current bitcoin network limits the amount of blocks of transactions added to the ledger to 1MB. The miners, who run the network and are responsible for adding transactions to the bitcoin ledger, want to increase that limit. (There have been different proposals over the years over exactly what the new cap should be.)\n\nThe developers, on the other hand, have been wary that raising that threshold could harm bitcoin’s decentralized properties and make it more subject to the influence of any particular institution, group, individual, country or other entity. Plus, boosting that limit would require what’s called a hard fork, which runs the risk of splitting the network and creating two versions of bitcoin and likely harming its value in the process — especially if it’s done without widespread support. The developers backed a proposal called Segregated Witness (SegWit) to make blocks more efficient, thereby enabling more transactions per block, that wouldn’t require a risky hard fork.\n\nKeeping these different considerations in mind, Andrew Lee, CEO of bitcoin-enabled Amazon discount site Purse, which backed the extension block idea, said, “The beauty of this proposal is it gives everyone what they want.”\n\nExtension blocks enable bigger blocks, plus the version suggested implements SegWit, and doesn’t require a hard fork. Co-author Christopher Jeffrey, said, “The goal was to move bitcoin forward but at the same time to keep it safe.”\n\nThe way extension blocks work is that they process more transactions outside of the 1MB block but peg them to each block on the main bitcoin blockchain. Stephen Pair, coauthor and CEO of bitcoin payment processing company BitPay said, “I think it’s a good idea. I think it’s a way you can seamlessly enhance the capabilities of the network and allow people to experiment without endangering the blockchain.” However, he noted, “It needs that period of time where people can test it and evaluate it.”\n\nEric Lombrozo of the Bitcoin Core team, which has been in charge of the development of the software for the last several years, objected to the proposal on the basis of how untested it is compared to SegWit, which has been released but not been adopted by enough computers on the network to make it activate.\n\n“My biggest concern is that even assuming it would work in principle, in practice it will still require review, … implementation, testing, convincing the ecosystem to support it, and implementing support in existing applications and libraries...which means considerable delays still,” Lombrozo wrote in an email.\n\nCould It Work?\n\nAs for what this debate is really about — control of the network — it’s not clear whether this idea will succeed in uniting these entrenched factions.\n\n“This is the problem,” said Samson Mow, formerly of Chinese cryptocurrency exchange BTCC who is a supporter of Core’s SegWit solution. “They’re going outside of the norm for how open source software is being developed. They’re building up a lobbying effort and then saying, everyone wants this, so this is what we’ve got to do. This goes against the principles of bitcoin and how it needs to be open, decentralized and transparent.”\n\nBecause of how contentious the issue has become, Bitcoin developers have been discussing a pseudonymous proposal process so ideas are based not on who proposed them but their technical strengths. Mow said that the way extension blocks were proposed gives it a political bent and could pressure developers because outside groups may already want it. “So then if you’re developer, you’re put in the position of, if I speak against it, am I speaking against some other person’s wishes or stepping on someone else’s toes?” said Mow.\n\nWhile the jury is still out on its technical quality, the extension block proposal may be irreparably hobbled by what many people in the community perceive to be its shady origins, illustrating that this “trustless” technology has a very human element.\n\nDespite his positive technical appraisal of extension blocks, BitPay’s Pair demurred when asked if this solution could end the two-year-long impasse. “I would never make a prediction like that,” he said. “This whole debate changes day by day.”', 'WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Controversial New Zealand-based internet mogul Kim Dotcom plans to launch a Bitcoin payments system for users to sell files and video streaming as he fights extradition to the United States for criminal copyright charges.\n\nThe German-born entrepreneur, who is wanted by U.S. law enforcement on copyright and money laundering allegations related to his now-defunct streaming site Megaupload, announced his new venture called ‘Bitcontent’ in a video posted on Youtube this week.\n\n“You can create a payment for any content that you put on the internet...you can share that with your customers, with the interest community and, boom, you are basically in business and can sell your content,” Dotcom said in the video.\n\nHe added that Bitcontent would eventually allow businesses, such as news organizations, to earn money from their entire websites. He did not provide a launch date.\n\nDotcom did not provide details on how Bitcontent would differ from existing Bitcoin operations or how it would help news organizations make money beyond existing subscription payment options.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.\n\nThe currency’s anonymity has however made it popular with drug dealers, money launderers and organized crime groups, meaning governments and the financial establishment have been slow to embrace it since the first trade in 2009. The currency’s value hit record levels in 2017, trading at $1,145 on Wednesday, a fivefold increase in a year, amid growing interest globally.\n\nA New Zealand court ruled in February that Dotcom could be extradited to the United States to face charges relating to his Megaupload website, which was shutdown in 2012 following an FBI-ordered raid on his Auckland mansion, a decision he was appealing.\n\nDotcom, who has New Zealand residency, became well known for his lavish lifestyle as much as his computer skills.\n\nHe used to post photographs of himself with cars having vanity plates such as “GOD” and “GUILTY”, shooting an assault rifle and flying around the world in his private jet.', 'Media coverage of bitcoin and blockchain technology has increased over the last one year. Anytime you are on the web, you are likely to encounter a blog or website article that talks about blockchain and bitcoin. Investors have not been left behind either. Established businesses, as well as startups, are investing in blockchain technology. It would be unfortunate to just get used to the two terms but not really grasp the concept and the relationship between them. Here, we bring you all you need to know with regards to bitcoin and blockchain to ensure that you always remain current with the facts of these fintech trends.\n\nBitcoin Demystified\n\nBitcoin is a form of digital currency that is currently being bought, sold and spent in many parts of the world. You can transact bitcoin outside the traditional banking system which requires that money goes through an intermediary, a bank. Once you send bitcoin to someone, the transaction is broadcast to a network of computers working round the clock. The transaction is then verified and confirmed almost instantaneously. The information regarding your transaction as well as other transactions involving bitcoin is recorded and stored in a public ledger. The public ledger is visible on all computers forming part of the network. All of these computers work towards the same goal, verification of every transaction involving bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain Demystified\n\nAs mentioned above, bitcoin transactions are recorded and stored in a public ledger. Each transaction is recorded on the ledger as a block. A series of transactions form a blockchain. Notably, the term blockchain is also used to refer to the technology itself. While blockchain is the series of bitcoin transactions on a public ledger, blockchain technology is the technology that is used to record the transactions. This technology is also simply referred to as blockchain.\n\nThe Relationship between Blockchain and Bitcoin\n\nWhile bitcoin is the digital asset (currency), blockchain is the technology that bitcoin is built on. Therefore, bitcoin is dependent on blockchain technology. Without blockchain, bitcoin would not be valuable because there would be no secure method of transacting in it. Blockchain provides a verifiable database ensuring that all purported transfers are actually transfers. As a result, you are protected from double spending and fraud.\n\nSignificance of the Relationship between Blockchain and Bitcoin\n\nThe relationship between blockchain and bitcoin is of great significance. Through blockchain, the distributed computers recording and verifying a transaction must agree that the transaction is valid before a new block can be added to the chain. This presents a level of security and protection that has not been witnessed before. No single computer can alter the history of the chain. The trust that is usually given to central institutions such as banks to keep accurate records will eventually be replaced with a consensus-based model.\n\nIt is suggested that although current discourse about blockchain has been limited to its applicability in the financial sector, it will in future be used in record keeping, property deeds, contracts, and shipping information. It is for this reason that many commentators have labelled blockchain a disruptive technology.', 'Legislation making bitcoin and virtual currencies legal currency took effect this month in Japan. The country’s Financial Services Agency released a text of the law last week.\n\nThe Accounting Standards Board of Japan will create a framework to determine how the accounting sector can address digital currency. According to the Nikkei, the process is expected to take six months.\n\nAccounting Standards Still Needed\n\nMany companies expressed concern that the government has not provided guidance for the accounting of cryptocurrencies.\n\nChikako Suzuki, a partner at PwC Aarata, told Nikkei Asian Review there is a risk that companies holding virtual currency could have incorrect valuations and could suddenly suffer major losses.\n\nApproximately $1.7 billion of cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies, circulated across Japan two years ago. A Fuji Chimera Research Institute study projects this number to reach $9 billion by 2020.\n\nLessons From Mt. Gox\n\nAmendments to banking law concerning virtual currency were passed in 2016. Uncertainty arose about the legal status of virtual currency following a multi-million dollar embezzlement scandal and the collapse of the Mt.Gox bitcoin exchange in 2014.\n\nMt.Gox was once largest cryptocurrency exchange before it collapsed, resulting in a loss of 850,000 coins ($480 million at the time). Mt. Gox had handled around 80 percent of global bitcoin transactions. The exchange admitted that there was a flaw in its system that enabled hackers to steal the coins.\n\nThe new law places virtual currency exchanges under the control of the Japanese Financial Services Agency. The exchanges must be registered and must verify the identity of customers opening accounts.\n\nJapan’s Cabinet last year approved amendments to the law making bitcoin an officially recognized currency.\n\nJapan Adapts To New Technology\n\nThe bill passed last year revised portions of the Banking Act to account for changes in the economy driven by the growth of telecommunications technologies.\n\nThe law did not change the taxing of virtual currency.\n\nVirtual currency was described as having asset-like values, limited to items that are electronically recorded excluding Japanese currency, foreign currency and currency-like denominated assets. It is usable as payment.\n\nVirtual currency was also described as asset-like values to be used in exchange for other items and transferred via electronic data processing.\n\nVirtual Currency Considered An Asset\n\nUnder the law passed last year, virtual currency is considered as an asset for accounting purposes. The government has been asked if virtual currency should be recorded at book or market rate value. The government leaves this choice up to the individual party.\n\nVirtual currency will still be treated as the transfer of taxable assets. The transactions are taxable.\n\nVirtual currency received from overseas from intermediaries are not tax deductible purchases and instead are treated as non-taxable purchases.\n\nIncome from virtual currency earned by an individual is treated as miscellaneous income and is subject to tax on aggregate income. It is treated as operating revenue for corporations.\n\nCurrency-denominated assets are displayed in foreign or Japanese currency or assets against which monetary obligation are made in foreign or Japanese currency. Those assets against which monetary obligation is made in a currency-denominated asset is considered a currency-denominated asset.\n\nExchanges Are Regulated\n\nThe regulations passed last year include provisions for registering as a virtual currency exchange service provider (VCESP), and rules to ensure proper deployment of virtual currency exchange services, according to a summary by the International Financial Law Review.\n\nApplicants need to be a stock company and have an office and representative in Japan. The applicant also has to meet financial requirements, including a minimum capital of $87,300 and positive net assets.\n\nOnce registered, the applicant has to follow the following rules:\n\n1) Take responsibility for the security of systems related to its services.\n\n2) Supervise external service providers properly by confirming their status in cases where exchange services are outsourced.\n\n3) Take measures to protect users, including explaining that virtual currencies are not foreign or Japanese currencies and provide tri-monthly reports on transaction records, and segregate user deposits from its own deposits in a law-specified manner.\n\n4) Segregate user deposits in virtual currencies or cash once a year a minimum with regard to segregating financial and management statements.\n\n5) Have external audits annually at a minimum with regard to segregating financial and management statements.\n\n6) Create internal management systems to address complaints about services that are fair.\n\n7) Establish books and records about its services.\n\n8) Submit a yearly report and quarterly reports about the relevant authority using the form specified in the law.\n\nUnder existing accounting guidelines in Japan, virtual currency holders can table it as inventory while issuers can deem it a liability. That’s the closest a company or an individual can get to considering digital currencies on a balance sheet, however.\n\nSince there is no specific instruction or method of accounting to consider bitcoin and other popular currencies like Ether and Litecoin in Japan, many adopters leave their digital currency holdings off their books entirely, the report noted.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A Bitmain company has launched the Bitcoin network’s newest mining pool to the public. Developed and operated by Bitmaintech Israel, which is Bitmain’s first R&D center outside of China, ConnectBTC pool is aimed at providing a way for miners to avoid the risk they encounter in the mining process, says its manager, Gadi Glikberg.\n\nGlikberg states in a chat with Cointelegraph:\n\n“We see that pools have begun to offer creative new ways of payments that roll the risk back to the miners. We believe that with the recent fluctuations in the tx fees, miners deserve to have the pool, bear the risk and offer a fixed payment that takes into account the tx fees.”\n\nThe new pool’s launch is coming at a time when Bitmain and its pools have been actively involved in Bitcoin’s controversial scaling issue. Bitmain owns AntPool which is currently the largest mining pool on the Bitcoin network - controlling about 15 percent of all hash power - while BTC.com represents an additional three percent. With regards to Bitcoin scaling, Bitmain’s preference tilts towards Bitcoin Unlimited over Bitcoin Core’s SegWit.\n\nSubsidy\n\nOne may have expected ConnectBTC to identify in that direction too. However, Glikberg says his pool is yet to decide on which solution he prefers for the Bitcoin scalability issue.\n\n“At the moment, the pool is not signaling either way. If we decide to cast a vote we will do that by talking to our customers and understanding where their interests are,” he says, adding that they are rather working to benefit their users for now.\n\n“In addition to the six percent subsidy we offer, we’re launching with a new UI that makes it easier than ever to keep an eye on the real-time status of miners making it easier than ever to manage several mining units.”\n\nThe pool, which has been already up and running in closed beta for a few months, provides highly detailed real-time information and analytics to miners, and gives mining operators a better understanding of their performance, without having to develop custom internal monitoring tools.\n\nIt requires no configuration or setup to use. Rather, it automatically sets up workers and frees mining operators from having to maintain two sets of configuration both locally and at the pool.\n\n“High subsidies on regular PPS plans allow miners to benefit from the increase in transaction fees while avoiding any risks,” he says. Glikberg adds that ConnectBTC aims to be the new home for miners, hence it’s operating under a robust infrastructure and employing the latest cutting-edge technologies to ensure members can maximize their profit and minimize the work required of them.', 'Bitcoin and Blockchain are receiving a dedicated day at a week-long event highlighting the use of cryptography in finance and data security.\n\nThe International Financial Cryptography Conference, which kicked off in Malta on Monday and runs until Friday, draws together industry experts and academics worldwide, who will present findings and hold discussions on the issue.\n\nTuesday sees a session on Bitcoin and Blockchain technology specifically, with Hashcash creator Adam Back, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin and Charles Hoskinson among the attendees.

Since Bitcoin\'s launch in 2008, businesses and startups offering Bitcoin services have been pushing for further acceptance in the greater global economy. The listing of Bitcoin as an ETF on a major U.S. exchange would have put Bitcoin on track to one day rival other global commodities such as gold, silver and oil. Many market participants anticipate a Bitcoin ETF would have a positive impact on the current price of Bitcoin, as it would allow for institutional investors, funds and individuals to add Bitcoin to their portfolios.\n\nBut it didn\'t happen. Per the SEC (emphasis mine):\n\n[The] Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because […] First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.\n\nThe ruling is quite clear in stating its two main reasons for disapproval. Let\'s take a deeper look at the two reasons.\n\nProblem 1: Exchange Surveillance-Sharing Agreements\n\nA surveillance sharing agreement is an agreement between a self-regulatory organization (SRO), in this case, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust’s “Self-Regulatory Organization: Bats BZX Exchange,” and a commodity exchange operator.\n\nWith respect to the Bitcoin exchange market, there is serious concern about potential market manipulation.\n\nAs you can see from this chart, which outlines the reported global Bitcoin trading volume across all public bitcoin exchanges over the past two years. the clear dip in January 2017 is the result of Chinese bitcoin exchanges removing no-fee trading.\n\nThe first point of suspicion is the incredible drop in trading volume in entering 2017. We see the trading volume from Huobi, BtcChina, and OKCoin virtually vanish. These three China-based exchanges were under Chinese government scrutiny near the end of 2016. Markets with proper oversight simply do not experience such sudden and precipitous drops in trading volume.\n\nThe proposed “Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust” ETF only had a surveillance sharing agreement on Bitcoin exchange named “Gemini Exchange,” but Gemini Exchange is a digital currency exchange also owned by Digital Asset Services LLC (the same group petitioning the SEC to list the ETF). As the SEC ruling notes (emphasis mine):\n\nThe Gemini Exchange conducts only a small fraction of the worldwide trading in bitcoin …\n\n… Gemini Exchange accounted for just 0.07% of all worldwide bitcoin trading, and 5.16% of the much-smaller bitcoin-USD market worldwide …\n\nIn fact, the SEC is correct in assessing that Gemini exchange is by no means a “significant market” for bitcoin trading. In this chart, we can see quite clearly that over the past six months, Gemini has contributed very little to the overall BTC/USD market. Not only does Gemini not have a significant market share, the majority of BTC/USD trading actually occurs on offshore exchanges. As a matter of fact, Bitfinex, the world\'s largest market for BTC/USD trading, lost over $70 million of customer funds in 2016, yet remains the world\'s largest exchange.\n\nProblem 2: Exchange Regulation\n\nIn the SEC’s analysis, it deals a secondary blow to the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust’s proposal.\n\n… the Gemini Exchange is not a “regulated market” comparable to a national securities exchange…\n\nHaving a look at Gemini’s website, we see that Gemini exchange does not define itself as a “regulated market,"" but rather as a trust under the oversight of the New York Department of Financial Services. As a matter of fact, of the three currently operating exchanges in the United States (Gemini, itBit and coinbase), none are currently classified as a “regulated market.""\n\nFor A Bitcoin ETF To Succeed, Key Changes Are Needed\n\nGiven all these hurdles, significant changes in the market are required before a bitcoin ETF proposal could see the light of day. In my opinion, there are two key changes needed in the market before this can happen:\n\nMajority of Bitcoin trading must occur on U.S.-based exchanges U.S.-based Bitcoin exchanges petition for access to “regulated markets”\n\nThe first requirement is going to be very difficult but is likely the only way significant trading activity could ever fall under regulated, surveillance-exchange agreements. The majority of Bitcoin trading currently occurs on overseas exchanges. Other commodity ETFs track products traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nWith respect to regulations, it is unlikely that current Bitcoin exchanges will petition for increased regulation in the near future due to the significantly increased related costs. A more prudent approach would be to gain closer relationships with regulated commodities exchanges.\n\nFundamentally, the prospects of a Bitcoin ETF are low; it will not likely happen in the near future. Institutional investors looking to gain exposure to the digital currency markets will likely have to work with regulated brokers, or, offshore ETFs, such as the one currently listed in Sweden.\n\nNevertheless, current Bitcoin investors have a lot to gain from a future ETF approval. It would solidify Bitcoin, and digital currencies themselves, as a whole as a new asset class.', 'As an observer of the Bitcoin market as long as this original cryptocurrency has existed, it never made much sense to me from an investment perspective. Bitcoin prices were too volatile and the volatility seemed too random. Volatility can be a good thing for traders, mind you, but only if you think you have an idea why the price goes up and down the way it does. Otherwise it is just a good way to lose all your money. But a couple of recent events have changed my view of Bitcoin. I now think I can explain its volatility and predict it well enough for profitable trading. And the best part is that it takes no rocket science at all. Your mother (and mine) can make a living trading Bitcoins.\n\nFor those who don’t know, Bitcoin is a stateless currency based on blockchain calculations. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins and only 16-odd million of those have so far been ""mined."" The present value of all mined Bitcoins is around $18 billion, which is amazing if you realize they came from nowhere and have no intrinsic value.\n\nMy first realization about Bitcoins this year came among the annual predictions I publish every January. Here’s what I wrote then:\n\nPrediction 7\n\nNot the demise of Bitcoin, but finally an acceptance of what the crypto currency is (and isn’t). My son Cole, who is 12 (and now taller than me), was for awhile a Bitcoin miner. We bought a used Ant Miner last year on eBay, equipped it with a proper power supply and set it going 24/7 in the Man Cave, where most boyish things happen around here. The rig was incredibly loud and -- after the first electric bill arrived -- totally uneconomic. We were paying twice as much for electrons as Cole was receiving in Bitcoins for his labor. Anyone with a robust solar installation want to buy an Ant Miner?\n\nThen a few weeks ago Bitcoin prices started to rise again and I saw Bitcoin stories with headlines like ""Too Big to Fail."" Yet what goes up seems to inevitably come down because Bitcoin prices crashed yet again a few days ago. This led me to a realization that I think is going to become popular: Bitcoin is an excellent transfer currency but as a longer term store of value it sucks and that isn’t likely to change.\n\nBitcoin is a great idea, blockchain is an even better idea, but since neither is backed by the full faith and credit of, well, anyone, a Bitcoin will always be a sorry substitute for a dollar or a yen. The price of Bitcoins will rise as folks in China find the need to use them to get money out of that country. But when their money finally is out of the China it is inevitably converted straight into dollars and the Bitcoin crashes as a result. So there may be some cyclical arbitrage opportunity in Bitcoins, timing the market to take advantage of the suckers, but as a true currency, Bitcoin will probably never cut it.\n\nThis says nothing about technical merit, mind you. What matters here is psychology and behavior. It’s the ""full faith and credit"" thing. Without it Bitcoin can’t be trusted to be any more than a short-term monetary value mule.\n\nMy second Bitcoin realization came last month when the SEC denied two separate proposals to create Bitcoin-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The SEC’s reason for the denials doesn’t matter here but it’s likely to stick even under President Trump, so don’t expect that situation to change. Bitcoin ETFs would have ballooned the currency’s capitalization as little investors piled-in like timeshare condo buyers. It would have been an easy win for those with large existing Bitcoin holdings like the Winklevoss twins, who were behind the first ETF proposal to go down in flames.\n\nUpon the news, Bitcoin dropped in price by 25 percent then recovered completely within two days! When the second ETF application was denied the drop was much smaller and the recovery even quicker. Some will say the market had already priced-in the SEC decision, but that begs the question of not why Bitcoin didn’t go down by much, but why it quickly continued to rise? This is what I think I’ve figured out.\n\nI’m starting to believe Bitcoin can’t go down in value. I mean, it will be volatile of course and there will be many bumps in the road. But over time, it’s a good bet that it will continue to rise in value as the most popular cryptocurrency. If it loses that status then fine, it can go down, but something is going to win here and Bitcoin is the prime contender.\n\nThe first reason I say this is because there are two kinds of Bitcoin owners.\n\nFirst are those poor sods who think it’s a store of value and the price will go up for unknown reasons. These folks are much like stockholders. There are only a finite number of shares of a given stock. When I buy one I slightly make the price go up. If I hold that share, I also ever so slightly put upward pressure on the stock price because my one share is not available for sale. Obviously, I’m (slightly) limiting supply.\n\nUnlike stocks, however, there’s another kind of Bitcoin owner -- one who owns the currency only for a few seconds. You can spend Bitcoin at Dell (and lots of other places) to buy computers. Now what really happens is that I can convert Fiat currency to Bitcoin, send it to Dell (For the nice minimal transaction costs) and Dell instantaneously turns it back into Fiat. Dell and I hardly cared about Bitcoin: it was (as I explained in my annual predictions) a transfer mechanism, not a store of value.\n\nDell and I were Bitcoin owners for only a fraction of a second, but we were owners. We did indeed “limit supply” of Bitcoin for a very short time.\n\nAmazingly, Dell and I were utterly insensitive to Bitcoin’s price. All we want is non-volatility for the few seconds we owned it. I don’t care if a Bitcoin is worth a dollar, a thousand dollars or a million dollars. I’ll buy the exact number of Bitcoins (or fractional bitcoins), send them to Dell, and they’ll turn them back into Fiat. As long as the USD to Bitcoin exchange rate remains relatively stable in that tiny timeframe, we accomplished our value transfer.\n\nRealization number three -- Bitcoin transactions are increasing.\n\nThat is, more and more Bitcoins are being owned for fractional seconds. At some point enough transactions (especially big ones) mean a lot of Bitcoin is out of the supply pool tied up in transactions. Bitcoin gets harder to find if even for a few seconds. Hence you have to convince more people from the first type of owners (the stored value holders) to sell their Bitcoins back into the supply, driving prices up.\n\nBitcoin is having some high-transaction issues which might cause a technical downfall from what I describe, but in general, whichever cryptocurrency wins will end up ever-increasing in value because of a finite money supply and the scarcity of money itself!\n\nThat’s the micro view, now let’s look at the macro view of the same market. As I wrote in my prediction, a large part of the Bitcoin market -- the really big transactions -- are rich people in countries with capital transfer controls using Bitcoins to get parts of their fortunes out of Dodge and into some safer economy. There are lots of such countries and -- this is the important part -- there will always be lots of such countries. So whether it’s a Chinese cabinet minister or a Russian oligarch or someone from behind Door Number Three, there will always be some rich person trying to move a shiftload of money to safer ground.\n\nThis suggests my new Bitcoin trading strategy, which I admit I have only tried so far on paper. Here’s how it works. Bitcoins go down in value when the demand for them as transaction instruments decreases. When that Russian oligarch sells his shiftload of Bitcoins for US dollars, Bitcoin value goes down. When that happens -- when Bitcoin prices drop by 20 percent or more -- BUY! The price will inevitably come back up, I assure you.\n\nWhen Bitcoin prices rise by 20 percent or more -- SELL! You just made 40 percent on your money.\n\nRinse, repeat, automate, get rich.\n\nNothing short of some other cryptocurrency taking the business from Bitcoin is going to change this trend. Say Goldman Sachs throws billions into doing exactly as I propose but as an institution. That will drive Bitcoin values generally higher and decrease price volatility a little, but the general trend will continue. So lower your threshold to +/- 10 percent (instead of 20) and do twice as many transactions.\n\nThe success of this strategy comes, I think, from the limited supply of Bitcoins. With only 16 million in circulation and only 21 million EVER, there will always be price changes with larger transactions, which is to say there will always be profit opportunities. I wonder if this was part of the Bitcoin plan from the beginning?\n\nAnother growing cryptocurrency is called Ripple and it was designed, frankly, to avoid these very profit opportunities. There are 100 billion Ripples, for example, compared to 16 million Bitcoins. But then Ripple is aimed straight at inter-bank transfers while Bitcoin has to be aimed, I’m guessing, straight at those who prefer to avoid banks altogether, at least for transactions like these. Bitcoin is the Wild West cryptocurrency.\n\nNow for the paper test of my trading strategy. Using the interactive Bitcoin historical daily price chart at 99bitcoins.com, I started my paper test by converting $100 to Bitcoins on July 17, 2010 -- the first day Bitcoins were ever traded -- when the price was $0.05. I then scrubbed through the data looking for selling and buying opportunities that more or less met my +/- 20 percent guideline.\n\nThis is neither an optimal nor a perfect trading strategy and it misses a lot of profit opportunities, but is easy to automate. For example there are times when the sell signal is just a hiccough and the price keeps going right on up (or down), but I’ve already sold (or bought). In some instances there are almost daily trades while in two cases I went more than a year without doing anything because my criteria weren’t met. In all, there were 31 total transactions, with my last SELL order on February 2, 2017 at $990.65 for a total value of $21,638.88. A BUY order followed on March 26, 2017 and prices are generally higher since, but I’ll stand on growing $100 to $21,638.88 (almost a 220X profit) in about 6.5 years.\n\nIn contrast the S&P 500 grew by 2X (from 1100 to 2300) in the same period.\n\nBut maybe my huge Bitcoin paper trading success had to do with starting at the very beginning when a Bitcoin was worth only a nickel, which will never happen again. This is a mid- to long-range trading strategy I’m proposing, but if it has any real value that should be visible in a couple years, so I went back to the 99bitcoins chart and did the same analysis starting a year later, then two years, three years and four years later. I also did the analysis beginning when Bitcoin first hit $10, $100 and $1000.\n\nStarting with $100 in July 2011 my paper trades grew to 1,056.26 in 5.5 years for a 10X return.\n\nStarting with $100 in July 2012 my paper trades grew to 2,020.99 in 4.5 years for a 20X return.\n\nStarting with $100 in July 2013 my paper trades grew to 289.81 in 3.5 years for just under a 3X return.\n\nStarting with $100 in July 2014 my paper trades grew to 183.41 in 2.5 years for a 1.8X return.\n\nStarting with $100 when Bitcoin first reached $10 in June, 2011 my paper trades grew to $1532.01 in 5.5 years for a 15X return.\n\nStarting with $100 when Bitcoin first reached $100 in April, 2013 my paper trades grew to $505.82 in 3.75 years for a 5X return.\n\nStarting with $100 when Bitcoin first reached $1000 in December, 2013 (a true moment of irrational market exuberance) my paper trades didn’t really grow at all in four years but at current prices I’d get my money back.\n\nSo in all scenarios except one, my paper returns clobbered the S&P 500 and in that one exception, though I didn’t make any money, I didn’t lose any, either, other than opportunity cost.\n\nSince I’m known as an economics blogger of sorts (the Kauffman Foundation has declared me several times to be one of the top US economics bloggers), but I’ve never before proposed a trading strategy, I thought I’d reach out for some adult supervision. So I showed a draft of this column to Darrell Duffie, Dean Witter Professor of Finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a friend of mine for 30+ years. Here’s what Darrell had to say more succinctly than I ever could:\n\n""On the substance, you are proposing that there is mean reversion in the price of Bitcoin through the effect of price impacts caused by big transactions. This happens a lot in other financial instruments. I don’t know whether this is a correct diagnosis in the case of Bitcoin price behavior, but I would not rule it out. It seems reasonable.""\n\nPhoto credit: Lightboxx / Shutterstock', 'One of bitcoin\'s earliest angel investors, Roger Ver has backed a number of startups including BitPay, Purse and ShapeShift, and is the owner of resource portal Bitcoin.com. Ver is noted as both an outspoken evangelist for the technology and one of the first \'bitcoin millionaires\'.\n\nIn the first entry in CoinDesk\'s ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Ver discusses his initial brush with the technology and recounts the watershed moment when a single bitcoin became more valuable than the US dollar.\n\nI first heard the word \'bitcoin\' in November or December 2010 thanks to a mention of it on the FreeTalkLive.com podcast.\n\nIt sounded interesting enough. I maybe spent a few moments Googling it. At the time one bitcoin was worth about $0.10. I thought to myself, ""This is interesting, but if no one is using it, it isn\'t worth anything.""\n\nI moved on with my life after only about five minutes of research...\n\n***\n\nIn February 2011, I heard bitcoin mentioned again, so I decided to Google it once again. The price was now around $0.40, and this time I started to see the bigger picture.\n\nI began to understand that:\n\nThe supply of bitcoin is limited\n\nThey could be sent anywhere in the world for free (no longer true)\n\nThey could be sent anywhere nearly instantly (no longer true)\n\nThey could be used almost anonymously (less true than we thought)\n\nIt was impossible for governments to stop.\n\nThat\'s when the dots (helped by years of studying Marx and Mises) connected in my mind.\n\nI realized that people were going to start using bitcoin as money and that I needed to buy some, but that was easier said than done in those days.\n\nThere was no Coinbase, Xapo or Blockchain. In fact, the only wallet was the Bitcoin-QT full client that still had the option of CPU mining in it. The only option for buying bitcoin was a website with a strange domain called Mt. Gox.\n\nI contacted the website and received a personalized response rather quickly from the site\'s owner, Jed McCaleb (he hadn\'t yet sold the business to Mark Karpeles). After an email exchange or two, I decided to send $25,000 to what I recall was a personal bank account in New York.\n\nI waited for him to credit my account at Mt. Gox... and the price of bitcoin rose... and then it rose some more...\n\n***\n\nSeveral days went by, but Gox still hadn\'t credited my wire transfer.\n\nI began to grow impatient... The price was rising ever closer to $1.\n\nAs the price rose, so did my frustration at not having had my wire credited... but I wasn\'t deterred. My excitement for the future potential of bitcoin was rising as well – and I was openly telling friends about bitcoin.\n\nOne of them was less than convinced.\n\nWhen I explained bitcoin to him, and how I had just initiated a purchase of $25,000 worth because they were so amazing, he sarcastically replied, ""If you think bitcoins are so great, why don\'t you buy more of them?""\n\nAs soon as he said that to me, I knew he was right, and that I should buy more of them! That very same day I initiated a second wire to Mt Gox.\n\nSomewhere in between, bitcoin passed $1...\n\n***\n\nAs anyone who has owned bitcoin before knows, the moment you have some yourself, you feel much more connected with the cause and the people in the ecosystem.\n\nI couldn\'t help but tell anyone who would listen to me about all the wonderful ways in which bitcoin was about to change the world for the better.\n\nI would literally tell anyone who would listen.\n\nFrom strangers in a restaurant, to cashiers at convenience stores, to everyone at family gatherings or weddings, whether they wanted to hear about bitcoin or not. (Many of them did not!)\n\nI paid for the world\'s first bitcoin billboard and national radio ads. I set up the first major store to accept bitcoin as payment. I was involved with many other projects. The more bitcoin companies I invested in and the more bitcoins I bought, the more fun the whole experience became.\n\nI knew that we were all working on a fundamentally world-changing technology, but the rest of the world still had no idea.\n\nBut, the real turning point for me though was owning my first bitcoin, and watching the price cross the $1 barrier for the first time.\n\nI still remember the naysayers claiming that a bitcoin could never be worth a whole dollar each. They claimed that bitcoin was just a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, or no different than digital Beanie Babies.\n\nThey were all wrong, and I gladly told them so.\n\nToday, many people still dismiss bitcoin. Bitcoin isn\'t guaranteed to be the winning cryptocurrency in the end. But its invention is guaranteed to have changed the world forever.\n\nBitcoin and US dollar image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

04/05/2017,"[""Japan is set to for a massive explosion in Bitcoin acceptance. This is after a new law that authorizes the use of digital currency like Bitcoin came into force on April 1, 2017, the text of which was released by Japan’s Financial Services Agency on March 24, 2017. The way is now clear for Japanese merchants to start accepting Bitcoin at stores to make purchases.\n\nBitcoin’s rising popularity in Japan\n\nCoincheck, a Bitcoin wallet and exchange provider based in Tokyo, Japan has teamed up with VeriTrans Co. Ltd and EconText in providing Bitcoin payment gateway services to Recruit Lifestyle Co. Ltd, a company owned by Recruit Holdings, the renowned Japanese Human Resources firm.\n\nCoincheck revealed in a Press Release announcing the partnership that Bitcoin transaction volume in Japan has risen significantly from 2016 and in January 2017, the volume has surpassed ¥ 541.1 billion. This is 20 times higher compared to the same period last year.\n\nLarge retailers are gearing up for Bitcoin\n\nAccording to the Nikkei Asian Review, It is expected that two large retailer groups will start accepting Bitcoin as early as April 7, 2017. With Bic Camera, a large electronics retailer starting a trial run at their Yurakucho district store and Bitcoin can also be used at the Shinjuku Bicqlo Bic Camera, the hybrid store shared between the electronics retailer Bic Camera and the Clothing giant Uniqlo.\n\nRecruit Lifestyle’s partnership with Coincheck will enable retailers who have the AirREGI application to accept Bitcoin. AirREGI allows customers to pay just by simply scanning a barcode. As for retailers, all they need is an iPhone or iPad with an Internet connection to enable them to process payments.\n\nTourists in Japan will benefit enormously\n\nJapan’s fledgling retail sales figures are a concern for the government and tourist money is of increasing importance to the pacific nation.\n\nIn recent years, Japanese merchants have started attracting Chinese tourists by accepting China UnionPay. AirREGI too had partnered with Alipay and Coincheck reports that as a result in Spring 2017, sales have increased noticeably and the gross merchandise volume was the recorded as the ‘largest ever.’\n\nIt is expected that Bitcoin, which is used by many foreign visitors will also lead to a further boost in tourist spending in Japan. AirREGI’s Bitcoin payment option will be introduced in the Summer of 2017 and it will be possible to use Bitcoin at more than 260,000 stores.\n\nBitcoin adoption will only increase - Japan and worldwide\n\nJapan’s embrace of digital currency is a welcome and positive step. Bitcoin acceptance at stores can potentially widen from this point forward.\n\nWe asked Kagayaki (Kaga) Kawabata, Business Development Lead at Coincheck.comabout what he thought about the growth in merchant acceptance of Bitcoin in Japan:\n\n“Yes. Partnership with Recruit group, a very well-known public company in Japan, will accelerate merchants Bitcoin adoption for sure. Since the inception of the service, Coincheck provided Bitcoin payment gateway to merchants. We were the first in the Japanese market to provide an instant Bitcoin payment gateway that converts Bitcoin to YEN automatically. By providing simple and intuitive UI/UX, we penetrated the market having 99 percent of the market share currently.

And yes, we are considering global expansion.”"", 'Controversial New Zealand-based internet mogul Kim Dotcom plans to launch a bitcoin payments system for users to sell files and video streaming as he fights extradition to the United States for criminal copyright charges.\n\nThe German-born entrepreneur, who is wanted by U.S. law enforcement on copyright and money laundering allegations related to his now-defunct streaming site Megaupload, announced his new venture called \'Bitcontent\' in a video posted on Youtube this week.\n\n""You can create a payment for any content that you put on the internet...you can share that with your customers, with the interest community and, boom, you are basically in business and can sell your content,"" Dotcom said in the video.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nHe added that Bitcontent would eventually allow businesses, such as news organizations, to earn money from their entire websites. He did not provide a launch date.\n\nDotcom did not provide details on how Bitcontent would differ from existing bitcoin operations or how it would help news organizations make money beyond existing subscription payment options.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.\n\nThe currency\'s anonymity has however made it popular with drug dealers, money launderers and organized crime groups, meaning governments and the financial establishment have been slow to embrace it since the first trade in 2009. The currency’s value hit record levels in 2017, trading at $1,145 on Wednesday, a fivefold increase in a year, amid growing interest globally.\n\nA New Zealand court ruled in February that Dotcom could be extradited to the United States to face charges relating to his Megaupload website, which was shutdown in 2012 following an FBI-ordered raid on his Auckland mansion, a decision he was appealing.\n\nDotcom, who has New Zealand residency, became well known for his lavish lifestyle as much as his computer skills.\n\nHe used to post photographs of himself with cars having vanity plates such as ""GOD"" and ""GUILTY"", shooting an assault rifle and flying around the world in his private jet.', 'When a bitcoin startup proposed a new way to solve bitcoin\'s scaling debate this week, it provoked an all-too-familiar response.\n\nConversation escalated on Twitter, lines of argument formed quickly, rumors spread of mass-media deception, and ultimately, a proposal was put forth that perhaps only provided evidence that disagreement among the tech\'s supporters is the new norm.\n\nThat\'s the old script that replayed when bitcoin startup Purse proposed upgrading bitcoin to support so-called \'extension blocks\', adding yet another proposal to the now years-long scaling debate that dates back to 2015.\n\nAs pitched, extension blocks would allow a way for bitcoin users with different needs from the network to live under their own rules – essentially enabling nodes to select their own block size while remaining on the same network.\n\nAs it only requires a soft fork – a change that wouldn\'t require all the network\'s nodes to update – the team framed it as a way to get around bitcoin\'s current deadlock on how best to scale the digital currency\'s transaction capacity.\n\nIn response, some developers pointed to online discussions around similar proposals from months (or even years) ago that revealed the potential security flaws of the plan. Others argued it could take another year to test and deploy the solution, whereas another solution, SegWit, has already been through that process.\n\nIn other words, not everyone agreed that the new plan was a safe one.\n\nMixed reactions\n\nThis seems to be par for the course for the industry, which saw two similar events take place last week.\n\nDuring this time, the idea the network may put in motion a hard fork – a controversial method of upgrading that could risk splitting bitcoin into two networks – continued to see discussion, though proposals seemed to borrow from a slew of competing ideas.\n\nWang Chun, co-owner and chief administrator of mining pool F2Pool, submitted an idea to the bitcoin mailing list that was unusual since it would not trigger until 2020. With a 32MB block size increase locked in, he argued the bitcoin community could use a soft fork, to change it to a smaller size ahead of the activation date.\n\nChun\'s idea, however, like Purse\'s, wasn\'t really a new one. He said that he brought it up at a scaling meeting in Hong Kong last year, and Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr once issued a similar concept.\n\nHis letter ended with a warning that those following the debate have also likely heard before:\n\n""We must code something right now, before it becomes too late.""\n\nIn short, it was another proposal without full support, prompting more than 70 replies, an unusually high number for the mailing list, with multiple variations of \'yes\' or \'no\'.\n\nA few days later, Rootstock (RSK) developer Sergio Demian Lerner posted another hard fork proposal. In a sense, it was different from Chun\'s in that it wrapped together two changes: SegWit (the solution favored by core developers) and a hard fork to double the block size parameter (an idea often voiced by miners).\n\nThough it won some supporters, the reaction was again mixed. Not all developers saw it as a novel idea. Further, because it advocated for a hard fork, many simply weren\'t willing to entertain the idea.\n\n""These are all hard forks, so they are dead on arrival for any sort of near-term activation, unfortunately,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""If you\'re going to split with a contentious hard fork, the decent thing to do is pick a new name, pick a new address prefix, enable replay protection and fork peacefully.""\n\nMeet and repeat\n\nFork proposals might not be the only industry event to be in a bit of a loop.\n\nAnother scaling meeting is coming up in May, one which Digital Currency Group (DCG) co-founder Barry Silbert has confirmed the VC firm will host. However, not everyone is heralding it as a milestone.\n\nWhile at first listed on a possible list of attendees, bitcoin investor and Bitcoin.com operator Roger Ver said that he doesn\'t plan to attend.\n\n""I agree that there have been plenty of meetings already, and none ended in a lasting agreement,"" he said.\n\nSuch a meeting would add to a history of approaches to the scaling solution that have included a number of in-person meetings.\n\nOf note is the famed \'Hong Kong agreement\' that saw some developers and miners agree on a roadmap that was then met with delays and disagreement from those that didn\'t attend.\n\nSince then, appetite for in-person meetings is perhaps low – a fact exacerbated by the fact no one wants to be seen as in charge of the protocol or its decision-making.\n\nBlockstream CEO Adam Back rejected DCG\'s invitation on the grounds that he believes there\'s an implication he represents bitcoin\'s volunteer developer team.\n\n""There is a persistent incorrect assumption that Blockstream [is the same as] Core, or that, by implication, I speak for bitcoin developers. Neither of these are correct, so if that expectation is in the room it will just feed the false narrative,"" he wrote in an email to the investment firm, which has a stake in Blockstream.\n\nThe silver lining\n\nThis constant confusion over who represents what, or speaks for who, has added increasing difficulty to the discussion. Indeed, irrespective of the proposals, there is even the matter of who gets to decide what agreement is, even if there was consensus around a technical fix.\n\nAmong the options are users, businesses, miners and developers, though determining who even falls into which category, as evidenced by exchanges above, remains a challenge.\n\nBlockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille showcased the perception issue in his response to Chun\'s proposal, in which he suggested that developers don\'t have the power to force bitcoin users to accept a change, such as a 2MB block size increase.\n\nHe argued that if Bitcoin Core ""blacklisted"" network activity in a new software version, for example, users could simply choose not to download the new software version if they didn\'t support the change.\n\nStill, it could be argued that the negative sentiment has nonetheless galvanized historic levels of open discussion.\n\nWith at least three scaling ideas offered in the past week, adding to many others over the last few years, it seems there\'s no end in sight to the ongoing conversation – but that that might not be a bad thing in the context of technical innovation.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.\n\nBroken reel-to-reel image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'In a post on the Bitcoin development mailing list today, Blockstream CTO and long-time Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell laid out the case that an unnamed Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer is using a flaw in Bitcoin\'s proof-of-work implementation to gain an efficiency advantage of up to 30 percent over other miners.\n\nMoreover, this could explain why Segregated Witness (SegWit), the Bitcoin protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, is blocked by some miners. Many therefore suspect the hardware manufacturer in question is Bitmain, whose CEO Jihan Wu is a staunch opponent of SegWit.\n\nA source familiar with the matter has confirmed to Bitcoin Magazine that this is indeed the case; though that source prefers to remain anonymous.\n\nASICBOOST\n\nASICBOOST is a patented technology developed by former CoinTerra CTO Timo Hanke and RSK Chief Scientist Sergio Damián Lerner. It takes advantage of what Maxwell described as a ""vulnerability"" in Bitcoin\'s proof of work system, by utilizing what the ASICBOOST inventors describe as ""an ingenious new way to process work items"". With ASICBOOST, specialized ASIC mining-chips can be up to thirty percent more efficient.\n\nMaxwell writes that an ASIC mining device from a ""major manufacturer"" has been reverse engineered, which revealed that it contains undisclosed, covert use of ASICBOOST functionality. This could, Maxwell estimates, lead to as much as $100 million in increased revenue per year for a mining cartel controlling 50 percent of the network hashrate.\n\nIn addition to leading to enormous profits, the ASICBOOST technique can also have detrimental effects on the bitcoin mining ecosystem as a whole, Maxwell explained:\n\n\n\n""This could have a phenomenal centralizing effect by pushing mining out of profitability for all other participants, and the income from secretly using this optimization could be abused to significantly distort the Bitcoin ecosystem in order to preserve the advantage.""\n\nBitmain\n\nMaxwell did not mention a specific hardware manufacturer in his email himself, but a source has confirmed to Bitcoin Magazine that Bitmain is the entity in question. And with only a handful of ASIC producers active on the market today, there really aren\'t many candidates.\n\nBitmain may also hold the patent for ASICBOOST in China, but the details of the seemingly related patent are not clear at the time of publication. According to BitGo CTO Ben Davenport , the patent is related to ASICBOOST.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, the incompatibility of the covert use of ASICBOOST with Segregated Witness seems to be a giveaway. According to Maxwell, the covert method of mining with ASICBOOST is no longer possible if Segregated Witness activates on the Bitcoin network. Over the past six months, Bitmain has been one of the only staunch opponents of Segregated Witness in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n\n\nAs noted by Maxwell:\n\n\n\n""An incompatibility would go a long way to explain some of the more inexplicable behavior from some parties in the mining ecosystem so I began looking for supporting evidence""\n\nThe use of ASICBOOST could also explain why Bitmain\'s main pool, AntPool, mined blocks roughly 100KB smaller than other mining pools of a comparative size during the month of February.\n\nAn unnamed source familiar with the matter told Bitcoin Magazine that the technique is easier to pull off when empty or nearly-empty blocks are mined.\n\nAdditionally, Maxwell\'s post claims that the best methods of covertly implementing ASICBOOST are ""significantly incompatible with virtually any method of extending Bitcoin\'s transaction capabilities"", with extension blocks as a notable exception. Recently, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu tweeted support for a new scaling proposal based on this exact concept. Former BTCC COO Samson Mow even said Bitmain funded the extension blocks proposal, though Wu denied that to be the case.\n\nSolutions\n\nASICBOOST has been discussed on the Bitcoin development mailing list before. As patents are state-enforced, some Bitcoin developers, like Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, are concerned it could skew competition by non-market factors. Others, however, argued that an optimization in hardware should not be punished by a protocol change, and at that point no consensus over a solution was found.\n\nNow, in his post to the mailing list, Maxwell proposes two solutions to counter at least the covert use of ASICBOOST. The first is, indeed, activation of Segregated Witness by flag day activation: miners can be ""forced"" to signal support for Segregated Witness through a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) starting at a specific point in time. The second option is described as a WTXID commitment, which simply makes the covert method of ASICBOOST impossible even without activation of Segregated Witness.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitmain for comment on this story but had received no response at the time of publication.\n\n\n\nAaron van Wirdum contributed to this article.', 'It might seem hard to believe that Bitcoin barely existed not even 10 years ago.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin’s first official non-mined transaction happened in January 2009, which was between Hal Finney and Satoshi Nakamoto. A few months later, Kristoffer Koch spent roughly $27 for 5,000 bitcoins worth $0.0001 USD as of June 2009–which were then estimated to be worth $886,000 in 2013.\n\nBitcoin reached its first peak in November 2013, when it hit $1,000 per coin. Between 2014 and 2016, however, it took a bit of a hit and sat somewhere between $200 and $800.\n\nNow, Bitcoin is worth roughly $1,131.59 USD, and has even begun rivalling the price of gold. Not only that, but the list of how to use the digital currency–or cryptocurrency, that is produced and held electronically–is growing and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nMore and more retailers in Japan, for example, are accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment. Dozens of countries also accept Bitcoin, while big name countries like Microsoft, Dell, and Expedia also take Bitcoin. Putting it simply, it’s safe to say that Bitcoin has made a name for itself over the last several years.\n\nWith that in mind, research conducted by Junior Research suggests that Bitcoin users can grow to five million in the next two years. As such, with Bitcoin’s increasing popularity it’s hard not to wonder whether it will become a global currency–and whether a Trump presidency is bitcoin’s answer.\n\nWill Bitcoin Beat Gold? See how the two assets have been doing in our new report\n\nGive me my free report!\n\nTrump bitcoin currency: price surge\n\nAfter President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, it didn’t take much longer for the price of Bitcoin to reach a new high. On March 2, 2017, Bitcoin reached $1,268 per unit–which surpassed even the price of gold–for the first time ever.\n\nAs noted by Forbes, the Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares nearly tripled in value over a 12 month period and gained almost 30 percent between December 2016 and March 2017 alone. To get an idea of how much the price of Bitcoin has soared over the last several months, following Trump’s election victory Bitcoin jumped from $708 to $738, and is now $1,131.59 (noted above).\n\nOn that note, much like other currencies, Bitcoin reacts to world and political events–particularly in countries where there’s a strong market–such as the US. Similarly, Trump has made it no secret about his preference for a weaker US dollar to help American companies sell goods abroad. This, in turn, has pushed Bitcoin prices up (including gold and silver).\n\nTrump bitcoin currency: will it happen?\n\nWhile Bitcoin isn’t a government-issued currency, or tied to a specific country, company or bank, advocates are making a strong case to turn to the digital currency as an alternative, especially for those who are hesitant of central banking systems.\n\nWith Trump’s presidency having a positive impact (so far) on Bitcoin, experts at Denmark’s Saxo Bank have said that, ” Trump’s plans to increase spending — which would grow the U.S. economy but cause inflation — may prompt people across the world to seek alternative currencies.”\n\n“Emerging market powers eager to move away from being tied to the monetary policy of the US and the banking system as well as to adopt the block chain as a payment system prove willing adherents as they adjust to zero interest rates and the decrease in systematic risk,” the December 2016 report reads.\n\nThe report further suggests that if banking systems in Russia and China accept Bitcoin as an alternative to the US dollar, the price of Bitcoin could very well rise above $2,100. With 51 percent of its user based outside the US, and the fact that China is pushing for a new global currency separate from American influence, the possibility of bitcoin as a global currency is more likely than one might think.\n\nStill–there is work to be done before that can happen. At the end of March, the Securities and Exchange Commission denied the Bitcoin ETF application to list on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n“The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter,” the SEC statement reads. “First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.”\n\nDespite this, it’s clear to see how far Bitcoin has come in the last decade, and some suggest it will be the sixth largest currency by 2030.\n\nMoral of the story? Be patient. A Trump presidency just might be the kick bitcoin needs to become a global currency.\n\nDon’t forget to follow us @INN_Technology for real-time news updates.\n\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Jocelyn Aspa, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.', 'International Forex trading hub Cyprus has signaled that “comply or close shop” standards will be enforced within nine months, causing uncertainty among FX companies, some of them holding Bitcoin/fiat positions.\n\nRetail trading companies located on the island offering clients Bitcoin/fiat pair options have yet to be instructed on Bitcoin options but the latest Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) statements and the Central Bank of Cyprus’ view on cryptocurrencies may put these operations into question.\n\nCyprus is host to about 80 percent of the world’s retail FX and binary options companies, nestled in the financial district of Limassol. The rising number of complaints risks tarnishing the industry that is still growing at a fast pace.\n\nAbrupt meeting\n\nOn Tuesday, CySEC Chairman Demetra Kalogerou lined up the executives of the island’s Forex firms for an abrupt closed doors meeting. Sources presented at the meeting told Finance Feeds that the change is coming to the industry in what may be a make or break phase.\n\nThe retail forex trading industry grew rapidly lately, surviving some scandals. Some firms have already paid heavy fines, already to the tune of over three million euros on the island alone.\n\nUncertainty\n\nAs early as 2014, the Central Bank of Cyprus issued a warning on the risks associated with virtual currencies when certain companies have introduced the dollar/Bitcoin pair.\n\nIt still holds a neutral stance, while suggesting traders or holders of virtual currencies take steps to protect themselves as they are yet to be regulated. It is uncertain how the latest development will influence companies offering dollar/Bitcoin pairs.\n\nNew regulations aimed at protecting clients might affect the cryptocurrency trading options.\n\nCall centers to be banned\n\nCalling out the boiler room tactics used via call centers, Kalogerou looks to ban them entirely. Sales staff will be required to change from cold callers into CySEC licensed and examined professionals starting this year. A warning was raised against reports of giving clients financial advice and offices will have to be set up in countries where a substantial number of clients reside to better represent them.\n\nAffiliate marketing has yet to be called out for a strict ban or not, while Ms. Kalogerou sternly raised concerns as to how to monitor marketers on how and what they advertise to potential clients.\n\n“We do not like introducing brokers at all, we do not like affiliates,” said Kalogerou on the topic of affiliates.\n\nLeverage limits\n\nLeverage limits will now be set to a maximum of 1:50 until clients request and show an aptitude for more. Currently, leverage as high as 1:500 is available to retail clients. The commission already requested a 1:50 cap in November 2016, calling anything above that “excessive leverage.”\n\nWith European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and Markets in Financial Directive II (MiFID II) legislation set forth by the EU, the market it set to get its act together. Furthermore, CySEC has made it clear that the corporate tax efficient environment of Cyprus will not play host to those who cannot or will not comply.', 'EDINBURGH, Scotland, April 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Users on the leading digital and cryptocurrency exchange platform Paybis can now buy Bitcoin instantly with their credit card.

Ever since its inception in 2008, Bitcoin the peer to peer digital currency has steadily grown into limelight. Importantly the underlying technology of Bitcoin, ie Blockchain has numerous spheres in the Business community excited of its potential to cause major disruption in the way we do business.\n\nThe digital revolution has also ushered a new growth in digital payments\n\nGrowth in ecommerce leads to growth in online payments\n\nSolutions such Payment wallets allows ease of use\n\nAccessibility of smartphones and mobiles phones has increased\n\nWhilst Enterprises have geared up over the years to adapt to digital payments and now looking at the endless opportunities of Blockchain , the question is have they addressed the elephant in the room ie Digital Currencies?\n\nThe interest in Digital currencies is occurring in several spheres. They have now become an asset class in themselves. Central Bank of China has recently piloted a digital currency showcasing interest in government spheres. There has also been a steady increase in Bitcoin merchants over the years\n\nHere are few factors enterprises need to consider for leveraging digital currencies\n\nDigital Currency Evaluation – unlike FIAT currencies like USD , GBP etc where assessment is based amongst other things macro-economic factors, digital currencies need to evaluated on technology basis to assess which digital currency may be suitable Validation Architecture -These include the approach of validation to conduct transactions applied with view to secure the currency. For eg Dash applies Master Nodes whereas Bitcoin does not use that Scalability – This refers to the avg transaction time and number of transactions that can be carried out by the currency network. Eg Ethereum can handle much larger volume of transactions as compared to Bitcoin Hardforks –A significant change to the protocol software which may require upgrade. Financial infrastructure -Review whether key wallet providers and exchanges deal in the currency Regulatory Environment - For multinational operations, assessments need to be made around countries that allow transactions in Digital currency. For eg India has discouraged the use digital currency sighting AML contraventions\n\n– unlike FIAT currencies like USD , GBP etc where assessment is based amongst other things macro-economic factors, digital currencies need to evaluated on technology basis to assess which digital currency may be suitable\n\nIntegration into Enterprise software: Considerations have to be made towards undertaking impact assessment for systems used by corporations across areas such as order to cash, procure to pay and record to report. As an example ERP packages such as SAP usually maintain currencies in two decimal numbers whereas Bitcoin is traded in upto 8 decimal numbers. Therefore configuration changes will be required to accommodate a digital currency\n\nAnother example would be Bank & Cash reconciliation functionalities which would need to be reviewed prior to trading in Digital currencies\n\nProgram Rollout and Governance- Digital currency implementation covers mutlidisplicnary functions in an organization and therefore would ideally be spun as a separate program Whilst a number of companies have digital departments with Chirft Delivery Officers , assessment has to be made on the approach of the right structure of program governance and sponsorhip within the organization\n\nWhlist critics may argue that the evolution of digital currency will take time however for enterprises to define a strategy and rollout would equally take time & effort .Therefore the need to recognize this new paradigm of digital disruption and draw competitive advantages will become important for companies worldwide', ""An Indian politician who has previously raised his concerns on the growth of bitcoin in the country has, once again, urged the Indian government to weigh in on the cryptocurrency’s legality. More pointedly, the bitcoin critic is urging the Indian government to deem the cryptocurrency illegal.\n\nKirit Somaiya, a member of the Indian Parliament who belongs to the BJP, India’s conservative ruling party at the center, questioned if bitcoin is a ‘pyramid ponzi scheme’ during a session of the Indian parliament on March 24. At the time, the politician cited unnamed experts to base his concerns of the world’s largest cryptocurrency – now a legal method of payment in Japan – being a pyramid scheme and called for Indian financial authorities to regulate bitcoin.\n\nIn response, the Union Minister of State if Finance revealed a written reply to Somaiya, one that triggered much of the Indian media to falsely report that bitcoin was deemed illegal by the government.\n\nA local report has since surfaced pointing to the formation of an ‘inter-ministerial’ committee installed by the Indian Parliament to study the legality of the popular cryptocurrency. It is speculated that the committee is tasked to give an initial announcement about its findings on April 20.\n\nHowever, not content with these developments, Somaiya has once again raised his issue with bitcoin in India in the parliament on Wednesday afternoon. The bitcoin critic spoke during the ‘zero hour’, a session that starts at 12 noon wherein members of parliament are allowed to raise important subjects in the house.\n\nIn the Lok Sabha (the Lower house of the Indian parliament) session today, Somaiya opined that bitcoin was growing ‘without any restrictions’ in the “name of blockchain” technology. Unlike earlier, however, the politician has matter-of-factly stated that bitcoin is ‘illegal’ as a parallel currency. He then urged the government to ban bitcoin immediately, before drafting regulations for the industry.\n\nToday again I raised Bitcoin issue in Parliament in zero hour It's illegal & unregulated in India Urged Govt for early action @BJP4India pic.twitter.com/zSpV5T9x5w — Kirit Somaiya (@KiritSomaiya) April 5, 2017\n\nSomaiya’s translated statements read:\n\nBitcoin trading worth ?2000 crores (approx. $300 million, a day) has been initiated. This can also be used in underworld trading. Last week some students were caught dealing with drugs and LSD. In the name of block chain and crypto currency these kind of schemes are growing without any restrictions. The government has made a committee to address this. I urge them to declare this parallel currency illegal, and make rules and regulation to deal with it as soon as possible.\n\nAs it stands, the bitcoin industry remains unregulated in India with the Indian central bank issuing a public notice stating bitcoin companies in India were not recognized or approved by the authority. The notice, a rehash from December 2013, has spurred the Indian bitcoin industry to establish its own self-regulatory body and watchdog in February, one that approached Indian authorities but has yet to receive a response.\n\nThe Indian bitcoin industry has also launched a petition urging Indian lawmakers to declare the legality of bitcoin. Launched last week, the petition now sees over 10,000 signatures.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:"", 'One of the biggest bitcoin mining pools, ViaBTC, is to open a CNY/BTC exchange in around two months with a USD/BTC exchange to follow. The CNY exchange will be based in China and provide no margins or futures, but the USD exchange will be based offshore and will provide margins and futures as permitted by relevant regulations, according to Sara Ouyang, Chief Operating Officer at ViaBTC.\n\nShe further revealed to CCN:\n\nFrom the company level, we want to expand our business in cryptocurrency industry and cover the entire industry chain in the long run for sustainable development. Mining and exchange are both very important foundation for the industry. We have done a not bad job in mining and we believe the market for exchanges is big enough for us to multiply our users if we can do a good job too.\n\nOuyang said the exchange intends to comply with all relevant regulations and, referring to PBoC specifically, the COO said that “there’s no specific policies yet but we will try to comply with the current requirements.\n\nThe announcement is made after the company raised around ¥20 million (approx $3 million) in a Series A round led by Bitmain. Asked about the other investors, CCN was told that “besides Bitmain, there’s a couple of private investors who are not ready to reveal themselves now.”\n\nSome, especially Bitcoin Core supporters, have accused ViaBTC of secretly being owned by Bitmain. Ouyang denied such allegations, stating “ViaBTC is not owned by Bitmain. They are just investing in our new (and promising) business. We are 100% independent in running our own company.” She further said:\n\n“We want more people to know that we are looking further into the business. Financing from Bitmain or any other company in the future will help us grow even bigger. We’d like to try tapping all our potentials and see how much more we can do for the industry and community as well. We love Bitcoin and that’s why we have ViaBTC. As what we’ve been visioning, we do want to make the world a better place via Bitcoin.”\n\nThe bitcoin exchanges market appears competitive, but the industry is sorely lacking margins or futures in a regulated exchange. Coinbase’s GDAX recently announced they are to add such function, but only for very rich traders with millions of dollars. The other alternative is Bitfinex, but they were hacked out of $75 million, making it a somewhat risky proposition to traders.\n\nThere is BitMEX, which provides as much as 100x margins, but they are not regulated, their spread is considerable and their liquidity seems lacking.

04/06/2017,"['Bitcoin is abuzz with fresh controversy following an inflammatory new post by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell in which he alleges some miners are engaging in unfair practices that may be harmful to the network.\n\nPosted to the bitcoin mailing list last night, the entry asserts that a mining hardware maker is secretly exploiting a previously known weakness in bitcoin\'s proof-of-work algorithm that enables them to mine roughly 20% faster than competitors.\n\nThe allegation is that this activity is ongoing, and that this has been proven by an analysis conducted on a mining chip.\n\nHere\'s where the intellectual gymnastics begin.\n\nOf note is that the technology in use has already been patented by developers Timo Hanke and Sergio Demian Lerner in a scheme called ""AsicBoost"" for which a patent was filed in November 2014.\n\nMaxwell contends that someone has discovered what he called a ""covert"" version of the technology used in a mining chip. He did not state who conducted the analysis, whether him or a separate party.\n\nTaking a step further into speculation, the inference of the post is that Segregated Witness, a scaling solution developed and proposed by the Bitcoin Core team, would render the covert version of AsicBoost discovered obsolete, hurting the bottom lines of any miners using the workaround.\n\nAs such, the statement has stoked controversy in bitcoin\'s long-simmering scaling debate in that the allegation that the miner engaged in the practice is China-based Bitmain – one of the industry’s largest providers of mining equipment. (Bitmain has a separate patent for the AsicBoost technology in China).\n\nThe assertion is that Bitmain is not only blocking a technical solution favored by the Core developers (through its support of alternative development teams), but doing so because it would enhance its profitability at the expense of users.\n\nIn statements, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu has vehemently denied that the company is using the AsicBoost workaround on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n""There is no relationship between SegWit and AsicBoost,"" Wu told CoinDesk.\n\nBitmain released a statement on Thursday, adding that they tested AsicBoost, but they never used it in a real mining capacity, and further pointed to an agreement where they expressed support for SegWit in the past.\n\nEven those involved in the debate acknowledged that, given present information, it remains difficult to prove whether the allegations are true.\n\nFormer COO of bitcoin mining firm BTCC, Samson Mow, told CoinDesk that the post confirms rumors that have been floating around for some time, though he did not offer any new evidence in the conversation.\n\nMow told CoinDesk:\n\n""This is not something that you\'re going to get solid proof for, but there’s smoking guns all around. All the science points to manipulation.""\n\nWhat is AsicBoost?\n\nFirst things first, it may be beneficial to understand the specific mining technique at the center of the allegations.\n\nIn short, AsicBoost is best described as a ""mathematical trick."" Instead of taking a huge amount of computation, miners can use the technique to whittle down their choices of potential hashes that enable them to solve a puzzle and claim bitcoin\'s rewards.\n\nThese mathematical tricks can lead to an increase in mining profitability by boosting key mining hardware profitability ratios.\n\nFor example, a primary measurement of mining profitability is the amount of money earned in gigahashes per second (GH/s). This is most often measured in USD per Gh/s.\n\nThe other measure of hardware profitability involves determining energy consumption, commonly measured in Joules, and dividing that by the hashing speed. This is the Joule per Gh/s.\n\nThe creators of the technology claim these key ratios are improved by roughly 20% thanks to AsicBoost.\n\nAccording to mining firm representatives, the technique has been known for some time, though it is largely out of use through a combination of patent protection and industry standards that aren\'t enforced by any body or organization.\n\nBut this isn\'t AsicBoost?\n\nGoing back to Maxwell\'s original post, what\'s being speculated is that the company in question, allegedly Bitmain, isn\'t using AsicBoost exactly.\n\nRather, the mining chip in is said to implement another version of the idea whereby it is implemented in the hardware. Further, it is argued that Segregated Witness would, as a bi-product of its code, make this specific technique obsolete.\n\nShould this be correct, and should the mining chip maker be implementing the chip widely, it\'s argued that they may have a business interest in blocking the software.\n\nFor mining firms, which produce mining chips on a massive scale, the pace of technological innovation renders hardware obsolete within a period of months. It is argued that such a recall could be potentially devastating, adding pressures to the scaling argument.\n\nExploitation or efficiency?\n\nAt the center of the issue is whether the specific technology use represents a natural desire for a competitive advantage, and whether miners can be working ""against the network"" if no rule prevents them from engaging in that activity.\n\nFor example, there is no rule that currently prevents use of the AsicBoost design, meaning that miners have more of an unspoken agreement to refrain from using the technique on the basis it is ""bad"" for the network.\n\nAs explained by an executive at one of the world’s largest mining firms, who wished to speak on privacy citing business concerns, the practice is widely known, and has little impact on their operations.\n\n""They operate differently, but that I think it is normal. Jihan [Wu] said it is the freedom given by protocol so they can do it,"" he said.\n\nMow noted that the technique isn\'t ""kosher"" among miners, as it essentially enables them to try to solve bitcoin\'s puzzle, without performing any useful work – say, processing transactions.\n\nNotably, others don’t think ""attack"" or ""flaw"" is the right term, arguing it’s simply a way for miners to mine more efficiently.\n\nIC3 co-director Emin Gün Sirer, for example, asserted in a blog post that there isn\'t enough public evidence yet to verify Maxwell’s claims.\n\nMerkle grinding?\n\nThe details of the so-called ""attack"" are rather technical, but in its most basic form it deals with how miners find blocks.\n\nTo recap the mining process, miners use specially designed equipment to repeatedly hash bitcoin block data (or turn it into a fixed-length scrambled string of letters and numbers) until they hit a particular solution that unlocks bitcoin mining rewards.\n\nThere’s certain data that miners aren\'t supposed to know before they calculate hashes so that miners all have to go through the same calculation process, leveling the playing field.\n\nThe problem, developers claim, is with the hashing algorithm, which miners can exploit in a couple ways. For one, the subject of Maxwell’s post, is a technique that developers call ""merkle grinding."" But, Maxwell claims that some miners found a clever way of finding out more about the data that they expect to find ahead of time.\n\nIn each block header there\'s a ""merkle root"" that you can think of as a summary of the transactions bundled in a block. Miners can order transaction data in the merkle tree such that they need to calculate less data.\n\n""If the miner finds multiple candidate root values which have the same final 32-bit then they can use the attack,"" Maxwell writes.\n\nThis speeds up the process. Essentially, if it goes according to plan, it means occasionally skipping a step.\n\nFurther, some developers contend that one sign that this technique being used is that some miners have been mining blocks without transactions, making it easier to reorder transactions in the merkle tree. (Bitmain, specifically, has been known to occasionally mine empty blocks).\n\nWho\'s saying what?\n\nNotably, Timo Hanke, AsicBoost co-inventor and former Cointerra CTO, allege that the argument that AsicBoost is inhibiting Segwit adoption is overplayed.\n\nWhile admitting via Twitter that AsicBoost could potentially be used for purposes that may be detrimental to the network, he said he would not support any Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would use the technology to harm bitcoin.\n\nAsicBoost co-creater Sergio Lerner noted on Twitter that newly proposed Segwit2MB, an alternative to SegWit, would also prevent miners from continuing to utilize the exploit.\n\nStill, the big worry is that this technique is being used to further centralize mining in bitcoin – a problem that developers have been concerned about for a long time – since miners using the faster mining technology could have an advantage over those who don’t.\n\n""Patents conferring large advantage are a problem for bitcoin,"" Blockstream CEO Adam Back said.\n\nFurther, there\'s an economic advantage to the attack. A mining pool comprising 50% of the bitcoin mining power could save as much as $100m per year by exploiting the flaw, Maxwell noted.\n\nOthers have gone on to theorize that, since SegWit somehow fixes the problem, there might be an economic reason that miners do not support the solution.\n\n""If you had a $100m cash cow, and it gets destroyed by a feature, you do everything you can to block it,"" argued developer Alphonse Pace.\n\nMaxwell added that this implication is exactly why he began looking into the issue, adding:\n\n""An incompatibility would go a long way to explain some of the more inexplicable behavior from some parties in the mining ecosystem.""\n\nAlyssa Hertig and Garrett Keirns contributed reporting.\n\nGun lighter for gas-stove via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

On that news, the crypto-currency spiked some 7%. The ability for businesses and individuals to use Bitcoin as a payment method will provide more demand for the crypto-currency. The increased demand will ultimately push the value of the currency above its all-time high of $1,350..00.\n\nThe law is being nicknamed the Bicoin law. The law allows for Bitcoin to be used as a payment method in Japan starting on April 1st. That means that Japanese citizens are likely to start getting involved in Bitcoin as well as the potential for Japanese exchanges and ATMs. While I do not see Japan becoming the biggest users of Bitcoin, that distinction belongs to China, I do see some increased usage.\n\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 and since that time the currency has been appreciating in value. In fact, since 2010, the currency has increased in value every single year except 2014. Already in 2017, the currency is up some 17%. In December, the currency was trading at $700.00. It is now quoted at $1,138.00:\n\nAs a payment method the crypto-currency is very useful for anyone who wants to buy and sell items completely anonymously. That is the entire idea behind Bitcoin. Being able to move money out of your country and being able to invest in the currency itself is an appeal in its own.\n\nI am a big believer in the currency. Think about China and all of their economic woes they have been heaving. China is home to some of the world's biggest exchanges for Bitcoin, Huobi and OKCoin. The volume on these platforms dwarfs most other platforms around the world. This makes sense.\n\nThe Chinese government has capital controls in place to ensure that the renminbi does not appreciate too rapidly. In fact, the People's Bank of China has met with the country's Bitcoin exchanges to have the exchanges halt withdrawals from Bitcoin in order to prevent money from flowing out of the country and skirting the country's regulations. There are also money laundering issues involved that the PBoC wants to ensure that the exchanges are not being used for.\n\nStill, those capital controls are not likely to stop the money flowing into Bitcoin. The renminbi has been falling over the past several years. The PBoC has had to use its currency reserves to halt the depreciation of the renminbi do the economic declines of the country and the fact that there are such stringent capital controls in the country. Bitcoin is an easy way around all of these issues and is the reason why Bitcoin is so heavily traded in China.\n\nAnd, if the Chinese economy continues to moderate and the PBoC continues to increase interest rates while simultaneously the capital controls are strictly enforced then Bitcoin will be a viable option for individuals wanting to push money out of the country and into a safe-haven currency.\n\nMany Chinese individuals are already using Bitcoin. It is easy to convert cash into Bitcoins and can easily be done so via any ATM around the world. Once the cash is converted into Bitcoins there is no following the money. That is the appeal for Chinese nationals.\n\nBitcoin will continue to appreciate in value. The spike up in the crypto-currency from the announcement on Friday reiterates the increasing available use of the currency. That demand will push the value of Bitcoin higher. I am thinking that the currency will cross over its all-time high of $1,350.00 in the next few months given the pace at which it is moving.\n\nFurther, I believe that the currency will be seeing more activity if there is any turmoil in the world financial markets. There has been some selling off of the highs as of late. This will prompt individuals to continue to push into the crypto-currency as a store of value.\n\nRight now, the French election is showing that the far-right Le Pen is leading. She has made it clear that she is not a fan of the EU. Great Britain has just initiated Article 50 to leave the European Union. If Le Pen were to win then it is very possible that a referendum for France is next. If France were to even mention a referendum then I believe that Bitcoin will move considerably higher and do so very quickly.\n\nThere is already substantial demand for Bitcoin. But, there are a lot of headwinds ahead that may push Bitcoin higher regardless of the current demand. And, I believe a lot of this demand is going to occur soon. The move by the Japanese government is just one more thing that is propelling the crypto-currency higher.\n\nLook for eventual moves above the $1,350.00 level. And, considering the current political environment, that move may happen much sooner than anticipated.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long BTCUSD.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."", '""What leads you to believe that Bitcoin will top £3K in 2017?"" The answer does not lie in an analysis of macro-economic or monetary theory but in a more interesting understanding of human behavior. An understanding of human behavior and motivation, similar to that which lead Steve Jobs to develop the products he did and the digital marketing system of today. But first, let’s rewind.\n\nSix months ago, before the Brexit vote, when the world seemed a safe and steady place, I put forward the theory that Bitcoin would surpass gold as the safe haven currency. While I pondered this theory, I realized that given the right conditions digital currencies can only trend up in value. The date was late April 2016, I had just been paid, so I went online and spent all that month’s wages on Bitcoins. I\'m not a gambler and I’ve never invested in shares. But this was a sure thing.\n\nThe success of digital currency both in terms of value and popularity lie in its universality and ease of use, for the same reason telecommunications and transport were sure bets -- it allows people to do things in an easier way. The theory of success, originating from finding easier and more efficient ways of doing things, is the central theory behind Clayton Christensen’s book, The Innovator’s Dilemma. It is this concept that drove Steve Job’s insistence that iTunes should make any song available in three clicks. And this is what Bitcoin does. The bitcoin ecosystem significantly reduces the friction and opportunity cost of sending ownership of value from one person to another, anywhere with Internet access.\n\nHowever, just because it’s easy does not guarantee adoption by itself. There needs to be a catalyst. A driver. The adoption of Bitcoin over the next year will be driven by those who experience the highest and most obvious impediments to value transfer -- the grey economy. The next wave of value transfer underpinned by Bitcoin will be to move value across borders, to pay the plumber in cash without the tax implications, and for the plumber to make a purchase without touching real-world currencies.\n\nTo start using Bitcoin you don\'t need any proof of ID, copies of utility bills or letters signed by solicitors. Getting Bitcoins is easy, and transferring them from one location to another is equally easy. This in and of itself satisfies all the conceptual requirements that made Apple into one of the world’s largest and most profitable companies.\n\nValue\n\nMost currencies are valued in one of two ways: pegging the currency against a commodity or by comparing its value against another currency.\n\nBitcoin however is unlike any other currency, as it wasn’t created by a sovereign state nor does it have an owning authority. Consequently, Bitcoin can only be valued by what someone is prepared to pay for it. As Bitcoin is not available on the forex markets its value is determined not by the money markets, but by trade. This is an important distinction from traditional currencies and the key strength of Bitcoin.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to buy something on the international markets, then you most probably will do that trade in US dollars. However, what happens if when you attempt to get your dollars (electronically) there are no dollars available? Normally, one of two things. Either the value of dollars needs to increase in order to allow space for your purchase, or more dollars are produced to cover the shortfall.\n\nIf the dollar value increases, it can cause goods, produced by the dollar, to become more expensive in other currencies. Alternatively, if too many new dollars are released, this may devalue the dollar as trades are completed and a surplus becomes available. In the real world, central banks will aim to balance the value and demand for their currency by printing more to encourage trade and removing it if the currency becomes too weak.\n\nAs Bitcoin supply is finite with no central authority controlling its value and no traditional markets trading in it, the value of Bitcoin is determined by the value of products under in-flight trade taking place. When bitcoin was new, there wasn\'t much trade and therefore there wasn\'t much value -- the value of a Bitcoin was low. Today, as Bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular, the amount of in-flight trade in goods using Bitcoin as the value mechanism means that the only way there can be enough bitcoins available is via an increase in their value.\n\nSo the answer to the question ""what leads you to believe that bitcoin will top £3K in 2017?"" is really driven by how much the value of trade will increase in 2017. We can understand this better by looking at a spot value in March since 2013 of transactions: $23, $271, $174, $282, $1000. This shows clear growth and traction.\n\nIt would not be unreasonable to predict that the value of Bitcoin will double this year. If we now look at the values of individual transactions then we find that all of the largest value transactions happened in the last six months, with the largest ever Bitcoin transaction being on March 12 2017 at $860K. Big money is on the move. Putting these two indicators together can only mean one possible outcome: Bitcoin has to expand its market value to meet the demands of higher volume and higher value transactions.\n\nTransactions\n\nBitcoins rose to fame by being used on the dark web (darknet market) as the unit of currency for sites like Silk Road which was best known as an online market for selling drugs. However, Bitcoin is now being adopted by many people who want to move money across borders and by those who want to hedge against hyper-inflation and currency restrictions, or as in India, banknote demonetization. This is happening across the globe and is the new ""grey"" market. As these activities become more and more mainstream, I would expect to see the use of Bitcoin further increase in popularity.\n\nThe future\n\nPutting it all together. When you have an ascending frequency and value of Bitcoin transactions, along with wider acceptance and awareness, underpinned by easy and simple access, we could easily see growth outstrip the original $3000 prediction.\n\nAdam Davies, solutions architect and technology specialist, Altus Consulting.\n\nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

Waters would go on to start several bitcoin ventures, and was at the forefront of efforts to boost its regulatory compliance.\n\nIn the second entry in CoinDesk's 'Bitcoin Milestones' series, Waters discusses the early escalation in what would become an arms race to mine bitcoin, reminiscing on what was lost along the way.\n\nI didn't take the bitcoin white paper seriously when I first read it in late 2009.\n\nIt wasn't until a few months later that I thought, 'Wow, this is starting to catch on'. I saw someone trade bitcoin for some pizza on the forums. It was awesome, but I didn't really grasp what was happening.\n\nAt that point, my commitment level was very casual. I remember thinking that if I got some bitcoins, they could maybe pay for a new computer in a couple of years...\n\nBut bitcoin wasn't like anything I'd seen before. It captured my imagination and I was hopeful that someday it would be discussed outside of forums and IRC chats.\n\n***\n\nSoon, that started happening. I put on my hat, met the locals at the saloon and began working on the blockchain.\n\nI started panning for bitcoin gold via the default client. At the time, most people generated bitcoins by letting the v0.3 bitcoin client run in the background on their computers (a quaint notion by today's standards).\n\nI earned some coins and I loved it. I liked it so much that I spent huge amounts of time researching the mechanics of bitcoin. I immersed myself in understanding the computer science. (This served me better in the long run than any of the mining.)\n\nI get asked occasionally if I'm a 'bitcoin millionaire' because I was an early miner, but the answer is no. The early miners I knew traded thousands of coins for the value of a new video game.\n\nMost people I spoke with on IRC were mining, but few of the discussions were about the value of a bitcoin. Gavin Andresen, the project's first maintainer, went so far as to give tons of bitcoins away for free to spur the movement.\n\n***\n\nSoon, the parameters of mining would change, though.\n\nMining proved to be a dynamic system, with larger unknown actors who had the tools and resources to outpace me. Even after realizing this, I decided that I would keep mining. Mostly because mining was fun. I enjoyed the process of learning and improving — but knew that I couldn't compete.\n\nThe history of bitcoin mining would go on to progress through several phases.\n\nCPU mining took off in 2010 when bitcoin was Slashdotted and a small crowd began mining with the Bitcoin Core client. Then, there was pooled mining.\n\nBut the big change was the emergence of GPU miners in late 2010 and their total dominance — decimating the CPU mining contingent. (GPU mining would eventually be rendered useless, too, when the first ASICs began to ship).\n\nThroughout these movements, there have been a group of people within the bitcoin community called miners. I like to think that I'm part of that group, along with others who have a passion for bitcoin.\n\nAlthough, it's probably more appropriate to label that group 'local miners'.\n\nI say local miners because we were a bunch of hobbyist, mom-and-pop operations. We were displaced by large corporate industrial mining.\n\nSimilar to other markets, economies of scale bore down upon us...\n\n***\n\nLooking back, it's easy to say this was just capitalism at work, and it could be argued that it was better for the network as a whole.\n\nBut I take exception with this idea. Bitcoin mining for me wasn't just about making money (I didn't make much anyway). It was about being part of the bitcoin ecosystem as a contributor, as a voice among many, a sort of crypto-democracy.\n\nMining bitcoins made me feel like I was part of the movement, more than anything else. I was at every step, and was captivated from CPU through ASIC.\n\nSomehow I even inherited one of the first two ASICs (shout-out to Yifu Guo, Jeff Garzik, and Charlie Shrem). It stares at me while collecting dust, and reminds me of how I came to where I am today.\n\nBy creating bitcoins, miners are useful as a bulwark against malfeasance: if bitcoin was a government, the miners made up a branch that prevented others from gaining too much power.\n\nFor me, one of the biggest moments in bitcoin history was the advent of GPU mining and excitement within the bitcoin community that mining created. It's what kept me fascinated with bitcoin. From working with the core development to working with various bitcoin companies, it all started with mining.\n\nGPU mining was when the beat dropped for the bitcoin universe...\n\n***\n\nBut I still loved that moment when CPU mining was the essence of bitcoin — as Satoshi and many of us saw it. Over time, it was revealed that the system tended toward oligarchy when we moved to GPU. Maybe it was inevitable.\n\nI still believe something can be done to take crypto-democracy back.\n\nWe're mostly a group of people on the internet trying to find and create value together. We know what bitcoin looks like with the current state of centralized mining, and I think we can improve it.\n\nSure the economics of mining have changed. The jump to GPU ensured that. But there's more to mining than money.\n\nBe a local miner, bitcoin still needs you.\n\nThis article is dedicated to my friend and brother in bitcoin, Jake Dienelt.\n\nYou will be missed.\n\nRow of bitcoin miners via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Nevertheless, you can still invest directly in bitcoins through various exchanges, for example. You may also invest indirectly through a bitcoin investment trust, an ETF-like investment product that is publicly quoted using alternative reporting standards and doesn’t require the same level of SEC approval as ETFs.\n\nBefore you invest, you may wonder, what are bitcoins or ETFs for that matter? An ETF is a well-established investment product that works like a mutual fund (i.e., an ETF represents indirect ownership of the assets owned by the fund), but it trades like a stock. Bitcoins are a virtual currency created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym that sounds almost as cool as Keyser Söze (a character in the film The Usual Suspects). Other than the bitcoin creator, and perhaps some close associates sworn to secrecy, the creator’s—or creators’—true identity remains a mystery.\n\nHow bitcoins work, however, isn’t a mystery. They’re based on a fascinating technology that has many potential applications beyond bitcoins. It allows bitcoin transactions to be conducted directly (i.e., peer-to-peer) instead of through an intermediary such as a bank.\n\nBitcoins can be used to buy things just like a traditional currency, though many people view bitcoins as investment opportunities as evidenced by the recent ETF proposals. The SEC is concerned about the potential for fraud and price manipulation in the bitcoin markets because of the markets’ lack of regulation and transparency.\n\nDoes the attractiveness of investing in bitcoins—directly or indirectly—offset the SEC’s concerns about bitcoin markets? Here are the three most compelling reasons to consider investing in bitcoins, and why they fail to make a case for taking the bitcoin investment plunge.\n\nReason #1: Expectation of a bitcoin price increase\n\nThe price of bitcoins has skyrocketed over the past several years from 7 cents on July 19, 2010, to $1,175 on April 6 (midday ET) of this year. That works out to a suh-weet compounded annual return of 325%.\n\nDoes this past performance imply anything about future performance? Yes, it does according to technical analysis (i.e., the extrapolation of future returns based on past returns and possibly other historical data such as trading volume). This technique has long been derided by many academics, and yet many investors use it. Indeed, there is evidence that technical analysis can produce market-beating returns in the U.S. stock markets, for example.\n\nThere are countless technical trading rules, however. Some rules may suggest you should buy based on the historical returns in the bitcoin market while others may suggest you should sell. The fact that some rules have been historically profitable in some markets may tell you nothing about the future profitability of these rules in the same markets, much less a notably different market like the bitcoin market (even if there wasn’t a concern about the potential for fraud and price manipulation).\n\nMore generally, what makes a bitcoin worth $1,175 on April 6, 2017? An economist would say “supply and demand,” but that’s about as helpful as a medieval physician attributing an illness to an imbalance in the patient’s humors, unless the economist knows the supply and demand functions for bitcoins. Notwithstanding some interesting research showing the relation between the bitcoin price and various supply and demand factors, there’s no consensus on which factors determine the price, much less the rationality of the factors.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the rationality of the current bitcoin price, what chance do you have of accurately forecasting future prices? You might think the future fixed supply of bitcoins (i.e., no more than 21 million are scheduled to be “mined” in the parlance of bitcoins) would ensure bitcoin price rises. But this supply ceiling is well known and, therefore, knowledge of this fact should not offer any special advantage in forecasting future bitcoin prices. And, who knows what the future demand will be for bitcoins.\n\nReason #2: Invest in an interest-bearing bitcoin account\n\nInstead of storing your bitcoins under the proverbial mattress and hoping for a price increase, you can invest in various interest-bearing investments based on bitcoins. Just don’t confuse these investments with U.S. Treasury Bonds because, unlike U.S. Treasury Bonds, there’s no guarantee you’ll get your money back with interest in bitcoin-based investments.\n\nTo be fair, you’re also at risk of not getting your money back with interest in corporate bonds and other traditional interest-bearing investments that aren’t backed by the U.S. government. These investments, however, are typically traded in markets that operate efficiently (e.g., there is minimal risk of fraud or price manipulation). When markets are efficient, investors willing to accept more risk are rewarded with a plausible increase in their expected return. You cannot make such an assumption with a bitcoin-based investment given the concerns about the potential for fraud and price manipulation in bitcoin markets.\n\nReason #3: Bitcoins as a hedge against global uncertainty\n\nThere is preliminary evidence that bitcoins can serve as a hedge against global uncertainty (i.e., bitcoin prices tend to rise when global uncertainty rises). You can think of this evidence as justifying an investment in bitcoins for insurance purposes. However, this evidence is based on historical patterns over a short time period, and there is no guarantee these patterns will continue even if bitcoin markets are free of potential fraud and price manipulation concerns.\n\nAs I have mentioned in a previous article, if you really want to hedge against uncertainty, you should invest in U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). These are the only investments that guarantee a future amount of purchasing power (i.e., the amount of goods and services you can buy with your dollars).\n\nWhat about the possibility the U.S. government defaults on its obligations and TIPS investors lose some or all of their investment? The market clearly views this possibility as extraordinarily small as evidenced by its insatiable demand for U.S. government securities despite their historically low yields.\n\nOf course, I can’t completely rule out the possibility of a collapse of the U.S. government, but what’s a pile of bitcoins going to do for you if things truly go south and we descend into chaos? If you’re really worried about a catastrophic scenario, you might consider binge-watching the TV series The Walking Dead for some preparation tips.\n\nIn summary, even without the SEC’s concerns, I think the reasons for investing in bitcoins with the hope of a price increase or as a hedge against global uncertainty are unconvincing. On the other hand, I would be interested in ETFs based on interest-bearing bitcoin investments if they received SEC approval. For now, however, I’m steering clear of all bitcoin investments.', ""Litecoin prices continued a recent rally today, pushing the digital currency to its highest value in more than one year.\n\nFar from a standard cryptocurrency pump, however, the market appears to be responding strongly to its technical roadmap. Namely, the increase comes as the network nears the key 75% support level needed to activate Segregated Witness, a scaling solution that will boost block capacity.\n\nWhile signaling had declined slightly to 67% at press time, litecoin traded as high as $11.32 today, up nearly 40% in the space of 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nLate yesterday, the digital currency even reached $11.42, its highest price since May 2014.\n\nThese recent price increases have built on the gains the cryptocurrency began experiencing roughly one week ago, when the digital asset surged nearly 70% on 30th March.\n\nAs a result of these continued upward price movements, litecoin's value surged more than 100% in a week. According to Coinmarketcap.com, 24-hour volume surpassed $250m today, a drastic increase from the $10m recorded during the 30th March rally.\n\nSegWit support builds\n\nThe major development that has coincided with litecoin's continued rise is progress toward obtaining the support levels needed for activating SegWit.\n\nFirst designed for use on the bitcoin blockchain, SegWit would nonetheless increase litecoin's block capacity by altering how transaction date is stored by the network.\n\nOnce breached, the level of support will need to remain at or above the 75% threshold level for 8,064 blocks (roughly two weeks) before it can officially be implemented.\n\nThe recent rally in litecoin prices compares to a long period when the digital currency's price experienced little volatility.\n\nThe price of litecoin rose to more than $50 in late 2013 but has traded below $20 since early 2014.\n\nImage via CoinDesk Archieve\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In addition, the 100 SMA lines up with the bottom of the channel at the $1150 level, adding to its strength as a floor in the event of a pullback.\n\nA larger correction could last until the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point at $1100 but a break below this area could be enough to confirm that a downtrend is underway. Stochastic has been indicating overbought conditions for quite some time and appears ready to turn lower and draw sellers to the game. RSI is also turning down from the overbought zone and bitcoin price could follow suit.\n\nMarket Events\n\nOne potential event risk for bitcoin price against the dollar today is the NFP release. Analysts are expecting to see only 174K in hiring gains but there could be a chance for an upside surprise as the ADP figure released earlier in the week printed much stronger than expected results. If so, dollar gains could return as traders look forward to more Fed rate hikes once more.\n\nHowever, bitcoin price is currently drawing support from geopolitical tensions, particularly between the US and Syria. Earlier this week, Syria launched a chemical bomb attack and the US government looked into military options. A few hours ago, an airstrike was launched on Syria and brought risk-off vibes to the financial markets.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Yet, Ripple is now weighing in on the market activity, arguing that the sharp spikes in value of late are evidence of its progress.\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CoinDesk:\n\n""We have had a significant rally in XRP prices, but it is reflective of a lot of work we have done to make Ripple a very compelling solution.""\n\nHe emphasized that there have been ""huge"" network improvements, adding that his company has invested significantly in ensuring that the Ripple Consensus Ledger – along with XRP – truly becomes a leading technology.\n\nYet, not all market participants agree there\'s a direct correlation.\n\nAs the price of XRP has experienced sharp volatility of late (rising and falling 10% in some single sessions), some assert the digital currency became the latest victim of \'pump and dump\' trading activity, several analysts told CoinDesk.\n\nRipple is certainly not alone in this regard, as several other alternative asset protocols have surged to all-time highs lately and then suffered notable declines.\n\nScaling and speculation\n\nAnother major development that has helped provide tailwinds for XRP prices is bitcoin\'s ongoing scaling dilemma, according to Garlinghouse.\n\nThe bitcoin community has thus far been unable to form a consensus on how best to address the problem of block size, and that is sparking interest in alternatives, he reasoned.\n\nBecause of the technical issue, the average time needed to confirm bitcoin transactions has risen significantly in recent months, reaching 168 minutes on 27th March and 145 minutes on 31st March.\n\nGarlinghouse sought to contrast this performance with Ripple\'s, tweeting on 31st March that his network\'s confirmations were taking an average of 3.7 seconds, while it costs $0.00031 per transaction compared to $0.48 using bitcoin.\n\nYet, here too, analysts offered an alternative picture, contending the quick rise in Ripple\'s price was more indicative of speculative market activity.\n\nJacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund trader, told CoinDesk that XRP is most certainly benefiting from an ""altcoin fervor"" amongst active traders. As a result, buyers were either swayed by some news, or some large buyer chose this week to spark market activity, he posited.\n\nAs for the decline in price that soon followed, analysts said this may have marked a period of ""profit taking"", where long-term Ripple holders sold (and bought back at a lower price) to increase their return on their investment.\n\nGrowing credibility?\n\nStill, it remains an open question whether this activity amounts to real use for the Ripple platform. As such, the statements above mark a divide between the startup\'s view on the market and those of avid traders.\n\nGarlinghouse, for example, suggested that the Ripple network may also be more practical than bitcoin\'s, a feature that he argued is attracting users.\n\n""One of the big differences between XRP and many other digital currencies is that we are solving a real-world problems for banks and providing ROI. This has been giving us credibility in the broader cryptocurrency space,"" he said.\n\nSome analysts mentioned Ripple\'s partnership with Japan\'s largest bank, MUFG, as helping bolster XRP\'s price. As a result of this partnership, the Asian financial group will become the latest financial institution to get involved in creating and overseeing payment transaction rules and standards for Ripple\'s network.\n\nHowever, such ideas are countered somewhat by the rise in trading activity on markets typically associated with more speculative trading.\n\nFor instance, one Ripple gateway operator projected more than three-quarters of XRP\'s trading activity is now taking place on Poloniex, an exchange for alternative cryptocurrencies that does not offer trading in fiat currency.\n\nIn this light, the recent moves may mark a combination of factors.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, suggested that Ripple\'s developing value proposition was perhaps encouraging it to be more aggressively traded.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""On a percentage basis, BTC moves have been getting steadily smaller for years. For those who have grown used to trading in that environment – with the attendant risks and rewards – alts have simply become more interesting.""\n\nQuestion mark image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

04/07/2017,"['As long as Japan does not fail in what seems to be an effort that is making Bitcoin bigger, the world\'s top digital currency would always be a success. One latest example is the adoption of the AML/KYC rules for Bitcoin exchanges in the country\n\nLike China, Japan is now impacting meaningfully on the Bitcoin market whenever the third largest economy in the world comes out with a move that causes a change.\n\nBitcoin price affected\n\nWith the recent development in which Japan recognized Bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting Saturday, April 1, the Bitcoin price has seen a steady climb over the $1100 range by the start of Monday.\n\nThe recovery from the dip where the Bitcoin price had been over a week ago when the deadlock over the scalability issue had heightened has been attributed to a growth in Bitcoin demand from Japanese consumers after the government passed a law which basically says officially that Bitcoin users will not be taxed directly.\n\nRather, it brings up the issue of AML/KYC which caused a heated debate. Some users are in favor of it preferring exchanges operating legally so that they can be law-abiding, pay taxes on behalf of users and guarantee some form of protection for users’ money.\n\nNew law\n\nJapan’s new law has been on debate for months following the collapse of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange.\n\nThe law’s passing brings Bitcoin exchanges under Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer rules as it is the case in China. The exercise in verification will expectedly increase trust in Bitcoin and probably forestall a recurrence of the Mt. Gox case.\n\nCoincheck\'s Kagayaki Kawabata told Cointelegraph:\n\n""While market cap and usage of cryptocurrency is scaling significantly in past few years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are something that can\'t be ignored. The Mt. Gox incident took place in Tokyo. This experience I think has made Japan decided to regulate them in order to protect the customers. I think other countries will follow Japan if this new regulation works out.""\n\nTax issues\n\nThe AML/KYC process will also serve as a link between the government and Bitcoin which is what many people believe is still missing for the ecosystem to grow into a regulated market.\n\nFor Bitsquare\'s Ken Shishido, the development is a result of years of industry effort in lobbying policy makers and not necessarily the government taking a proactive approach nor wanting to make Bitcoin bigger and better.\n\nTax implication is not finalized yet but it is a huge deal that consumption tax is now officially exempted, he adds.\n\nFrom China to Japan and other countries, it is now clearer that governments are on the way of recognizing Bitcoin as a financial instrument. But to make the digital currency go mainstream everyday users need to support it as a common practice.\n\nWhy Japan Matters\n\nJapan does not seem at all worried by the general attitude of some countries to digital currencies like Bitcoin. The country’s level of confidence in Bitcoin is overwhelming despite the negative history it has had with the digital currency.\n\nBased on this level of trust and interest in the currency, the success of the ongoing experimentation will help show how possible legislations can work with Bitcoin.\n\nIt will go a very long way to draw other countries that are still skeptical about Bitcoin into the fold as well be a good form of advertisement to the wider global community - especially governments. The legality of the state is always a boost for the justification of Bitcoin.\n\nFor a big economy like Japan to trust Bitcoin as a payment method speaks volumes. It is a sign that it could be a significant tool that could bring advantages over sentiments that point to negativity.\n\nShishido says:\n\n“Not sure other developed countries will follow suite anytime soon but maybe countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, Estonia, Switzerland and etc. If some countries do recognize it as a legal tender, it will be a game changer. Japan’s legal status is “currency-like property with consumption tax exemption. If one country recognizes it as a legal tender, all United Nations country will need to acknowledge, too.”\n\nOne other factor to note about Japan\'s impact on the Bitcoin price is that when it happens, the price increase tends to be usually real - it would correct at some point but not to its initial take-off point.\n\nRelatedly, one of the countries picking up on a similar move is Mexico which is working on the first draft of a fintech law that will make its central bank define the regulation that will apply to digital assets such as Bitcoin based on two criteria: widespread adoption of the public and the protocols, rules and mechanisms that allow their generation, identification, division and control.', 'Gregory Maxwell, Blockstream’s CTO, has made an astonishing statement in the mailing list regarding an algorithmic optimization called AsicsBoost which was revealed last year. Maxwell states:\n\n“Due to a design oversight the Bitcoin proof of work function has a potential attack which can allow an attacking miner to save up-to 30% of their energy costs (though closer to 20% is more likely due to implementation overheads).”\n\nIt’s not clear what Maxwell means by “design oversight.” It could simply be the fact that proof of work allows for the use of specialized software which can be optimized leading to an arms race to gain profits in a highly competitive and purely capitalistic form.\n\nSomething which Maxwell doesn’t seem to like as he says “exploitation of this vulnerability” would cause “inequality in the mining process.” This suggests that in Maxwell’s view, all miners should be equal, otherwise known as communism, a tried and failed idea at a great cost to hundreds of millions of people.\n\nOf course, to achieve this equality we need some sort of technocratic group which decides the price of goods (blocksize) and purges the undesirables, including mining optimizations that diverge from the purity of equality.\n\nTo achieve this end, we might further engage in censorship, DDos-ing, alteration of historical facts, banning, double speak, control over the media through troll armies, and, you know, the usual playbook as detailed in Orwell’s 1984.\n\nWe might also want to engage in a daily two minutes hate to rally the bitcoiners, with today’s rage being evil scientific optimizations by a company that hires hundreds of employees, including scientists, academics, ordinary workers, etc, a company which has to pay for hardware development and manufacturing, land space, for all those employees, electricity, etc, with the aim of making some profit.\n\nThose evil capitalists must be purged in our grand utopia of equality in mining. Everyone should get the same amount, regardless of their intellectual abilities, efforts, investments, with the smartest people on earth, the utmost geniuses, the heros, known as Blockstream, deciding the amount they get, when, for what, as well as the fees peasants should pay, the price of bread, and all else.\n\nIn response to the imperialist subversion by bourgeoisie, our great hero who “reverse engineered a mining chip to discover ASICBOOST while trolling people 24/7 on reddit and contributing to Bitcoin Core” and tirelessly works for the common good, has come up with the “virtuous improvement” called Segregated Witnesses.\n\nThis will give us the great utopia where we all are equal and can run our own hubs while expanding no resources, so receiving free money on top of those who own the means of production, the miners, who unfairly get all this wealth.\n\nPeople of the bitcoin world, you have nothing to lose, but your chains. Rise and seize the miners. We will build a great new world of forced equality where genius technocrats who know everything will decide all things.\n\nSlaver is freedom\n\nWas is Peace\n\nYes, it’s satire. Yes, maybe it’s not appropriate, but I could not bear to write a serious article on this topic as this whole thing has now descended into a farce and a joke. For a serious article, you can read Emin Gün Sirer, who has does a far better job than I possibly could to distil this statement that would make Orwell very proud.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are those of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A group of hackers who claimed to hold millions of iCloud accounts for ransom said on Friday they\'d been paid. But one bitcoin expert says that\'s bogus.\n\nThe Turkish Crime Family grabbed headlines last month by claiming they had the stolen login credentials for more than 700 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com accounts. They demanded increasing ransoms from Apple while threatening to wipe the data from devices connected to the affected accounts if it did not.\n\nOn Friday, the hackers tweeted that they had been paid US$480,000 in bitcoin. As proof, the group posted a link showing a transaction on Blockchain.info, a popular bitcoin wallet.\n\n“We were told by our negotiator that we have come to a final agreement with Apple,” the hacking group tweeted prior to receiving the payment.\n\nHowever, the hackers actually tweeted out a transaction to an ""internal treasury operation at a bitcoin exchange,"" according to Jonathan Levin, co-founder at Chainalysis, a provider of anti-money laundering software for bitcoin.\n\n""We have positively identified that the inputs and outputs of that transaction are controlled by a single bitcoin exchange,"" Levin said in an email. The transaction was part of an internal money deposit process at a Korean bitcoin exchange, he said.\n\nApple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The tech giant has said that it never suffered any such breach. The stolen login credentials that the hackers obtained appeared to come from breaches at other third-party services, Apple said.\n\nSecurity researchers suspect that\'s true, and they believe the Turkish Crime Family has exaggerated its hacking claims.\n\nThe hacking group also didn\'t respond to a request for comment.', 'In the years since the Great Recession, you\'ve probably heard about the electronic payment system and so-called cryptocurrency called bitcoin.\n\nBut you\'re perhaps less likely to have heard of the underlying technology that powers it. It\'s called blockchain.\n\nBlockchain technology is a digital ledger distributed across a network of computers that keeps track of transactions. But beyond payments, it can be used for a wide variety of applications such as contracts, documents and basic record keeping.\n\n""Wall Street is going to eventually move into this in a big way,"" says Alan Friedland, founder of Compcoin, a blockchain-based public currency trading platform. ""In the meantime, it\'s a great opportunity to get into early.""\n\n[See: 9 Under-the-Radar Ways to Buy Financial Stocks.]\n\nJust like the internet democratized the dissemination of information, blockchain technology democratizes the securitization of information, says Chris Burniske, head of blockchain products with Ark Investment Management.\n\n""It\'s probably the most impactful general purpose technology that\'s been invented in the 21st century,"" he says.\n\nWhile bitcoin decentralizes payments, another major blockchain technology called Ethereum enables decentralized applications. Another, Storj, is involved in decentralized computer storage. Each issues its own value token or coin -- bitcoin issues bitcoins, Ethereum issues ether, and Storj issues Storjcoin X -- that can be bought and traded. There are now many different digital currencies.\n\nBlockchain assets have a very low correlation to other assets, and so they can be used to diversify portolios, Burniske says. Some use them as a risk hedge similar to how they use gold, he says.\n\nStan Miroshnik, managing director with the Argon Group, an investment bank focusing on the blockchain sector, adds that bitcoin is uncorrelated to bonds, gold, real estate, commodities and emerging market currencies. It only has a very small correlation to U.S. equities, he says.\n\nBlockchain is ""an important enough technology that people should try to invest a little bit,"" Miroshnik says.\n\nThere are different schools of thought about the best way to invest in this nascent, but growing, industry.\n\nOn the one hand, you can stockpile tokens, such as bitcoin or another digital currency, and hope the demand for them will increase, their value will rise and you can sell them later at a profit. Or, you can invest in the companies that are creating different blockchain-based products.\n\nMorningstar analyst Jim Sinegal falls into the latter camp, saying investors should focus on companies that stand to make money if they find useful applications for blockchain technology.\n\nHe suggests investors go after the companies because the coins don\'t generate any cash flow. So the only way you\'ll make money off it is if a token\'s price goes up and you can then sell it, Sinegal says.\n\nHowever, because the industry is so new, it can be tough to invest in companies with exposure to blockchain technology, Sinegal says. He compares it to the early stages of internet stocks in the 1990s. A few were successful, but investors lost money on others.\n\n""It\'s very tough to make a direct investment,"" he says.\n\n[See: 6 ETFs That Let You Buy Micro-Cap Stocks.]\n\nStill, Sinegal says companies such as Goldman Sachs Group (ticker: NYSE: GS) and CME Group ( CME) eventually stand to significantly benefit from the lower costs blockchain technology makes possible.\n\nWhile more than 70 of the world\'s largest financial institutions have joined a blockchain-development consortium, and large technology firms like International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM) and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT) have blockchain solutions, Miroshnik says it remains difficult to get true exposure to the technology through public companies.\n\nThe blockchain penny stock universe includes BTCS, Global Arena Holding, HashingSpace Corp. and First Bitcoin Capital Corp.\n\nBut penny stock companies are very young and may not be the best investment now as their business models are evolving, Miroshnik says.\n\nMiroshnik says investing in coins is the way to go because blockchain assets appreciate for two reasons.\n\nFirst, there is a real cost to producing each transactional ledger of the blockchain. It takes computer equipment and energy. These so-called miners compete to produce the next block in the chain and are rewarded with coins. This cost of production keeps going up over time, creating a fundamental driver of higher value, Miroshnik says.', 'What is even more interesting is how over US$150m worth of bitcoin passed through all of these casinos.\n\nIt is evident there is a bright future ahead for bitcoin in the gambling industry. Particularly bitcoin-based provably fair gambling has become a lot more popular throughout 2017. Casinos and gambling platforms dealing with cryptocurrency offer many different benefits, that much is certain. Over 1 billion bitcoin-based bets were placed with bitcoin through March of 2017, which is a spectacular number.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons as to why people switch to bitcoin casinos. First of all, the vast majority of platforms focus on being provably fair. In doing so, these companies ensure players can manually verify the outcome of every game. Ensuring the casino doesn’t have an unfair house edge is of the utmost importance. Traditional casinos cannot provide such unprecedented transparency.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoin offers a lot of advantages compared to traditional payments. First of all, bitcoin provides more privacy, as no personal information is exchanged. Additionally, it is also a transparent payment solution, as anyone can verify the payments in real-time. From a safety point of view, one can rest assured there are no chargebacks or refunds, which matter a lot to casino operators.\n\nFinding the top bitcoin casinos is not an easy feat, although eery platform has something to offer. Most platforms have a wide variety of games and provide some great bonuses to boot. Thankfully, there are some good platforms keeping track of the top bitcoin casinos on behalf of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, like TheBitcoinStrip. Especially the year 2017 has been quite positive for bitcoin casinos in general, with thousands of players making the switch.\n\nAlthough traditional casinos still have a lot of appeal, trusting them is virtually impossible. Scam accusations can be found all over the internet, and their restricted withdrawal options are not helping matters much either. All of this translates to exponentially increasing amounts of money being bet across bitcoin gambling platforms. Close to US$360,000 worth of bitcoin profit was generated for bitcoin casinos in March, which is quite impressive.\n\nWhat is even more interesting is how over US$150m worth of bitcoin passed through all of these casinos. If this trend continues, it is very well possible the year 2017 will see US$2bn or more in bets on bitcoin platforms. The first quarter and first week of April combined have netted some interesting results so far. Over US$520m worth of BTC changed hands across 3 billion bets. This translates to 360 bets per second throughout the year, which is a staggering number. Things are definitely improving for bitcoin casinos, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of NewsBTC or any of its team members.

Amongst our many services, we assist companies in ICO's, particularly regarding compliance, exchanges, hedging and safe storage of assets\n\nIn regards to Matchpool GmbH and their ICO, BTCSAG helped a subset of contributors exchange fiat funds to ETH and placed them in the ICO contract on their behalf.”\n\nBTCSAG also held a single, non-mandatory signature to the Matchpool main ETH wallet but Matchpool was (and is) fully able to sign transactions without the involvement of BTCSAG.\n\nThe nature of the BTCSAG/Matchpool relationship, as described by Matchpool, is listed here.\n\nMatchpool hires a new CTO\n\nFellow Matchpool co-founder Yonatan Ben Shimon meanwhile released his own post to counter Saunders’ claims.\n\n“During the ICO, we got a lot of support from our community which eventually summed up to 2,370 different participants that trusted us with their funds. We take that very seriously and it is our sole desire to return this trust and provide our initial supporters with the best product and community possible,” he wrote.\n\nShimon adds that a replacement CTO for Saunders had been hired:\n\n“We have appointed Or Demri the position of CTO. Or specializes in system architecture on Ethereum and is highly qualified for the role and came recommended by the community. Or won the Consensys NY EtherCamp Hackathon last year, so we’re in a great position to move onward and upward.”\n\nAccording to Shimon, as a precaution all the BTC now are in a multisig wallet with the address: 392eAQg9FioqDn7T3mqkTu8bcFfux1YJAq.\n\n“We are going to publish a developer plan in one week from now and release the first product in early June,” he says."", 'Litecoin prices fell roughly 20% in less than 24 hours, and the culprit is apparently a single tweet.\n\nThe digital currency declined to as little as $9.19 at 12:29 UTC today, after reaching a high of $11.45 yesterday. According to data source Coinmarketcap, this represented a 19.7% loss for the digital currency.\n\nYet, analysts suggest the price movement is the latest example of how cryptocurrency prices can be impacted by relatively minor events, in this case, speculation about the future of an upgrade to the litecoin protocol.\n\nFirst developed for the bitcoin network as a way to increase the capacity of network transaction blocks, there are now high hopes litecoin could be a useful proving ground for Segregated Witness, a blockchain scaling solution.\n\nDevelopers, for instance, have expressed their interest in testing SegWit on litecoin as a way to ease concerns about its deployment on bitcoin, and traders have responded in turn.\n\nThe tweet that analysts identified as triggering this sharp drop, however, shook confidence in this outcome.\n\nIn the message, Wang Chun, co-owner and chief administrator of mining pool F2Pool, expressed his concerns about Segregated Witness and warned that he may need to pull his mining pool\'s support for the proposal.\n\nAt issue is that F2Pool accounts for roughly 35% of the network\'s mining power.\n\nStill, less than two hours later, litecoin creator Charlie Lee tweeted that he had spoken with Chun, who would continue to signal for SegWit.\n\nThough with the scare over, it seems markets were still affected.\n\nOver the last several days, the litecoin network has repeatedly approached the key 75% support level it needs to activate SegWit, and as such, the tweet sparked concerns the technical proposal might not be activated.\n\nAt the time of report, 67% of miners were signaling their support for the change, including F2Pool.\n\nTrend forming\n\nGoing forward, analysts said the blockchain asset will likely experience continued volatility on the outcome of this upgrade.\n\n""Litecoin\'s jumps and drops lately all seem to be tied to speculation as to whether it will manage to activate SegWit,"" algorithmic programmer Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.\n\nHarry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, offered a similar sentiment, stating that a lot of litecoin\'s price movements had to do with SegWit activation.\n\nThe drama takes place as the price of litecoin has enjoyed sharp increases over the last several trading sessions, with data suggesting it has surged roughly 175% from its peak to trough over the last week.\n\nTwitter chalkboard image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Financial institutions across the world are lining up to implement Bitcoin’s underlying technology into their operations. The use of blockchain technology in the traditional financial system, mainly driven by the banks’ need to evolve while facing competition from cryptocurrencies still doesn’t solve the issues of centralization itself. It has been proven by the recent rejection of Russian Sberbank by the R3 consortium.\n\nUnlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, almost all blockchain banking solutions are governed by the institutions that are part of it, which makes it impossible to have an unbiased ecosystem. With centralized institutions calling the shots, there will always be undue geopolitical influences that hamper global innovation and universal access.\n\nAccording to reports, the leading Russian banking institution – Sberbank was informed by R3 Consortium that it is not welcome to be part of it due to international sanctions. Following the communication, the bank has decided not to apply for membership in the R3CEV led consortium. Other affected banks due to R3’s stance includes Ak Bars, Alfa-Bank, Otkritie Bank and the National Settlement Depository.\n\nWhile reporting the withdrawal of Sberbank from applying for R3 Consortium membership, publications have pointed it out that the banking institution is already part of the Linux Foundation’s HyperLedger blockchain project. Incidentally, R3 also recently announced its participation in the Hyperledger Project which already has some of the leading banking, financial and technology companies working together to create distributed ledger solutions.\n\nCurrently, the payment solutions company — QIWI is the only Russian institution to be part of the R3 blockchain consortium.\n\nUnlike these blockchain consortiums, the pure Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency based financial solutions are universal in nature, and anyone, irrespective of their geographical location can readily make use of it. Bitcoin has already showcased its capability of replacing fiat currency to become the global currency, and it comes with all the goodness of blockchain technology based solutions right out of the box.\n\nRef: Econotimes | Kommersant | Image: Shutterstock', 'UK-based cryptocurrency exchange Paybis has added a rare facility for users to purchase Bitcoin with a credit card.\n\nPaybis, which also operates from Latvia and the US, developed the “Bitcoin with Credit Card” feature specifically to allow instant purchase, coins being released as soon as the transaction is processed.\n\nVerified users can purchase up to $5,000 of BTC at once, subject to a $20,000 monthly limit.\n\nWhile exchanges serving the UK market have traditionally been seen as somewhat poorer value due to banking regulations, charging around £10 for fiat withdrawal or deposit, Paybis looks set to circumvent the issue.\n\nIn doing so, it takes on the lively alternative market in the country, consisting of peer-to-peer marketplaces such as LocalBitcoins.\n\nIn March, the exchange reduced fees for purchasing Bitcoin with credit cards, now charging five percent, is beating services such as Bitcoin ATMs by around two to three percent.\n\nPaybis’ segment of the exchange market remains modest, having existed since 2014 and focusing on service rather than rapid expansion.\n\n“The main differences we have from our competition (other online digital currency exchanges and classical BTC exchanges) is that we offer fully managed and guided services to our customers,” CEO Konstantin Vasilenko told Cointelegraph in an interview at the end of 2015.\n\n“Similar to a peer-to-peer marketplace, we help and guide our customers when purchasing Bitcoin using the most convenient payment method available in their country.”']"
04/08/2017,"['You\'re reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of controversy surrounding Bitcoin’s legality in India. The government and ministers are cautioning the users repeatedly gainst the risk involved with the usage of this digital currency.\n\nThe minister of state for finance, Arjun Ram Meghwal, last week reiterated concerns against the use of digital currencies in India.\n\n""The absence of counter parties in usage of [virtual currencies] including bitcoins, for illicit and illegal activities in anonymous/ pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws,"" he said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.\n\nDespite all the warnings, Bitcoin startups of India remain confident and feel largely insulated by the consequences of the risk involved with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin startups such as SearchTrade, Zebpay, Unocoin and Coinsecure have taken a step forward to form the “Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI)” for the orderly and transparent growth of the virtual currency market.\n\nUnderstand Legal And Value Discovery Process for Bitcoin:\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO, SearchTrade feels Bitcoins are a risky investment not withstanding government opinion or policies around it.\n\n“One must understand both legal as well as value discovery process before jumping into investing in them. The government has not explicitly said it is illegal; my understanding is they insist it is illegal to indulge in illegal activities with them,” he explained.\n\nTalking about the self – regulatory body formed by the Bitcoin start-ups, he said, “We are creating a self-regulatory framework due to lack of defined policies in the space to protect both consumers and businesses involved in the space. For e.g., we have made it mandatory for our members to implement KYC, anti-money-laundering and suspicious trade reporting in their day to day operations. We are working on many such initiatives to help the budding ecosystem.”\n\nIn addition, at DABFI Vikas along with other members are engaging with various government departments to help them better understand the technology and frame policies for the future.\n\nBitcoin Investment Faces Both Technical And Legal Risks:\n\nAnother bitcoin exchange company, Zebpay buys and sells bitcoins in India.\n\nSandeep Goenka, COO and Co-founder, ZebPay believes that investing in bitcoin is high reward, high risk.\n\n“Bitcoin has been the best performing currency for a year since its inception except 2014. However, the investment faces both technical and legal risks. Hence even if you consider it, it should be a very small part of your portfolio,” he said.\n\nAccording to Sandeep, bitcoin is legal under all existing laws. If it is banned in future, his company will stop operations. However, he added that it needs to be understood that the ban won\'t stop cryptocurrencies. It\'ll only stop its legitimate use.\n\nReferring to the Indian governments’ strong stance towards the bitcoin usage, he said “They have genuine concerns like for any new technology, whether it’s a taxi hailing app, drones, health tech or cryptocurrencies. However, legitimate exchanges give them radar to the industry. If they ban us, international apps will continue to serve the underground market. All this will achieve is stopping legitimate use and Indian companies.\n\nBitcoin Will Always Face Legality Issues:\n\n\n\nAccording to Mohit Kalra, CEO and Founder of Delhi-based bitcoin startup Coinsecure, something so decentralized and disruptive like bitcoin will always face issues regarding legality. Even for semi-decentralised cab systems like Uber and Ola Cabs, it took a lot of years for the regulators to come out with proper regulations. This delay definitely not means it was illegal to operate such services.\n\n“We are seeing a similar trend with bitcoin, there are different opinions currently. Making bitcoin illegal will force exchanges like ours to shut down, thus promoting users to trade in cash illegal market. Doing so will be the complete opposite and against to what government expected after demonetisation,” he said.\n\nWhile there’s global uncertainty over the legal status of bitcoin in India, Mohit further explained that a ban on something so decentralized will only force all the users to trade illegally. It will only result in government not getting any service tax from the companies or income tax from the users on what they earn from trading or mining.', 'Bitcoin has been the top-performing currency in the world in six of the past seven years, climbing from zero to a value of about $1,190.\n\nBut the cryptocurrency isn\'t anywhere close to its potential, according to Jeremy Liew, the first investor in Snapchat, and Blockchain CEO and cofounder Peter Smith. In a presentation sent to Business Insider, the duo laid out their case for why it\'s reasonable for bitcoin to explode to $500,000 by 2030.\n\nTheir argument is based on increased interest in bitcoin, thanks to:\n\nBitcoin-based remittances\n\nRemittance transfers, or electronic money transfers to foreign countries, have almost doubled over the past 15 years to 0.76% of GDP, data from The World Bank shows.\n\n""Expats sending money home have found in Bitcoin an inexpensive alternative, and we assume that the percentage of Bitcoin-based remittances will sharply increase with greater Bitcoin awareness,"" the two say.\n\nUncertainty\n\nLiew and Smith said increased political uncertainty in the UK, US and in developing nations would help elevate the level of interest in bitcoin.\n\n""We believe Bitcoin awareness, high liquidity, ease of transport and continued market outperformance as geopolitical risks mount, will make Bitcoin a strong contender for investment at a consumer and investor level,"" the two said.\n\nMobile penetration\n\nLiew and Smith believe the percentage of non-cash transactions will climb from 15% to 30% in the next 10 years as the world becomes more connected through smartphones. There\'s only a 63% global smartphone penetration and the total number of smartphone users is expected to soar by 1 billion by 2020. GSMA, a trade body that represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, believes 90% of these users will come from developing countries.\n\nThis will make it possible for nearly everyone to have a bank in their pocket, and that should provide a boost for bitcoin as well. Liew and Smith say bitcoin could account for 50% of all of these transactions.\n\nHere are the basic model drivers that Liew and Smith used:\n\nA bitcoin price of $1,000 in 2017. That network users will grow 61x from now until 2030. ""Put another way, we need a population of bitcoin users around a quarter of the Chinese population (or 5% of the global population) in 2030 to see bitcoin at $500k,"" Liew and Smith told Business Insider. Bitcoin\'s user network grew from 120,000 users in 2013 to 6.5 million users in 2017, or about 54x, and this could be just the beginning. Growth of that magnitude would produce 400 million users in 2030. The average value of bitcoin held per user hits $25,000. ""As institutional investor cash in Bitcoin, sophisticated investors trading Bitcoin, and Bitcoin-based ETFs proliferate, we think the average Bitcoin value held will increase to around $25k per Bitcoin holder,"" Liew and Smith said. Currently, with a market cap of $16.4 billion, and 6.5 million user count, the average user holds $2,515 worth of bitcoin. Bitcoin\'s 2030 market cap is decided by number of bitcoin holders multiplied by average bitcoin value held. Bitcoin\'s 2030 supply will be about 20 million. Bitcoin\'s 2030 price and user count total $500,000 and 400 million, respectively. The price is found by taking the $10 trillion market cap and dividing it by the fixed supply of 20 million bitcoin.\n\nIt\'s important to note that a lot could go wrong, too. News surrounding bitcoin has been rather negative as of a late.\n\nChina, which is responsible for nearly 100% of trading in bitcoin, has been cracking down on trading. The three biggest exchanges recently announced a 0.2% fee on all transactions, in addition to blocking withdrawals from trading accounts.\n\nAdditionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected two bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and will make a ruling on another one in the future. It\'s not expected to be approved. However, Smith thinks bitcoin is still in its early stages.\n\n""The SEC’s ruling wasn\'t a surprise to us,"" he told Business Insider. ""We know that getting this sort of approval is going to take (a potentially long) time,"" Smith said. ""In the meantime, bitcoin is already simple to buy and hold and, as the asset continues to mature, we\'ll continue to see an increase in the development and deployment of surrounding products.""\n\nBitcoin More\n\nAnd while bitcoin hasn\'t been granted regulatory approval here in the US, it is catching on elsewhere. On April 1, the cryptocurrency became a legal payment method in Japan.\n\nAnother threat to the future of the cryptocurrency is that developers are threatening to set up a ""hard fork,"" or alternative marketplace for bitcoin. This would result in the split of bitcoin into bitcoin and bitcoin unlimited. However, Smith says not to worry.\n\n""Bitcoin has strong economic incentives to prevent this,"" he said. ""If the last two years of healthy contention and debate lead to a conclusion, it\'s that Bitcoin is incredibly resilient and stable. In fact, the bitcoin Blockchain has operated for 7+ years with no downtime, a feat no other back-end system operating at this scale can claim.""\n\nAnyone interested in bitcoin should also know that the cryptocurrency sees violent price swings that are uncommon among the more traditional currencies. Bitcoin rallied 20% in the first week of 2017 before crashing 35% on word China was cracking down on trading.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has regained those losses, and trades up about 25% so far this year.\n\nNOW WATCH: Warner Bros. might have to pay $900 million if it can\'t prove ghosts are real\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From Business Insider\n\n', 'Only a few weeks since the SEC denied two separate bitcoin ETF applications, there may be some good news coming out of Japan for supporters of Bitcoin.\n\nOn April 1, a new law went into effect in Japan allowing for the country’s first officially recognized bitcoin exchange. The creation of a bitcoin exchange has been a long time coming in Japan. Officials in the country have been calling for increased regulation over the cryptocurrency since 2014 when Mt Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, went under following allegations of fraud and the eventual arrest of its CEO. The new law creating the bitcoin exchange was designed to protect consumers from future instances of similar fraud through registration, regulation, and supervision.\n\nSummary of the New Law\n\nThe law was originally drafted in May of 2016 and amended Japan’s Payment Services Act (PSA) in four ways. First, the law officially recognizes and defines virtual currencies. Second, it allows the official registration of virtual currency exchanges. Third, it requires that virtual currency exchanges submit certain disclosures and undergo periodic audits. And finally, it forces virtual currency exchanges to submit to regulatory supervision by requiring them to maintain books and records, file audit reports, and submit to on-site examinations among others. Virtual currency exchanges are now listed as “designated businesses” that have to comply with the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds’ anti-money laundering provision, verification of new account identity provision, and reporting of suspicious reporting provision.\n\nOver Regulation?\n\nWhile some are excited over the fact that bitcoin is now officially recognized in Japan, many believe that the new law goes too far and may negatively impact bitcoin startups in Japan. The chief concern of critics of the new law is that the regulations make it too costly for companies to register as a bitcoin exchange. According to Bitcoinist: “Some experts estimate that the costs involved with becoming a compliant exchange could be as high as $300,000-$500,000 USD.”\n\nIn his blog analyzing the new law, co-founder of IndieSquare, Koji Higashi, thinks that the new law will force foreign companies to leave Japan, make it harder for smaller companies and startups, and stifle innovation.\n\nThe market seems to be more optimistic about the new law. The price of a single bitcoin jumped almost 3% within 2 days of the law going into effect. At the time of this writing, the price of bitcoin has risen even higher to $1,194 USD (it opened at $1,068 USD on April 1st; see figure below). After all, Japan is the second-largest trader of bitcoin in the world by volume, so this could very well be a step in the right direction for legitimizing bitcoin around the world.', 'Over the past few weeks, the price of Ethereum’s Ether and Bitcoin price have consistently demonstrated inverse correlation.\n\nAs shown in the comparison chart below, a tight correlation between the performance of Ether and Bitcoin is evident. When Bitcoin rises in value, Ether price declines and vice versa.\n\nDifference\n\nThe Ethereum and Bitcoin network are completely different from each other in terms of philosophy, structure, monetary policy and vision. Bitcoin was developed to operate as digital gold and as a cash system. Ethereum, in contrast,was introduced to supplement decentralized applications. Essentially, Bitcoin is a digital currency and Ethereum is a decentralized network of applications.\n\nMany Bitcoin and security experts including Andreas Antonopoulos commented on the comparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin in the past. In 2016, Antonopoulos wrote:\n\n“Stop calling ethereum ""the bitcoin rival"". No one in ethereum or bitcoin believes it is a rival. Post-national currencies are not zero-sum.”\n\nIn a way, Ethereum developers and companies depend on the Bitcoin network for its stability and security. Ethereum prioritizes flexibility and functionality to provide a more efficient ecosystem for developers, while Bitcoin operates as a better store of value.\n\nFor instance, Blockchain startups that often engage in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) normally hedge their funds raised in Ether to Bitcoin for increased stability. Since Bitcoin has a substantially lower volatility rate, startups prefer to maintain their funds in Bitcoin via cold storage or hardware wallets such as Trezor.\n\nBitcoin scalability issues\n\nRecently, as the Bitcoin community struggled to come to a consensus on which solution to activate to scale the Bitcoin network, some users migrated over to the Ethereum network. Some analysts including Social Minds founder and Reality Keys developer Edmund Edgar went as far as to describe Ether as a viable alternative payment method to Bitcoin due to its fixed transaction fees.\n\nIn Ethereum, transaction fees are called gas. For users to initiate smart contracts or send transactions, they are required to spend a certain amount of gas. According to Edgar, this transaction fee for Ethereum transactions is fixed and does not alter depending on the size of the transaction, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nEdgar explains:\n\n“A user’s account can be modeled as… an account. You can have a single balance, and it doesn’t matter how many payments it took to get you that balance. Wallets are simpler, less surprising stuff happens, and fees are easier to predict and explain. All payments cost the same, regardless of where the funds came from.”\n\nARK Invest’s crypto-focused product lead Chris Burniske further noted that traders tend to switch back and forth between Bitcoin and Ether, depending on the performance of the two markets.\n\n3/ ""Correlation != Causation"" & these are short time periods for data, but it does suggest traders are swinging back & forth b/w $BTC & $ETH — Chris Burniske (@ARKblockchain) April 5, 2017\n\nETH/ BTC pair trade\n\nIncreasing interest of Bitcoin users, developers and businesses in Ethereum is demonstrated in the global exchange market of Ethereum. The ETH to BTC pair accounts for over 50 percent of all Ethereum trading.', 'This article was updated on Sept. 22, 2017, and originally published on April 8, 2017.\n\nInvestors in bitcoin have enjoyed an incredible year. Twelve months ago, the price for one unit of the cryptocurrency stood at just a shade over $600. As I write, one bitcoin trades for over $3,700 -- a greater than 500% gain in just one year. Truly incredible!\n\nHowever, the dramatic rise in bitcoin over the past year doesn\'t begin to tell the story of its volatile trading history. In late 2013, the trading price for one bitcoin was over $1,100. By January 2015, the price had plunged again, this time to under $200. Following this incredible drop, the digital monetary unit began its current meteoric rise. This instability is inherent in investing in a currency that is not backed or regulated by any national government, or based on something of tangible value, like gold. Check out this chart showing bitcoin\'s meteoric rise this past year.\n\nIt\'s not just the currency\'s stomach-churning volatility that turns some people off from investing in bitcoin. The lack of regulation or palpable value behind the currency causes many people to consider bitcoin somewhat akin to Monopoly money. On the other hand, the blockchain technology behind bitcoin has a chance to be disruptive across so many different industries and investors might be more willing to get behind that.\n\nBlockchain technology is essentially a publicly distributed ledger. When transactions using this technology are completed, they are recorded on the newest ""block."" When a block\'s capacity is filled, it is added to the end of the ""chain"" in linear order. This way of transferring money, supplies, or other assets eliminates the need for each transaction to go through various middlemen, like brokerages, payment processors, and even banks. The fewer third-parties involved in facilitating transactions, the fewer players that take a small cut.\n\nHere are three companies that clearly see many opportunities ahead for this potentially transformative technology, and that are working to incorporate it in their respective fields.\n\nBlockchain\'s impact on the financial industry\n\nCount Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) CEO Rich Daly among those who see the opportunities for blockchain technology in finance. In the summer of 2016, Daly wrote in Forbes:\n\nSome people know blockchain as the underlying technology behind the controversial digital currency Bitcoin. However, blockchain is so much more; it\'s incredibly innovative and its promise is far-reaching. This technology is a secure and transparent way to digitally track the ownership of assets before, during and after transactions, and it has the potential to ultimately transform everything from how stock exchanges operate to how proxies are voted.\n\nBroadridge Financial handles mundane tasks for brokerages and financial institutions such as facilitating proxy votes and processing equity trades. The company believes blockchain technology can streamline these processes, making them faster, cheaper, and more secure.\n\nIn the same editorial quoted above, Daly lists syndicated loans as an example where blockchain technology would accomplish these goals. Syndicated loans, Daly states, currently take up to 20 days to settle in a labor-intensive process. With blockchain, the process would be much faster and would cost less in legal fees and to close.\n\nIn September 2016, Broadridge made its latest investment in this space, buying the technology assets of Inveshare, Inc. for a total of $135 million. The acquisition was for the sole purpose of accelerating Broadridge\'s use of blockchain technology in its proxy business.\n\nRevolutionizing equity trading\n\nNasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ: NDAQ) is the world\'s second-largest stock exchange and has been experimenting with blockchain technology for years. In the final days of 2015, Nasdaq announced it had completed the first issuing of a private company\'s shares to an investor via blockchain technology on the company\'s Linq platform.\n\nThe use of blockchain technology eliminated the need to issue paper stock certificates and ""significantly"" reduced the transaction\'s settlement time, according to Nasdaq, which believes the technology holds the same promise for stocks sold on the public markets. In the press release announcing the historic transaction, Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld said:\n\nThrough this initial application of blockchain technology, we begin a process that could revolutionize the core of capital markets infrastructure systems. The implications for settlement and outdated administrative functions are profound.\n\nThis isn\'t the only way Nasdaq has experimented with using blockchain technology. Earlier this year, the company successfully used the technology to process proxy voting on its Estonian exchange. It is now contemplating whether to use the same process for proxy voting across all of its exchanges.\n\nBig Blue\'s blockchain bet\n\nPerhaps no company has more invested in blockchain technology than International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). Earlier this year, the company launched IBM Blockchain, a platform that will enable enterprise customers to build applications in IBM\'s cloud using blockchain. The company believes its cloud-based blockchain offerings -- a type of blockchain-as-a-service -- will differentiate it from its many cloud competitors.\n\nCEO Ginni Rometty believes it cannot be overestimated how important blockchain technology is to the company\'s future. In the company\'s 2016 annual letter, she stated:\n\nBlockchain brings together shared ledgers with smart contracts to allow the secure transfer of any asset -- whether a physical asset like a shipping container, a financial asset like a bond or a digital asset like music -- across any business network. Blockchain will do for trusted transactions what the Internet did for information.\n\nRometty says the company is currently working with over 400 clients on blockchain initiatives. These offerings are as diverse as using the platform to work with Wal-Mart Stores to track food inventory, and with the London-based start-up Everledger to track diamonds.\n\nBroadridge Financial, Nasdaq, and IBM are multibillion-dollar companies with many moving parts. Their futures do not hinge on blockchain technology, but each is aiming to use it in ways that will cut costs, allow for faster service, or differentiate their business services from competitors. All three companies are avenues investors can explore to gain decent exposure to blockchain technology without buying bitcoins.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The price gained momentum and managed to trade towards $1200. It is a positive sign, and shows that the price has established a good bias above the $1120 support area. The recent high was $1204 from where the price started a minor dip.\n\nThere are many support levels on the downside started $1170. There are a few bullish trend lines formed with support at $1160 and $1140 on the 4-hours chart BTC/USD. These trend lines may act as a strong support if the price dips from the $1200 swing high. We can keep a close eye on the $1160 and $1140 support levels to enter a short-term buy trade. Furthermore, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $890 low to $104 high is also aligned on the downside.\n\nSo, the most important immediate support can be near $1130.

And this is apparently no fluke, with only 807 of the Form 8949s filed for 2013 and 893 for 2014.\n\nThis low level of reporting occurred during the same period (2013-2015) that the value of the currency (in dollars) went on a bumpy ride, skyrocketing from less than $20 to more than $1,100, presumably generating significant capital gains for many investors.\n\n“In my view, 800 reports per year of profits and losses in virtual currency transactions is ridiculously low,” says Martin Mushkin, an attorney specializing in bitcoin law.\n\n“The publicity given to this proceeding now and the forthcoming enforcement actions would result in a substantial amount of tax collections,” he adds. “The anonymity of bitcoin should not be allowed to foster tax evasion.”\n\nCoinbase, for its part, blames the IRS itself for this underreporting, and its chief executive has called for creation of a Form 1099-B to be issued to each of its clients participating in a potentially taxable transaction — a proposal that the IRS has called low priority because of cuts to its budget.\n\n“We’re very serious about complying with the laws and we actually support the idea that people who ought to pay their taxes do so,” says Michael Lempres, Coinbase chief legal and risk officer. “But the demand for three years’ worth of transactions conflicts with privacy interests.”\n\nMushkin and others familiar with the case say they expect Coinbase to cut a deal with the IRS. “I suspect that, as we speak, Coinbase is preparing an answer to the anticipated Order to Show Cause and negotiating the terms of the summons,” he says. “The papers show the parties have been talking, and Coinbase will try to cut this down.”\n\nCoinbase is already registered with FinCEN, the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Center, obliging the exchange to report transactions in excess of $10,000 per day and suspected transactions to be structured to avoid the $10,000 reporting threshold (such as multiple $9,750 transactions). The Coinbase response, Mushkin predicts, “will be to initially limit the subpoena to FinCEN reporting accounts and smaller accounts with large turnover volumes.”', ""About The Author\n\nDariusz is a Digital Anthropologist who has been closely following the world of cryptocurrencies since 2014.

A major Hong Kong-based Bitcoin exchange has suspended trading after 65 million USD in the virtual unit was reportedly stolen by hackers -- sending the digital currency plunging more than 20 percent. (Photo: ANTHONY WALLACE, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMost people believe bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just a passing fad. Until recently, bitcoins were only owned by devout libertarians and criminals who used the digital currency to buy and sell illegal goods and services on hidden parts of the internet. Cryptocurrencies are also difficult for a layman to obtain, and the value of bitcoin is so volatile that it dissuades investors. For these reasons, bitcoin has remained relatively obscure.\n\nHowever, in the past couple years, Venezuelans have been using bitcoin as an alternative to the country’s rapidly inflating currency. Venezuela’s decades of failed socialist policies have destroyed the country’s economy, but the same policies also laid the groundwork for bitcoin’s insurgency as a legitimate currency. The role of bitcoin in the Venezuelan economy demonstrates that normal people are capable of understanding and using bitcoin for regular transactions, and that what works in Venezuela can work in the rest of the world.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is an electronic payment system that uses cryptography to secure transactions. It was created in 2008 by an unidentified programmer and first introduced to individuals on a cryptography mailing list. Bitcoin transactions do not use an intermediary, the encrypted ledger of all transactions are available to the public and bitcoin’s software is open source. These elements are why bitcoin is considered to be the first decentralized virtual currency.\n\nCryptocurrencies work in complex ways. For an individual to obtain bitcoin, they could either buy existing bitcoins from someone or trade goods and services for bitcoins. Individuals can also be rewarded bitcoins for recording transactions on the ledger, also known as the blockchain. The blockchain is managed by a network of individual miners, or people who record encrypted transactions to the ledger by solving computational problems on the bitcoin software. Each individual miner is able to view the entire blockchain, and the entire network of miners is needed to create new portions of the ledger, after which the ledger is updated. This process both standardizes and decentralizes the way in which transactions are recorded.\n\nAnyone who runs the bitcoin software could be a bitcoin miner, but the computational power of regular desktops is so weak compared to miners who use supercomputers, that the price of electricity to run the mining software ends up costing more than the bitcoins they would be rewarded.\n\nYou never really “possess” a bitcoin, you just have credentials to access its location on the blockchain. This location has both a public and private cryptographic key, and in order to have access to bitcoins at this location on the blockchain, you need to know the private key. The existence of public keys allow you to target where you want to send or receive bitcoins, and private keys allow you to confirm ownership and approve transactions.\n\nVery few people owned bitcoins or had an interest in cryptocurrencies during the first three years of its creation, so the price of bitcoin stayed below $1. Since then, there have been several boom and bust cycles, and now the price of bitcoin is $1173.09 at the time of writing. Most people rightfully wonder if there is anything inherently valuable about bitcoin, and in order to conceptualize this, it helps to compare it to the inherent value of the US dollar. The US dollar, like other fiat currencies, is not backed by a commodity like precious metals, instead it is valuable because it is the only form of payment accepted by the US government. If you want to do business in the US, you need to do it in dollars. Likewise, bitcoin’s value is derived from the fact that there is great demand for encrypted, decentralized, digital currency.\n\nOnline black markets\n\nBitcoin is infamously known as the only accepted form of payment on online black markets, accessible via the dark net. Illicit marketplaces exist in hidden networks on the internet that do not appear in search engine results, and almost always require specific software or authorization to access websites. These websites can only be reached on encrypted internet browsers, and if performed properly, browsing habits are completely anonymous and impossible to track. Since bitcoin is also encrypted and anonymous, it thrives in this clandestine atmosphere.\n\nYou can buy anything you want on the dark net. Any drug can be purchased, hitmen are available for hire, human trafficking is disturbingly accessible, hacking tools and scamming software are easy to find and respective forums exist for deviants to discuss their illegal escapades. The dark net existed before cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin allowed dark net marketplaces to flourish.\n\nThe most well-known example of a dark net marketplace is the Silk Road. From the period of 2011-2013, the Silk Road mediated over 1 million transactions, generated $1.2 billion in total revenue and produced almost $80 million in commissions for Silk Road’s owner and operators. Although Silk Road was shut down by the FBI in 2013, and its creator sentenced to life in prison on various related charges, new dark net marketplaces have been created to fill the void.\n\nBitcoin in Venezuela\n\nFor various reasons, both internal and external, Venezuela is suffering hyperinflation and economic depression. The country has the largest oil reserves and has been one of the world’s leading exporters of oil, which has been the focal point of Venezuela’s economy for the past few decades. The petroleum sector accounts for one third of the country’s GDP and one half of the government’s revenues. Because of this, any decrease in oil prices sends a shockwave throughout the country’s economy that compounds negative effects far beyond the energy sector. Modern Venezuela history is punctuated by recessions caused by decreases in the price of oil.\n\nWith the condition of its economy in a precarious place, the Venezuelan government for the past two decades has not been able to appropriately handle economic downturn. In response to recessions, Venezuela has devalued their currency, set fixed price controls for goods and nationalized industries. These polices have led to a capital flight of foreign direct investment out of the country, and tend to make recessions much worse. However, one government policy has had a peculiar unintended consequence.\n\nThe Venezuelan government subsidizes electricity, and as a result all of the costs associated with mining bitcoin are shifted from the individual to the government, making it profitable for the individual to mine bitcoin. A relatively small group of computer savvy Venezuelans have caught onto this, and have begun mining bitcoin to buy food and goods from Amazon Prime Pantry service. Since domestic goods are scarce and no one accepts the Venezuelan bolivar, this seemingly roundabout process is the only way to acquire goods that would otherwise cost months’ worth of savings.\n\nBitcoin mining and the resulting black markets created by it can be dangerous for participants. Venezuela’s secret police targets bitcoin miners, arresting them for charges of possessing contraband or misusing electricity, since mining bitcoins is not yet illegal in the country. Despite this, bitcoin mining has enabled a black market for imports bought with bitcoin. The most visible example of this is Bitcoin Venezuela, a Facebook group with 7,000 users who can buy and sell goods using bitcoin they either mined or bought from someone who was mining.\n\nIt is unclear how much of a role bitcoin will play in the future of the Venezuelan economy. After all, not only is the government bearing the cost of the mining, but the use of bitcoin further delegitimizes the Venezuelan bolivar and increasing the size of the black market. However, it is clear that the once esoteric hobby for geeks and far-right libertarians has finally reached the mainstream. Regardless the fate of bitcoin in Venezuela, bitcoin has proven to be useful in everyday transactions and not just illicit services.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fsune.ws/2oPcCic', 'Jeremy Liew, the first investor in Snap Inc., the $24.5 bln parent company of popular social media platform Snapchat, said in an interview with Business Insider that Bitcoin price can realistically reach $500,000 by 2030.\n\nSince its introduction in 2009, with the exception of one year, Bitcoin has consistently been the world’s best-performing currency and asset.\n\nContrary to the perception of Bitcoin by the general consumer base, Bitcoin’s volatility rate has significantly decreased over the past few years and has transformed into a stable store of value, digital gold and settlement network.\n\nBitcoin as remittance and settlement network\n\nBitcoin is currently being utilized globally as a means of payment and efficient remittance method. In fact, as reported by Cointelegraph in February, the Philippines officially recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate remittance and payment method.\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s central bank, stated in its Circular No.944:\n\n“Rather, the BSP aims to regulate VCs when used for delivery of financial services, particularly, for payments and remittances, which have a material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability.”\n\nAccording to Liew and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, the transportability and high liquidity of Bitcoin allow the digital currency to operate as a practical remittance method for the general consumer base. In that regard, Liew explained that Bitcoin is appealing to mainstream investors and users as a strong investment and reliable digital currency.\n\nLiew and Smith noted:\n\n""Expats sending money home have found in Bitcoin an inexpensive alternative, and we assume that the percentage of Bitcoin-based remittances will sharply increase with greater Bitcoin awareness. We believe Bitcoin awareness, high liquidity, ease of transport and continued market outperformance as geopolitical risks mount, will make Bitcoin a strong contender for investment at a consumer and investor level.”\n\nBitcoin’s distinctive applications are enabling the currency to grow at an explosive rate. Some are utilizing Bitcoin as a wealth management tool, while others are relying on Bitcoin to send and receive payments, to profit in the long run, and settle transactions with low fees and shorter confirmation periods in contrast to bank transfers.\n\nIn consideration of Bitcoin’s exponential growth, its limited supply, scarcity and rarity, Liew explained that it is highly likely for Bitcoin price to reach $500,000 as its user base reaches 400 mln. Currently, there exist approximately 20 mln Bitcoin wallets provided by service providers such as Blockchain and Coinbase. Liew expects the user base of Bitcoin to grow by 20 times in the next 13 years.\n\n“Bitcoin\'s 2030 price and user count total $500,000 and 400 million, respectively. The price is found by taking the $10 trillion market cap and dividing it by the fixed supply of 20 million bitcoin,” a section of the presentation provided by Liew and Smith read.\n\nWhy the SEC ruling wasn’t surprising for Liew and Smith\n\nFor Liew and Smith, the denial of the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN was somewhat expected, primarily due to the inefficiency of the SEC when it comes to the approval of new markets and assets. However, Liew also noted that Bitcoin does not need a strictly regulated channel in order to appeal to a large group of investors.\n\nThe Bitcoin exchange market itself provides a high level of liquidity for traders. Thus, it is relatively easy for an average trader to purchase and sell Bitcoin on regulated platforms.\n\nHe told Business Insider:', 'Bitcoin has been trading between ~$1075-1200 this week, according to the BLX, on heavy bullish momentum. Total Network Hashrate continues to make all-time highs, despite the ongoing scaling debate. The Network Hashrate is set for a 4.51% rise on about April 12th, increasing 51.89% year to date.\n\nOver the past week, evidence has come forth suggesting why bitcoin mining chip manufacturer Bitmain continues to oppose Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 141, Segregated Witness (SegWit). The covert use of AsicBoost provides a 20% competitive advantage towards mining blocks, and is incompatible with SegWit. There is evidence of it’s existence in current chipsets, but no clear evidence it was used, as the covert form may be completely undetectable. The news preceded is a split in support for Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) this week.\n\nCurrently, SegWit and BU support is roughly even, but support for SegWit is expected to grow at a steady pace. SegWit’s testnet mined a 3.7MB block last week, which is almost 4x the current block size ceiling.\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese exchange volume continues to dominate the global market, led by BitFlyer, which currently trades almost as much volume as all of the USD exchanges combined.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe Ichimoku Cloud is a constant, auto-drawn indicator which quickly offers a trade an immense amount of valuable information on any timeframe. The cloud is best used at higher timeframes as more data generally provides truer signals and less false positives.\n\nThe indicator uses moving averages and dynamic support and resistance to make projections of key zones, as well as capturing 80% of any given trend. As long as the price remains above the cloud, sentiment remains bullish. Price in the cloud indicates a neutral trend, and below the cloud indicates a bearish trend.\n\nWhen the Tenkan (T) is over the Kijun (K) sentiment is bullish. K over T would indicate bearish sentiment. When the Lagging Span (LS) is above the cloud and above the price sentiment is bullish, below the cloud and price would indicate bearish sentiment. The best entry signals for the cloud occur when trend is obvious, but 1 or 2 of the signals have yet to become confluent with a higher timeframe trend.\n\nOn the daily timeframe, mixed messages continue for the cloud signals. Price is above cloud but the TK cross remains bearish.\n\nA strong long entry signal would be the TK cross above cloud, with bids on kijun. A similar setup occurred on February 7th. The strong pullback two days later coincided with unfavorable regulatory news out of China.\n\nAnother way to measure a longstanding trend is with a pitchfork. There are a few versions of the pitchfork, beginning in 2015, depending on the exchange your viewing. Be sure to use the log scale and pick an extreme low with a swing high and low.\n\nThe median line (red) gives the expected mean of the trend. Price will continually attempt to return to this diagonal. Each diagonal of the Pitchfork can be thought of as a potential reversal zone or support/resistance line. The upper blue diagonal zone being ‘most overbought’ or the top bounds of the trend and lower blue diagonal zone being ‘most oversold’ or the bottom bounds of the trend.\n\nThe trend continues with no threat of stopping anytime soon, with price reaching for a return to mean. Should this trend continue to year’s end, an expected price of $1800 is reasonable, based on the lower bounds of the pitchfork.\n\nThe four hour Heikin-Ashi (HA) candlesticks can be used to assess the strength of an active trend. Heikin-Ashi candlesticks manipulate the raw open and close data from the previous period to better smooth the trend. Stops may be continually moved up based on the bearish candles in a bull trend, a long-wicked candle, or a doji, which would signify a drop in momentum. Entry usually occurs when at least two candles match the active trend following a pullback or stop out.\n\nDepending on how stops are used, each of these trend flip and continuation trades may or may not have been stopped out on each leg up and pullback. Two HA candles are currently green again, but are showing little to no momentum. Until momentum returns, HA is not showing a strong long entry signal, which would likely have limited upside to the local top of the overarching move down.\n\nIn the meantime, the previous bullish butterfly harmonic has played out exactly as expected ,with price currently sitting at A-C diagonal resistance.\n\nThere is also another bearish harmonic, at the current level, which has formed off the bullish butterfly. Considered an advanced harmonic pattern, the shark is a bearish harmonic with a target of ~$1000-1050. A stop would typically be placed above the 1.272 fibonacci retracement from point C to D, with a short accumulation zone between point D and the 1.272 fibonacci retracement.\n\nSummary\n\nEvidence for creating an unfair mining competitive advantage has caused BU support to plummet. All long signals on the Ichimoku cloud have yet to flip bullish, but the longstanding pitchfork shows no threat to trend. HA candles are showing a slowing of bullish momentum at the diagonal resistance of A to C on the completed bullish butterfly harmonic. An advanced bearish harmonic has formed forecasting a target between $1000-1050 in the coming days, should the 1.272 fibonacci extension from points C to D hold as resistance.', 'There seems to be a trend in cryptocurrency investment. Traders of Bitcoin often leap from one digital currency to another, spreading their investments across popular currencies such as Ethereum’s Ether (ETH), anonymous currency Monero (XMR) and Litecoin (LTC).\n\nWith the exception of some timeframes, Bitcoin price is usually stable and significantly less volatile in comparison to other digital currencies. At a market cap close to $20 bln, the volatility rate of Bitcoin has substantially decreased over the past few years.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin price fluctuates upon the emergence of major market and industry-affecting events. For instance, when the discussion of hard fork contingency intensified and the market began to panic, Bitcoin price plunged, stabilizing in the late $900s.\n\nTraders usually attempt to pinpoint certain timeframes that Bitcoin price could either go up or down. Most recently, the acceptance of Bitcoin by major Japanese electronics retailer company Bic Camera and the legalization of the digital currency in Japan led to a surge in Bitcoin price, moving it from around $980 to $1180.\n\nInvestors who miss these short and mid-term rallies of Bitcoin tend to bet on the performance of alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ether, Monero and Litecoin that have demonstrated a significantly higher level of stability in comparison to the rest of the digital currencies on the market over longer periods of time.\n\nMore importantly, crypto assets like Ether have drastically increased in price because of the rising interests of corporate investors and financial institutions. Specifically, the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance increased the market cap of Ethereum by around 4x, as it jumped from $1 bln to over $4 bln within a span of two months.\n\nThe back and forth movement of Bitcoin investors and their diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies explain the ratio of trading pairs in major assets like Ethereum. More than 50 percent of trading in the Ethereum exchange market is processed with the ETH/BTC pair. Therefore, there exist more domestic traders within the cryptocurrency community purchasing alternative crypto assets such as ETH than conventional investors trading altcoins.\n\nRising interest in altcoins\n\nBitcoin dominance index is currently at one of its lowest points. But, the 69.2 percent dominance index of Bitcoin does not represent a declining interest in the digital currency. Rather, users are simply gaining more interest in altcoins that supplement or make up for the missing links of Bitcoin.\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum represents a Blockchain platform designed for developers and decentralized applications. Many developers have expressed their concerns over Bitcoin’s limited development framework. What Bitcoin lacks in flexibility is supplemented by its high-security measures and robust infrastructure.\n\nMonero, Dash and Zcash provide anonymity to cryptocurrency users, which Bitcoin does not. Litecoin is a unique currency in the sense that it represents nearly identical philosophies, structure and monetary policy of Bitcoin.\n\nTraders or investors who feel like they missed out on Bitcoin or the recent rally of Bitcoin price still have accessible altcoins like Monero, Litecoin, Zcash, Dash and Ether to profit from.', 'While Deloitte has long been an advisor on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, it took a step toward to practicing what it preaches earlier this month.\n\nAfter installing a bitcoin ATM in its Toronto office last fall, the consulting giant is now accepting bitcoin payments at a restaurant in its office complex – providing a hands-on opportunity for patrons to experience bitcoin.\n\nIliana Oris Valiente, strategy leader at Rubix by Deloitte, explained that such first-hand experiences are instrumental toward educating people about the greater potential underlying blockchain technology.\n\nDespite her firm\'s focus on distributed ledger applications, she said that understanding the technology in any of its many variations often starts with a walk through its historical origins.\n\nShe told CoinDesk:\n\n""What we\'ve consistently realized is that when we’re starting to educate our clients, that journey typically starts with understanding bitcoin.""\n\n""It\'s very difficult to skip over that part of the historic line and say, \'Oh by the way, now we’re going to talk to you about this really complicated distributed ledger technology\',"" she continued.\n\nWith the bitcoin ATM becoming more popular with clients and employees, Oris Valiente said it was logical for her firm to look for other ways to expand on its support for the digital currency.\n\n""But the question we often received was, \'So, where do I use the bitcoins that I\'ve acquired?\'"" she said, adding:\n\n""The answer is usually online merchants, but there aren\'t as many brick-and-mortar venues. That\'s when the idea came up: \'What about our bistro downstairs?\'""\n\nExpanding appeal\n\nWith this lightbulb lit, Deloitte teamed up with Benchmark Hospitality (which operates Bistro 1858 inside Deloitte’s Toronto complex) and bitcoin processor BitPay to kick off the concept.\n\nThe idea was that users could download a wallet, purchase bitcoin from the ATM and then buy a meal from the bistro – with the end result being that they could see the changes to their balance reflected immediately.\n\nBenchmark initially viewed the opportunity as a chance to cut costs and test out a new technology, but the appeal has expanded much more widely.\n\n""We\'ve had a positive reaction from the bistro staff,"" said Oris Valiente. ""They\'ve just said: \'This is flat out cool.\'""\n\nFor Deloitte, the initiative has served as a means to inform even more people about bitcoin and blockchain, while generating more organic interest in the subject internally.\n\n""We have a lot of our internal employees who are excited to get their first bitcoin wallet, buy their first fraction of a bitcoin and perhaps invite their clients in and have a conversation about what this technology means,"" she said.\n\nOrganic interest\n\nBut Deloitte is quick to concede that rolling out such an endeavor – as straightforward as it may seem – is far from an easy task.\n\nThere were a plethora of financial and technological hurdles to overcome.\n\nThese included determining how Bistro 1858 would handle end-of-shift reconciliations, calculating the implementation costs and deciding which payment provider would be the best fit.\n\nAt the end of the day, Oris Valiente explained that introducing the new payments system was ultimately a change management exercise.\n\nWhile simple in aim, it involved retraining management and front-line staff, along with communicating to all stakeholders why the exercise was being undertaken in the first place.\n\n""I think those conversations, and trying to understand what motivates all of the parties and how we address all of their needs, that was probably the most time-consuming aspect,"" she said.\n\nFuture visions\n\nHowever, she argued that the exercise has been useful in helping to explain that blockchain solutions are similar to other types of enterprise applications: While the nuts and bolts get fundamentally reworked, the experience for the end-user oftentimes remains unchanged.\n\n""The user experience is pretty straightforward; what\'s changed is the complex back-end. That story is actually in parallel to what we often see when we develop enterprise applications,"" she said.\n\nOris Valiente also emphasized that the exercise has been instrumental in helping to facilitate the flow of creative juices internally.\n\n""A lot of the use cases that we’re working on today could not have been possible if it were a small group of people sitting in a board room talking to one another,"" she said, adding:\n\n""For me, the more people we can expose to this technology, the more smart people you have looking at it, the more creative ideas you’ll come up with.""\n\nBistro 1858 image via Deloitte\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In addition, the 100 SMA lines up with the triangle support, adding to its strength as a floor in the event of another pullback. The gap between the moving averages is widening, signaling that bullish pressure is strengthening and that no new crossovers are about to take place yet.\n\nStochastic has been indicating overbought conditions for quite some time, which means that buyers are already feeling exhausted.

RSI is still on the move up, which means that there’s some buying momentum left to push bitcoin price a bit higher.\n\nMarket Events\n\nGeopolitical risks continue to keep bitcoin price supported as investors worry about how global financial markets could react. The attack in Syria and the US military response continue to dominate headlines, keeping market watchers on edge for more attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, liquidity is expected to be thinner as most markets close towards the end of this week for Holy Week celebrations. With that, smaller positions could trigger larger moves, especially if these are headline driven.

The online market already allows users to pay for purchases in multiple cryptocurrencies via an integration with the ShapeShift.io exchange.\n\nWith rising bitcoin fees, Mike Wolf, design lead at OpenBazaar, has proposed supporting multiple cryptocurrencies, noting there are details to be worked out.\n\nRising Bitcoin Fees\n\n“Bitcoin fees are getting high,” Wolf tweeted. “Should @OpenBazaar support multiple cryptocurrencies?” The tweet directed readers to a Youtube video in which he presented an idea for how multiple currencies could layer into the OpenBazaar wallet.\n\n“We have not thought about all of the functional aspects of it yet,” Wolf said in the video. The team is looking for feedback as to whether the concept has value. “Let us know what coins you think are most useful,” he said. “We’ll definitely read through them.”\n\nWolf also posted a survey on Twitter asking people to vote on whether OpenBazaar should support multiple currencies. With 443 votes cast and six days left, 87% wanted to see OpenBazaar accept multiple currencies.\n\n“Relying 100% on bitcoin might not be realistic in the near future,” Wolf said. “From the Open Bazaar perspective, we really want to keep fees as low as possible.”\n\nMultiple Crypto Options\n\nThe merchant payment screen Wolf demonstrated in the video showed multiple currencies to choose from.\n\nHe showed a vendor called Ski Shop that accepts bitcoin, Litecoin and Zcash. In the checkout screen, it also listed Ethereum, Dash and Monero.\n\nWolf also tweeted to ask if any Litecoin developers would be interested in helping him with the integration.\n\nLitecoin Offers Support\n\nCharlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and director of engineering at Coinbase, responded that he would arrange to have a developer work with OpenBazaar on the project.\n\nLee, who noted that Litecoin’s volume is now over $10 million, sees interoperability of different cryptocurrencies as a key to lowering transaction costs.\n\nLee has advocated SegWit to activate on both bitcoin and Litecoin. He noted in an article on the SegWit website that the release candidate code is tagged and binaries are near release.\n\nSegWit’s main benefit is transaction malleability, Lee said. Lightning Network could be built atop Litecoin.\n\nAt 1MB block size, Lightning Network and SegWit on bitcoin can service 500 million users, he noted.\n\nAlso read; OpenBazaar now accepts altcoins with ShapeShift integration\n\nHow Interoperability Lowers Fees\n\nBecause the bitcoin transaction fee on Lightning Networks will be higher than the Litecoin transaction fee, it could make economic sense for a Lightning Network transaction to go via Litecoin and then back to bitcoin to get the lower transaction rate. Lightning Network makes this possible because it allows the two networks to be interoperable.\n\nLee said he did not know if this use case will be economical, but no one will know until both Lightning Networks are up and running.\n\n“My bet is that the convenience and the cheaper tolls on Litecoin highway will convince cars to cross over and use Litecoin,” Lee wrote.\n\nAnother benefit is cross-chain transactions via Lightning Network. Two parties can trade BTC and LTC immediately and without risk. Efficient decentralized exchanges are now possible.\n\nShould a merchant accept only BTC, a buyer who only has LTC can now pay LTC and exchange the currencies instantly through a Lightning Network exchange node and send BTC to the merchant.\n\nWith SegWit and bitcoin’s current block scaling deadlock, Lee sees the potential for Litecoin to help bitcoin break through this deadlock.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
04/10/2017,"['Remember that Internet of Things botnet? The one known for temporarily shutting down a number of the world\'s largest websites last autumn?\n\nWell, a newer version has been detected, but as well as being able to issue DDoS attacks and the like, it\'s equipped to mine bitcoin.\n\nIn the digital age, it\'s possible for hackers to infect and take control of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices, say, toasters, cameras or other web-connected devices. They can then bundle them together into a botnet, using their combined capacity to shoot spam at websites or internet structures, slowing them down or sending them offline.\n\nThat\'s what happened in a series of attacks in the fall, using the malware dubbed Mirai.\n\nThe software was open-sourced soon after – much to the dismay of security engineers – and, since then, different strains iterating on the first version of the botnet have cropped up with added abilities.\n\nOne strain, known as ELF Linux/Mirai, has now been detected mining bitcoin for a few days, according to research from IBM X-Force, the Big Blue\'s cybersecurity research wing. It seems some unknown hacker (or hackers) is experimenting with using the power accumulated from IoT devices to mine the digital currency and possibly make some cash.\n\nThis could be an omen for future IoT botnet use cases, argued Dave McMillen, IBM Managed Security Services senior threat researcher and author of the report.\n\nMcMillen told CoinDesk:\n\n""This ELF/Mirai variant could be appealing to others in the future due to the potentially large volume of devices that could be involved.""\n\nThe researcher noted, however, that, the botnet didn\'t appear to successfully mine any bitcoin. The security team see it more like a peek at a down-the-road possibility.\n\nMining \'blip\'\n\nSo, what happened, and how did IBM spot the mining component of the botnet?\n\nMcMillen explained, saying:\n\n""We detected a spike in command injection activity in our IBM X-Force monitored client environment data that prompted deeper investigation.""\n\nThe security team saw traffic related to an ELF 64-bit binary file., which the report describes as beginning as a ""blip"", which grew in volume by 50%, but had fizzled out by day eight.\n\nThe team ""dissected"" the binary to discover that the Linux version of the malware is similar to the more typical Windows version.\n\n""It was detected as a slave miner by multiple tools, however we are still investigating other properties of the variant,"" McMillen added.\n\nWhile there are now many variants of the botnet, ELF Linux/Mirai has extra abilities in that it can execute \'SQL injection\' (a notorious way to take control of databases) and execute so called \'brute force\' attacks.\n\nBut, the Linux version has an extra add-on – the bitcoin miner component (which you can see online here).\n\nFuture threat?\n\nIBM speculates in the report that the botnet creators may be looking for a way to make bitcoin mining with compromised IoT devices a lucrative venture.\n\n""Realizing the power of Mirai to infect thousands of machines at a time, there is a possibility that the bitcoin miners could work together in tandem as one large miner consortium. We haven\'t yet determined that capability, but found it to be an interesting yet concerning possibility,"" a blog post explains, adding:\n\n""One scenario could be that while the Mirai bots are idle and awaiting further instructions, they could be leveraged to go into mining mode.""\n\nAlthough this idea is admittedly speculative, the report points to the fact that bitcoin has been used for other cybercrimes – such with ransomware, which encrypts all of a user\'s computer data with a demand for payment – because it\'s decentralized and is perceived as a more privacy-enhancing currency.\n\nThe tech can have more beneficial uses cases, though. For example, one company recently revealed aims to build a bitcoin botnet to help secure IoT devices, combining the cryptocurrency with technology also has the potential for less beneficial online activities.\n\nSimple defense\n\nSo, how can users protect their internet-connected toasters from being enlisted as a bitcoin mining slave?\n\nThe Mirai malware exploits a surprisingly simple attack vector.\n\nThe problem is that many IoT devices come with pre-installed passwords. And, since many users never change them, all an attacker needs to do is find the default password to \'hack\' into the devices.\n\nMcMillen’s advice is for users to change those passwords. Though, he said that he hopes that IoT companies are beginning to tackle the problem, too.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Manufacturers could be looking for ways to manage these credentials more securely, perhaps by prompting a forced change or randomizing the default logins.""\n\nArmy computer via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The central bank is developing a joint position together with the government on digital currencies, according to its press service.\n\n“The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain,” Moiseev said. “If there’s a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.”\n\nWhile bitcoin isn’t regulated by any government, it has come under increasing scrutiny in some countries as a way to shelter assets from the authorities or launder ill-gotten gains. In China, which has occupied a central role in trading and mining bitcoin in recent years, the three largest exchanges imposed a moratorium on all coin withdrawals in March as the central bank issued new guidelines on their use.\n\nTracking cryptocurrencies could become the latest tool enlisted in the Bank of Russia’s battle against money laundering, which has seen hundreds of lenders lose their licenses over the last three years. The plan to legalize and monitor bitcoin is taking shape as traditional schemes are drying up, with dubious operations such as fake trades and loans used to move money abroad dropping by half to $771 million last year, according to central bank data.\n\nBank of Russia Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said in February that the authorities would decide if digital currencies can be considered as asset, cash or security by mid-2017.\n\nInitially, cryptocurrencies in Russia are most likely to be bought via bank accounts in order to make online purchases, with some also acquired as a speculative investment, Alfa-Bank Vice President Oleg Legostev said in comments emailed by the lender’s press service.\n\nBitcoin rose 1.1 percent to $1,215.85 at 10:09 a.m. in New York on Tuesday. It has gained 28 percent since the start of the year.\n\nForeign banks have sometimes been swept up in investigations of Russian schemes. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc received information requests from the U.K. in March in relation to an alleged money laundering ring that moved money through Moldova and Latvia between 2010 and 2014.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG in January was fined $629 million by U.K. and U.S. authorities for compliance failures that saw the bank help wealthy Russians move about $10 billion abroad using transactions that may have covered up financial crime.\n\nCrime, corruption, and tax evasion spawned at least $211.5 billion in illicit Russian outflows between 1994 and 2011, with illegal transfers reaching $552.9 billion, according to Washington-based Global Financial Integrity.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was the first digital currency to achieve a measure of popularity, thanks to its use of blockchain, an online ledger that tracks and verifies every time the virtual money is used. It’s faced some criticism from those who say the software it relies on is too rigid to gain widespread acceptance, with hipper investors moving on to the more sophisticated record book used by Ethereum.\n\n— With assistance by Anna Baraulina', 'Hold on, investors – you haven’t seen anything yet.\n\nAccording to Peter Smith, Blockchain CEO/co-founder, and Jeremy Liew, Snapchat’s first investor, bitcoin’s price could hit $500,000 by 2030. The pair made their case for this projection to Business Insider.\n\nThere are several factors behind this projection.\n\nFactors To Consider\n\nRemittance transfers are one reason. Bitcoin transfers to foreign countries have nearly doubled in the past 15 years and account for 0.75% of GDP, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe duo claim bitcoin-based remittances will increase sharply as awareness builds.\n\nPolitical uncertainty in the U.S., the U.K. and developing nations is another factor. As geopolitical risks increase, rising bitcoin awareness combined with ease of transport and continued strong market performance will boost consumer and investor interest in bitcoin.\n\nThe growth of mobile transactions is another factor. Non-cash transactions will jump from 15% to 30% over the next decade as smartphone use increases. The total number of smartphone users is expected to reach 1 billion by 2020.\n\nGMSA, a global organization representing mobile phone operators, predicts 90% of new users will be from developing nations. Nearly everyone will be able to have a bank in their pocket. Bitcoin could account for half of these transactions.\n\nModel Drivers For The Projection\n\nSmith and Liew based their projection on the following model drivers.\n\nA $1,000 bitcoin price in 2017. The bitcoin user network will grow 61 times through 2030. A population of bitcoin users comprising 5% of the world’s population in 2030 will drive the price to $500,000 in 2030. From 2013 to 2017, the network grew from 120,000 users to 6.5 million users, nearly a 54-fold gain. Such growth would produce 400 million users in 2030. The average bitcoin value per user will hit $25,000. When institutional investors cash in their bitcoins, bitcoin-based ETFs and trading by sophisticated investors will increase, pushing the average value to $25,000. With a current market cap of $17.4 billion and 6.5 million users, the average user now holds $2,515 of bitcoin. The 2030 market cap is based on the number of bitcoin holders multiplied by the average held bitcoin value. The cryptocurrency’s 2030 supply will be about 20 million. The 2030 price and user count will total $500,000 and 400 million, respectively. The price is determined by taking the $10 trillion market cap and dividing it by 20 million bitcoins, the fixed supply.\n\nAlso read: Researcher sees major gains ahead for bitcoin, silver and gold\n\nNothing’s Definite\n\nThe projections are not definite, considering things could go wrong. There has been a lot of negative news about bitcoin recently.\n\nChina, where most bitcoin trading takes place, has cracked down on trading. The three largest bitcoin exchanges have announced a 0.2% fee on all transactions, as well as blocking withdrawals from trading accounts.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected two bitcoin ETFs. Another proposed ETF is not expected to be approved.\n\nSmith, however, thinks bitcoin is in its early stages. He said the SEC ruling was not a surprise. Winning such approval could take a long time.\n\nMeanwhile, regulatory approval has occurred elsewhere. Bitcoin became legal payment in Japan on April 1.\n\nAnother obstacle is the hard fork, which could cause a split into two bitcoins, regular bitcoin and Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nSmith is not concerned about the hard fork since there are strong economic incentives to prevent it. He noted that the bitcoin blockchain has operated for more than seven years with no downtime, which no other back-end system operating at the same scale has accomplished.\n\nWhile the price of bitcoin has been volatile compared to traditional currencies, it has always rallied. After rising 20% in the first week of 2017, it crashed 35% when China cracked down on trading. Since, then, it has recovered those losses and is up 25% for the year.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Reports are emerging that an agent for an Indian law enforcement agency has been arrested for stealing bitcoins tied to a drug bust.\n\nAccording to the Times of India, an officer for the Indian Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is alleged to helped steal more than 400 bitcoins originally confiscated during a 2015 seizure. Specifically, investigator Satyendra Kumar Singh is said to have been accused of unfreezing those funds at the behest of one of those arrested.\n\nThe media source claimed that it was the first such case in India – though the cryptocurrency world is no stranger to rogue agents siphoning bitcoins obtained during criminal investigations.\n\nThe NCB reportedly alleged that Singh consulted with Deepak Manguikya, one of the accused drug dealers, after he was released on bail in 2016. In July 2016, Singh then helped Manguikya forge documents which would allow for the unfreezing of the accounts where the bitcoins were stored. After being unfrozen, the accounts were emptied and liquidated with Singh allegedly receiving 50% of the proceeds.\n\nOfficials noticed the missing coins while working on a report regarding the status of the seized funds. Subsequently, the NCB moved to suspend and arrest Singh, and an investigation into his role in the heist is said to be ongoing.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A staunch Bitcoin Unlimited supporter, Wu last week faced fresh accusations he had exploited a Bitcoin vulnerability to save costs using his mining hardware.\n\nBoth Wu and Bitmain formally denied the claims, the former stating “someone made a probability math wrong [sic].”\n\nRunning in tandem with the Bitmain argument is a private spat between Wu and former BTCC COO Samson Mow over several topics. Wu labeled Mow a “liar” on at least two occasions, while Mow most recently stated Wu had “overplayed his hand and is losing on multiple fronts.”\n\nJihan has overplayed his hand and is losing on multiple fronts. A #UASF #SegWit activation on $LTC looks increasingly likely. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) April 9, 2017\n\nThe last comment was in relation to scaling’s latest scandal, this time involving Litecoin’s implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit).\n\nCharlie Lee, Litecoin’s creator, retweeted accusations from user-activated soft fork supporter shaolinfry on Monday that Wu was behind a deliberate attempt by miners to block the altcoin from activating SegWit.', 'In Southeast Asia, Bitcoin is gaining traction as a genuine store of value as investors in the region are viewing the digital currency as an attractive investment opportunity. Among the Bitcoin companies located there, Luno (formerly BitX) and Bitcoin Indonesia have watched this growth with interest.\n\n\n\nHeadquartered in Singapore, Luno allows customers to buy, sell and store the digital currency. It operates in several countries around the world including the U.K., South Africa and Nigeria. In Southeast Asia, Luno has operations in Malaysia, one of its largest markets, as well as in Indonesia, where activity has been growing consistently.\n\n“From our perspective, Bitcoin is slowly gaining mainstream adoption in Southeast Asia. We see this every day in the numbers we track in terms of signups, transaction volumes, etc,” Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia Pacific at Luno, told Bitcoin Magazine. “The volatility of the price makes it particularly attractive for traders. People who have bought Bitcoin as a store of value have been quite happy with the performance of the asset [as] it has been one of the best performing assets globally over the past year.”\n\nBut new trends are beginning to emerge as well, he said, noting the growing use of Bitcoin as a payment mechanism. “Cross-border e-commerce is one of the most popular use cases here since credit card penetration is quite low in the emerging markets and using bitcoin avoids the whole issue of charge-backs for a merchant,” Ayyar said.\n\nHe also mentioned that institutional interest has been on the rise, with high-net-worth individuals and private funds now looking to allocate a percentage of their funds to the asset class. He expects to see this trend grow over the coming months and years.\n\nBali-based Bitcoin Indonesia has also witnessed the public’s growing appetite for the digital currency. The exchange platform has seen its daily transaction volume reach up to $1.48 million (Rp 20 billion). Today, it serves over 200,000 users, up from 80,000 at the end of 2015.\n\nAccording Suasti Atmastuti Astaman, business development manager at Bitcoin Indonesia, the positive trend is due to the fact that Bitcoin has successfully gained global trust. “At present, as more and more countries have relaxed their stances on digital currency, including the United States, China and Russia, more and more people are putting their trust in it,” he told the Jakarta Post in a recent interview.\n\nUnclear Regulations\n\nWhile some jurisdictions have moved forward and established clear rulings on digital currencies, regulators in Southeast Asia have remained quiet on the subject.\n\nAccording to Dante Fuentes, chief compliance officer at Security Bank Corporation in the Philippines, policymakers tend to move prudently because, from their perspective, digital currency is still very new.\n\n“At Security Bank, for any virtual currency related companies, we ensure that the account is not used for virtual currency trading activities,” Fuentes told IQPC Singapore. “Increasingly, we want to know that companies dealing in virtual currency are performing some kind of KYC to avoid tainted funds, but this has yet to be firmly put in place.”\n\nBut for Ayyar, unclear regulation is what’s been hampering Bitcoin adoption in the region, often discouraging banks from conducting business with Bitcoin companies. In November last year, Maybank closed two of Coinbox’s corporate accounts without warning or notice. Kuala Lumpur–based Coinbox operates a bitcoin trading platform.\n\n“The issue is that traditional criminal activity that takes place with fiat currency can also be performed with virtual currency. Since the banks are unable to monitor these transactions, it is a new platform for criminals to continue the same money-laundering activities and scams that they were performing before,” Fuentes said.\n\nLuno, which is aiming to become the largest bitcoin wallet and exchange across Southeast Asia, hopes to see regulators in the region communicate more about their position on digital currencies in the near future. In the meantime, the company is working with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to test its technology for cross-border money transfers.\n\nAyyar wasn’t able to provide specific details on the matter but said that the tests are going well and that the company has made good progress both in terms of cost and speed.\n\nLuno was selected to join the FCA’s regulatory sandbox in November 2016 alongside several other Bitcoin and blockchain startups, including SETL, Epiphyte and Nivaura.', 'OKCoin, one of China’s so-called ‘Big Three’ bitcoin exchanges, has published new guidelines to adhere to AML requirements by regulators and authorities.\n\nThe announcement, published on its China-based and international websites, comes amid the ongoing withdrawal freeze of bitcoin and Litecoin enforced by Chinese exchanges due to regulatory pressure from the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank.\n\nThe guidelines read nearly identical for Chinese and international users.\n\nRoughly translated, the Chinese announcement begins:\n\nConsidering from the perspectives of national Anti-Money Laundering regulations and risk control, we have established a few suggestions and guidelines for you. These are purely for the purpose of boosting your trading experience and account security. They will not affect your funds and trades.\n\nMore specifically, the bitcoin exchange informs users that they could be subject to “enhanced due diligence’ once they reach a certain level of account balance. For international users, this stands at $10,000 over a lifetime USD deposit while no specifications are revealed for Chinese users.\n\nOKCoin underlines video verification as an example of ‘enhanced due diligence’ methods.\n\n‘Level 2 verification will require a copy of your passport, a copy of your ID /driving license, and additionally, a copy of your proof of residential address (e.g. bank statement, utility bill) issued within 3 months when needed,’ reads an excerpt from the new KYC procedures, asking customers to be prepared with the above-mentioned paperwork in front of a camera.\n\n‘Video verification will require a device that has video recording function and access to the internet (e.g. cellphone, laptop, tablet). You will be required to show your legal documents in front of the camera,’ the notice added.\n\nThe other notable guideline informs users that single-signature wallet addresses created before today, starting with “1” and “L” for Bitcoin and Litecoin respectively, will stop functioning on April 23, 2017. Multi-signature addresses will not be affected.\n\nNearly 2 months ago to the day, OKCoin paused bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals to comply with ‘relevant national AML, payment and settlement of foreign exchange management and other financial laws and regulations.’ The withdrawal freeze, initially estimated to last a month, sent bitcoin prices crashing. The announcement followed January reports from China that pointed to a PBOC-led investigation into bitcoin exchanges finding ‘irregularities’.\n\nWhile withdrawals were expected to resume in March, Chinese exchanges confirmed their postponement, only to be resumed after regulatory approval. After today’s announcement, Chinese users’ extended wait to retrieve their bitcoin and litecoin balances could be nearing its end.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'We have all seen photos of large data centers hosting mining hardware built from specialized ASICs designed to solve the Bitcoin proof-of-work (a double SHA256 hash.) These data centers tend to be located in places with inexpensive electricity, often where hydroelectricity is plentiful, like Washington State in the U.S. But how much electricity is consumed by these miners? Knowing this helps us to better understand the economics and financial opportunities of Bitcoin mining. Previous estimates have not been very accurate, often making simplistic assumptions. So I decided to conduct the most exhaustive research on this topic that I could. All sources used in this research are listed in my original blog post.\n\n\n\nI started by drawing a chart juxtaposing the Bitcoin hash rate with the market availability of mining ASICs and their energy efficiency. This allows calculating with certainty the lower and upper bounds for the global electricity consumption of miners (which is not wasteful in my opinion.)\n\n\n\n\n\nI split the timeline in 10 phases representing the releases and discontinuances of mining ASICs.\n\nI reached out to some Bitcoin ASIC manufacturers when doing this market research. Canaan was very open and transparent (thank you!) and gave me one additional extremely useful data point: They manufactured a total of 191 PH/s of A3218 ASICs.\n\nDetermining the upper bound for the electricity consumption is then easily done by making two worst-case assumptions. Firstly we assume that 100% of the mining power added during each phase came from the least efficient hardware available at that time that is still mining profitably. Secondly we assume none of this mining power, some of it being barely profitable, was ever upgraded to more efficient hardware.\n\nHardware that is no longer profitable has obviously been retired. As of February 26, 2017 (difficulty = 441e9, 1 BTC = 1180 USD, and assuming $0.05/kWh — half the worldwide average electricity cost) an ASIC is profitable if its efficiency is better than 0.56 J/GH:\n\n1e9*3600 (hashes per hour of 1 GH/s) / (2^32 * 441e9 (difficulty)) * 12.5 (BTC reward per block) * 1180 (USD per BTC) / 0.05 ($/kWh) * 1000 (Wh/kWh) = 0.56 J/GH\n\nSo 3 ASICs in the chart are no longer profitable: Neptune, RockerBox, and A3222.\n\nAlso, most of the hardware deployed during phase 0—CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, first-generation ASICs—has not been profitable for a long time, so we make the assumption these miners who deployed during this phase have since then upgraded to the least efficient ASIC available at the end of phase 0 that is still profitable: BM1384.\n\nFurthermore, despite A3218 being the least efficient in phases 5-8 we can only assume 191 PH/s of it were deployed, and the rest of the hash rate came from the second least efficient ASIC: BM1385 (phase 6), Bitfury 28nm (phase 7), or BF8162C16 (phase 8).\n\nTo summarize all this, the upper bound estimate leads to the following breakdown of hardware deployments:\n\nPhase 0: 290 PH/s @ 0.51 J/GH (BM1384)3 Phases 1-3: 150 PH/s @ 0.51 J/GH (BM1384) Phase 4: 40 PH/s @ 0.25 J/GH (BM1385) Phase 5: 191 PH/s @ 0.29 J/GH (A3218) + 159 PH/s @ 0.25 J/GH (BM1385) Phase 6: 670 PH/s @ 0.25 J/GH (BM1385) Phase 7: 350 PH/s @ 0.20 J/GH (Bitfury 28nm) Phase 8: 150 PH/s @ 0.13 J/GH (BF8162C16) Phase 9: 1250 PH/s @ 0.15 J/GH (A3212) Average weighted by PH/s: 0.238 J/GH\n\nTherefore the upper bound electricity consumption of the network at 3250 PH/s assuming the worst-case scenario of miners deploying the least efficient hardware of their time (0.238 J/GH in average) is 774 MW or 6.78 TWh/year.\n\nNow, what about a lower bound estimate? We start with a few observations about the latest 4 most efficient ASICs:\n\nBitfury BF8162C16’s efficiency can be as low as 0.06 J/GH. But the clock and voltage configuration can be set to favor speed over energy efficiency. All known third party BF8162C16-based miner designs favor speed at 0.13 J/GH (1, 2). Bitfury’s own private data centers also favor speed with their immersion cooling technology (1, 2, 3). The company once advertised the BlockBox container achieved 0.13 J/GH (2 MW for 16 PH/s), presumably close to the efficiency achieved by their data centers. But we want to calculate a lower bound, so let’s assume the average BF8162C16 deployed in the wild operates at 0.10 J/GH.\n\nKnCMiner Solar is exclusively deployed in their private data centers and achieves an efficiency of 0.07 J/GH.\n\nBitmain BM1387’s efficiency is 0.10 J/GH.\n\nCanaan A3212’s efficiency is 0.15 J/GH.\n\nAs to market share, we know KnCMiner declared bankruptcy and was later acquired by GoGreenLight. They currently account for 0.3% of the global hash rate… a rounding error we can ignore.\n\nTherefore the lower bound electricity consumption of the network at 3250 PH/s assuming the best-case scenario of 100% of miners currently running one of the latest 3 most efficient ASICs (at best 0.10 J/GH) is 325 MW or 2.85 TWh/year.\n\nCan we do better than merely calculating lower and upper bounds? I think so, but with the exception of Canaan, other mining hardware manufacturers tend to be secretive about their market share, so anything below are just educated guesses.\n\nVirtually all of the 1750 PH/s added after June 2016 came from BF8162C16, BM1387, and A3212, with the latter having the smallest market share. So the average efficiency of this added hash rate is likely around 0.11-0.13 J/GH. This represents 190-230 MW.\n\nI would further venture that out of the 1500 PH/s existing as of June 2016, perhaps half was upgraded to BF8162C16/BM1387/A3212, while the other half remains a mixture of BM1385 and A3218. This represent 750 PH/s at 0.11-0.13 J/GH, and 750 PH/s at 0.26-0.28 J/GH, or a total of 280-310 MW.\n\nI believe an insignificant proportion of the hash rate (less than 5%?) comes from all other generations of ASICs. Bitfury BF864C55 and 28nm deployments were upgraded to BF8162C16. KnCMiner/GoGreenLight represents 0.3%. BM1384 is close to being unprofitable. RockerBox, A3222, Neptune have long been unprofitable.\n\nTherefore my best educated guess for the electricity consumption of the network at 3250 PH/s adds up to 470-540 MW or 4.12-4.73 TWh/year.\n\nEconomics of Mining\n\nGiven the apparent high energy-efficiency, hence relatively small percentage of mining income that one needs to spend on electricity to cover the operating costs of an ASIC miner, it may seem that mining is an extremely profitable risk-free venture, right?\n\nNot necessarily. Though mining can be quite profitable, in reality it depends mostly on (1) luck about when BTC gains in value and (2) timing of how early a given model of mining machine is put online (compared to other competing miners deploying the same machines.) I say this as founder of mining ASIC integrator TAV, as an investor who deployed over time $250k+ of GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, and as someone who once drove 2000+ miles to transport his GPU farm to East Wenatchee, Washington State in 2011 in order to exploit the nation’s cheapest electricity at $0.021/kWh— Yes, it was worth it!\n\nTo demonstrate the real-world profitability of a miner, I modeled the income and costs generated by an Antminer S5 batch #1 ($418, 590 W, 1155 GH/s) starting from its release date on 27 December 2014, assuming mined bitcoins are sold on a daily basis at the Coindesk BPI, and assuming $0.05/kWh. See income-antminer-s5.csv\n\nThe CSV file shows that on its first day an S5 mined 0.01472124 BTC = $4.64, cost $0.71 in electricity, therefore generated $3.93 of income (15% of mining income is spent on electricity.)\n\nThe income decreased over time. 1 year and 9 months later, on October 8 2016, electricity costs surpassed income for the first time. By that date the total income was $1021. So a miner who had invested $418 into an S5 would have turned it into $1021, a 2.4× gain. So yes, mining was quite profitable. (However another investor who on 27 December 2014 bought $418 worth of bitcoins would be worth $818 on 8 October 2016, a 2.0× gain. It could be argued that a large reason why mining was profitable came simply from BTC gaining value.)\n\nSome interesting observations:\n\nBy 15 January 2016 84% of the lifetime income of the S5 had been generated; at this point 39% of the daily income ($0.71 out of $1.84) was being spent on electricity.\n\nBy 15 July 2016 99% of the lifetime income of the S5 had been generated; at this point 78% of the daily income ($0.71 out of $0.90) was being spent on electricity, and in total $403 has been spent on electricity which is still slightly less than the cost of the hardware at $418.\n\nThe S5 started with electricity costs at 15%, generated a good chunk of its income by 39%, and essentially became worthless beyond 78%.\n\nSummary\n\nWe can calculate the upper bound for the global electricity consumption of Bitcoin miners by assuming they deploy the least efficient hardware of their time and never upgrade it. As to the lower bound it can be calculated by assuming everyone has upgraded to the most efficient hardware. The table below summarizes the electricity consumption of miners, their energy efficiency, annual electrical costs (assuming $0.05/kWh), and percentage of the world’s energy consumption (9 425 Mtoe, or 109 613 TWh, or 12.51 TW, according to IEA statistics for year 2014,) with all numbers calculated as of February 26, 2017:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may sound like a lot of electricity but when we considering the big picture, I believe Bitcoin mining is not wasteful. Also an interesting comparison to make is that according to a 2008 study from the United States Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) these figures are comparable to or less than the annual electricity consumption of decorative Christmas lights in the country (6.63 TWh/year.)\n\nLastly, when modeling the costs and revenues of a miner over its entire life such as the Antminer S5, we find out that the hardware cost is as high as, if not higher than, its lifetime electricity cost. Therefore a miner’s business plan should not look at the electricity costs alone, and cannot trivialize hardware costs when calculating expected profitability.\n\nThis is a guest post by Marc Bevand.

But one bitcoin expert says that\'s bogus.\n\nThe Turkish Crime Family grabbed headlines last month by claiming they had the stolen login credentials for more than 700 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com accounts. They demanded increasing ransoms from Apple while threatening to wipe the data from devices connected to the affected accounts if it did not.\n\nOn Friday, the hackers tweeted that they had been paid US$480,000 in bitcoin. As proof, the group posted a link showing a transaction on Blockchain.info, a popular bitcoin wallet.\n\n“We were told by our negotiator that we have come to a final agreement with Apple,” the hacking group tweeted prior to receiving the payment.\n\nHowever, the hackers actually tweeted out a transaction to an ""internal treasury operation at a bitcoin exchange,"" according to Jonathan Levin, co-founder at Chainalysis, a provider of anti-money laundering software for bitcoin.\n\n""We have positively identified that the inputs and outputs of that transaction are controlled by a single bitcoin exchange,"" Levin said in an email.

If a careless or malicious admin in a carrier or ISP network sends incorrect BGP route information to the Internet, they can black-hole significant chunks of 'net traffic.\n\nIn this paper at arXiv, explained at this ETH Website, Zohar and his collaborators from ETH, Maria Apostolaki and Laurent Vanbever, show off two ways BGP can attack Bitcoin: a partition attack, and a delay attack.\n\nThe upside of both of these attacks is that they need an insider, because they happen at the ISP level.\n\nThey are, however, serious attacks.\n\nIn the partition attack, if an ISP is the only route between significant chunks of the Bitcoin network, a blackhole would stop the two sides communicating with each other.\n\nSince the two “islands” will keep going – processing transactions, and mining new Bitcoin. When the “evil ISP” connects the islands together again, they have no option but to discard mined Bitcoins, transactions, and mining revenue.\n\nThe delay attack is nastier, in a way, because unlike the partitioning attack, the researchers say it's undetectable.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nStep 0: Nodes A and B advertise the same block to the victim, node C.\n\nStep 1: Node C requests the block via a GETDATA from node A. The attacker changes the content of the GETDATA such that it triggers the delivery of an older block from node A.\n\nStep 2: The older block is delivered.\n\nStep 3: Shortly before 20 minutes after the original block request made by node C, the attacker triggers its delivery by modifying another GETDATA message originated by C.\n\nStep 4: The block is delivered just before the 20 minutes timeout. The victim does not disconnect from node A.\n\nThe delay attack impacts merchants by making them susceptible to double-spending attacks; miners waste their processing power; and ordinary nodes can't propagate the latest version of the blockchain.\n\nHow did we get to this point?\n\nPart of the problem is that Bitcoin's nodes have tended to gather together at relatively few ISPs: thirteen in all host about 30 percent of the whole Bitcoin network; and 60 percent of Bitcoin traffic is visible to just three ISPs.\n\nThe researchers say BGP hijacking (which is usually but not always inadvertent) already affects as many as 100 Bitcoin nodes a month. November 2015 saw a peak in this: around 8 percent of the whole Bitcoin network (447 nodes) suffered a traffic hijack in that month.\n\nThe work is to be presented at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2017 in May, in San Jose. The trio also say they'll release code on GitHub offering a prototype of the delay attack. ®""]"
04/11/2017,"['Pretty soon, pension funds and other institutional traders will be able to buy and sell gold on a platform inspired by the digital currency bitcoin.\n\nU.S. futures and options exchange CME Group announced on Tuesday that it is in the final stages of testing a venue for trading spot gold that’s based on the blockchain, the pioneering distributed-ledger technology that powers the bitcoin network.\n\nCME built the platform in partnership with the U.K. Royal Mint, which has helped supply $1 billion in gold bullion to back transactions executed on the network. Blockchain companies AlphaPoint and BitGo helped develop the software and trading platform.\n\nThe platform isn’t expected to launch until later this year, according to news releases from the CME Group, AlphaPoint and BitGo.\n\nPhysical gold will be represented on the platform by tokens called RMGs—short for Royal Mint Gold. The platform is the first digital gold product targeted at institutional investors, and its also the first to work with a government entity, according to the releases.\n\nTrading gold in the spot market is a cumbersome process that involves moving quantities of the lustrous metal from place to place. The market is also extremely fragmented, with individual dealers free to offer their own prices.\n\nCME, through its Comex subsidiary, is the largest trading venue for gold futures contracts in North America. A futures contract is a promise to deliver or receive a commodity, asset or currency at a set price at a mutually agreed-upon future date.\n\nPresently, investors who’d like to gain exposure to gold can either purchase futures US:GCM7 contracts or shares in an exchange-traded fund like the SPDR Gold GLD, -0.20%\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the concept, a blockchain is a distributed, cryptographically-protected ledger that maintains an immutable record of every transaction executed on the network. It was first introduced to the world as the system that undergirds the pioneering digital currency bitcoin.', 'Earlier this year, I declared the Internet of Things had officially hit peak stupid, courtesy of a new smart toaster being shown at CES. I should have known better. What’s even more useless than a smart toaster? A smart toaster that’s been hacked to mine Bitcoin.\n\nIt’s a concept as incomprehensible as it is stupid. Seven years ago, mining Bitcoins on CPUs was Totally A Thing people did. Six years ago, GPUs like AMD’s HD 5000 series were tearing up the hash charts. Four to five years ago, you could still earn some money mining on GPUs, but the specter of custom-built ASICs was rising, and those offer performance benefits no GPU could compete with.\n\nAccording to IBM’s X-Force initiative, there was a brief spike in a specific variant of Mirai that carries a cryptocurrency mining payload, possibly deployed as a proof-of-concept solution. Here’s how X-Force describes the Bitcoin-mining version:\n\nWhat we found when we dissected the Mirai sample was pretty much the same Mirai functionality ported over from the Windows version with a focus on attacking Linux machines running BusyBox. This software provides several stripped-down Unix tools in a single executable file and digital video recording (DVR) servers. BusyBox utilizes Telnet, which is targeted with a dictionary attack brute-force tool contained in the Mirai malware. The DVR servers are targeted because many of them use default Telnet credentials. The Telnet protocol is an attacker’s gateway to compromising IoT devices. Aside from DVRs, many embedded system applications in IoT devices, such as routers, VoIP phones, televisions, industrial control systems and others, leverage Telnet’s remote-access capabilities.\n\nIBM’s X-Force theorizes that this new approach might have been an attempt to monetize Bitcoin mining by spreading the workload out to dozens, even thousands or tens of thousands of IoT products. In principle, yes, this could work. In practice… well. It probably wouldn’t.\n\nWhat’s the hash rate on a microcontroller?\n\nOver the last few years, people have made something of a game out of mining Bitcoins on unusual bits of hardware. We’ve seen Bitcoin mined via pen-and-paper, and on an ancient IBM 1401. But there’s something about trying to mine BTC on a toaster, wireless light bulb, dildo camera, baby monitor, wine bottle, and/or humidifier that’s particularly pathetic. For one thing, the CPU power packed into this equipment isn’t just “less” than you’d get off an Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/ 7 — it’s dramatically less. A single-core Cortex-A8 running at 800MHz – 1GHz would be terrible compared with even a low-end CPU (the Bitcoin article on this topic suggests a hash rate of 0.12 – 0.2MHash/s for the Cortex-A8 and 0.57 for the Cortex A9). Imagine trying this with a Cortex-M3 or M4-class processor, which offer significantly less performance than their Cortex counterparts.\n\nNow, add the fact that a Cortex-A8 is still a high-end CPU by the standards of a lot of embedded products. You’re not going to get much call for an ARM-optimized Bitcoin client capable of toasting and hashing. Whatever bright bulb tried to create this solution will find himself painstakingly writing a lot of hand-tuned code to execute BTC operations “optimally” on ancient hardware.\n\nWe suspect the reason IBM saw a steep drop-off in Mirai’s BTC client is because it’s just too damn hard to get Bitcoins out of your microwave. Best to let the Internet of Things focus on what it does best — destroying perfectly useful products, stuffing landfills with insane amounts of plastic garbage, and making no one’s life better, ever. Oh yeah — and that whole “crash the Internet at will with an army of bots” shtick. It does that pretty well, too.', 'The Russian government is reportedly looking to recognize bitcoin as a kind of financial instrument in 2018.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, senior Russian officials including Deputy Minister of Finance Alexey Moiseev and representatives from the Bank of Russia (the country’s central bank) are developing a position on bitcoin and digital currencies as part of a bid to cut money laundering risks.\n\nMoiseev reportedly indicated that the government wants access to information about transaction parties, and that services in Russia handling digital currency payments would be required to collect and submit that data.\n\nHe told the news source:\n\n""The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain. If there’s a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.""\n\nWhile Russia’s final position remains to be seen, past developments have suggested a move toward a softer stance on the technology.\n\nBack in 2015, the government initially proposed steep fines on the use or creation of digital currencies. Those proposed penalties were later beefed up in an amended draft later the same year.\n\nHowever, last August, officials reportedly backed away from a more punitive approach soon after Moiseev himself indicated that Russia could recognize bitcoin as a kind of foreign currency.\n\nRussian Duma image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Even supporters admit there isn\'t hard evidence, and many others are skeptical.\n\nDespite this, many in the community think there\'s enough circumstantial evidence to back it up, and a grassroots movement is growing in the hopes of pushing through the change that miners are now being accused of blocking.\n\nNormally, miners are the ones that are tasked with pushing through such a fix. But because of this roadblock, some in the bitcoin community are calling for a different (more experimental, yet older) method of making a change to bitcoin based on support of the so-called ""economic majority"", instead of miner support.\n\nThe change is known as a ""user-activated soft fork"", or a UASF.\n\nCoinkite CEO and co-founder Rodolfo Novak, an advocate for the nascent movement, said it aims to correct perceived inequities that have so far dominated the years-long scaling discussion.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Miners trying to centralize bitcoin is an unacceptable thing. It goes against what bitcoin is supposed to be. This UASF is really like saying, \'No, we control bitcoin, not you.\'""\n\nAnd, support appears to be growing. There\'s a website and a Twitter. There are UASF hats.\n\nThough the code isn\'t safe to run yet, some volunteers running nodes are now flagging support with their nodes. Volunteers who run nodes can signal their support by adding a line to their node configuration file.\n\nFlagging support\n\nSince the allegations were made last Wednesday, node support for the change has grown to 4.8%, or by about six times.\n\nBut, since the code isn\'t ready yet, and users are just showing support, does it really mean anything?\n\n""On a technical level, signaling it that way does absolutely nothing, it does however help the case on a social level and prevents users from running an outdated version of the code when enforcing starts,"" developer Damian Mee argued.\n\nBeyond just gauging users\' support, some unidentified developers are allegedly testing and reviewing the reference implementation put forward by the pseudonymous shaolinfry in the proposal BIP 148.\n\nBut, so far they\'re secretive about it, and are waiting to see if people flag support for the change or not. (Though, one contributor delivered a reddit AMA on Monday.)\n\nThat said, there\'s a long been back and forth on the topic of this metric because node counts are easy to spoof.\n\nFor example, one entity can spin up a bunch of nodes in a data center in a sybil attack, as it\'s formally known.\n\nEconomic majority\n\nSo, simple node count might not be the best indicator. Due to how a UASF works, it could be necessary to have explicit support from the ""economic majority,"" or exchanges, wallets, and other bitcoin economic players.\n\nAnd, support from key economic players is so far at about 6% since the BIP was put out on March 12th (by one metric), admittedly sparse. Though, others are allegedly on the way, many are starting to announce their company\'s support via reddit.\n\nHowever, Novak pointed out that a sizable percentage of bitcoin nodes are running Bitcoin Core, and the versions with SegWit, which he thinks is a good indicator that the fuzzily-defined ""economic majority"" supports SegWit, and thus a UASF version of it.\n\nThis is perhaps notable given that the code is backwards-compatible, so the 80% of nodes that are currently ready for SegWit, would also be ready for the change.\n\nGiven this, Novak said he\'s ""very optimistic"" the plan to scale the network could ultimately work.\n\nAgain, there’s while there\'s a reference code implementation, it hasn\'t been fully tested and reviewed yet. The original activation date for SegWit was put at October 1st, 2017, but shaolinfry, recently moved it up to 1st August, meaning, if the community supports the proposal, that miners need to signal support for SegWit by that date, or they will fork off the network would need to upgrade.\n\nCautions to the wind\n\nIf it sounds dangerous or as if the idea is being rushed along, many believe it is. It\'s highly possible that the current aura of confidence in the proposal is the result of high tensions.\n\nOthers are proceeding more cautiously, as shown in one bitcoin developer chatroom.\n\n""I\'d say we want [it], if we think there is community support,"" said lead Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, when asked if developers should consider coding up Maxwell\'s suggested BIP.\n\nBitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille mentioned that it\'s ""complicated"" to determine when that threshold is met.\n\n""Whether that BIP is the best solution to that is indeed open, indeed makes sense for the dust to settle on that, though it may still make sense to have actual code,"" Van der Laan added later.\n\nIn the mailing list thread where he outlined his allegations against the miner in question, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell proposed using the method, but agreed that going through with it would depend on the level of support from the community.\n\nYet another development is that some developers are calling for a UASF on litecoin, a smaller blockchain by market cap, as both a way to get it on SegWit, and as a way to ""test"" how a UASF would pan out should it prove to be as divisive as other proposals.\n\nBut like past attempts to scale bitcoin, it remains to be seen if cooler heads, or strong passions, will prevail.\n\nUSAF hat image via Twitter\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The first issue of Ledger was published in March.\n\nWilmer pointed out that blockchain has evolved over time.\n\n“First people just said Bitcoin, then people started saying cryptocurrencies,” Wilmer said.\n\nBut the term cryptocurrencies still gave the connotation that it was limited to the financial world, he said.\n\n“So now people call it blockchain technology,” he said. “But who knows what people will call it in 10 years.”\n\nMany people know Bitcoin as an internet-based currency that allows people to buy and sell online goods anonymously. And there are many other cryptocurrencies in circulation including Ethereum and Dash.\n\nSome early adopters of cryptocurrencies were those engaging in illegal activities and who did not trust centralized power such as governments and banks. Since then, their use has become much more wide spread. It’s estimated that there are nearly 800 active cryptocurrencies worth more than $28 billion.\n\nAll of them are based on a computer science technology known as blockchain, which was first written about in an academic journal in 2008.\n\n“Like the Internet, it will touch all aspects of life,” Wilmer said. “It will change the way we do scientific research … it will change the way that we practice law and it will change the way we practice filing patents and going to concerts and trading stocks and so forth.”\n\nThe blockchain can be used anytime you want to publicly record a transaction down to the fraction of a second and without a central authority like a bank, stock exchange or government.\n\nBut Wilmer said, until now, there has been no single place for people passionate about the technology to publish their research. That’s why he created Ledger.\n\nWilmer said researchers in the past tried to shoehorn their writing into other journals that might not have been very accepting to their works.\n\nAt the same time, the lack of a central repository for their work made it very hard for others interested in cryptocurrency to find scholarly papers, he added.\n\nWilmer said the first issue reflects the diverse nature of the subject.\n\n“Ranging from very technical, focusing on the cryptography – ways of sending payments even more privately,” Wilmer said. “And just talking about a sociologist’s view of blockchain technology and Bitcoin and its effects on society.”\n\nThe journal is already generating interest, according to Wilmer, and he does not expect it to slow.\n\n“Bitcoin has been described as the largest socioeconomic human experiment,” Wilmer said. “So it definitely has social and political dimensions, so there is a lot there for people to study.”\n\nFidelity Investments recently announced it had joined the research and industry group The Initiative for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts, making it the first financial institution to do so. The auditing firm Deloitte is seen as a leader in integrating blockchain technology into more traditional financial tools.\n\nLedger is funded by the University of Pittsburgh and outside sponsorships, which Wilmer said can be made with U.S. dollars or Bitcoin.\n\nIn this week’s Tech Headlines:\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh has created a new position that will “lead the University’s strategic vision for research and innovation.” Rob A. Rutenbar was named to the post. He previously worked at the University of Illinois where he headed the Department of Computer Science. He previously held a post at Carnegie Mellon University. Pitt chancellor Patrick Gallagher said Rutenbar is uniquely qualified to support faculty research and innovation efforts and to champion Pitt research on a local, national and global scale.\n\nGoogle says it will expand the use of ""fact check"" tags in its search results.

Multiple organizations may reach different conclusions and Google says it will show those separately. However it still expects to get complaints.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Over the past two days, Bitcoin price stabilized at $1,215 primarily due to the increasing adoption of Bitcoin in Japan.\n\nOn April 1, the Bitcoin legalization billdraftedby the Japanese government’s Financial System Council was taken into full effect, officially recognizing Bitcoin as a legal payment method. As a result,businesses began to integrate Bitcoin paymentsand offer the digital currency as an option to consumers.\n\nMost notably, one of Japan’s largest electronics retailer chain Bic Camera announced its partnership with leading Bitcoin exchange bitFlyer to allow their customers nationwide to purchase electronics in Bitcoin.\n\nBic Camera’s acceptance of Bitcoin and generally positive media coverage on the digital currency spurred the demand for Bitcoin amongst traders and investors. This rising demand for Bitcoin pushed the Japanese exchange volume further, establishing Japan as the most dominant Bitcoin exchange market as of current.\n\nThe Japanese exchange market controls over 43 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market. This essentially means that the market share or the trading volume of the Japanese market is larger than that of the US, Europe and China combined.\n\nBitcoin scaling: SegWit vs. Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nFor the foreseeable future, SegWit will most likely enjoy its current momentum and continue its path toward activation as the market favorite. According to various sources, including Coin Dance, 70 percent of the Bitcoin industry’s businesses and companies are in support of the activation of SegWit.\n\nIn terms of node distribution, the support of Bitcoin nodes toward SegWit is overwhelmingly high in comparison to Bitcoin Unlimited. Currently, 83.2 percent of Bitcoin’s nodes are signaling Bitcoin Core, while the rest are in support of Bitcoin Unlimited, XT and others.\n\nAt the moment, it is quite evident that mining pools in China including Antpool and ViaBTC are aggressively campaigning for the hard fork execution of the Bitcoin Unlimited software. In fact, according to Coinbase, around 36 percent of the Bitcoin mining network are in support of Bitcoin Unlimited and today, on April 11, 45.1 percent of blocks supported Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nThe Bitcoin scaling debate is an important discussion to follow for short and mid-term price prediction. While certain events and factors such as the Japanese industry’s explosive growth are pushing Bitcoin price above the $1,200 margin, analysts explain that for Bitcoin price to achieve new highs in the range of $2,000 to $3,000, a scaling solution must be set in place.\n\nIf the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market and industry continue to outperform others and maintain their momentum, it is likely that Bitcoin price will remain relatively stable at around $1,200 for the near future.', 'Bitcoin mining has become a multi-billion dollar industry. Bitcoin miners have collectively earned over $2 billion in revenue since the cryptocurrency was established in 2008, according to an estimate from a new report published by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.\n\nBitcoin mining is how transactions on the bitcoin network get processed. Transactions in bitcoin are bundled into “blocks,” and it’s the job of miners to confirm those blocks are legitimate. This happens when a miner successfully solves a cryptographic puzzle attached to each block, gaining a payout called the “block reward.” This payout halves every four years; the current reward is 12.5 bitcoins per block, or $15,350 at today’s prices. The twist is this: miners must compete with one another with greater computational power to solve the puzzle and win the payout.\n\nThese incentives have led to a massive increase in complexity and need for computational power. In bitcoin’s early days, people mined the cryptocurrency on their home computers. Today, server farms of thousands of custom-designed machines around the world compete with one another to solve the puzzle first.\n\nRevenues generated by the bitcoin mining sector could be significantly higher, the report says. The estimate only accounts for revenues earned from block rewards and fees paid by bitcoin users for having their transactions processed. It doesn’t include revenue from selling mining equipment, or providing “cloud mining” services, which let subscribers share in block rewards for a fee, without having to operate their own equipment.\n\nImportantly, the estimate doesn’t account for capital gains from cashing out of bitcoin strategically, since the researchers assumed block rewards were immediately converted to US dollars. Those gains could be substantial, since bitcoin has been on a historic bull run.\n\nTransaction fees have historically been a small part of miners’ revenue, but they’ve shot up this year as the number of transactions gets closer to the bitcoin network’s limit. Users are willing to pay higher fees to ensure their transactions are processed by miners. The question of how to raise the limit is at the heart of the “civil war” that has divided the bitcoin world. As bitcoin adoption grows, miners are prospering.\n\nRead this next: Bitcoin’s civil war threatens to blow up the cryptocurrency itself', 'Bitcoin is up 1.3% at $1,227 a coin as traders move into the cryptocurrency amid a scramble for safety.

While the specific manufacturer was not named in the email, it was easy to surmise that Maxwell was alluding to the Chinese mining giant Bitmain — a suspicion confirmed through a press release issued by the company the next day.\n\n\n\nRumors, clues and accusations have dominated social media, news sites, and chatrooms ever since, as a new dimension in Bitcoin’s long-lasting scaling debate kicked tensions into high gear. Instead of the reasons given so far, some now believe that Bitmain and its mining pools have rejected the Segregated Witness soft fork (SegWit) because it is incompatible with the covert use of AsicBoost technology embedded in their chips.\n\n\n\nFor anyone not “in the loop”: here’s an overview of what’s going on…\n\n\n\nAsicBoost\n\n\n\nIn short, AsicBoost is a technology invented by former CoinTerra CTO Timo Hanke and RSK Chief Scientist Sergio Damián Lerner. When implemented in ASIC chips (chips specialized for Bitcoin mining), AsicBoost can take advantage of a quirk in the implementation of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining algorithm. This lets miners take a sort of a “shortcut” to finding a valid block.\n\n\n\nThis shortcut can give miners up to a 30 percent efficiency advantage — though some 15 to 20 percent seems more likely. Since miners compete on small margins, even small efficiency gains can result in big profits. Maxwell estimated that a large miner can bank up to $100 million extra per year; a claim backed by calculations by the pseudonymous “praxeology_guy.” Though others, including the founder of now-defunct ASIC manufacturer KnCMiner Sam Cole, downplayed this figure. In the scheme of things — cost of electricity, ASIC design, and more — the added profit from AsicBoost alone could be much smaller.\n\nUpdate: Former Spoondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem also estimates the added profits from AsicBoost would be significantly smaller; some $2 million extra per year.\n\n\n\nAsicBoost has been subject to some controversy before. Since the technology is patented, and patents are state-enforced, some worry that AsicBoost could skew Bitcoin’s mining competition by non-market factors. This could in a worst-case scenario lead to a centralized and perhaps even regulated mining landscape, providing reason enough for some developers to consider changing the Bitcoin protocol to counter AsicBoost. Others, however, see AsicBoost as an optimization like so many mining optimizations realized over the years, and argue that innovative miners should not be punished by a protocol change.\n\n\n\nIn light of last week’s events, it is important to note that AsicBoost not only can be utilized overtly, in which case it is obvious that a miner is using it, but it can also be employed covertly, which is much harder to detect. And, as it now turns out, covert use of AsicBoost is largely incompatible with the current soft fork implementation of Segregated Witness, the protocol upgrade as proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team.\n\n\n\nThe Admission\n\n\n\nWhile it was up in the air for a day or so, it is no longer a question whether Bitmain indeed implemented AsicBoost technology in its chips.\n\n\n\nIn their press release, the company readily admitted that it did, stating:\n\n\n\n“Our ASIC chips, like those of some other manufacturers, have a circuit design that supports AsicBoost.”\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Bitmain said that it “has tested AsicBoost on [Bitcoin’s] Testnet,” while also explaining that the company can legally use the technology:\n\n\n\n“Bitmain holds the AsicBoost patent in China. We can legally use it in our own mining farms in China to profit from it and sell the cloud mining contracts to the public.”\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Bitmain said that AsicBoost wouldn't be bad for the company’s business model, writing:\n\n\n\n“Bitcoin mining equipment depreciates rapidly. Bitmain has constantly been introducing newer more efficient miner models for all. As such the statement that the deployment of AsicBoost, which can lead to a 20% difference in power efficiency, is some kind of negative development for Bitmain’s business model is false.”\n\n\n\nAnd on top of that, the ASIC producer rejects that AsicBoost is something detrimental in itself. Instead, it argues that widespread use of the technology would benefit the Bitcoin network:\n\n\n\n“If all mining equipment could use AsicBoost, it will lower the J/GH cost and the total network hash rate will increase, making the Bitcoin network even stronger. So, the AsicBoost method is not a ‘covert attack’ on the Bitcoin [proof of work] function. It is an engineering optimization.”\n\n\n\nSo, in summary, Bitmain admits it implemented AsicBoost technology in its chips, acknowledges testing it, explains that using it in China is legal, says that it is not a negative for the company, and also says it's not a negative (an attack) in itself — but rather something positive: an optimization.\n\nYet…\n\n\n\nThe Denial\n\n\n\nEven though Bitmain argues that AsicBoost is a positive on all fronts, the company maintains that “the AsicBoost method has not been used by us on the mainnet.”\n\n\n\nAs well as:\n\n\n\n“[Using AsicBoost], however profitable, is not something we would do for the greater good of Bitcoin.”\n\n\n\nThese claims may be true.\n\n\n\nWhile the denial seems oddly inconsistent with with the statements that there is nothing wrong with AsicBoost, it has so far not been conclusively proven that Bitmain did, in fact, use AsicBoost on Bitcoin’s main net. And this may be hard to prove conclusively, as covert use of AsicBoost can, indeed, be done covertly.\n\n\n\nThat said, covert use of AsicBoost could in some cases be noticeable after all. Specifically, using AsicBoost could result in odd transaction ordering in blocks, or even in the mining of (near) empty blocks. Efforts to further analyze blocks are ongoing.\n\n\n\nSo far, it does appear that Bitmain’s main mining pool, AntPool, has both mined blocks with odd transaction ordering, as well as nearly empty blocks. And while both of these may be explained by spy mining, buggy mining pool software, or perhaps other reasons we don’t yet know of, the timing and structure of some of some of the (near) empty blocks is at least suspicious.\n\n\n\nMoreover, AntPool’s mining of (near) empty blocks has always been notable, since Bitmain’s co-CEO, Jihan Wu, is one of the most prominent proponents of a block size limit increase: If Bitcoin needs to process more transactions, mining empty blocks doesn’t help.\n\n\n\nAnd when asked about the empty blocks last year, no reason was given by Wu at all. In fact, there is little indication Wu had “the greater good of Bitcoin” in mind at that time:\n\n\n\n@sysmannet sorry, we will continue mining empty blocks. This is the freedom given by the Bitcoin protocol. — Jihan Wu (@JihanWu) March 1, 2016\n\nAnd then, AntPool seems to also have stratum commands for overt use of AsicBoost on their servers. This basically means that all of the infrastructure to utilize AsicBoost is there — though it’s not clear if this can be used covertly as well. (And Bitmain definitely hasn’t used AsicBoost overtly.)\n\n\n\nAll in all, there is substantial circumstantial evidence that Bitmain (and AntPool) has been using AsicBoost on Bitcoin’s main net. But as per the nature of covert use of the technology, conclusive evidence is hard to find, and may even be impossible to come by.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the debate, there is one main argument for why Bitmain may not have used AsicBoost on Bitcoin’s main net. If, instead of the $100 million figure, the more conservative estimates are correct, and AsicBoost for example “only” adds a couple of million extra profit per year, perhaps it’s not worth the hassle. Setting up an operation of the size of Bitmain to utilize AsicBoost does require a lot of complex work, and from a cost/benefit-analysis, some suggest it may be better to skip it.\n\n\n\nSegregated Witness\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, using AsicBoost is controversial; doing so covertly, even more so. And if Bitmain sold machines to customers without the technology enabled, while itself taking in the extra AsicBoost profit, it would be worse.\n\n\n\nBut this, in itself, is not really at the heart of the “AsicBoost scandal.”\n\n\n\nRather, the (perceived) scandal is that Bitmain may have been blocking and stalling a widely popular upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol under a false pretence. The incompatibility between (covert use of) AsicBoost and Segregated Witness could explain why Bitmain remains one of the very few companies in the Bitcoin industry to so staunchly oppose the soft fork.\n\n\n\nMoreover, it would explain why the Chinese mining giant has been so persistent in its demand for a hard fork. Covert use of AsicBoost would be compatible with Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative protocol implementation supported by Wu. Similarly, a recent Segregated Witness hard fork as proposed by Lerner (the same Lerner that patented AsicBoost) could be made compatible with covert use of AsicBoost, too.\n\n\n\nAnd, the incompatibility between (covert use of) AsicBoost and Segregated Witness could explain why Wu was supportive of extension blocks, a recent proposal that appears to have little (if any) benefit over SegWit… except that extension blocks don’t break covert use of AsicBoost.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it could explain why this recent proposal was designed to be incompatible with Segregated Witness. While the two solutions do not need to exclude each other in any way, an unnecessary design choice in extension blocks made sure they are.\n\n\n\nAnd if the reason for Bitmain’s rejection of the Segregated Witness soft fork is not AsicBoost, there seems to be only one alternative explanation left. Miner activation of the protocol upgrade could be used as a sort of bargaining chip, where the mining giant is only willing to activate the soft fork if it’s guaranteed to be followed up by a hard fork.\n\n\n\nIndeed, this is what Wu told Bitcoin Magazine last year, and it is what the company maintains in its press release published last week:\n\n\n\n“SegWit is not running in production because the conditions made clear in the Hong Kong agreement have not been met, in which we foresee a non-witness block size increase coming together with SegWit.”\n\nFor more (details) on AsicBoost, see this explanation by Jeremy Rubin, or this ELI5 (Explain Like I’m Five) by Jimmy Song, or this blog post on the relation between SegWit and AsicBoost by Lerner, or the original white paper by Hanke.

After the attack stops, all blocks mined within the smaller component will be discarded together with all included transactions and the miners revenue,” the group says.\n\nBitcoin mining lies at the heart of the ISP weakness issue, as a considerable amount of network mining power (30 percent) is distributed across a comparatively small number of ISPs (13).\n\n\u200b\n\n“Moreover, most of the traffic exchanged between Bitcoin nodes traverse few ISPs,” ETH continues. “Indeed, our results indicate that 60% of all possible Bitcoin connections cross 3 ISPs. In other words, 3 ISPs can see 60% of all Bitcoin traffic.”\n\nThe delay attack, meanwhile, would facilitate delivery of a block to a node 20 minutes behind others, leaving it susceptible to double spends.\n\nETH stated the purpose of the research was to inform the Bitcoin users and miners as well as suggest long and short-term countermeasures.']"
04/12/2017,"['Hackers may be hijacking internet-connected fridges, toasters and light bulbs in order to use their computing power to mine bitcoins, researchers have revealed.\n\nIBM researchers discovered a bitcoin mining component in a new variant of Mirai—a form of malware that exploits security vulnerabilities to take control of devices connected to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nSecurity firm McAfee recently estimated that more than 2.5 million IoT devices were infected by the Mirai botnet in 2016, though it is not clear how many compromised devices may have been used to mine the virtual currency.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n“We do not have any insight into whether or not bitcoins were actually mined during these attacks,” Dave McMillen, a senior threat researcher at IBM, tells Newsweek. “It is also not known whether or not this is the actions of one group or many… This Mirai variant could be appealing to others in the future due to the potentially large volume of devices that could be involved.”\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nSecurity experts have previously warned that hackers could target smart devices in order to mine bitcoin. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure prophesied in 2014 that cryptocurrencies offered a new method for criminals to profit from vulnerable devices.\n\n“Attacks don’t target the user but the computer itself,” Hypponen said. “Internet of Things devices can be hacked to mine cryptocurrencies and make money.”\n\nMining bitcoin—the process of confirming bitcoin transactions and adding their record to bitcoin’s public ledger in order to generate new units of the currency—requires vast amounts of computing power. It would therefore require a huge network of IoT devices in order to have a successful mining operation.\n\nDetails of the Mirai variant were published by the IBM researchers in an online blog, in which they speculated hackers would be incentivized to mine for bitcoin in order to facilitate cybercriminal activities.\n\nCreative Commons/ Composite\n\nAccording to a 2016 study by the security firm BullGuard, up to 185 million devices may be at risk of being compromised by Mirai. Hackers used the network of compromised devices in a series of attacks that caused several major websites to go offline, including Netflix, Reddit and Twitter.\n\nProjections from technology research firm Gartner suggest the issue may escalate if security fixes are not implemented by device manufacturers. According to Gartner, there will be more than 20 billion IoT devices by 2020, while estimates from ABI Research put the figure closer to 30 billion. Cybersecurity experts warn that too many manufacturers treat security as an afterthought when producing internet-enabled devices.\n\nChris Boyd, an analyst at the security firm Malwarebytes, told Newsweek in an interview last year: “The problem here is that many IoT devices are horribly broken security-wise because it costs money to ensure a reasonable standard of protection on a product.”\n\nThis lax approach will inevitably lead to much more devastating attacks, according to cybersecurity veteran John McAfee.\n\n“The attacks are slowly escalating, similar to the way America developed the atomic bomb,” McAfee, who created the eponymous antivirus computer software but is now longer connected to it, said in October. “Clearly there are weaknesses. Anticipate that these will be exploited in a big way.”', 'The Indian government has established an interdisciplinary committee that includes among others, the central bank, to examine the framework surrounding virtual currencies like bitcoin.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Finance has today announced the formation of a committee that will examine the existing framework – of which there is notably none in India – of virtual currencies.\n\nThe following excerpt is the beginning of the announcement, citing ‘concern’ with the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in India.\n\nIt read:\n\nThe circulation of Virtual Currencies which are also known as Digital/Crypto Currencies has been a cause of concern….Reserve Bank of India [the country’s central bank] had also cautioned the users, holders and traders of Virtual currencies (VCs) including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to.\n\nThe announcement cites two separate notices issued by the country’s central bank in 2013 and 2017.\n\nThe committee is established by the Ministry of Finance, the authority that oversees taxation & the country’s finances; and the Department of Economic Affairs, the nodal sub-department of the Ministry that prepares the country’s budget.\n\nThe committee will be chaired by the Special Secretary of Economic Affairs and representatives from a number of other ministries. Notably, the committee will also be represented by the central bank and the State Bank of India, the country’s largest bank that is also state-owned.\n\nThe Committee’s tasks are laid out as follows:\n\nTaking stock of the present status of Virtual Currencies both in India and globally;\n\nExamining the existing global regulatory and legal structures governing Virtual Currencies\n\nSuggest measures for dealing with such Virtual Currencies including issues relating to consumer protection, money laundering, etc; and\n\nExamine any other matter related to Virtual Currencies which may be relevant.\n\nThe lack of regulation by the government, at a time when other Asian nations including Philippines and Japan do so in acknowledgement of bitcoin as a legitimate method of payment, has led to India’s young but growing bitcoin industry to establish a self-regulatory body and watchdog earlier in February.\n\nContrary to recent reports of the Indian government deciding upon the legality of bitcoin in the country by April 20, the committee will have three months to submit a report based on its research into bitcoin and its regulation, usage, and acceptance around the world.\n\nIndian authorities would do well to take a cue from their Russian counterparts, who went from proposing prison sentences for bitcoin adopters to reversing that stance and hinting toward bitcoin regulation, in the space of a year.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Bitcoin was the first digital currency to achieve a measure of popularity, thanks to its use of blockchain, an online ledger that tracks and verifies every time the virtual money is used.

In a blog post on Blockstream’s website this morning, it was announced that Mow would be joining the blockchain technology startup as the new chief strategy officer.\n\n\n\nDetails related to Mow’s new role at Blockstream, his alignment with the company’s core values, and his ability to continue his support for an open Bitcoin development process were outlined in the Mow-authored blog post and a related press release.\n\n“What I hope to accomplish with the team at Blockstream is to bring great products to market, continue to contribute to the community, and make Bitcoin great again,” Mow told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nMow’s New Role at Blockstream\n\nAccording to comments from Blockstream CEO Adam Back, the company is preparing to accelerate and shift toward the launch and marketing of their enterprise and consumer products. “Samson will be undertaking a number of immediate strategic initiatives [during this process], including the establishment of Blockstream offices in China and Canada,” Back said.\n\n""Samson\'s skills and experience are exceptionally complementary to Blockstream, leveraging both his deep Bitcoin and startup expertise,"" Back added.\n\n“We\'re starting to see a lot of interest in the Elements blockchain platform in Asia, which is very encouraging,” Mow told Bitcoin Magazine. “As such, we\'ll start spending more time with local partners there and getting developers familiar with building on top of Elements.”\n\nElements is a project from Blockstream that allows developers to extend Bitcoin’s functionality via sidechains.\n\nMow also discussed some of the differences and similarities between his new role at Blockstream and his previous position at BTCC. “There will likely be some similarities, but I expect things to be very different as well since Blockstream\'s focus is on building platforms, whereas BTCC was purely B2C,” he said. “At Blockstream, I\'ll mainly focus on productization and bringing products to market, while building relationships with our partners.”\n\nAlignment with Blockstream’s Core Values\n\nMow wrote in the company blog about how he is aligned with Blockstream’s core values. He specifically pointed to “protecting permissionless innovation, empowering through trustable and secure financial technology, and transforming the trust paradigm for the betterment of society” as examples of these core values.\n\n“Blockstream is building a platform and systems where those risks can be eliminated, and where the end-users of the system do not need to trust Blockstream or anyone else to verify that the systems built using the technology can be trusted,” he said. “In addition, the Blockstream team prioritizes security, decentralization, and performance when approaching their work, which I find practical and pragmatic.”\n\nThis is not the first time Blockstream and Mow’s core values have brought them together. During his time at BTCC, Mow was involved with the organization process for the Scaling Bitcoin workshops, of which Blockstream is a key sponsor. “I plan to continue supporting Bitcoin community events and initiatives,” Mow wrote.\n\nSupporting Bitcoin Development\n\nAnother reason Mow has joined Blockstream is to continue his support of the Bitcoin development process. He referred to this as Blockstream’s “raison d\'être” in the blog post, explaining his reasons for joining the company.\n\n“It’s important that Bitcoin development remain decentralized, and that developers are free to act independently and in the best interests of all users,” he said. “At Blockstream, everyone on the team has an independent voice, and may even disagree with each other publicly or make competing proposals at times.”\n\nDuring his time at BTCC, the company began contributing financially to some of Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd’s development work.\n\nFinally, it appears that Mow’s Twitter antics aren’t going anywhere. “On occasion [I will] find interesting ways to reiterate my beliefs and intentions with those who disagree,” Mow concluded, adding a smiley to the post for extra effect.', '3:38\n\n\'The Shape of Water:\' The Creature Feature That Goes All the Way\n\nCan an audience suspend disbelief and believe that a human and a creature can fall in love; both emotionally and physically?

Images: Everett Collection Composite: Mark Kelly', 'As a mobile payment method, Bitcoin is gaining prominence alongside apps like Samsung and Apple Pay, a surge in popularity helped no end by the cryptocurrency’s triumph over gold for value earlier this year. But, despite a decade of development and a number of high-profile fans behind it, is it possible for people to survive with just their mobile phone and virtual Bitcoin wallet in their pocket?\n\nCasino\n\nIn some places, it’s easy to live off virtual money. For example, buying games is a straightforward task (Steam, Microsoft, and Kinguin all accept Bitcoin) and the more eccentric and modern a coffee shop happens to be, a trait that’s discernable through the vessels it serves its lattes in (who doesn’t love their morning cup of Joe in a chemistry beaker?), the more likely it is to accept Bitcoin. It’s a strange fact of life.\n\nSimilarly, a branch of the casino industry, iGaming, accepts Bitcoin exclusively, a good example of which is this site, Vegas Casino, a crypto-casino. The website has the customary perks for new players, including a 50 mBTC no deposit bonus, but Bitcoin integration means that deposits and withdrawals are instant by default and odds can be provably fair. With a range of live casino games and several hundred slots, Vegas Casino’s business model is both viable and unique.\n\nBut, beyond the safety of the internet, is Bitcoin still a usable currency? The short answer is “yes”; the long one is below:\n\nThe Right Place\n\nObviously, the usability of Bitcoin in the real world hinges on the number of stores that will accept it in lieu of plastic or coins. However, acceptance isn’t uniform – in the United States, a good chunk of crypto-culture is centered on the Eastern Seaboard, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tampa, and Miami while support for Bitcoin in Africa is confined to about five cities. Europe has by far the most consistent coverage as far as Bitcoin-friendly stores are concerned, though.\n\nKreuzberg, the counterculture capital of Berlin, has a record store, a bar called Room 77 and a cake-selling café (Floor’s), among other establishments, all of which will take Bitcoin for goods. The Guardian notes that the first LP sold for Bitcoin in Kreuzberg was Tom Waits’s The Big Time. Kreuzberg is perhaps typical of the Bitcoin-accepting community, as a pocket of support in an otherwise fiat-orientated city.\n\nLiving on Bitcoin\n\nThere are people out there who have gone the whole hog and challenged themselves to live a dollar-less life, such as Olaf Carlson-Wee, formerly of currency exchange website Coinbase. His rationale is idealistic – “I view Bitcoin as the more democratic version of money” – but his experience with the currency nevertheless brings up some of the difficulties of using it offline; there aren’t many landlords that accept Bitcoin.\n\nTalking to Forbes three years ago, Carlson-Wee would almost definitely have an easier time getting people to accept Bitcoin in 2017. Ironically, luxury goods like TVs are readily available for Bitcoin; it’s things like gas and groceries that can prove elusive. However, taking the advice of Bitcoin marathoners on Reddit and YouTube, buying gift cards with the cryptocurrency is a popular way to ensure the stock of organic avocado doesn’t dip too low.\n\nFinally, the obvious question to ask is what is involved in paying with Bitcoin? The customer simply transfers the money to the business by opening their preferred digital wallet app and then scanning a QR code supplied by the cashier. It’s a little different to Apple Pay transactions but no more convoluted.', 'Litecoin’s price rose some 20% today following news that BW was signaling for segregated witnesses (segwit), a protocol upgrade which combines added on-chain capacity with fixes that aim to support the Lightning Network and other layer-two protocols.\n\nPrice reacted almost instantly to the news, rising from around $9.70 to just under $12, currently seemingly settled around $11.30 at the time of publishing.\n\nSome suggest segwit support on litecoin now stands around 77%, above the 75% threshold required for its activation. Sites tracking segwit support state it currently stands at around 73% over the short and high variance time period of 24 hours.\n\nSegwit support needs to stand at or above 75% for a period of two weeks. Thereafter, another two weeks is given as a grace period to allow non-upgraded miners to upgrade. The incentives, after it becomes clear segwit has activated, are to go with the majority, but in this case it might be more complicated.\n\nLTC1BTC’s founder has come out strongly against segwit while there were rumors Antpool hired litecoin hashrate to reduce segwit’s network share. It is not clear whether they would upgrade if segwit is activated, nor is it clear what would happen if they do not upgrade.\n\nPotential Chain-Split?\n\nThe 75% threshold has been strongly criticized in the bitcoin context due to suggestions that it would force 25% of miners, or it would lead to a chain split. In a soft-fork context it might be slightly different, but there is no soft-fork as far as miners are concerned. For miners, all forks are hard-forks.\n\nWe have seen this many times when soft-forks accidentally led to a chain split. We have never seen an intentional chain-split in a soft-fork, but there has been no controversial soft-fork of note either.\n\nWhat exactly would happen if there is such intentional chain-split is not very clear. The usual advice is to not transact during this period because a re-organization is expected. Moreover, there may be some confusion as transactions seemingly confirm and then unconfirm.\n\nMinority miners would probably lose their blocks. Moreover, keeping the minority chain running might be expensive, but F2Pool would have the ability to cause chaos if they switched their hashrate, or if minority miners add hashrate and gain 51%.\n\nAs such, the upcoming few weeks are likely to be an uncertain period for litecoin until it becomes clear what dissenting miners intend to do. If they follow other miners, then it will be as if nothing happened, but if they keep objecting, then we would enter an unchartered territory.\n\nHowever, the market seems to like the upgrade, probably because it brings attention to litecoin which was significantly overshadowed to the point of forgotten prior to the segwit merger.\n\nIt also appears to have support in the litecoin’s public space, but they seem to engage in arbitrary moderation, seemingly lacking public mod logs, therefore it is not obvious how much of that support is genuine or otherwise considering allegations of troll armies.\n\nOn balance, as litecoin has nothing else going for it, it is probable the majority supports the upgrade as might be indicated by the amount of hashrate support. An objective poll through token holders vote, however, would have been useful.\n\nThe Bitcoin Angle\n\nThe more important consideration is how would segwit’s activation on litecoin affect bitcoin’s scalability debate, if it affects it at all? It may be the case that small block supporters conclude if litecoin is going the segwit way – and, therefore, the settlement way – there is no longer any reason why bitcoin should.\n\nThey may, therefore, move to litecoin, allowing bitcoin to follow Nakamoto’s roadmap of on-chain scaling, while litecoin applies Finney’s vision, thus allowing both to compete in an open and free market, in a fair way, with experience and history left to judge which path is best.\n\nIf that does indeed happen, it would be interesting to see whether r/bitcoin becomes, in effect, r/litecoin. That would be quite a bemusing spectacle, but can’t really be written out.\n\nThe flip-side might be that litecoin’s segwit activation leads to a doubling down by small blockers, but bitcoin is very divided, with neither side able to conclude the debate after two years. As such, it appears far more rational for Blockstream to move to litecoin and drop its opposition in bitcoin which clearly seems to want to follow Nakamoto’s roadmap as shown by hashrate’s support levels of BU and segwit.\n\nThat wouldn’t be without costs to bitcoin. Any open source project would like more, not less, developers. However, Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik, both very capable developers, seem to have currently been sidelined. If bitcoin moves ahead on Nakamoto’s roadmap, they may return to play a prominent role in development once more.\n\nMoreover, if the toxic atmosphere comes to an end, the project might attract new developers or those that left. It might also be able to collaborate with other open source projects, combining forces and talent.\n\nAs such, litecoin’s segwit activation might be actually good news as small blockers would no longer have any intellectual standing to change Nakamoto’s roadmap when they can compete in a free and open market and prove their worth just as Nakamoto did his (or hers/theirs/whatever).\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'New Hampshire is weighing a bill to exempt bitcoin traders from money transmission laws – and state officials are speaking out against the measure.\n\nTheir argument centers on whether the government of New Hampshire should take a proactive or reactive role in the regulation of money transmitters within the state that use digital currency.

For better or worse, the majority of the discussions about scaling in the Bitcoin community have mostly been focused on this one variable.\n\n\n\nAs an oversimplification of the current debate: Some would like to see an increase in block size which would enable more on-chain transactions per second; others would like to see the block size limit remain low in an effort to limit the cost of operating a full node while moving some types of payments above the base Bitcoin protocol to secondary layers such as the Lightning Network and sidechains.\n\nIn early 2016, a research paper was released in which the relationship between increased on-chain capacity and increased costs of operating a full node were explored. The paper, titled On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains, explained that blocks must not exceed 4 megabytes if the goal is to prevent more than 10 percent of the full nodes on the network from being overwhelmed by the demands of the network. This 4 megabyte metric is often brought up during discussions around the proper block size limit for Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Christian Decker, an infrastructure tech engineer at Blockstream and one of the co-authors of the paper, Bitcoin network communication has improved over the past few months which, the paper explained, has affected the tradeoffs.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Decker to gather more information related to what the Bitcoin network can handle today in terms of block sizes.\n\nClearing Up Misconceptions Around the Study\n\nDecker first wanted to clarify a common misconception of the research presented in the paper on scaling decentralized blockchains:\n\n“Our results are not binary, in that they are not showing a threshold up to which nothing happens and going just beyond [which] bad things start to happen,” Decker explained. “What we do is show that there is a tradeoff between block size and the guarantees that confirmations give us.”\n\nAccording to another paper co-authored by Decker, titled Information Propagation on the Bitcoin Network, an increasing block size will also increase the blockchain fork rate, which means confirmations in the current version of the blockchain become less reliable for users.\n\n“What we can compute are upper bounds on block size, after which the system will definitely become unstable, e.g., never converge to a unique ledger state,” Decker continued. “However the tradeoff between block size, confirmation guarantees, and centralization pressure is continuous: Even small changes have an effect. We show that the tradeoff exists and that it must be taken into consideration, but the decision about what the sweet spot in this tradeoff is, is a political issue and less a technical one. If network participants are happy to have a less decentralized network in exchange for an incremental transaction rate increase, that's their decision.”\n\nWhile Decker said he is convinced that a moderate block size increase is possible without incurring too many negative effects, he also noted that the precedent set by such a move needs to be taken into consideration.\n\n“There are natural limits to the size that the network can support, namely our worst case thresholds, beyond which we cannot go,” Decker stated. “An increase today could signal that in case of block space contention we can always just increase the block size, which is definitely not true.”\n\nImprovements to the Bitcoin Network\n\nAccording to Decker, the fundamental analysis provided by On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains is still relevant, but there have been incremental improvements achieved over the past few months that have had a noticeable effect on the tradeoffs described in the paper. Decker pointed to Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo’s work on the FIBRE relay network and Compact Block Relay as specific contributors to network communication improvements.\n\nDecker also runs BitcoinStats.com which tracks the efficiency of information propagation around the Bitcoin network. He recently updated the site with new data that, in his view, shows the propagation of blocks around the network is much faster than it was before Corallo’s improvements were implemented.\n\nAccording to Decker, a comparison of block propagation times between now and one year ago show that a 3 megabyte block today has an equivalent propagation time of a 1 megabyte block from one year ago. It took a 1 megabyte block 6.5 seconds to reach half of the network a year ago, while it takes roughly 2 seconds today. However, Decker added that size increases have increased longtail propagation time, which means it now takes longer for a block to reach every single node on the network.\n\n“Both [FIBRE] and [Compact Block Relay] employ forward error correction to reduce the amount of data to be shipped around the world and recombine blocks from multiple sources instead of relying on a single source,” Decker explained. “This creates geographically distributed seeds from which the blocks are then forwarded to the remaining peers.”\n\nIn the past, Corallo and BTC.com’s Kevin Pan have told Bitcoin Magazine that FIBRE and Compact Block Relay have also led to a decline in the number of empty blocks mined on the network.\n\nWhat Can Bitcoin Handle Today?\n\nAt this time, further analysis on what impact the implemented network improvements have had on Bitcoin’s ability to handle blocks larger than 4 megabytes has not been made available. “I am continually monitoring the network propagation, and need to aggregate them and re-evaluate our analysis,” Decker said.\n\n“What is safe strongly depends on the requirements of the user, the tradeoff is still valid, it just shifted slightly due to the increased efficiency,” Decker added.\n\nAccording to Decker, extrapolating a new throughput limit based on the improvements in how efficiently data is shipped around the world may be simplistic. In other words, a threefold improvement in network communication does not necessarily mean the 4 megabytes number in the original paper would be 12 megabytes if it were written today.\n\n“These one-time efficiency increases have certainly moved the throughput limit at which bad things definitely happen upwards, but whether it is at 12 megabytes, I'm not sure,” explained Decker. “As I mentioned, it's not a binary threshold, just an upper limit, and putting a number on it just does not mean that lower values are safe.”\n\nIn conclusion, Decker added that there are some types of transactions that will never make sense as on-chain transactions due to the intrinsic costs involved. “There will always be use-cases which are not fit for on-chain payments.” he stated. “There is also a privacy increase in using off-chain transfers, since they no longer leave a permanent trace in the blockchain.”\n\nIn Decker’s view, off-chain protocols, such as the Lightning Network or Duplex Micropayment Channels, are desirable for long-term scalability because they evolve much faster and do not rely on consensus from the entire ecosystem to enable.\n\n“I think Segregated Witness is both a malleability fix, enabling these higher level protocols, and a safe block size increase, which does not set the dangerous precedent of just bumping the block size [limit] when there is block size contention,” Decker stated."", 'Testing has begun on a blockchain-based gold trading platform backed by the UK\'s Royal Mint.\n\nFirst announced in November of last year, the initiative sees the 1,000-year-old institution – which creates and issues physical coins, among other items – developing a so-called ""Royal Mint Gold"" digital asset, each unit of which will represent 1 gram of gold held by the Mint. The Mint is working with bitcoin startup BitGo and white-label exchange software provider AlphaPoint to develop the market, with a planned launch eyed for later this year.\n\nAccording to CME Group, which is also involved in the project, a number of as-yet-undisclosed financial institutions are also involved in the development and testing of the platform. The firm said that as much as $1bn worth of gold will be digitally represented using the blockchain being developed in partnership with BitGo, as detailed in a blog post published earlier this week.\n\nSandra Ro, head of digitization at CME, said in a statement:\n\n""This is the first digital gold product that is institutionally targeted – and the first to work with a government entity – to be currently in a live testing state.""\n\nThe Royal Mint will be responsible for issuing on-chain assets and maintaining the gold reserves. Rules regarding transactions and block creation will be verified and enforced by a community of validators which will include exchange customers, academic and public institutions, as well as corporate partners. Meanwhile, transactions will be verified by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Wallets tied to the system will utilize multi-signature security protocols.\n\nWhen the project was unveiled last year, Royal Mint chief finance officer Vin Wijeratne positioned it as a way to improve the ways in which gold is traded.\n\n""Developing a trading platform with CME Group will satisfy customer demands for faster, cost effective and secure ways to buy, hold and sell gold and complement our existing product,"" Wijeratne said at the time. ""This landmark partnership allows us to combine the world’s leading mint, the best futures trading platform globally and best in class technology.""\n\nMint coin via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

04/13/2017,"['SINGAPORE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - A company built around the research of Craig Wright, who has claimed to have invented the bitcoin cryptocurrency, has been sold to a private equity firm in a deal the company says is the biggest to date involving bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology.\n\nThe deal swings the spotlight once again on to Wright, a 46-year-old computer scientist who is the cryptocurrency’s most controversial figure. He hopes to remain central to the technology’s future, telling Reuters the goal is to build bitcoin into a global “system with no ruler, no king.”\n\n“We will scale and grow bitcoin to become what it was envisioned to be,” he said. “All I do is to help grow the use of bitcoin, and I want to see it in daily use by at least a billion people on-chain. We have the funds, the people and the technology to do this.”\n\nAccording to a news release on Thursday, Malta-based High Tech Private Equity Fund SICAV plc bought nChain Holdings, “the world leader in blockchain-centric research and development.” It put no value on the deal and did not mention Wright.\n\nReuters previously identified nChain, formerly known as EITC Holdings, as Wright’s vehicle for filing hundreds of bitcoin and blockchain-related patents.\n\nUK records confirm that the target company - under both its EITC and nChain names - already filed more than 80 bitcoin and blockchain-related patents.\n\nA person close to the deal said $300 million had been invested in nChain, but it was not clear over what period of time.\n\nThe Maltese fund did not respond to emails asking for comment.\n\nReuters reported last year that EITC planned to file hundreds of patents related to blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The financial industry and others are exploring its potential.\n\nThe fund is managed by Liechtenstein-based Accuro Fund Solutions, part of Zurich-based Accuro Group. Accuro did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nDIVISIVE FIGURE\n\nWright remains a divisive figure in the bitcoin world.\n\nAfter failing to convince many in the bitcoin community that he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of bitcoin, Wright retreated from view last year.\n\nReuters reported last month that Wright was working with Calvin Ayre, a Canadian online gambling tycoon, to build a patent portfolio, though its purpose was not clear. Ayre was not immediately available for comment.\n\nnChain said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters that neither Ayre nor Wright had a stake in it before or after the sale. It said the company previously acquired Wright’s assets and intellectual property, and he now held the post of chief scientist.\n\nAlthough it was not possible to confirm Wright’s identity as Nakamoto, a Reuters investigation found he was deeply involved in the early development of bitcoin, and had told Australian tax officials he possessed more than 1 million bitcoin - worth $1.2 billion at the current exchange rate.\n\nPatent lawyers have noted that open-source technologies like bitcoin are not easy to patent, and even if patents are approved, they are not always easy to defend.\n\nThursday’s announcement is the first time nChain has publicly acknowledged it is filing patents.\n\nWithout confirming how many bitcoins he owns, Wright told Reuters he would never “dump bitcoin.”\n\n“I will sell when I do this for goods on a daily basis, or I will go down with it. Past the basics of my family’s well-being, all I have is dedicated to building the systems and institutions needed to make bitcoin successful globally,” he said.\n\nThe news release also shed light on what Wright and nChain might do with its patents. nChain this year “intends to make some of its intellectual property assets available to the blockchain community through open-source software and royalty-free licensing.” It invited interested parties to register via email.\n\nnChain’s patent filings, seen by Reuters, range from the storage of medical documents to WiFi security. Investors have spent more than $1.5 billion on blockchain and bitcoin start-ups over the past four years, according to CB Insights, an internet research company.\n\nThe company said it was also working on software tools and applications to support the growth of blockchain. These include a software to develop applications on the bitcoin blockchain, solutions for bitcoin blockchain scalability, inventions to improve security, on-chain scripting for smart contracts, and a decentralized trading platform that uses autonomous agents.\n\nThe company also called for a neutral standards body to be set up to coordinate bitcoin’s development.', 'North Korean hackers stole about 100 million Korean won, or $88,000, worth of bitcoin from South Korean exchanges every month from 2013 to 2015, Yonhap News Agency reports, citing Radio Free Asia.\n\n""Cyber criminals have turned to bitcoin for money as it is very difficult to track them down,"" Choi Sang-myong, a senior official at South Korea\'s cybersecurity firm Hauri, told Free Asia Radio, according to Yonhap. ""Since tracking down the culprits is very difficult, North Korea had jumped on the bandwagon of bitcoin extortion since around 2012.""\n\nThe apparent theft comes as North Korea looks for ways boost its hard currency amid an onslaught of sanctions levied against leader Kim Jong Un\'s regime, according to Radio Free Asia.\n\nIt\'s not the first report of hacking from North Korea aimed at the capital markets. North Korean hackers have been accused of transferring almost $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank\'s account at the New York Fed by using the Swift messaging network in February of last year.\n\nThe latest report comes at an interesting time for the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected plans for two bitcoin exchange-traded funds, partly because of security concerns.\n\nIn its ruling on the ETFs, the SEC said: ""Based on the record before it, the commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated.""\n\nIt continued: ""Therefore, as the exchange has not entered into, and would currently be unable to enter into, the type of surveillance-sharing agreement that has been in place with respect to all previously approved commodity-trust ETPs — agreements that help address concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market — the commission does not find the proposed rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act.""\n\nThe cryptocurrency is, however, gaining acceptance elsewhere. Japanese regulators ruled that as of April 1, bitcoin would be accepted as a legal payment method. Additionally, on Monday, Russia said it would consider recognizing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2018.\n\nBitcoin has been the top-performing currency every year since 2010, aside from 2014. It\'s up about 25% in 2017.', 'The major cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has just opened Dash trading, capping off a recent run of integrations following this year’s price spike.\n\nKraken, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Wednesday the integration of trading pairs for Dash, a cryptocurrency focused on usability and privacy as a digital cash. In addition to a Dash/Bitcoin trading pair, Kraken also added fiat trading pairs for Dash (Dash/USD and Dash/EUR), cementing the coin’s place and independence from Bitcoin. Notably, Kraken will take advantage of Dash’s InstandSend functionality, allowing for withdrawals with instantly-confirmed transactions.\n\nDaniel Diaz, the Vice President of Business Development for Dash’s Core Team, has been working closely with Kraken on the integration:\n\n“Kraken is excited to offer Dash on their trading platform and our teams are working closely to ensure clients can begin trading the currency immediately.”\n\nHe adds: “Kraken is an incredibly well established and well-structured organization and amongst the best in the exchange business. In terms of reputation, they represent the highest standard for client satisfaction. Dash is a project that has implemented very original ideas that resonate well with the market and as a top tier exchange, Kraken’s mission is to provide clients with access to digital currencies that are in demand and provide value.”\n\nA string of integrations following recent Dash price surge\n\nThe early part of this year has seen a meteoric rise for Dash, rising from a market cap of about $80 mln in January to about $480 mln today. This has solidified Dash’s position as a major cryptocurrency, lead to a series of integrations, particularly with connections to the world of fiat currency. The European cryptocurrency exchange BitPanda recently added Dash-fiat trading pairs, increasing buying options for Dash without first going through Bitcoin.\n\nRecently, early Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem partnered with the Dash DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) to create a Dash debit card. While ShakePay and SpectroCoin currently offer Dash cards, the Shrem card will be the first one widely available in the United States and will also prominently feature Dash branding on the card itself.\n\nAltcoins increasingly developing fiat trading options\n\nThis integration marks an increasing trend of altcoins developing their own fiat trading markets. In the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin is typically bought first and is used to trade other coins before Bitcoin is then used again to cash out.\n\nAdding new fiat trading pairs allows direct points of entry to alternative cryptocurrencies themselves, reducing reliance on Bitcoin for the entire cryptocurrency field.\n\nBitcoin retains a solid first place, still worth more than $1,200 at the time of writing and claiming more total value than all other cryptocurrencies combined. However, its dominance in its field has slipped recently, dropping from about 86 percent of the total cryptocurrency market share in early march to roughly 69 percent now, up slightly from an all-time low of 65 percent at the beginning of April. This change is likely the cause of cryptocurrency growing as a whole, but Bitcoin’s scaling issues, including a vicious conflict including concentrated troll campaigns, causing market share to spill over into the top alternative coins.', 'After the demonetization of 85 percent of the circulating currency in India in November 2016, ASSOCHAM organized the first global summit on Blockchain technology. Now it is all set to hold the second global summit on Blockchain technology with a focus on opportunities and challenges for the Indian economy.\n\nASSOCHAM is a ‘chamber of chambers’ in India having been in existence since 1920 and having in its fold more than 400 industry chambers. The mission of ASSOCHAM is to ‘articulate the genuine, legitimate needs and interests of its members.’ They are also thought of as promoters of new business models.\n\nGoing beyond just a nascent technology\n\nWhile the Blockchain has made a major impact in the world and its potential has been realized and is being released around the globe, in India the situation is still one of considering Blockchain as a nascent technology.\n\nThe Second Global Summit which will be held in Bangalore on Friday, 21st April 2017 will focus on opportunities and challenges associated with Blockchain technology and explore the future prospects in India.\n\nThe key discussion areas for the summit are impact of Blockchain technology on banks, insurance and financial institutions, legal perspectives and regulation from Bitcoin to Blockchain, applications of Bitcoin and Blockchain and criminal activity, security and data in the Blockchain.\n\nIt is expected that a wide variety of people from different backgrounds will attend the summit including company management, telecom and IT sector workers, security and legal heads, Bitcoin exchanges, regulators, bankers, fund managers and etc.\n\nImportant representatives of the Indian government are expected to be present including Ravi Shankar Prasad, the Minister for Law and Justice and Electronics and IT. PP Chaudhary, the Minister of State Law and Justice and Electronics and IT, Dr. A.S. Ramasastri, Director for Development and Research in Banking Technology and others.\n\nNegative news can be countered by information\n\nIn recent days there has been a lot of controversy regarding the status of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in India. This is the result of misconceptions and misunderstanding of what Blockchain and Bitcoin are all about.\n\nWe talked with Santosh Parashar, joint director and Head-Corporate Affairs and Capital Market Division of ASSOCHAM about the legality of Bitcoin and how this summit could help address these issues.\n\nHe says:\n\n“I absolutely agree that in recent days there has been a lot of news about the legality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in India. Indeed, this is happening due to the lack of related know-how at different levels in the economy. A few illegal transactions that recently came into notice cannot be ignored with reference to Bitcoin and its legality in India. In our first summit organized in March 2017, nearly all such possible negatives related to Bitcoin were addressed. They were not a fairy tale but based on worldwide experiences that may or may not happen in India. Simultaneously, the investments and transactions in Bitcoin are not altogether ceasing to an end due to any such fear of legal status in India.”\n\nSantosh further adds about learning from other countries and the role the summit is supposed to play, “The options available for India to choose from are - learning by practice, learning by mistakes or learning through others. To what extent, the cost of particular learning is affordable should be a subject matter of utmost priority. Certain countries like the US, China and Japan which had banned Bitcoin earlier and now following the trend of acceptability must have learned through mistakes. This has to be taken care of by the investors as well as the government and regulators in India because it is a matter of economic significance. In the absence of any such legal tender of Bitcoin in India, ultimately opportunity cost is foregone as there is a loss of taxes to the government. Therefore, this summit is expected to address the legal issues, applications, and implication of Blockchain Technology in the light of recent global developments happening.”\n\nIndia can become a Fintech Hub\n\nIndia has been known as an IT hub for more than a decade now. The contributions of India’s IT sector can’t be downplayed as the country is the world’s largest sourcing destination for Information technology (IT) industry and accounts for 67 percent of the $124-130 bln market according to ibef.\n\nThe industry also gives employment to close to 10 mln people. India can capitalize on its IT experience and recreate a similar success story in the Financial Technology (fintech) sector as well. The need though is for a better understanding of the possibilities that reside in this area and for changing perceptions in New Delhi.\n\nThe need for a conducive environment\n\nDemonetization was followed by a push for a Cashless India where all the transactions are done digitally. In fact, if India truly does want to go digital, it will have to rely on the emergent fintech sector and try to embrace digital currencies and Blockchain technology.\n\nSantosh points out:', 'On April 11, Vitalik Buterin, co-creator and inventor of Ethereum, a decentralized mining network and software development platform, flew to Moscow for an open lecture at Digital October Center, which is on a strategic mission to facilitate development and adoption of the Blockchain technology. The lecture was organized with the support from Wavesplatfrom prior to the upcoming international Blockchain event “Genesis Moscow Conference”.\n\nBefore the meetup, the Blockchain industry star and investors’ favorite boy spent some time chatting with the Cointelegraph about ICOs, ways to free the industry from scammers, regulations of cryptocurrencies, and other issues.\n\nWhy don’t we just gather up into consortium?\n\nIt now seems that gathering up into consortiums is trendy. There hasn’t been a week with no announcement about some global financial company or tech giant joining some sort of consortium or establishing one of its own. It is certainly a good thing, as more things can be done and faster with joined resources.\n\nHowever, there are certain concerns about their efficiency. Buterin points out:\n\n“I think that in general consortiums are a good way to build a partnership between large companies. In theory, they can be quite beneficial for one simple reason the main purpose of Blockchain applications is to create a decentralized system which is free from an absolute control by only one entity. So, it doesn’t really make much sense for one company to work with Blockchain, however, if a number of companies establish a partnership, results won’t take long to wait.”\n\nIn his opinion, this is one of the advantages of consortiums. Another advantage lays in that companies certainly contribute to the development of technology in general, not only a specific use-case, and it is very important.\n\n“Some consortiums are created just because it seems to be trendy, and there is a risk to spend a few million dollars and come up with a technology which is much worse than the one built by a group of hackers who sit somewhere in the basement,” remarks Buterin. “There are advantages but there are risks as well.”\n\nBlockchain inspires, R3 couldn’t resist\n\nLately, there has been much criticizing going the R3 direction triggered by their sudden realization of not needing Blockchain after all. Yes, sometimes it happens, you want something so badly you direct all of your efforts on making it happen, agitating a bunch of world’s largest institutions to make the party bigger and merrier. And that’s okay if eventually, you realize that you can survive without something you’ve been chasing so blindly.\n\nWas it the Dalai Lama who said that sometimes not having something is a wonderful stroke of luck? Blockchain or Blockchain-inspired – who actually cares? Now that R3 has redirected their energy on realizing the benefits of distributed ledger technology, we will just let folks do the things they have gathered for.\n\nButerin explains:\n\n“Actually what everyone is saying about R3 is a little bit too harsh, that they spent 18 months working with Blockchain, realized that it is useless, decided to drop it and move on. Actually, I have been communicating with people from R3 during all this time and from the very first day they were very frank saying that they are working on a Blockchain-inspired technology. I believe that the recent change in their strategy was simply misinterpreted. The question here is different – whether this Blockchain-inspired technology is going to be useful. Obviously, they have brilliant people in their team, who have been communicating a lot with banks and understand very well what banks really need and look for. There is a chance they will achieve what they are aiming at.”\n\nButerin shares a famous quote by Henry Ford ‘If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses’, and continues: “It is maybe not always helpful to ask people what they really want. Besides, we can always take smaller steps moving towards progress, but we can’t call it a technological revolution. My opinion is that R3 is not going to start a technological revolution.”\n\nMany people say that Blockchain is a technology way ahead of its time and that it is bringing too radical changes. Buterin sees that what the community is now doing might be risky, but if everything goes well, the results will be fantastic.\n\nPlans for improving Ethereum\n\nQuite recently Buterin announced that Ethereum is ready to transition to the proof of stake protocol, at the open lecture in Digital October, he confirmed that the transition will start soon, but not necessarily will be completed soon, as there is still a lot of work to be done.\n\nHe also shares general plans concerning further development of Ethereum:\n\n“There are a few perspectives. First of all, we will keep developing the technology and solving pressing challenges, some of them we already started working on, but there is still a lot to be done, including scaling, confidentiality, security issues. These issues need to be solved to ensure further development of the protocol and the whole ecosystem. Besides, we are focusing on the expansion of the system – to make sure that more projects are building on top of Ethereum, more companies and users working with the platform, exploring new use cases.”\n\nICO is a brilliant model but needs improvements\n\nCointelegraph was also curious to hear Buterin’s opinion concerning the first wave of ICOs and the ways to ensure the cleanliness in the space from all sorts of scams.\n\nButerin says to Cointelegraph:\n\n“ICO as a model has a number of huge advantages. For instance, through ICO we can democratize participation in the projects from the very beginning. This model is a perfect way to give everyone an opportunity to contribute to the development of the project from the very early stages. We definitely need to work hard to improve this space. There are a lot of projects nowadays launching their ICOs, some of them are really brilliant and promising, some simply will not kick off, but there are also this kind of ICOs where people are trying to raise funds with one simple goal – to escape with these funds. Sometimes it’s really hard to see the scams among ICOs.”\n\nButerin thinks that smart contracts could actually solve some of the problems in this space. For instance, in his opinion, the money invested in the ICO should not go directly to the team behind ICO, instead, it should be forwarded to the smart contract controlled by a number of people, assigned as trusted entities.\n\nFunds should be forwarded to the team only upon authorization given only when it was proved that the project is indeed under development.\n\nButerin continues:\n\n“This model has a potential to significantly decrease a number of scams among ICOs. It could be brilliant to have some independent organizations or analysts who would evaluate projects and give recommendations concerning investment prospects. The solution will be found through this kind of approaches. It is important to keep in mind that due to an increasing number of scams, really good projects often get a negative feedback from the community only because people get suspicious and think that all ICOs are scams.”\n\nBitcoin can mature without ETF\n\nIt is never boring in the cryptocurrency community, would you agree? We have lived through all kinds of dramas. The recent decision of the Securities Exchange Commission to deny the proposal for Bitcoin ETF triggered another one. But we didn’t stay disappointed for long. Bitcoin price might have plunged following the decision but it soon recovered, so as our broken hearts.\n\nButerin says:\n\n“Indeed the proposal for Bitcoin ETF was recently declined in the US, but I know that in other countries there are a few Bitcoin ETFs, there is even one in the US, however, it operates under special conditions. I am certain that in the short term cryptocurrencies are able to grow and mature even without these funds. Those who want to take part in the cryptocurrency industry will do it without any ETFs. The fact that the proposal was declined doesn’t actually make any harm to Bitcoin.”\n\nGood for Bitcoin - good for altcoins\n\nA few industry experts recently pointed out to an interesting trend – when the Bitcoin price declines, people don’t rush to back to traditional currencies, they rather invest into alternative coins, therefore staying within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nButerin explains:\n\n“This is happening because people start realizing that cryptocurrencies actually have the future. Besides, people understand that there is a problem specific for Bitcoin, which significantly slows down the system. If this problem persists, it will only harm Bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies. The market understands that what affects Bitcoin would not necessarily affect other cryptocurrencies.”\n\nHowever, in general, Buterin agrees that what’s good for Bitcoin, good for other cryptocurrencies, and maturation and wider adoption of Bitcoin have only positive implications for altcoins. “There is certainly some degree of competition between cryptocurrencies, however, I think that cooperation is getting more important than competition,” he says.\n\nSpeaking of the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum, Buterin says that these two have stopped competing long time ago:\n\n“Well, Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing different things. Bitcoin is a digital currency, and the protocol is written to sustain this cryptocurrency. Clearly, Ethereum platform has ETH, it is also a digital currency, but it exists to sustain the protocol. The protocol was written for a vast amount of applications, both in the area of payments and going far beyond payments.”\n\nGenerally, Buterin seems to be optimistic about the current state of cryptocurrency industry, and the fact that regulators are showing more and more interest in this phenomenon of digital money, which at first seemed to them all bizarre.\n\nButerin concludes:\n\n“There are advanced governments all around the world. Central Banks in Estonia, UK, Russia are testing cryptocurrencies and their potential. Actually, people interested in cryptocurrencies are everywhere, but another question here is how to convince others to start learning about it at least, and then make them understand that this thing should be allowed and not forbidden. At this point, it all looks bright I think, we will see what happens next.""\n\nBlockchain Weekend arranged by Digital October in Moscow has established itself as a practical course in which you can immerse yourself in the world of Blockchain technology, not just by listening to the lectures but also by upgrading your skills, and of course talking directly to the industry professionals. On May 26th, 2017, Digital October with support from Wavesplatform is to hold the first international Blockchain conference in Russia “Genesis Moscow Conference” with top-notch speakers and true legends of the Blockchain community.

The bill was first introduced in January, clearing its first vote the following month.\n\nWhile not guaranteed to be signed, the broad support the bill attracted signals that it may pass.\n\nStill, its contents could lead some digital currency-focused startups to think twice about operating in the state – and in the past year, several firms have already pulled out, citing a difficult regulatory environment.\n\nThe bill represents an update to the state\'s existing money transmission laws, in order to make them account for firms that handle digital currencies.\n\nAccording to the text of the measure, businesses would be required to maintain reserves – denominated in the relevant digital currency – equal to the funds they retain on behalf of their customers.\n\nThe bill states:\n\n""A licensee transmitting virtual currencies must hold like-kind virtual currencies of the same volume as that held by the licensee but which is obligated to consumers in lieu of the permissible investments required in of this subsection.""\n\nOther requirements include mandatory third-party cybersecurity audits of ""all electronic information and data systems"", the text reads.\n\nEven absent the new legislation, the past months have shown that some startups working with the tech have moved to steer clear of the state. These include digital currency exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Poloniex, the latter of which moved to exit Washington just last week.\n\nAccording to an email circulating on social media and dated 8th April, Poloniex said that it would be suspending services to customers in the state after 21st April.\n\nThe full text of the bill can be found below:\n\n5031-S.PL by CoinDesk on Scribd\n\nWashington State Capitol, Olympia, WA via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

I began studying bitcoin and watching how it was used. Unbeknownst to me, my business partner, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, was doing exactly the same.\n\nIn particular, he was watching how bitcoin was being successfully used around the world after the Cyprus bailout and studying its underlying blockchain technology.\n\nToward the end of the year, the two of us began to talk about bitcoin...\n\n***\n\nAs bitcoin interest and adoption grew, we saw technological, capitalistic and philosophic reasons to offer our customers a secure, decentralized, immutable way to buy products. In December 2013, wanting to make it possible for bitcoin users to purchase products from us, we included our senior management team in the discussion.\n\nAnd the team quickly decided bitcoin as a payment method was a good idea.\n\nBecause Overstock had lots of projects in the queue, we figured Overstock would get to coding the bitcoin project sometime during the first half of 2014. But, as news of this decision spread throughout the company, 40 of our best developers, all eager to be involved in the bitcoin project, wanted to speed it up.\n\n""Why take six months? This is a big deal,"" they said.\n\nOur developers volunteered for immediate duty.\n\n***\n\nStraight away, we formed a team that began work the week between Christmas and New Year\'s.\n\nWanting to be undistracted and uninterrupted, the team locked themselves in a room (and asked that pizza be slid under the door) so they could work on integrating the technology into our website.\n\n(At Overstock, we often create special project teams and give them their own ""war room"" so they can focus on the project.) This was just such a case.\n\nThe team was singularly focused on the project over the holidays. They were bitcoin believers and it showed in their dedication to the project.\n\nAfter just two weeks of hard work, on 9th January, 2014, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin.\n\n***\n\nThe buzz among the bitcoin community was huge. The press was quick to tout our pioneering action. Bitcoin holders came to Overstock in droves to purchase products.\n\nIn the following weeks and months, Patrick and I were asked to speak about bitcoin and why Overstock decided to accept the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile the decision to accept bitcoin seems like an easy and smart one, in retrospect, there were a number of factors that led our team to conclude an alternative currency was a good fit for Overstock.\n\nOverstock is a technology company at its core. We built our brand around leveraging technologies to provide our customers with the best possible shopping experience. Because of this, we constantly experiment with new technologies across a variety of applications.\n\nBitcoin was no exception. As we began to better understand bitcoin’s underlying technology – the blockchain – it was clear the decentralized and distributed infrastructure allowed for almost no possibility of exploitation. That, when combined with the immutable nature of the ledger, provided a level of security and transparency never before seen in a currency.\n\n***\n\nWhen we began accepting bitcoin, we accessed a new demographic of customers with plenty of bitcoin to spend, but few places to spend it.\n\nThe bitcoin community is a loyal and engaged one, and we believed they would return Overstock\'s faith in the currency with continued patronage. We were right.\n\nFiscally, the decision made a great deal of sense, too. We eliminated credit card transaction costs on bitcoin purchases, thus increasing our profit within the tight margins of e-commerce.\n\nBitcoin still combines the convenience, transparency and security of an online-based payment method with the virtues of a currency that has a finite supply of infinitely divisible units and predictable growth patterns. This duality supports our belief that a limited government, without the power to create currency at will for self-sustaining purposes, is the best business model for any nation.\n\n***\n\nWhile you might not hear much about its retail use cases anymore, Overstock still accepts bitcoin.\n\nThe digital currency\'s non-governmental nature still allows for easy global adoption, leading to efficient trade between individuals and companies without the cumbersome currency exchange processes and costs.\n\nJust as the internet allowed the world the freedom to communicate across borders and cultures, bitcoin and other non-governmental cryptocurrencies allow the world the freedom to trade goods in much the same way.\n\nOther retailers and industries soon followed our lead and the public began to see bitcoin less as a fringe idea and more as a safe, globally accessible way to purchase goods and services from reputable organizations.\n\nWhile bitcoin is responsible for less than 1% of our annual revenue, our experience integrating it with our website allowed us to understand the true potential of blockchain technology.\n\nIn late 2014, we went so far as to create Medici Ventures, a subsidiary company focused on developing and advancing blockchain technology.\n\nToday, you can use bitcoin to pay for everything from a computer to a vacation to college tuition.\n\nAnd, it all started with saying yes to accepting.\n\nBoxes image via Overstock.com\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

I am not going to support it on BTC because I am a bitcoin HODLER. Meanwhile, I do not have a single litecoin. — Wang Chun (@f2pool_wangchun) April 13, 2017\n\nWhat are Chun’s intent and motive?\n\nDuring an interview in February, Chun reaffirmed that F2Pool is pushing the activation of SegWit on Litecoin to observe its impact on overall scaling, on-chain capacity expansion and providing an infrastructure for two-layer solutions. At the time, Chun planned to support SegWit on Bitcoin upon the activation of SegWit on Litecoin.\n\nSince then, Chun has emphasized his opposition to the Bitcoin Unlimited software and its team, due to multiple bug exploitations and the software’s instability. However, Chun has since expressed his concern over the Bitcoin Core development team as well.\n\nIn a rather conflicting statement, Chun wrote to Cointelegraph’s journalist:\n\n“I've tried my best to love Core. But Core doesn't love me. Now I know Charlie Lee has a backup plan and it is called UASF.”\n\nChun’s criticism of Bitcoin Core came as a surprise to the Bitcoin community as he previously explained that Greg Maxwell, a Bitcoin Core developer, helped make his decision to support SegWit on Litecoin. It is highly likely that Maxwell introduced the benefits and advantages of activating SegWit and Chun agreed to observe the solution’s effect on Litecoin prior to implementing it on the Bitcoin network.\n\nCurrently, Chun is not in support of SegWit on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited. He went as far as to encourage developers to find an alternative solution to SegWit since the majority of miners are not willing to accept SegWit as a scaling solution.\n\n“If the majority of the miners say no to SegWit, developers must find an alternative solution,” Chun said.\n\nUser activated soft fork - UASF\n\nOver the past week, a new solution called Extension Blocks was introduced by Bitcoin startup Purse’s BCoin. However, the community doesn’t seem to be convinced as of yet that Extension Blocks is the answer to Bitcoin scaling.\n\nBased on the current trend, a user activated soft fork (UASF) is likely, considering that some of the largest businesses and companies within the Bitcoin industry already expressed their support toward UASF.\n\nThroughout this month, Chun has changed his stance on SegWit and Bitcoin scaling in multiple occasions. On April 6, Chun stated that he decided to reconsider SegWit on Litecoin.\n\nWhile Chun has been offering ambiguous statements to his followers and to the Bitcoin community, it is still likely that Chun will change his stance on SegWit on Bitcoin if the solution is activated properly on Litecoin."", 'Segregated Witness (SegWit) support has been on the rise ever since the disclosure of the covert usage of AsicBoost by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell.\n\nOn April 5, Maxwell sent out a letter entitled “Inhibiting a covert attack on the Bitcoin POW function” to the Bitcoin development mailing list. In it, Maxwell explained the possibility of utilizing a method called AsicBoost to exploit a flaw in the Proof of Work function of Bitcoin.\n\nMaxwell wrote:\n\n“There are two major ways of exploiting the underlying vulnerability: One obvious way which is highly detectable and is not in use on the network today and a covert way which has significant interaction and potential interference with the Bitcoin protocol. The covert mechanism is not easily detected except through its interference with the protocol. In particular, the protocol interactions of the covert method can block the implementation of virtuous improvements such as segregated witness.”\n\nBitmain reaction\n\nUpon the release of Maxwell’s letter, the vast majority of the community assumed that the company or the ASIC manufacturer in question was Bitmain. In fact, Bitcoin journalist Kyle Torpey confirmed with a source that Bitmain was the company mentioned in Maxwell’s letter.\n\nAs expected, Bitmain refuted the claims of Maxwell with a response statement. In it, Bitmain denied the usage of AsicBoost on the mainnet of Bitcoin but admitted to testing the technology on testnet, which further validated the statement of Maxwell.\n\n“I never alleged that I could prove they were using it on mainnet, only that their hardware secretly supported it. They\'ve admitted to putting it in their hardware and to using it on testnet. They claim that haven\'t used it on mainnet ""for the good of the network""-- but the constantly produce empty blocks (a potential asicboost sign) and argued that it was fine because the protocol permits it, when people complained,” Maxwell said in a separate statement.\n\nControversy deepens\n\nControversy on the Bitmain-AsicBoost discussion deepened when various users discovered several loopholes in the public statement of Bitmain. Although the company denied the actual usage of AsicBooost on Bitcoin’s mainnet, it did not specify whether their statement applied to its subsidiaries and other companies they own.\n\n""More importantly, Bitmain admitted their ownership of a patent on AsicBoost.""\n\nHowever, the company was criticized for failing to credit the original inventors of AsicBoost Timo Hanke and Sergio Lerner, who reportedly hold a patent on AsicBoost elsewhere.\n\nWhalepanda, a cryptocurrency trader, further emphasized in his blog post that Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu’s strange behavior and his support for AsicBoost-compatible solutions or proposals such as a BCoin’s extension block proves his intent to protect AsicBoost from being disabled permanently with solutions like SegWit.\n\nWhalepanda wrote:\n\n“Yesterday BCoin’s proposal came with Extension Blocks which is compatible with ASICBoost. BCoin didn’t follow the normal rules of Bitcoin proposals but got the media immediately involved. EB was nothing new, they just needed another excuse to stall.”\n\nApart from his AsicBoost discovery, Maxwell and the rest of the Bitcoin Core development team privately disclosed bugs and technical errors in the Bitcoin Unlimited software to its development team. In return, the Bitcoin Unlimited development team has been attempting for weeks to publicize supposed bugs in Core’s software although they turned out to be non-existent.\n\n“Next time you have a suspected vulnerability in Bitcoin Core, it would be helpful if told us immediately instead of discussing it in public for 13 days first. There are vulnerabilities in unlimited which have been privately reported to you in Unlimited by Bitcoin Core folks which you have not acted on, sadly. More severe than this one, in fact,” Maxwell said.\n\nSo far, Maxwell has made a point in disclosing bugs and errors in the Bitcoin Unlimited software and unraveling the intent behind some mining pools and companies which opposed SegWit.', ""The percentage of Bitcoin’s network hashrate signaling support for Bitcoin Unlimited has more than doubled from 16 percent to 35 percent over the past month. During this period, various Bitcoin businesses and organizations have become increasingly critical of Bitcoin Unlimited’s concept of Emergent Consensus.\n\n\n\nEmergent Consensus is the idea that the hard-coded limit on the size of blocks on the Bitcoin network should be replaced with a configurable variable for miners and full nodes. Users and miners would need to coordinate with each other before changing their block size preferences if the goal is for everyone to remain on the same chain.\n\nThe general lack of support for Emergent Consensus among Bitcoin companies and organizations has led some to question why some mining pools, such as Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC, are running the Bitcoin Unlimited software client (or at least signaling support for it).\n\nTo gain a better understanding of various mining pools’ reasons for signaling support for Emergent Consensus, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC, the latter of which recently raised 20 million CNY ($2.91 million) to launch a new, global bitcoin exchange.\n\nRepresentatives from both pools claimed that support for Segregated Witness (SegWit), which is implemented in Bitcoin Core and not Bitcoin Unlimited, is overstated and that Bitcoin Unlimited is the best option for solving issues related to transaction backlogs and historically high U.S. dollar-denominated transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin.com and ViaBTC Claim Bitcoin Businesses Don’t ‘Support’ Segregated Witness\n\nIn the view of Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC, support for SegWit has been overstated, as there is a difference between technically implementing a proposal and actively supporting it.\n\n“Segregated Witness is technically supported by wallets and exchanges,” Emil Oldenburg, the CTO at Bitcoin.com, told Bitcoin Magazine. “SegWit was implemented in these wallets at a time when it looked like SegWit had bigger support [in the community] than it actually had. Just because someone implemented SegWit into their wallet doesn't mean they support it and would vote for it.”\n\nCoin Dance segregates support for SegWit into two separate categories: those who support it technically in their software and those who advocate for the adoption of the proposal on the network. Currently, SegWit is technically supported by 61 of the tracked companies and is advocated for by 68 of the tracked companies. There are seven companies listed as opposed to SegWit, two of which are bitcoin mining pools.\n\nOf course, it should be noted that all companies tracked by Coin Dance are not equally relevant. For example the largest bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers have a greater impact on the discussion due to the large amount of economic activity that takes place on their full nodes.\n\nNo bitcoin exchange or wallet provider is listed as opposed to SegWit on Coin Dance. In fact, many of the most economically relevant Bitcoin companies, from Blockchain.info to Coinbase, BitGo to Xapo, have publicly advocated for the change.\n\n“The wallets we talked to said they implemented SegWit in case it will activate, not because they love SegWit or want it activated,” Oldenburg continued. “This is a marketing trick from Bitcoin Core. Just because someone says they will use SegWit, doesn't mean they want it or politically support it.”\n\nRepresentatives from Bitcoin.com did not name any specific companies as supporting evidence for the claim that they only implemented SegWit because it may eventually be activated on the network; however, as Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver commented to Bitcoin Magazine, “I’m sure there are lots of them that implemented SegWit because the censorship caused them to mistakenly assume that it was going to be adopted. Now some of them are falling victim to the sunk costs fallacy as well.”\n\nVer has routinely criticized the moderation policies of certain Bitcoin-related discussion forums, most notably the /r/Bitcoin subreddit. This is the perceived censorship Ver is blaming for the adoption of SegWit by various Bitcoin companies.\n\n“The fact that Bitcoin businesses, exchanges, wallets are ‘ready’ for SegWit activation doesn’t mean they ‘support’ it,’” Haipo Yang, CEO of ViaBTC, said. “They are just preparing in advance for what is needed if it happens.”\n\nDoes Bitcoin Unlimited Have Any Support?\n\nAccording to Oldenburg, developers who contribute to Bitcoin Core are trying to pitch a narrative that users don’t want Bitcoin Unlimited. Much like Ver, Oldenburg pointed to “extreme censorship” on the most popular discussion platforms as a reason it’s difficult to tell what users want.\n\nOldenburg also disputed the “narrative” from Bitcoin Core contributors that only those who run a full node are “real” Bitcoin users. “The truth is that most Bitcoin users are not Core users,” Oldenburg claimed. “The most popular wallet in the world is Blockchain.info. They are responsible for more bitcoin transactions than all other wallets combined.”\n\n“Blockchain.info supports bigger blocks and wants Bitcoin to scale,” Oldenburg continued. “Breadwallet is the most popular wallet for iPhone users and they also support bigger blocks for Bitcoin and a block size increase.”\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that both Blockchain.info and Breadwallet have made no public comments in support of Bitcoin Unlimited’s Emergent Consensus proposal. On the contrary, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith tweeted “I don’t think [Bitcoin Unlimited] is ready for prime time,” back in January.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Smith has also publicly advocated for SegWit on behalf of Blockchain.info.\n\nRepresentatives from Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC did not share examples of any companies that explicitly support Bitcoin Unlimited’s concept of Emergent Consensus (and not an increase in the block size limit more generally). According to Coin Dance, 27 companies advocate for the adoption of Emergent Consensus, eight of which are involved in bitcoin mining. Of those 27 companies, OKCoin is the only exchange or wallet provider.\n\nWhy Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC Are Running Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nAccording to Oldenburg and Yang, Bitcoin Unlimited is a solution to the problem of a congested Bitcoin network, which users would like to see solved as soon as possible.\n\n“What all these users want is an uncongested network with faster confirmations and lower fees,” Oldenburg said. “This can only be achieved by bigger blocks that currently is only supported by Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic.”\n\n“SegWit is a solution for malleability, but not one for the most urgent block scaling issue,” Yang added. “We support Bitcoin Unlimited because it focuses on the most dire problem. And a well-planned hard fork can also resolve malleability issues in a simple and safe way.”\n\nOldenburg also claimed that most people at the meetups he attends across the world are supportive of the removal of Bitcoin’s one megabyte block size limit.\n\n“At most meetups we attend, nine out of ten people want bigger blocks and want Bitcoin to scale properly,” Oldenburg said. “When we talk to exchanges we also hear that they are worried about the congestion and high fees. It's hurting their business and most exchanges now are busy integrating altcoins. If [there is] one team that [is] not listening to the users, it's the Core developers who have utterly refused to do anything about the block size limit for years.”\n\nIt should be pointed out that, as evidenced by this 3.7 megabyte block mined on Bitcoin’s testnet, SegWit would enable larger blocks on the Bitcoin network. “[SegWit] is not a block size increase for the type of transactions that everyone on the network is using today,” Ver said when asked about this point. “To the extent that it is a block size increase, it is nowhere near a big enough one.”\n\nAccording to Oldenburg, Bitcoin Unlimited is gaining more support and more people are starting to understand it. However, recent public statements from Bitpay, BitGo, Colu, GreenAddress, Armory, BHB Network, economically-relevant Bitcoin nodes in Canada, and others indicate the opposite trend is true. According to Coin Dance, 47 of the companies they track are explicitly against Bitcoin Unlimited’s concept of Emergent Consensus.\n\nOne member of Bitcoin Unlimited, Rhett Creighton, has also left the project in the aftermath of the recent ASICBOOST controversy.\n\nNote: In addition to ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com, Bitcoin Magazine also reached out to Antpool, Chandler Guo, and GBMiners via email. No responses were received from these additional three entities.""]"

If that happens, it will follow the order of China and Russia which have both shown growing interest in Bitcoin. Moreover, the three constitute the most powerful of the arrangement.', 'As first revealed by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream Co-Founder and CTO Gregory Maxwell, and subsequently confirmed by Bitmain through a press release, the major Chinese mining hardware manufacturer has included the AsicBoost technology in its specialized ASIC chips.\n\n\n\nThis is controversial, in large part because AsicBoost is patented and therefore potentially skews Bitcoin’s mining ecosystem by government regulation. Furthermore, covert use of AsicBoost, as it turns out, is largely incompatible with a Segregated Witness soft fork (SegWit), the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team.\n\nWhile it is not clear that Bitmain has actually used AsicBoost, and the company denies this is the reason it blocks SegWit, many do believe a response is required.\n\nHaving broken down the “AsicBoost scandal” in a previous article, what follows here are some options moving forward.\n\nAsicBoost\n\nFirst, a quick recap on Bitcoin mining and AsicBoost. (Skip if you already know the details.)\n\nBitcoin miners construct blocks of data. These blocks include transactions, some random data (a “nonce”) and more. Once constructed, a miner hashes his block, which is a mathematical trick that scrambles and compresses all the data into a short and random string of numbers: a hash. If this hash happens to start with enough zeroes, the block is valid and it can be submitted to the network. If it’s not valid, the miner will have to try again, for example by changing the nonce.\n\nTo construct and hash a block, miners have to invest a tiny bit of computing power, hence, energy. In effect, this means that any time a miner finds a valid block, he must have statistically invested much more energy for all of the invalid blocks he also constructed.\n\nA valid hash is therefore quite literally proof that a miner did a specific amount of work, which is why this process is called “proof of work.” This proof of work is what makes Bitcoin relatively immutable. The only way an attacker can rewrite history is to have access to specialized hardware and invest real energy to redo all the work.\n\nAsicBoost allows miners to take a “shortcut.” Instead of blindly hashing as many variations of a block as possible, AsicBoost lets miners reuse a certain calculation in the hash process across several tries. This saves some 15 to 30 percent of energy.\n\nAsicBoost can be used in two ways: overtly and covertly. Overt use would be obvious to anyone; it’s easily detected by looking at the blocks a miner produces. Covert use, however, is much harder, if not impossible, to detect. Only covert use is largely incompatible with SegWit.\n\nBitmain’s chips allow for both overt and covert use, but the company has certainly not used AsicBoost overtly. There are several indications that Bitmain has used AsicBoost covertly, but the company denies that it has, and it is so far unproven.\n\nOption One: Do Nothing\n\nThe first option in light of the AsicBoost revelations is, of course, to do nothing at all.\n\nAssuming Bitmain uses AsicBoost, or will use it in the future, miners (or, more accurately, mining hardware manufacturers) will then have to gain access to the patent as well, or compete on other grounds. Depending on how much added profit AsicBoost actually provides (this is somewhat disputed), this could be viable at least in the short term. Whether it’s viable in the long term, however, is much less certain.\n\nAlternatively, the patent could be made free to the public.\n\nOne of the patent holders, Sergio Demian Lerner, suggested this as an option, though he doesn’t appear very keen on doing so without any reward.\n\nAnd in their press release Bitmain alluded to freeing the patent too, writing:\n\n“If all mining equipment could use AsicBoost, it will lower the J/GH cost and the total network hash rate will increase, making the Bitcoin network even stronger. So, the AsicBoost method is not a ‘covert attack’ on the Bitcoin PoW function. It is an engineering optimization.”\n\nAnd:\n\n“We suggest working with the patent owners so that the patent could be used by the public.”\n\nWhile this could be a good option, it should be noted that (contrary to Bitmain’s press release) freeing the patent would not really increase Bitcoin’s security in a meaningful way.\n\nThis is because in a competitive mining landscape, any energy saved by miners would really have to be re-invested to increase the hash rate. But the purpose of proof of work is not, in itself, finding valid hashes. Hashes are just random numbers and don’t provide security in and of themselves.\n\nRather, the purpose of proof of work is … proving work.\n\nIf all miners were to use AsicBoost, the hash rate would go up, but miners would not invest more energy. In other words, if all miners take the same “shortcut,” that shortcut just becomes the “main route.”\n\nAs such, reversing a transaction would not be any harder. An attacker would still need access to specialized hardware and would have to invest the same amount of energy.\n\nThat is not a problem — but it does not benefit anyone either.\n\nOption Two: Blocking Covert AsicBoost\n\nOf course, the main reason Maxwell revealed that Bitmain is implementing AsicBoost in their chips wasn’t so much because of AsicBoost itself; rather, it was because of Segregated Witness. More specifically, since covert use of AsicBoost is largely incompatible with SegWit, it may stop Bitmain from activating the proposed SegWit soft fork.\n\nIn his draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) sent to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Maxwell therefore proposed to block only the covert version of AsicBoost (or, really, make it significantly more expensive to use). If covert use of AsicBoost is blocked, it would at least take away that reason to block SegWit.\n\nBitcoin users can block covert use of AsicBoost with a user-activated soft fork (UASF), which effectively forces miners to pick one of two options: miners would have to either activate Segregated Witness, or they would have to include something in their blocks that doesn’t actually do anything — except block AsicBoost.\n\nThis would still leave miners with the choice to either activate Segregated Witness or not. And they could still use the overt version of AsicBoost as well.\n\nAs such (and as opposed to what Bitmain suggested in its press release), the BIP will not result in loss for patent owners. If anything, it would help patent owners: it would ensure that no one covertly breaches the patent. Indeed, Lerner supports blocking covert use of AsicBoost, and he even resubmitted Maxwell’s BIP proposal using different terminology.\n\nBitmain, however, has not commented on the BIP so far, and it is still unclear whether the company will support it. (Of course, if the company is not covertly using AsicBoost, it would have little reason to oppose the proposal.)\n\nAlternatively, AsicBoost can be blocked by adopting the latest iteration of Extension Blocks, an alternative scaling solution proposed by the Bcoin development team.\n\nAs another option, Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song suggested that instead of making covert use of AsicBoost impossible, perhaps overt use should be incentivized. This added incentive could be combined with Segregated Witness, which could give miners one more reason to active the soft fork.\n\nOption Three: Blocking All of AsicBoost\n\nFor some, however, blocking the covert version of AsicBoost alone is not enough.\n\nSince AsicBoost is patented, and patents are state-enforced, the concern is that this could lead to a situation where mining becomes semi-permissioned: mining profitably would effectively require permission from the patent holders and the state(s) that enforces the patents. This could in turn lead to a more centralized, and perhaps even regulated, mining ecosystem.\n\nBitcoin Core developers Peter Todd and Matt Corallo, for example, have suggested that the Bitcoin protocol should be changed to make AsicBoost irrelevant altogether.\n\nThis can of course be done with a hard fork; the initial idea was to bundle it with a hard fork that was part of the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus (better known as the “Hong Kong Agreement”). But since the initial hard fork proposals resulting from this agreement have failed to gain consensus so far, this option seems off the table for now. Alternatively, AsicBoost can be soft forked out of the current protocol.\n\nBut perhaps unsurprisingly, the patent holders dislike these options, while others are afraid that changing the protocol in response to what they consider to be an optimization would disincentivize future innovation. Blocking all of AsicBoost, therefore, still seems like a long shot for now.\n\nOption Four: Proof of Work Change\n\nFinally, there’s the “nuclear option.”\n\nIn an ecosystem where a relatively small group of people has come to control a relatively large chunk of all hash power on the Bitcoin network, and where either AsicBoost-related motives or “political” motives seem to have played a part in blocking Segregated Witness, some — like the pseudonymous “Praxeology Guy” — propose that the best way forward is to change the proof of work algorithm entirely. This would render all existing mining hardware useless and would “reset” the mining landscape back to where more regular users can participate, while disabling AsicBoost at the same time.\n\nChanging Bitcoin’s proof of work algorithm is very controversial, however, in large part because it punishes all current miners. And as for any hard fork, it would require everyone to switch to a new protocol. This is no easy task — especially given its controversial nature.\n\nThis article has been updated for accuracy.', 'There are quite a few wild stories circulating in the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. One such story mentions how North Korean hackers allegedly stole 73 bitcoin over the past two years. This initial report was made by Radio Free Asia, although it is unclear how legitimate their information is. It appears all of this money has been stolen from South Korea, further increasing the tension between both countries.\n\nWhat Is The Deal With Bitcoin and North Korea?\n\nFor some unknown reason, mainstream media quickly picked up on this bitcoin story. The claims of how North Korean hackers successfully stole over US$88,000 worth of bitcoin from South Korea is quite an interesting story, assuming there is any truth to it in the first place. It is believed the North Korean hackers stole bitcoin once Seoul shut down the Kaesong joint industrial zone. This claim is made by a senior official at South Korean cybersecurity firm Hauri Inc.\n\nWhile it is true, there is a clear correlation between hackers and bitcoin, it remains unclear why North Korean hackers would want bitcoin in the first place. Bitcoin is not officially recognized as a currency in that part of the world. Moreover, it appears there are no particular use cases for BTC in the country either. Moreover, bitcoin is perhaps one of the easiest to track currencies in the world, making it less appealing to hackers and other criminals than most people would think.\n\nOne way the North Korean hackers could successfully extract bitcoin from the Southern counterparts is by deploying ransomware. Over the past few years, ransomware has become a significant threat to computer users and enterprises all over the world. It is not unlikely there are state-sponsored ransomware campaigns at work although it will be virtually impossible to back up those claims with credible evidence anytime soon.\n\nFor the time being, this entire news story seems to be trying to put things together without providing any real evidence. It is not the first time the media tries to give bitcoin a bad name either. North Korean hackers have successfully committed hacks against South Korea and other countries in the past. However, there has never been any verifiable link to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to date. It would be interesting to know what North Korea’s stance on bitcoin is, though.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Pexels', 'Japan has emerged as a leading player in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology markets. The country, following its recent regulation recognizing Bitcoin as a currency and a legal mode of payment, has now taken a step towards creating a standard blockchain platform for the Japanese banking industry.\n\nThere are a number of blockchain platforms currently available in the market. The global banking and financial sector, after understanding the benefits of blockchain solutions in their operations are invested in research and development of the technology. The choice of blockchain platform among these banks currently varies from existing solutions to new ones that are being built from scratch. This approach has created concerns about interoperability of these blockchain solutions.\n\nThe banking industry depends on a network of domestic and international banks to facilitate the flow of money and information between accounts. The Japanese Bankers Association is going to make it possible by urging the member institutions to conduct their research and development activities on a common blockchain platform. The approach adopted by the association also helps in standardizing the blockchain solution across all the banking institutions, making an allowance for seamless integration and onboarding of new organizations.\n\nThe blockchain initiative was announced yesterday by the Japanese Bankers Association. It will be similar to many global scale projects like R3 Blockchain Consortium, Hyperledger Project and more. According to reports, the Japanese banks that part of the association will start trials of the developed distributed ledger solutions later this fall.\n\nOnce the blockchain solution is widely adopted across Japan’s banking institutions, the transaction costs are expected to go down by about 90%. The distributed ledger network will eventually replace the existing Zengin server system currently connecting the banks.\n\nThe implementation of blockchain solutions in the country’s banking sector will help mainstream banking and financial institutions readily deal with Bitcoin transactions and investments. This capability will come in handy as Bitcoin usage is set to increase in the country following its newly attained legal status.\n\nRef: Nikkei Asian Review | Image: NewsBTC', 'This week, the blockchain technology arena has seen its biggest (and perhaps most famous) deal of its time.\n\nnChain Holdings, the company built around the research of Craig Wright, has been sold for $300 million to private investment firm High Tech Private Equity Fund SICAV plc.\n\nWhat makes this story unique is that Wright is the man who claims to be the inventor of bitcoin cryptocurrency.

We have the funds, the people and the technology to do this.”\n\nAlthough Wright is claiming to be the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whom everyone knows to be the founder of bitcoin, many people in the field view him as an alienating figure.

04/15/2017,"['The evolution of technology in the finance space has been interesting to say the least. The potential of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is considerable, though one must also be wary at this stage.\n\nIf you had asked me a few months ago what I thought about Bitcoins and the Blockchain technology in general, I’d probably reply with the same words you read in every headline related to this field — a decentralised, public ledger-based cryptocurrency. Now, fast forwarding to the present day, I’d describe it as a monetisable peer-to-peer protocol token that is maintained in a digitally scarce manner. I am beginning to understand the implications of this techno-financial Blockchain phenomenon on the various industries it will touch.\n\nIt all really reached the peak for me when I saw Naval Ravikant’s tweet and closely followed his thoughts on this matter.\n\nValue is seeping out of the venture business and into public blockchains where, ironically, individuals can play but VC funds cannot. — Naval Ravikant (@naval) March 20, 2017\n\nIt’s tough to argue with the fact that Bitcoins are at best seen as a digital gold with a certain degree of volatility, all constructed over social trust. What I really found out, though, is that there is a whole different world of AppCoins and Protocol Tokens that has started to come up now. It’s not uncommon to see regular VCs raising LP money through such offerings, hedge funds investing in these cryptocurrencies, and super-computer networks offering coins to be later used to access their network.\n\nA simple search will reveal that it’s still only a tiny fraction (~$ 29 billion market cap of all cryptocurrencies) in the whole financial pyramid of venture financing. These digital assets will require whole new investor mindsets to master — different kind of theses, evaluation methods, and trading skill sets to be able to participate in this protocol layer asset. These are highly risky, sometimes liquid, and often a democratised way of betting on a particular protocol’s usage. It’s easy to brush off Bitcoin and other such AltCoins as pump and dump schemes or even say that the ones driving these ecosystems forward are the ones who are most invested in it. It is true that it may be advisable to approach this space with caution. When things are not linked to an identity and most often anonymous, it’s impossible to recover what you have lost in the form of a private key.\n\nI went digging down the rabbit hole and ended up getting further intrigued by this ecosystem. The current breed of Indian crypto-wallets have ridiculous spreads (buy-sell) that make it impossible to do short term trades, not to mention that the UI/UX of these providers makes it seem like they are catering to a crowd from the previous generation. It’s better to look at exchanges that have more breadth and are operated by regulated players in international markets. It’s easier to ‘ShapeShift’ to coins that aren’t easily available, because apart from basic Bitcoin wallets and a single Ethereum exchange in India, there isn’t much to choose from.\n\nZebPay has a good public document that tries to argue around the tax and legal implications. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), meanwhile, seems to be confused on this matter. They seem to be forthcoming in doing research into this field, but backward in issuing strict notices cautioning against the use of these.\n\nThis is a call to all financial cryptographers and Blockchain enthusiasts of India to lead the way. I am happy to buy you a cup of coffee if you can enlighten me more by showing me some interesting projects that you are attempting in this space. These could be interesting concept whitepapers, commercial applications, or middleware for other developers to lean on. I will be delighted if there are any trading enthusiasts willing to discuss their ‘AltFolios’ and strategies. Find me on Twitter.\n\nP.S. — All views and thoughts expressed here are personal and not representative of any organisation or entity.\n\n(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)', 'A group called the “Large Bitcoin Collider” claims it can smash open bitcoin wallets by using a so-called brute force attack, which directs mass amounts of computer power at individual wallets in order to guess their private keys.\n\nThe project, which has been underway for months, relies on a distributed network of computers (similar to bitcoin itself), and invites anyone to participate—those who do could potentially share in the proceeds of the wallets cracked open.\n\nA “trophy list” on the home page of Collider (an apparent reference to the Hadron Collider) suggests the group has successfully opened over a dozen wallets, though only three had any bitcoin in them. It’s unclear if the group is motivated by financial gain or the cryptographic challenge of smashing wallets—the answer is probably both based on the site’s webpage and outside observers.\n\nA Q&A list on the Collider’s website says robbing even a tiny amount from non-profit group like the Internet archive “would make you an unconditional jerk.” But it also suggests other wallets are fair game, and that proceeds would be divvied up among the Collider participants.\n\nMeanwhile, others think the wallet-smashing endeavor is a fool’s errand, according to Motherboard, which first reported on the Large Bitcoin Collider. In this view, the project is too hard and the rewards too low and infrequent (as this Reddit commenter explains) to pay off.\n\nBut some speculate the goal of the project is not to rob a whole lot of wallets, but instead to strike a mother lode from a long-lost wallet from bitcoin’s early days:\n\n“About 10% of Bitcoins were created early, before 2012, and have never been traded. If somebody ever finds the key of the early lost Bitcoins, they’ll have a huge payoff, over a billion dollars. Speculation is that either “Satoshi Nakamoto”, whoever he is, is holding onto them for a big payoff, or somebody lost the private key for all those early Bitcoins. As the years go on, the second explanation seems more likely,” said the top comment on the site Hacker News.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune‘s technology newsletter.\n\nAs for the process of cracking open wallets, it involves the laborious task of creating private keys—which are dozens of characters in length—and trying them against existing bitcoin addresses. The Collider has so far created and checked 3,000 trillion private keys, a researcher told Motherboard.\n\nAs for the legality of all this, it’s unclear. On one hand, the law is pretty clear that you are not supposed to join a conspiracy in order to rob people. But on the other hand, as the group’s website points out, “It is not illegal to search for colliding private keys.”\n\nFor bitcoin owners, the risk of the Large Bitcoin Collider performing a stick-up on your private wallet is pretty tiny for now. But if the process also results in someone creating a collision for bitcoin’s general hashing algorithm—as happened with the longtime crypographic standard SHA-1 (cracked by Google this year)—that would spell a lot more trouble, though as one reader points out, bitcoin’s encryption algorithm can be upgraded.', 'In a surprising move, F2Pool, which has around 9% network hardware share, began signaling for segregated witnesses (segwit), a controversial proposal that aims to increase capacity while facilitating layer two protocols such as the Lightning Network and sidechains.\n\nUnlike in litecoin, where the market rallied after F2Pool began signaling segwit, there was no price reaction in bitcoin, which may indicate the market doesn’t think there has been any change as segwit still requires another 65% of miners.\n\nMoreover, the signaling began after a somewhat peculiar series of events. Firstly, F2Pool started signaling segwit in litecoin, then surprisingly said he was re-considering, then Charlie Lee said F2pool will keep signaling, Wang Chun, F2Pool’s co-founder, confirmed, but further suggested he will keep signaling because “I scare DDoS too much.”\n\nThat’s just the starters – or just the warm up if you’re into exercising. Wang Chun then went on to say in a statement that could not possibly make his views any more clear:\n\n“Segwit will be a disaster. I am not going to support it on BTC because I am a bitcoin HODLER. Meanwhile, I do not have a single litecoin.”\n\nYou’d rationally conclude that’s that then, but it seems Wang Chun was still hungry and wanted some dessert which took the form of asking his followers a fairly peculiar question: “Should miners stop signaling segwit by the end of current activation period and switch to UASF?”\n\nMiners can’t quite signal for a UASF, otherwise known as a flag-day soft-fork. That is, after block X segwit is activated. In such scenario, miners either upgrade or don’t upgrade. Plus, there is no difference between the two as far as miners are concerned because for miners all forks are hardforks.\n\nHere comes the twist: “As 56% from the poll in favor of segwit & agreed UASF is bad. We’ll respect ur opinion and implement segwit on both BTC & LTC soon. Thanks.”\n\nThe poll didn’t ask whether his followers are in favor of segwit or otherwise, but gave a choice between segwit or UASF which also implements segwit. So, between segwit or segwit, with the only real question asked being whether segwit should be activated at a threshold of 95% of miners or whether it should just be activated regardless of how many miners support it.\n\nThe Art of Surprise\n\nThis, of course, just two days after he said “segwit will be a disaster.” Now, to make some rational sense of this isn’t easy, but some suspect F2Pool isn’t really neutral. They implemented full-rbf, for example, at the advice of Peter Todd, then backtracked after a huge backlash by users.\n\nThey’ve never really mined on any other client, but Bitcoin Core, except for that one time when they pretended to give their users a choice by making mining with Bitcoin Classic as difficult as possible which led to just one block in a week or so despite the pool at the time having some 25% network share.\n\nOn the other hand, it may well be the case that the decision is actually purely made to avoid any DDoS as Wang Chun says or implies. F2Pool is a classic pool, running no hash of its own, and is a fairly small operation, therefore may not have the resources other pools do.\n\nIn that case, it doesn’t seem like a smart move to reveal DDoS-ing has so much effect on his pool. Nor does it sound like a good idea for miners to keep using F2Pool when their profits can so easily be affected by a DDoS either from competitors or segwit supporters.\n\nTheir hash has fallen to around 9% in the past four days, with segwit and Bitcoin Unlimited now very much neck and neck, both having around 36% network share. That suggests bitcoin is fully split.\n\nAs such, after two years, there is still no resolution in sight, while bitcoin’s fees reach all-time high, above $1, with users yesterday complaining about unconfirmed transactions.\n\nMaybe some new proposal will be able to bridge the divide, but what we’ll probably see is a repeat of the same old story. Firstly, nitpick every little thing in showing strong opposition, then smear the proposal’s name, then its devs, then whoever supports it, then DDoS.\n\nThis time, though, all of it is getting far too boring, like those Hollywood movies that keep repeating the same story-line.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Since the meteoric rise of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency has become increasingly popular across the world.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the largest and most widely-used cryptocurrency on the market, there are other currencies experiencing steady growth – such as Ethereum and Dash.\n\nThese cryptocurrencies also use a blockchain, or distributed ledger system, but feature different mining techniques and additional features.\n\nMining is the process of earning cryptocurrency based on the work done to confirm transactions and add them to the blockchain.\n\nThe earning efficiency of this process is generally based on hardware processing power, and mining different currencies can require different hardware.\n\nWhile mining Bitcoin in South Africa generally requires a large investment, mining alternative cryptocurrencies can be a cheaper option for enthusiasts.\n\nCryptocurrency popularity in South Africa\n\nBitMart CEO Jacques Serfontein told MyBroadband that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are becoming increasingly popular in South Africa.\n\n“The popularity of cryptocurrencies has increased tremendously in South Africa, and with the weakening rand it’s a great investment option – giving returns of between 6-15% per month,” said Serfontein.\n\nBitMart is a local online retailer which sells cryptocurrency mining hardware and hosts cloud mining services.\n\nSerfontein said Bitcoin mining rigs remain the most popular choice among South Africans, despite the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.\n\n“Ethereum mining hardware is becoming more and more popular as the price gains value, but Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency among miners,” he said.\n\n“We deliver two Bitcoin miners for every other miner we sell.”\n\nDash follows closely behind Ethereum in terms of popularity and is gaining rapidly on its competitors.\n\nMining alternative cryptocurrencies can be more viable than Bitcoin mining for beginners, and Serfontein recommends they purchase a GPU-based mining rig which allows them to mine a number of different coins.\n\n“We recommend the Thorium 2480 rig for beginners, as it is cheap and can mine Zcash, Ethereum, Monero, and various other coins,” said Serfontein.\n\n“You can choose to either mine the coin directly and keep it, or have our pre-loaded software convert the coin to Bitcoin.”\n\nThis article first appeared on MyBroadband and is republished with permission.\n\nNow read: What you need to know about mining Bitcoin in South Africa', 'Bitcoin price may have made a short-term top near $1240 against the US Dollar, but dips remain supported in BTC/USD in the near term.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price traded nicely higher above the $1200 resistance against the US Dollar before finding sellers.\n\nThe BTC/USD has broken a bullish trend line at $1224 on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX), and currently finding support around another trend line.\n\nThe price is currently above the 100 simple moving average (H4) at $1160, which is a positive sign.\n\nBitcoin price may have made a short-term top near $1240 against the US Dollar, but dips remain supported in BTC/USD in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Price Trend Line Support\n\nThere was a solid increase in Bitcoin price, as it moved above $1200 against the US Dollar.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Isn’t it absurd that nearly 326 million people representing 80% of the adult population in Africa do not have access to bank accounts? This wretched situation denies countless of people financial freedom in the so-called dark continent. Bureaucratic tenors and economic exclusion inter alia have paved the way for the current phenomenon.\n\nLast year a study of 10 African nations with unusual inflationary ratio had South Sudan registering an unimaginable inflation rate of 295 percent. Egypt had the slightest with 12.30 percent. African governments continue to plunder the riches of the African people through Inflation. This makes it considerably insurmountable for individuals to conserve their resources.\n\nMoreover, public sector borrowing has crowded out the efficient private sector that can put credit to good use. The IMF estimates that averagely credit to the private sector is estimated at 30 percent of GDP in Sub-Sahara Africa.\n\nCCN spoke to Werner van Rooyen, Head of Business Development and Growth at Luno, the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Africa about how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are naturally poised to offer Africans financial inclusion.\n\nCCN: Has Bitcoin anything to offer Africa?\n\nWerner van Rooyen: Absolutely. There is a huge potential for Bitcoin in Africa. Many Africans could move straight to a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, or a bank of the future, such as Luno. Much of the existing financial infrastructure is inefficient: banks and branches are expensive, currency transfers can often be expensive and slow and most of the developing world is still unbanked.\n\nThere is the potential for Africans to leapfrog some of the existing financial services, in the same way, that many Africans skipped the part of owning a cumbersome and expensive land line and went straight to owning a mobile phone.\n\nCCN: Most African currencies are reeking of inflation, does this make Bitcoin attractive as a store of value to Africans?\n\nWvR: Bitcoin has proven to be the best-performing currency in the world in 2016. I believe more investors in high-inflation countries are looking at alternative asset classes, things like gold or Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has been found to be largely uncorrelated to other asset classes. With most asset classes, there is a correlation (or inverse correlation), like when a country’s stock market goes down, the currency’s exchange rate usually also follows, same for the housing market. Bitcoin is largely uncorrelated, meaning it is becoming an attractive alternative to many investors.\n\nCCN: What do you make of some African governments tagging Bitcoin as a tool for terrorism and money laundering?\n\nI think this is mostly fueled by incorrect data, click-driven media hype and lack of understanding about Bitcoin. Firstly, I should say that the biggest facilitator of organised crime, including money laundering and terror financing, is cold hard cash.\n\nMany other modern inventions, such as the Internet, Twitter, cars and cellphones, are currently being used to facilitate crime. It doesn’t mean that we should shut these technological advances down (I doubt anyone is seriously proposing it), but rather that the good that comes with it outweighs the bad.\n\nLastly, there is very little proof that Bitcoin is currently being used for these nefarious purposes. Remember: Bitcoin is only pseudo-anonymous: all Bitcoin transactions ever conducted are recorded in the Blockchain.\n\nStudies by the UK government looking into the best channels for laundering money has consistently found the risk of Bitcoin being used as very low.\n\nCCN: Adoption in Africa is irritatingly slow. How do we push penetration?\n\nWvR: Education and user experience. At Luno, we’re doing a lot to tackle this. Our aim is to make Luno the easiest place to buy, sell and learn about Bitcoin. Something which is no trivial task, but we’re seeing fantastic growth in Africa, especially for our mobile wallet. We’ve also created a Learning Portal to help new people with some basic concepts about Bitcoin.\n\nCCN: Do you think Africans will finally embrace Bitcoin?\n\nWvR: I don’t think they will, I think they already have! We are seeing fantastic adoption in places like South Africa and Nigeria and I’m sure it will ripple to other African nations too.\n\nCCN: What makes Bitcoin expensive in Africa than elsewhere?\n\nWvR: Bitcoin is a very liquid instrument: it’s easy to move around the world. This, in theory, means that it can and will trade at roughly the same exchange rate, wherever it is available.\n\nObviously, there are many factors at play, but since the price is determined by supply and demand, it means that in some places where the demand is low, it may trade at a lower price (and vice versa).\n\nAnother issue is connectivity: to transact in Bitcoin, you need an Internet connection and ideally a smartphone. Many places are still underserved by the telcos, but this is changing fast. The price of smartphones is also continuously getting cheaper.\n\nCCN: Could you paint a picture of the future of Bitcoin in Africa?\n\nWvR: It’s really too soon to tell, but what we’re seeing already today is really fantastic and I believe Bitcoin has a lot of potential in emerging markets in Africa and abroad.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'While the strict regulations that emerged following the 2007–2008 financial crisis drew fire from many industry participants, they may have had an unintended consequence: making bitcoin more appealing to investors.\n\nFollowing the crisis, regulators created a complex framework of rules and regulations designed to ensure the continued stability of the global financial system. The new framework affected many different facets of the financial services industry, including financial institutions involved in trading.\n\nUnder the new rules, investors frequently need to deposit cash (known as \'margin\') when making trades. This margin is often left at clearinghouses, which act as intermediaries and help ensure that trades still take place even if one party gets cold feet.\n\nThese clearinghouses then take this cash and lend it out for safe assets, such as German bunds or US Treasury bonds, through the repurchase agreement or \'repo\' market, which enables them to make short-term loans.\n\nThis entire process has had the effect of making certain safe assets – specifically high-quality government bonds – increasingly scarce.\n\nAnd this situation could potentially grow more severe, Yves Mersch, member of the European Central Bank\'s Executive Board, warned recently.\n\nHe stated during a January speech:\n\n""The requirements for trades to be centrally cleared are still being introduced, so the demand from market infrastructure to exchange cash for collateral will rise.""\n\nWhile clearinghouses have been snapping up safe assets, they are certainly not alone in this respect. Central banks around the world have been acting similarly, purchasing trillions of dollars worth of bonds following the financial crisis.\n\nOne major objective of this quantitative easing (QE) was placing downward pressure on interest rates in an attempt to bolster lending and stimulate economic growth.\n\nThese efforts have been largely successful, as interest rates have stayed very low for several years.\n\nThe search for yield\n\nWhile QE has helped create an environment of low interest rates (and therefore modest borrowing costs), it has had an unintended consequence of placing downward pressure on yields.\n\nThe current environment has caused many investors to embark upon a search for yield, which in turn has drawn investors to bitcoin, according to several analysts who spoke with CoinDesk.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, spoke to this aspect of the digital currency, saying, ""It\'s not so much a shortage of safe haven assets, so much as low yields in all asset classes"" that makes bitcoin appealing.\n\nThe low-yield environment is ""driving the appetite for crypto currencies across the board"", he added.\n\nJacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, also spoke to the key need created by the current lack of high-yielding investment opportunities, as well as how he believes the situation is fueling demand for bitcoin:\n\n""The search for yield has no such obvious answers and I expect that is driving some of the interest.""\n\nDisaster hedge\n\nBitcoin prices have frequently enjoyed tailwinds during times of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, the capital markets have come to understand bitcoin\'s value as a ""disaster hedge,"" ARK Invest analyst Chris Burniske told CoinDesk.\n\nShould the economy fall into recession, or the stock market decline, bitcoin prices could benefit significantly. While investors tend to seek out safer securities during times of economic turmoil, the general lack of such assets could prompt them to flock to bitcoin instead.\n\nHarry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, has been preparing for such an event, recently telling CoinDesk: ""Our new fund specifically targets high net worth clients and institutions so they can park their money in an alternative asset.""\n\nHe continued:\n\n""Cryptocurrencies are seen as a safe haven asset now from global macroeconomic events such as currency devaluation or even events like the \'Brexit\'.""\n\nOther analysts offered a more complicated assessment, with Eliosoff emphasizing that, while a downturn would ""likely"" provide bitcoin with tailwinds, it might depend on what factors caused the downturn to materialize in the first place.\n\nMichael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, added further detail to the situation, emphasizing that ""safe"" is a relative term. He also noted that geography can play a key role in investors\' decisions.\n\nMoro stated:\n\n""If I am a US investor, I am sure that there are plenty of other assets that would be viewed as safe before getting to bitcoin. But if I am located elsewhere with more economic instability, bitcoin may very well be one of the first options.""\n\nHistorically, bitcoin prices have not correlated with those of other assets – a point raised by Moro.\n\nShould a recession or financial crisis take place, this is another aspect that could make the digital currency very attractive. During times of crisis, investors frequently panic, selling off many different assets and causing several different kinds of securities to lose value simultaneously.\n\nShould such panic selling take place, investors may find that bitcoin, with its status as as a unique and uncorrelated asset class, is even more appealing than it would be otherwise.\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis Trading.\n\nCup trick image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Participating in the round were Digital Currency Group, Xange, Libertus Capital, Wicklow Capital, GDTRE, BHB Network, The Whittemore Collection, Kima Ventures and Nicolas Pinto.\n\nThe new funding, which follows a $1.5 million round in 2015, will be used to develop the sales, marketing, engineering and support teams through the recruitment of 20 new collaborators. It will help accelerate the launch of a new enterprise security product for cryptocurrencies, opening new lines of revenues for Ledger.\n\nEnterprise Grade Security\n\nLedger’s enterprise-grade cryptocurrency security solutions, such as multi-currency, multi-signature, time-locked payments, are designed for financial institutions, marketplaces and hedge funds.\n\nLedger, which has more than 50,000 units in 130 countries, will also capitalize on industrial blockchain use cases with the goal of licensing its hardware oracle technology in the supply chain, smart grid and IoT security fields.\n\nLedger’s new enterprise-grade cold storage solution is founded on hardware authenticators and the Hardware Security Module. The turnkey SaaS hardware/software suite supports multi-signature, multi-currency, rate limiting and time locking. The fully-trustless solution has emergency recovery procedures that are available even in the case of force majeure.\n\nA Versatile Security System\n\nThere is no limit on the number of cryptocurrencies and segregated accounts that one entity can manage. Each account has its own rules that are enforced by hardware devices. A payment request, for example, has to be approved by two of three administrators and will only be executed after a 72-hour lockup time (time oracle). Such security level limits the risk of internal theft as well as external physical threats.\n\nLedger’s low-footprint crypto-embedded operating system designed for Secure Enclaves and Secure Elements enables full orchestration of code and systems directly from the secure core.\n\nBitGo, a multi-signature bitcoin wallet, announced earlier this year it will offer Ledger’s hardware-based key storage. The integration is available for the Ledger Nano S and Nano Blue. Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano Blue wallets secure digital identities and cryptocurrencies.\n\nPartners Support Direction\n\n“We believe Ledger’s hardware and software solutions will be critical to the broader adoption of blockchain technology by both consumers and enterprises,” said Barry Silbert, Digital Currency Group founder and CEO. “Bringing Ledger into DCG’s global ecosystem of companies will help accelerate collaboration and innovation around security, a critical skill for any company leveraging applied cryptography or blockchain technology.”\n\n“In a world that desperately needs data protection, Ledger has been the first to use secure chip technology to protect data and application in a way the user can adopt,” said Gabriele Domenichini, BHB Network head of venture. “Cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications are the ideal training ground for Ledger to expand to many other aspects of cybersecurity.”\n\nAlso read: Bitgo enhances its security with Ledger’s hardware based key storage\n\nSecurity A Major Challenge\n\n“Securing blockchain assets such as bitcoin and Ethereum is one of the greatest challenges in the digital asset space currently,” said Pamir Gelenbe, Libertus Capital managing partner. “Ledger is the leader in this field both for individuals and enterprises,”\n\n“By investing in Ledger, MAIF intends to contribute to the development of the blockchain ecosystem, a new source of confidence to record transactions, based on peer-to-peer exchanges,” said Jean-Marc Willmann, MAIF deputy general director. “MAIF is proud to support Ledger into its objective to become the world leader in distributed trust.”\n\n“We are delighted to co-lead this new round of funding and renew our trust after Xange’s seed investment in 2015,” said Cyril Bertrand, Xange managing partner. “We hear from many customers of Ledger.

04/16/2017,"['An EU-regulated fund, High Tech Private Equity Fund SICAV plc, managed by Accuro Fund Solutions, has acquired nChain, a technology group associated with Craig Wright, a scientist who previously claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSICAV claims the new acquisition is the biggest to date involving bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology. SICAV put no value on the deal and did not mention Wright in its press release.\n\nReuters identified nChain, previously known as EITC Holdings, as Wright’s vehicle for filing hundreds of blockchain and bitcoin-related patents.\n\nRecords from the U.K. confirmed that the target company, under both the nChain and EITC names, has filed more than 80 blockchain- and bitcoin-related patents.\n\nA $300 Million Deal?\n\nA source close to the deal told Reuters $300 million was invested in nChain, but did not clarify over what time period.\n\nWright told Reuters the goal is to build bitcoin into a global “system with no ruler, no king.”\n\n“All I do is to help grow the use of bitcoin, and I want to see it in daily use by at least a billion people on-chain. We have the funds, the people and the technology to do this,” Wright told Reuters.\n\nReuters previously reported Wright was working with Calvin Ayre, a Canadian online gambling tycoon, to create a patent portfolio.\n\nnChain told Reuters via email that neither Wright nor Ayre had a stake in the company before or after the sale. nChain said it previously acquired Wright’s assets and intellectual property, and that he now holds the post of chief scientist.\n\nReuters also previously learned that Wright was deeply involved in the early development of bitcoin, and had told Australian tax officials he owned more than 1 million bitcoins.\n\nnChain Acknowledges Its Patents\n\nThursday’s announcement marked the first time nChain publicly acknowledged it is filing patents.\n\nnChain is a distributed, decentralized ledger that chronologically records transactions in an immutable way.\n\nThe nChain group of companies has grown to a team of more than 60 scientific research, engineering and other professionals based mainly in Vancouver, Canada and London, U.K. The acquisition will support nChain’s research activities and advance blockchain adoption globally.\n\n“While learning about the suite of nChain’s capabilities through the transaction, it became clear to me that we are in a new era of the digital age following the creation of the personal computer and the Internet,” Arthur Davis, who has been appointed as a director of nChain Holdings Limited, stated in the press release. “This changes everything leading us into what we at nChain call the Internet of Transactions.”\n\nDavis said nChain has designed a blockchain infrastructure to transform the way businesses operate. He said the technology will be disruptive on a scale most people have not yet fully appreciated.\n\n“nChain sees the full extent of this disruption being achieved by maximizing transactional velocity on the bitcoin blockchain,” he said.\n\nnChain’s Vision\n\nnChain’s research demonstrates its vision through:\n\n• Removing the bitcoin blockchain’s “artificial” block size limit (temporarily set at 1MB) to support greater scalability and usage;\n\n• Enabling on-chain scaling without undermining the benefits of decentralization;\n\n• Advancing native scripting to build smart contracts; and\n\n• Supporting open source protocols.\n\nnChain is developing protocols and applications to support blockchain growth globally. There is a software development kit to allow programmers to create applications on the bitcoin blockchain, solutions to scale the bitcoin blockchain, innovations to improve security, on-chain smart contracts scripting, and a decentralized trading platform using autonomous agents.\n\nnChain supports the formation of a neutral standards organization that will coordinate the bitcoin protocol. This will deliver a stronger software design. Ensuring the bitcoin blockchain’s long-term advance makes it essential to harmonize a miner’s objective of profitability and the importance of the governance principles led by the software development community.\n\n“The patent program at nChain involves some of the most complex technologies we have ever seen, and stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation worldwide,” said Cerian Jones, a partner at Urquhart-Dykes & Lord LLP and nChain’s lead patent attorney.\n\nAlso read: ‘Bitcoin creator’ Craig Wright lines up 70 blockchain patents\n\nnChain’s Future Plans\n\nnChain plans to make some intellectual property assets available to the blockchain community through royalty-free licensing and open sourcing.\n\n“This acquisition is directly aligned with our investment objective of identifying and supporting world-leading disruptive technology innovators,” said Michel Van Zanten, who oversaw the transaction for the investors. “We were attracted to nChain’s core infrastructure capabilities and technical understanding of how a globally scalable enterprise-class architecture can be built to transform the way in which the world operates.”\n\nNuovo Capital served as nChain’s financial advisor for the transaction. Baker McKenzie, a law firm, advised nChain on IP, tax and corporate aspects of the transaction.\n\nFeatured image from BBC.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""After weeks of contemplation, F2Pool has finally decided to support Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness (SegWit) on both Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nOn April 14, Wang Chun, the owner of F2Pool, the second largest Bitcoin mining pool, announced the result of an internal survey conducted amongst its miners. Chun disclosed that 56 percent of miners within the F2Pool mining pool network were in favor of SegWit.\n\nAs 56% from the poll in favor of segwit & agreed UASF is bad. We'll respect ur opinion and implement segwit on both BTC & LTC soon. Thanks. pic.twitter.com/bOI8VusM2j — Wang Chun (@f2pool_wangchun) April 15, 2017\n\nYes to SegWit, no to UASF\n\nIn consideration of its miners and their support toward SegWit, Chun and the rest of the F2Pool mining team believed that signaling SegWit would be the preferable decision for both the organization and the Bitcoin community. More importantly, Chun did not want the community to go down the path of a user-activated soft fork, which essentially eliminates the authority of miners in the SegWit activation process.\n\nSamson Mow, former BTCC executive and Blockstream CSO, stated that Chun and the F2Pool team made an intelligent decision by signaling SegWit, as it further strengthens their opposition to UASF and appeals to the Bitcoin community.\n\nMow said:\n\n“Wang Chun is a smart guy. SW won't activate without Antpool, ViaBTC, BTC.TOP , GBMiners, Bitclub, CANOE and Bitcoin.com so he can signal now and simultaneously establish his opposition to UASF.”\n\nOne of the major reasons why mining pools like F2Pool are against UASF is because the mechanism allows node operators without the presence of miners and their hashrate to activate a soft fork by a fixed date. For instance, a UASF as noted in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 would activate SegWit by Nov. 15 if it garners enough support from the community.\n\nSince UASF completely disregards the authority of miners, mining pools and companies like F2Pool are opposed to the mechanism.\n\nAlready mining SegWit blocks\n\nWith Chun’s early statement on April 15, F2Pool already started to mine SegWit blocks. If the pool allocates its entire hashrate to support SegWit, which according to sources is close to nine percent, SegWit’s miner support would most likely surpass 30 percent by the end of this week.\n\nChun and F2Pool’s abrupt decision to support SegWit came only four days after the pool owner’s strong opposition to SegWit on Bitcoin.\n\nOn April 12, Chun wrote:\n\n“SegWit will be a disaster. I am not going to support it on Bitcoin because I am a Bitcoin holder. I've tried my best to love Core. But Core doesn't love me. Now I know Charlie Lee has a backup plan and it is called UASF.”\n\nIt is still unclear whether F2Pool is truly trying to look out for the best interests of its miners and the community or if signaling SegWit is the optimal method of rejecting UASF."", 'Beijing\'s moves to rein in bitcoin aren\'t deterring China\'s new crypto-currency kings\n\nPosted\n\nSome of the most powerful players in the world of bitcoin say recent moves by Chinese regulators targeting use of the virtual currency will not stall its long-term rise.\n\nKey points: Chinese investors have seized virtual control of the crypto-currency\n\nHuge computer \'mining\' farms in rural China have contributed to this influence\n\nChina has stepped up efforts to regulate bitcoin, leading to large value fluctuations\n\nThrough sheer weight of numbers, Chinese investors have seized virtual control of the highly valuable crypto-currency in recent years, with huge computer \'mining\' farms in remote areas playing a crucial role.\n\nAt the start of this year, more than 90 per cent of daily trade for bitcoin was being made in Chinese yuan.\n\nBut that has fallen, as China\'s Central Bank, the PBOC, started taking a series of regulatory measures to rein in the use of bitcoin.\n\n""The PBOC can potentially have very strong control over the price of bitcoin, at least in the short term, because it can effectively cut the money flow involved in bitcoin trading,"" said Jihan Wu, one of the most prominent figures in the global bitcoin community.\n\nMr Wu operates Bitmain — a Beijing-based company that is the leading manufacturer of the specialist computers used to generate new bitcoins on the network.\n\nHis company also administers Antpool, one of the biggest bitcoin mining collectives, along with several computer \'mines\' in China\'s remote western areas where electricity is cheaper.\n\n""Potentially [the PBOC] could shut down all the Chinese bitcoin exchanges"", he said.\n\n""But I don\'t think the Chinese Government will do very aggressive regulation over bitcoin.\n\n""I just think they want to control the risk for those investors who don\'t have enough knowledge about bitcoin.""\n\nChinese moves impacting highly volatile currency\n\nIn February, Chinese regulators forced two major Chinese bitcoin exchanges to temporarily halt withdrawals while they upgraded anti money-laundering measures.\n\nWhile that wiped almost a third off bitcoin\'s value, it has rebounded to hit new highs — peaking in March at $US1,290, before taking a hit when a US-based plan for a publicly listed bitcoin electronic trading fund was knocked back by regulators.\n\nSince then, the currency has continued its upward rise, due to an explosion of direct buying and selling between Chinese investors off the exchanges, known as \'over the counter\' trade.\n\n""In the longer term, I don\'t think the regulations are a bad thing"", said Zhao Dong, another Beijing-based investor who heads up a company called Galaxy Dragonfly Investments.\n\nMr Zhao previously invested in bitcoin mines, and has ridden the highs and lows of the currency\'s volatility, at one point losing close to $4 million.\n\nBut he still spends all day trading the currency on behalf of clients both in China and overseas.\n\n""In future, if there\'s a global online currency that\'s adopted widely enough, then no government will be able to control it"", he said.\n\n""For bitcoin, the possibility of this is huge, and even if it\'s not bitcoin, a similar currency would also surely develop.\n\n""This is why I devote myself to this career.""\n\nTopics: currency, computers-and-technology, world-politics, china', 'Computer geeks packing away hard drives was never going to be quite as dramatic as sharp-suited bankers carrying boxes of their possessions and pieces of office art down Wall Street, but the collapse of the Bitcoin currency exchange Mt Gox in 2014 was widely seen as the alternative digital currency’s Lehman Brothers moment.\n\nThe Tokyo-based exchange, which was handling 70pc of all Bitcoin transactions a year earlier, suspended trading and was eventually liquidated, with approximately $450m disappearing. Earlier this month, Japan introduced legislation to protect users from being ever stung by a collapse again, while also making Bitcoin exchanges comply with anti-money laundering regulations and officially authorising it as a normal payment method.\n\nIn the UK, cryptocurrencies, as payment methods such as Bitcoin are known, still have a confusing legal status. But Japan’s move could act as a framework and catalyst for widespread adoption.\n\nDr Cathy Mulligan, co-director of Imperial College London’s Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering, who believes that insufficient regulation could be holding back startups and the growth of financial technology, rather than creating opportunities through lack of regulatory constraints, says: “We have the situation in the UK where many startups are chasing the regulator to say, ‘How are we going to be regulated?’ rather than the other way round.', 'The user base and market cap of bitcoin are larger than most fiat currencies of small countries in Central America, Africa and Europe. The next step for bitcoin is to surpass the market cap of reserve currencies, to establish itself as the global currency used by mainstream users and general consumers.\n\nThe truth is, bitcoin as a technology is not capable of surpassing the value or user base of reserve currencies as of yet. Various scaling issues have to be addressed and solutions must be implemented. One of these solutions is Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness. If both the on-chain capacity and two-layer solutions of bitcoin are expanded and improved, bitcoin will be able to compete with larger fiat and reserve currencies of the world.\n\nStill, the bitcoin network has demonstrated a significant rate of growth in terms of market cap and user base. Most notably, Blockchain, a popular bitcoin wallet platform, recorded over 6 million new users in the past 12 months. Other competing wallet platforms such as Coinbase have also shown a rapid growth rate, with the Coinbase wallet platform serving over 6 million users.\n\nCoinbase and Blockchain alone are currently serving nearly 20 million wallet users. Apart from these regular day-to-day users, there exists many investors in regulated bitcoin exchange and trading platforms such as BitFlyer, Bitfinex and Bitstamp that hold bitcoin as an investment.\n\nAccording to an infographic provided by a user of a bitcoin online community, the userbase of bitcoin is larger than many countries including Norway and Finland. The market cap of bitcoin is higher than the majority of fiat currencies in the world. Bitcoin has a higher market cap than the currencies of the following countries:\n\nMongolia, Bolivia, Paraguay, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Laos, Sudan, Senegal, Nigeria and more. The full list of countries can be seen in the infographic shown below:\n\nImportance of Scaling For Bitcoin Mainstream Adoption\n\nBitcoin, as noted in Satoshi Nakamoto’s original white paper, was designed and introduced to operate as a peer to peer electronic cash system. Due to its high fees and relatively long confirmation times however, since 2015, bitcoin has begun to operate as digital gold. In order for bitcoin to appeal to the masses, it needs to be able to handle small payments that are cheap, secure and fast. In other words, for bitcoin to surpass the value of reserve currencies and obtain a massive user base, it has to refer back to Nakamoto’s original vision of bitcoin.\n\nTechnologically, bitcoin is not there yet. The open source development community of bitcoin is working toward adding a settlement layer on top of bitcoin so that it can operate as both digital gold and settlement network. Technologies like Segwit, Lightning and Tumblebit are all designed to add that second layer of infrastructure to handle small payments for day-to-day users.\n\nIn a way, the comparison digital currencies such as bitcoin to fiat currencies or reserve currencies that are actively utilized by their users on a daily basis could be incoherent. However, if bitcoin is used as a digital cash system as Nakamoto outlined in 2009 in the future, then this comparison could be more relevant.\n\n\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Galia Benartzi is a founder of Bancor, a Swiss-based non-profit focused on solving the liquidity challenge in asset exchange. Previously, she was founder and CEO of Particle Code, a cross-platform development technology for mobile and social games acquired by Appcelerator.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Benartzi discusses why she believes the ability of blockchain technologies to create many currencies could create a 'long tail' of new commerce opportunities.\n\nMoney, when it comes down to it, is a tool for collaboration.\n\nMoney moves human energy, skills and time between us, in different 'containers', or stores of value. National stores of value, like the US dollar, have historically been controlled by governments and distributed by banks.\n\nThis, of course, happens with limited transparency, a combined domestic and international monetary policy agenda, and political considerations throughout.\n\nNaturally, this model is far more inflexible and inaccessible than newer cryptocurrency solutions, made possible by blockchain database technology that can theoretically enable anyone to issue and distribute a digital store of value.\n\nIn fact, we're just beginning to see the blockchain ecosystem give rise to these new forms of money that can be issued at little to no cost.\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies allow us to account and transfer value securely between one another without the need for an intermediary, such as a bank, we can finally join and create local and group value networks that operate reliably, with little overhead or tedious monitoring.\n\nThe big change\n\nCommunities of any flavor can now be empowered to agree on credit-issuing policies and governance structures, and enjoy internal marketplaces from which to buy and sell goods or services, without relying on access to national money.\n\nToday’s first use cases are produced by early adopters, and already we see hundreds, nearing thousands, of cryptocurrencies on the market and counting.\n\nBut as technical barriers to entry are removed, we are on the precipice of millions of user-generated currencies, of all shapes and sizes. This is similar to inflection points in user-generated content we saw with the rise of WordPress for blogs and YouTube for video.\n\nSimilarly, the long tail of value creation will produce a large variety of monetary diversity and abundance from greatly enhanced collaboration between people.\n\nIn business, the 'long tail' describes content and products in low demand or with low sales or view volume that, collectively, make up a market share exceeding that of current top performers combined.\n\nInternet history shows us that with the digital long tail, the accumulation of all niche contributions is actually two to three orders of magnitude greater than the hits. Think of all the Instagram accounts after the 1,000 most followed, or all the status updates beyond the most viral.\n\nIn cryptocurrency, the long tail points to hundreds of billions in potential value when combining all small and niche currencies beyond the few largest.\n\nPast inhibitors\n\nIt's an idea that's been tried before.\n\nFor example, my founding team previously built technology for local currency initiatives. One of our most successful projects became the largest alternative currency in Israel where it was used.\n\nThere, a community of new mothers issued a currency called 'Hearts' that allowed thousands of active moms to buy and sell from each other in a mobile app which combined a currency wallet and trusted peer-to-peer marketplace.\n\nThe community generated hundreds of transactions every day for years, with millions of dollars-worth of value changing hands, including jewelry, apparel, household and children’s goods and lifestyle services.\n\nOver time, as other currencies were issued in neighboring communities, it became clear that being able to exchange these stores of value for each other would give them even greater usage, as new products and services would be available in other networks beyond yours.\n\nMany local businesses were eager to offer their products for their customers’ community currencies, which would further enhance product selection, but their inability to liquidate these back to national money was a barrier.\n\nCapping potential\n\nEven though these currencies were creating value for users, they were too small to achieve the trade volume needed for liquidity.\n\nThis is the main reason we haven't yet seen the user-generated-currency inflection point. Combined with the technical difficulty still involved in the creation of a cryptocurrency, what you see today are early adopters limited to crypto startups with deep development expertise and a business strategy for liquidity.\n\nWhen technical barriers are lowered and the liquidity problem is solved, the emergence of the user-generated-currency long tail may end up being the greatest long tail in internet history.\n\nIts combined volume won't represent the profit or traffic of its enabler (such as YouTube’s ownership of the video long-tail) but rather the collective abundance, as measured by the velocities and market caps of these currencies, accruing directly to their users.\n\nThis access to diverse capital may usher in a more even distribution curve of wealth in society. And we will measure that wealth not only in dollars or euros, or even bitcoins, but in the transfer of goods and services within each network and community, unconstrained by structural monetary inefficiencies.\n\nSugar candy image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

And there were no heirs apparent to his throne. The War of the Spanish Succession had begun.\n\nWith Spain\'s weakened leadership, and unable to defend its territory, a power vacuum formed through which nearly nearly all European nations vied for control of Spain\'s undefended land.\n\nThe war that started in 1701, raged on for nearly nearly 15 years and ended by treaty. The war ended without anyone clear victor, but the treaty resulted in significant changes to European and American territorial boundaries.\n\nWhat was left of the eviscerated Spanish mainland was given to Philip V, a member of the French nobility who held the closest genealogical claim to the Spanish throne. What was received by Britain and France was the title to \'New World\' territory in North and South America. What was received by all participants, was debt and the need to build and rebuild trade routes upon the new redistributed land. Enter Britain\'s \'South Sea Company\'.\n\nThe South Sea Company was formed via a partnership between the British parliament and the Bank of England in the year 1711.\n\nThe structure of this company was like many others in the 17th and 18th centuries. The company came into existence through a royal charter, and was given a monopoly on part of the monarchy\'s commerce. In the case of the South Sea company, this monopoly was granted over the trade in the newly conquered Spanish territory.\n\nAt the time of commencement, shares in the South Sea Company were primarily issued by conversion of war debt. The debt from the Spanish War, assessed at £10m, was assigned to the South Sea company for repayment. And at the option of an existing bondholder, that debt could instead be converted into equity into the new venture.\n\nIt was a good deal for the state, as the debt was removed from its books and import tax revenues could be collected from the company. And for a while, it was a great deal for debt and shareholders. So, when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1713 by all parties involved in the war, the ship that was the South Sea Company was ready to set sail.\n\nThe big sell\n\nIt\'s tough to say just where the South Sea \'bubble\' itself started, as the run up was caused by the culmination of many small decisions, each made with the best of intentions for shareholders.\n\nMarketing for the South Sea Company was unusually aggressive out the gates, with fantastic tales being told about the spoils awaiting export from the new land. Further, there was a complex front-running strategy that enabled legislatively privileged insiders to buy government bonds before the announcement, and \'sell into the pump\'.\n\nLater accounts of this time would reveal that the marketers of this security knew the tales of wealth were not sustainable at the time, but felt that, with the capital received, surely some profit would follow. Sure enough, as the claims of surefire returns were being propagated, the South Sea Bubble began its ascent.\n\nUnique to the South Sea company\'s launch, and for the first time in British history, investors were courted from outside those with close ties to the monarchy. The perceived potential to share in the gains of this elite group were too good an offer for the common man to pass down. And, the buying and selling of the stock developed into a new form of gambling in which the country as a whole began to play.\n\nAs the South Sea Company\'s valuation began to grow, and expectations of great wealth compounded, promoters of the South Sea Company started to realize that they too could emulate its success by creating their own companies and issuing stocks. For the ICO speculators of today, this is where the bubble begins to get significantly more interesting.\n\nExtraordinary claims\n\nInitially, these \'bubble companies\' (Yep, that\'s just what they were called) had plausible enough goals. In a time that preceded the invention of the \'white paper\', these companies instead drafted marketing literature that was quick to read and high on aspiration.\n\nThe initial companies were fairly benign in their focus. And, at first, most companies were focused on insurance, product and utility endeavors. To quote the canon of buttcoin, these companies could fairly be synopsized as having \'but with the new world\' goals for their corporate strategy.\n\nOver time, as the public\'s appetite for extraordinary investment opportunities continued to grow, the claims of these bubble companies grew equally extraordinary. No regulatory oversight or specialist review was needed at the time, so claimants began to pitch companies which claimed they would achieve: ""the making iron with pit coal"", ""the transmutation of quicksilver into a malleable fine metal"", ""the making of rape-oil"" and, of course, ""a wheel for perpetual motion"".\n\nAt the height of the madness, the most famously ethereal company of the bubble promised, without irony, ""a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is"".\n\nAs the mania grew, promoters and proto-exchange operators began to appear on the streets of London. \'Stock-jobbers\', as they came to be known, began to market their paper on the busy streets between london\'s coffee houses.\n\nThe stock-jobbers would buy and sell the newest schemes to passers-by for a commission on the sale. These promoters were notoriously unscrupulous, and as the front men for many of the unsavory offerings, and they would also become the first to be held responsible by buyers whose investments fell short of the promise.\n\nThe start of the end\n\nAdjusted for inflation, at its peak, the South Sea Company\'s market cap would equal $4tn in \'real\' (inflation adjusted) terms. Nearly all the country\'s bureaucracy, aristocracy and businessmen held significant exposure to the scheme. Even Isaac Newton was heavily invested in the company before its downfall. Oracles, it would seem, were equally unable to predict outcomes in times of manic fervor.\n\nAs the South Sea company reached its peak valuation, a confluence of events caused its downfall. In December of 1719, having yet failed to achieve any profit, the South Sea company was unable to pay its year-end dividend to shareholders.\n\nThis default started a snowball of action amongst politicians and bankers. Some bankers began to realize that increasing valuations could not continue indefinitely. Meanwhile, politicians began to see that investments in bubble companies, which were still technically illegal, competed with investment stake in their South Sea Company holdings.\n\nIn January of 1720, a parliamentary commission was held on what should be done about the fervor. Through a series of compromises and scandals, the commission concluded that only companies with a royal charter could be bought and sold. By June of that year, the Bubble Act reaffirmed the illegality of bubble corporations and put an end to the trading of their stocks.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was due to an investor credit program of which the first payments were due in August of 1720. At that time, investors began to sell their holdings to make due on the payment, and this started the initial selloff.\n\nWhat happened next, should be unsurprising. Bankruptcies began, and within months had reached all time highs. As the losses mounted, then compounded, everyone was affected. Notable bankruptcy included that of Isaac Newton, who upon losing the near entirety of his life savings proclaimed:\n\n""I can calculate the movement of stars, but not the madness of men.""\n\nBy the end of 1720, the price of the South Sea company stock had fallen 90%.\n\nThe backlash\n\nInvestors revolted against the stock-jobbers, the company founders, and the politicians who they blamed for losing their wealth. The mobs formed, and justice was demanded. Extraordinary claims that were once pitched and traded as foregone conclusions, were finally tested. Many of those who were responsible for the extreme claims fled the country. Those that remained faced jail and asset confiscations.\n\nThough many of the stock-jobbers escaped prosecution, they faced an inordinate public backlash in the form of mockery, ridicule, and disdain. Famous amongst this backlash is a lengthy written condemnation of their work by Daniel DeFoe (the author of ""Robinson Crusoe""), a popular deck of playing cards commemorating the folly, and numerous plays written to ridicule the stock-jobbing profession.\n\nWith the resulting contraction of the entire economy\'s growth, the South Sea Bubble was the great depression of its century, and the Bubble Act remained in effect thereafter for over 100 years, restricting the growth of investment markets until it was finally overturned in 1825.\n\nUnregulated, and without peer review, the investment economy had turned into a perverse and unsustainable Keynesian beauty contest. The South Sea Bubble never returned a profit on its operating expenses during the entirety of the bubble, and what little trade it did attempt (mostly in slaves) was performed at a net financial loss.\n\nLessons for today\n\nIf it\'s not clear by now, the parallels between the South Sea Bubble and today\'s ICO market are... uncanny.\n\nAs a new class of investor was given access to a securities market for the first time, and without any regulatory safeguards, this market quickly degenerated into a gambling racket where unscrupulous businessmen catered solely to the speculative markets, without any concern for long-term sustainability and non-speculative capital inflow.\n\nNot only that, these pitchmen starved out investment in modest, but actually profitable endeavors. The burden of this environment resulted in substantial externality costs borne by the entirety of the market.\n\nGiven the chance, investors will rationally jump at the opportunity to be the second greatest fool. And to promote long-shot schemes over modest and humble endeavors.\n\nWhether bitcoin itself goes the way of the South Sea Company has yet to be determined. But what is certain is that, if and when the SEC chooses to restrict the growth of this sector, much like British parliament\'s enactment of the Bubble Act of 1720, prices for these \'undertakings of great advantage\' will quickly fall to zero.\n\nSailing ship image via shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

For some reason, the GDAX exchange briefly listed bitcoin at US$0.06 per BTC. This event occurred right after the exchange came back from scheduled maintenance. Luckily, this price drop did not affect global bitcoin trading all that much. During times like these, it is good such a problem occurs on a smaller exchange.\n\nCheap Bitcoins At GDAX\n\nA lot of traders were surprised last night when looking at the GDAX bitcoin price chart. During a brief moment, the BTC/USD price dropped by 99.9%. Keeping in mind how this trade revolved around 100 BTC in volume, there was a brief panic among traders. As a result, bitcoin was valued at US$0.06 before returning to its normal price. A rather interesting event, to say the least.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/IamNomad/status/853413314327654402\n\nIt is worth noting GDAX had undergone scheduled maintenance just prior to this incident. However, rather than waiting for order books to be depopulated, market executions were resumed immediately after. That allows for traders to buy and sell bitcoin at unprecedented rates. In this case, those who scooped up bitcoin at US$0.06 will be more than pleased. None of the other bitcoin exchanges emulated this price behavior, though.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is how this drop affects the weighted bitcoin average. A lot of websites use GDAX to compute futures index prices. Such a drop to US$0.06 messes up the index quite a bit, to say the least. As a result of the drop, the bitcoin price index briefly dipped to US$888.48. Unfortunately for BitMEX users, some positions have been liquidated in the process. The exchange will refund all affected users, though.\n\nIt is evident glitches like these can occur at any given time. It remains unclear why GDAX did not repopulate the order book before resuming trading, though. It is possible this is just a one-off event, although it is worth keeping an eye on moving forward. Futures exchanges using average prices for their index will be affected by these incidents if they ever occur again. Moreover, if this problem repeats itself, the bitcoin price may effectively go down as a result.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'If you’ve ever had a company or friend offer to pay you with Bitcoins or another type of digital money, you’ve encountered cryptocurrency, also called crypto-money or cryptoassets.\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that is created through the use of encryption software. This approach is a solution to security and control issues that prevented a purely digital currency from being successfully developed in the past. If you hear someone talking about one of these currencies, it’s almost certainly in a cryptocurrency format. This type of digitally created and secured money is currently in a period of very cool experimentation, so let’s take a look at how it work, why it’s popular, and where cryptocurrency is heading in the future.\n\nHow does cryptocurrency work?\n\nHow does a currency exist in a totally digital format? What is it based on? While the process varies a little between different cryptocurrencies, they all follow the same general system.\n\nFirst, cryptocurrency chooses a base unit and how much that particular unit is worth when compared to other currencies (often, the U.S. dollar is used as a baseline). Some cryptocurrencies are more imaginative than others at this point. They try to represent debt registries, contracts, or the act of currency exchange itself. It can get a little weird, but ultimately the unit in some way relates to the value of other currency, as is true of all currencies in the world.\n\nUnits of cryptocurrency are then created, typically when a transaction occurs. The units are carefully formed and preserved through algorithmic encryption, then linked together in vast chains of data, where the currency can be tracked and exchanged.\n\nHowever, at this point, cryptocurrency is still too vulnerable and too easy to fake. The currency units need to be timestamped and processed to make them more concrete and harder to copy. A third party developer can do this, but most cryptocurrencies prefer to crowdsource the process to those with the right hardware and software to “mine” the currency.\n\nMining uses algorithms to go through each transaction, encrypt the cryptocurrency, and add it to a digital ledger, essentially verifying it and cementing its position online. This process may also be referred to as “consensus protocols” or “consensus platforms,” depending on the currency. This process is meant to make the currency impossible to duplicate, though whether it’s successful is up for some debate.\n\nSome cryptocurrencies are highly centralized, with someone — usually the organization that created the process/software — making decisions about how much currency is created and how it is used. Other types are very decentralized, controlled only by how and where people are willing to use them.', 'On April 1st, the famous Russian farmer and crypto-enthusiast Mikhail Shlyapnikov has launched an ICO for his project “Kolionovo Ecosystem.” Cointelegraph spoke with Shlyapnikov to know more about his aims, motivations and what inspired him to apply the Blockchain at his farm.\n\nThe ICO is carried out on the Waves platform through the Emercoin service. One mln of Kolions are listed for initial sale during the next 30 days. The fundraising is scheduled to end on May 1st after that Kolions will be traded on the stock market.\n\nAs stated in the White Paper, the project is aimed at attracting additional investments for development of existing production line and a variety of services in Kolionovo village located in the Moscow Region.\n\nIt is also emphasized that the project should not be viewed as an investment opportunity promising high returns - it should only be considered as a crowdfunding tool for development of the Kolionovo ecosystem, a system of local production and consumption, which has been successfully operating for over a decade.\n\nHow one modest farmer tried to sabotage national monetary system\n\nShlyapnikov is leading a modest life, breeding ducks and hens and growing all sorts of plants.\n\nHe says:\n\n“I don\'t have that much of a free time to dive deeper into studying digital currencies, their emergence, performance, following all these dramas happening in the space and predictions. Of course, I am trying to follow key trends and new projects. I have a laptop which is soon to turn seven years, an Internet connection through a USB modem which is far from stable, I am not quite able to speak foreign languages. But it doesn\'t stop me. I have my piece of land where I am working and I love what I do. Blockchain with all its benefits is not an object of adoration and worship for me, it is just a tool which has a potential to be applied in my farmstead. Just like a badass tractor pimped up with a bunch of cool stuff.”\n\n- Mikhail Shlyapnikov. Photo: Nikita Girin / “Novaya Gazeta”\n\nLong before the ICO Kolions have been in circulation used mainly by the community members of Kolionovo farm, its partners and customers. Mikhail Shlyapnikov, the man behind the project, created Kolions to order transactions between members of the Kolionovo farm.\n\nIn 2014 with the help of the local printing company he printed 20,000 Kolions, which basically looked like loan-certificates. His initiative immediately attracted the attention of the public prosecution office which claimed that Shlyapnikov is threatening the integrity of the national monetary system.\n\nWhen officials from the Central Bank of Russia learned about the case they just shrugged their shoulders saying they see no harm in Shlyapnikov’s invention, as it’s totally up to the farmer how to handle a relationship with partners and customers and through which instruments.\n\nOne cannot simply put a cow on the Blockchain\n\nWe developed technologies, we taught computers to mimic real life processes and relationship. Now technology is teaching us to easily and continuously improve many organizational systems, simplify complex relationships and transform whole industries suggesting innovative approaches and models.\n\nThe young but quickly evolving Blockchain technology definitely has some social dimensions and it is interesting to watch the societal impact it is producing.\n\nA few years ago we only thought that application of Blockchain technology is limited to the area of finances, it is becoming more and more obvious that its potential is unlimited.\n\nThe Russian farmer shows how it can transform agriculture. Obviously, one cannot put a cow on Blockchain, but it can be used to tame relationship with business partners and clients, while cryptocurrencies appear to be a perfect instrument for financing industries and projects all forgotten and abandoned by the state.\n\nShlyapnikov told Cointelegraph:\n\n“First of all, I\'m a farmer. I was interested in Bitcoin and Blockchain technology and decided to try it in my small business. Turns out it\'s quite easy, useful and lots of fun! In March 2017 we collaborated with Emercoin team and developed a package of ready-made solutions for farmers, providing a free and open access to it. This product has already attracted some interest. I would say that my enthusiasm is more about the application of cryptocurrencies in real life, rather than phenomena itself. Many people contact me asking questions concerning cryptocurrencies, but I just don\'t have enough competence in this matter. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why my project and ICO were met with irony at this fancy Blockchain party.”\n\nMaking digital and real worlds meet\n\nThe investments are linear by nature, therefore investing in Kolionovo Ecosystem is not about contributing to a single product but rather into expanding and growing the existing production. The growth of Kolions price is proportional to the growth of production volumes. The team behind the project also points out that Kolions holders will be able to purchase a number of products and goods with a discount of up to 100 percent.\n\n- Photo:Nikita Girin / “Novaya Gazeta”\n\nThe key advantage of Kolions is that cryptocurrency is not linked to any traditional currency, it is linked to actual product and serves as an instrument for barter, which is as old as the universe.\n\nWith this project, Shlyapnikov suggests to step out of the crypto world and invest in something real. The project is not absolutely risk-free, however, all risks are coming from the real world, have nothing to do with attacks by hackers but rather with natural disasters and issues related to regulation of ICOs as an investment model in Russia.\n\nIn one of the interviews to the local media he once said:\n\n“We hope that the government will not try to intrude into our small experiment in our small village. The fact that the experiment is unusual and creative does not necessarily mean that it is illegal. We are working to clearly define the terms of the project. Certainly, there are risks - an asteroid might hit the hen coop.”\n\nIntegration of Blockchain moved us from shadow economy\n\nLast year the Kolionovo Ecosystem carried an ICO on Emercoin Blockchain. First in August partners issued digital equities and shares. They allowed attracting long money for improving the production line, investors in turns were able to purchase farm products with a discount.\n\nShlyapnikov says:\n\n“During the eight months of this experiment we\'ve got returns of almost 80 percent which were shared among participants. Those who live in Moscow Region receive it in the form of a ""farm box"", those are investors who live far away are getting their returns in BTC. In December last year using the same platform we have issued digital futures. They are not different from any transactions on blockchain but needed when the production needs more time. For instance making whiskey or growing trees. With time prices for these products are increasing and the price of digital token is growing as well.”\n\nThe entrepreneur says that the main conclusion from his experiments with cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology is that they blend well with real life, representing an alternative to bank services, more accessible and efficient.\n\nHe continues:\n\n“This actually motivated us to create a digital currency of our own - KLN (Kolion). It is directly connected to the real product and is backed not only by investors\' trust but also by real world assets. In November after the crop harvesting, we are planning to direct the profit to support our digital currency and cover investment maturity through purchasing or clearing of our cryptocurrency.”\n\n- Photo: Nikita Girin / “Novaya Gazeta”\n\nThrough his tiny experiment, Shlyapnikov has demonstrated the enormous potential of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain solutions to be used in real life on daily basis. They allow fulfilling principles of P2P interaction to the fullest degree possible, eliminating the need for middlemen.\n\nHe says:\n\n“In our case, we were able to push aside banks, retailers, logistics services and controlling authorities. It allowed us to significantly decrease nonmanufacturing costs. Partly we freed the state from the obligation to support us. Besides the integration of Blockchain moved us from shadow economy. To protect investments we had to register our assets and report everything publicly. Perhaps this might influence the state to change their attitude towards Blockchain technology and its application.”\n\nFilling the gap between IT and agriculture\n\nThe Kolionovo Ecoproject is original and innovative in many respects. First of all, it has started without any prior promotion or media coverage.\n\nShlyapnikov explains to Cointelegraph:\n\n“My Facebook page was the only platform which was actively used for promotion of the project. Later, of course, there were releases on the BTT forum. Interest in our project was growing steadily. Many people who were following the project from the very beginning were very supportive. Those who are not that familiar with what we are doing thought of it as of just another scam.”\n\nShlyapnikov says that some met his project with irony and were making sarcastic jokes like ""peasant decided to crash fancy Blockchain party"", or ""how to brew homemade beer using cryptocurrencies"", etc.\n\nHe says:\n\n“Opinions vary significantly. One of the officials from the Central Bank of Russia contacted me saying that they are keeping an eye on my experiment. I\'ll repeat myself, but we were able to attract such a huge interest without any promotion.”\n\n- Photo: Nikita Girin / “Novaya Gazeta”\n\nThe farmer is following the ideas of anarchism and says that it might not always be possible to create an anarchy in such a big country, but it is easy to start with a small community.\n\nSo far the project raised $20,000 in cryptocurrencies and ten times more in fiat. Shlyapnikov shares that the entrepreneur inside him is celebrating because this is a huge success. But as a researcher and pioneer of the idea to combine real life production and digital money, he is a little bit confused.\n\nHe concludes:']"
04/17/2017,"['An announcement by one of the world\'s largest bitcoin exchanges has stoked fears another Mt Gox-style meltdown may be brewing.\n\nThe largest bitcoin exchange by US dollar volume in recent weeks, Bitfinex revealed today it will be unable to accept incoming wires starting tomorrow, a statement that comes after it disclosed late last week that it was experiencing delays in US dollar withdrawals.\n\nThe exchange said in a statement today:\n\n""Beginning 18th April, all incoming wires to Bitfinex will be blocked and refused by our Taiwan banks. This applies to all fiat currencies at the present time.""\n\nNotably, Bitfinex didn\'t offer any details as to why the banks – the subject of a previous wire transfer dispute that began earlier this month – will not accept the transfers. (The exchange ultimately went to court over the decision, but withdrew its lawsuit one week later.)\n\nWhile Bitfinex is said to now be working on solutions to its banking issues, market observers are suggesting cause for concern.\n\nJacob Eliosoff, cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to the general reaction that this situation has so far provoked, discussing how the resulting freeze in withdrawals could create abnormal pressures in the market.\n\n""This is a dynamic many of us remember from the Mt Gox days when there were problems with fiat withdrawals,"" he said. ""Investors responded by converting fiat they had on the exchange to bitcoin so they could withdraw it. [In other words], they buy bitcoin to withdraw, pushing up the price on the exchange.""\n\nEliosoff went so far as to state that some market observers could perhaps view this as an opportunity for arbitrage, using it as an excuse to deposit bitcoin in order to sell at the high price and buy the bitcoin back again.\n\nCharles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, provided a similar sentiment.\n\n""The hiatus [of] Bitfinex\'s banking facilities have led to a rush by some to extricate their bitcoin from the exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nWidening exchange spreads\n\nBecause of these developments, exchange spreads have widened, with Bitfinex enjoying a more than $50 premium in some cases at the time of report, according to data from CryptoCompare.\n\nBitcoin was trading at roughly $1,235 at 18:55 UTC on Bitfinex, compared to roughly $1,185 on Bitstamp and $1,190 on GDAX.\n\nThe spread harkens back to the final days of Mt Gox, when data showed the exchange consistently traded between 10% and 26% above its competitors.\n\nWhile analysts voiced their concerns, they were optimistic that Bitfinex would emerge from this situation unscathed.\n\nThe victim of a hack last August, Bitfinex has shown a propensity to bounce back from operational difficulties. After losing nearly $65m in customer funds, it would go on to ""socialize"" losses among exchange users, using a new cryptographic token to credit customers.\n\nThe system would later win praise from supporters, who saw it as a creative way to avoid bankruptcy and pay back users.\n\nHayter offered similar input, emphasizing that Bitfinex has a ""solid"" reputation. ""The hope is this will be dealt with in a timely and professional manner,"" he said.\n\nEliosoff concluded:\n\n""The big picture here is that these operational hiccups are still common in the space.""\n\nMarket image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Bitcoin entrepreneur Jihan Wu has spoken out and said that the Chinese government only wants to control the risk of bitcoin for investors who don’t know much about it.\n\nIn a report from ABC News, Wu, who operates Bitmain, a Beijing-based company that develops and sells the world’s leading bitcoin miner hardware using Bitmain’s ASIC chip technology, said:\n\nThe [People’s Bank of China] can potentially have very strong control over the price of bitcoin, at least in the short term, because it can effectively cut the money flow involved in bitcoin trading.\n\n“Potentially [the PBOC] could shut down all the Chinese bitcoin exchanges,” he added.\n\nHowever, he added that he didn’t think the government would conduct aggressive regulation over the digital currency, stating:\n\nBut I don’t think the Chinese Government will do very aggressive regulation over bitcoin. I just think they want to control the risk for those investors who don’t have enough knowledge about bitcoin.\n\nThis news comes after the fact that the PBoC has recently taken an increased interest in Chinese exchanges. In February, digital currency exchange BTCC announced that it was halting its Bitcoin and Litecoin withdrawals as Chinese regulators updated their anti-money laundering measures. OKCoin and Huobi announced a similar measure too.\n\nAs a result of the PBoC conducting on-site checks in February, the price of the digital currency dropped to around $790; however, despite the crackdown on digital exchanges with the PBoC director stating that they can’t function without regulations, the currency is continuing to rise in value.\n\nBitcoin Scalability Debate\n\nAs the discussion surrounding the potential bitcoin hard fork increases, many proponents are coming out in support of either Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) or SegWit as the potential solutions to the digital currency’s backlog issue.\n\nSo much so, that Wu, who is also the founder of Antpool, which is the digital currency’s largest pool with around 14 percent of the network’s hardware share, announced last month that they would be switching their entire pool over to BU in support.\n\nWu has also shared a post on his Weibo account from an unknown author, which declared that the network’s problem can only be achieved by talking about the ‘distribution of interests‘ and reaching a ‘compromise in the pursuit of those interests.’\n\nAnd yet, many believe it is only through SegWit that a solution can be found particularly when it comes to transaction malleability, which is a bug that makes it difficult for developers to implement second layer protocols. Those in support of SegWit are of the opinion that SegWit can fix this bug.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin startup Bitwage has moved to improve its payroll service for customers based in the EU, launching a new upgrade aimed at speeding up the process for users in the region.\n\nFounded in 2013, the startup provides a means for employers to pay their workers in bitcoin or fiat currencies, using bitcoin as a way to quickly move money worldwide.\n\nBitwage said today it is now offering unique International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to EU customers who subscribe to its premium service, as well as those who see monthly transaction volumes in excess of €1,999.\n\nAn IBAN is a unique string of numbers signifying a specific bank account, and should see customers able to access wages more quickly.

Titov said this during the All-Russian scientific-practical forum “Blokcheyn: dialogue between business and the authorities.”\n\n“Maybe we can make a Crypto Valley Crimea,” Titov said.\n\nSwitzerland’s “Crypto-Valley” based in Zug is home to a number of bitcoin and blockchain startups supported by the Crypto Valley Association. The association supports industry startups through policy recommendations, organizing conferences and hackathons, enabling researching programs and more.\n\nA Region Embroiled\n\nTitov has proposed such a project in the Crimea, a region that has been the center of a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine that has drawn sanctions by numerous countries, including the United States.\n\nIn March 2014, Russian special forces backed by pro-Russian separatists invaded major Ukrainian government buildings, military bases and telecommunication facilities of the peninsula and forced local authorities to hold a referendum on “reunification with Russia,” according to Wikipedia. Most of the international community does not recognize the annexation and considers Crimea to be Ukrainian territory. Russia presently administers the peninsula while Ukraine continues to assert its right over the peninsula.\n\nTitov said cluster initiatives are another approach. While it is hard to control such a process on a territorial basis, he said geographical boundaries are verifiable via the Internet.\n\nSuch a territory could help solve financing problems related to sanctions, Titov said. The possibilities of bitcoin, blockchain and the Internet can bring funding to the Crimea in new ways.\n\nTitov Promotes Cryptocurrencies\n\nTitov, the leader of Russia’s Party of Growth, has called for Russia to legalize cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and become a leader in blockchain development.\n\nHe has also said Russia can take advantage of its difficult economic situation to embrace blockchain technology as a way to become a very profitable country.\n\nThe country should create opportunities for foreign investors to invest in bitcoin by removing restrictions on such investments, he said, and the country can use blockchain to develop its economy.\n\nAlso read: Russian political party calls for bitcoin legalization\n\nRussia’s Party of Growth supports a free market economy, democracy and protecting the rights of the middle class, according to Wikipedia. While widely regarded as a pro-Kremlin party, the Party of Growth has found itself in opposition to the presidential administration on several issues.\n\nTitov joins a pro-bitcoin/blockchain cadre facing an uphill battle against some powerful forces in Russia.\n\nThe Growth Party and Waves, a cryptocurrency platform for asset and custom token issuance, transfer and trading, launched a new platform in March called “People of Growth,” a social project based on Waves.

Price action throughout the session hasn’t been particularly inspiring, and not only that, it’s not really told us anything about what we can expect throughout the remainder of the evening. We did manage to get into a quick short position, and this flushed through to completion relatively hassle free, but in terms of sustained momentum, we’re just not getting the volume we need for any maintenance.\n\nNo mind.\n\nWe can set up against action this evening in the hope that things start to widen out as price matures throughout the US session tonight, and see where things have taken us when we conduct our analysis tomorrow morning.\n\nSo, with all that noted, take a quick look at the chart below to get an idea where things stand, and where we are looking to get in and out of the markets according to the rules of intraday strategy this evening out of the US, and beyond in to the Asian session tomorrow morning. It’s a five-minute candlestick chart, and it’s got our key range overlaid in green.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range in focus for this evening is defined by support to the downside at 1224 and resistance to the upside at 1242. If we see price break through support, we’re going to look at getting in short towards an immediate downside target of 1213. A stop on this trade somewhere in the region of 1229 will ensure we are taken out of the trade in the event of a bias reversal.\n\nConversely, a close above resistance will get us in to the markets in the opposite direction. We’ll enter long towards 1255, and place a stop loss at 1237 to take us out if things go wrong.\n\nLet’s see what happens.\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

While this correlation has not been proven, it is an interesting indicator of Bitcoin price to consider.\n\nOn April 12, the Chinese yuan strengthened against most of the world’s reserve currencies, including the US dollar.\n\nImmediately after the initial surge in the value the Chinese yuan, Bitcoin price, as listed on major Bitcoin exchanges, fell by around five percent from $1,232 to $1170.\n\nAlthough a five percent fluctuation in Bitcoin price is often perceived as normal daily volatility, the correlation between the decline of Bitcoin price and the strong performance of the yuan triggered the interests of day-to-day traders.\n\nBTC/CNY - a major determining factor of Bitcoin price? Not anymore\n\nIn the past, BTC/CNY pair was considered to be a major determining factor of Bitcoin price until Chinese regulators enforced a policy which required local Bitcoin exchanges to implement trading fees.\n\nUpon the integration of a small trading fee, inflated trading volumes of Chinese exchanges vanished, massively decreasing the daily trading volume of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market as a whole.\n\nUntil late 2016, the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market was believed to process around 95 percent of global trading. However, the enforced trading fees unraveled the true volume of Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, which currently only account for eight percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market.\n\nWith eight percent of the global Bitcoin trading volume, it seemed unlikely that a factor which affects the Chinese market would impact the global Bitcoin exchange market and ultimately, Bitcoin price.\n\nReactive trading from the US traders matters more\n\nSome traders including Tone Vays noted that the US market and its traders closely follow the Chinese market and a correlation between the Chinese market and Bitcoin price could actually stem from reactive trading from US-based traders and investors.\n\nSimply put, US traders expecting Bitcoin price to decline as a result of the strengthening of the Chinese yuan sell the digital currency which leads to a short-term fall in Bitcoin price.\n\nCurrently, with over 27 percent of the global Bitcoin trading volume and as the second largest Bitcoin exchange market, the US has substantially more leverage over Bitcoin price than the Chinese market.\n\nTherefore, it is highly likely that reactive trading from the US traders often leads to the decline of Bitcoin price upon the increase in the Chinese yuan.', 'Though not a new thesis that Bitcoin price could rise drastically - up to $500,000 in the next 13 years according to the first investor in Snapchat - based on what comes out of developing countries, an analysis of some figures and trends as they relate to Africa comes to mind.\n\nJeremy Liew and Blockchain Co-Founder Peter Smith hinged their outlook for an increased interest in Bitcoin on remittance, uncertainty and mobile penetration. These factors, especially remittance, have much to do with Africa, whose composition of developing countries have what will strengthen the rise and use of Bitcoin for several financial purposes in the coming years.\n\n$4 bln a year\n\nRemittance is gradually becoming a major boost for Bitcoin use in Africa - as well as in parts of Asia and Latin America. The advent of new services that use the digital currency for the purpose of sending money from one point to another has started eating into the roughly $4 bln per year cost that banks and other institutions make from international transfers to Africa.\n\nAs earlier reported, many countries in this region - and in Asia - have the most expensive transfer rates in the world as well as bureaucratic processes that make sending and receiving money to and from loved ones a little difficult. This is a major reason why the promotion of the ease of use that Bitcoin brings is essential.\n\n19 percent remittance charge\n\nBitwala, for example, notes that transferring money to South East Asia is cheaper than it is to Africa where banks and intermediaries charge high fees and manipulate currency rates to their advantage. The majority of banks charge between 10-19 percent on any transfers to, from and within African countries.\n\nThe payment service provider points to a leaked document from Santander, a major Spanish banking group, as confirming the dangers of using banks.\n\n""In 2016, the bank made €585 mln solely from international money transfers, making up 10 percent of all of its revenue, it says. In addition to transfer fees, the bank also made another killing by controlling its foreign currency exchange which helped it earn €290 mln.""\n\nPerhaps the most shocking part is that 80 percent of all global money transfers are still conducted via banks and conventional monetary transfer channels.\n\nBitwala adds that the number of signups from developing countries on its platform is almost as those in the US and the EU in total - developing countries forming approximately 30 percent of its new signups globally. Bitwala recently launched into Africa to compete for market share with other companies like BitPesa, BITSSA and Luno.\n\nAfrica boasts some of the top developing markets in the world presently. This is the main reason why the continent’s market of over a billion people stands a chance to be at the center of a share struggle in a couple of years.\n\nYoungest population\n\nAfrica has the youngest population in the world - about a quarter of a billion people aged 15 to 29 in Africa as of 2010. Current trend indicates that this figure will double by 2045, according to the 2012 African Economic Outlook report prepared by experts from the African Development Bank (AfDB), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the industrialized countries’ Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), among others.\n\nFast forward to 2017, the October 2016 IMF’s World Economic Outlook shows that 12 of the top 25 world’s fastest-growing economies are in Africa.\n\nThese countries, according to the outlook, will continue their growth into 2019 where the latest forecast stops. The growing Internet connection rate, particularly in Africa, will also add to the increasing interest in Bitcoin.\n\nMost of the emerging figures from Africa apply in the LATAM region where a series of events are now being put together to widen the understanding of the burgeoning economy and how to enhance access to income easily, cutting down costs and not necessarily relying on the use of a physical structure.', 'Derivatives giant CME Group is looking to patent a way for bitcoin miners to hedge against operational risks.\n\nAs detailed in a patent application published last week by the US Patent and Trademark Office, the proposed system would receive data from the bitcoin network as a means of keeping contracts up to date – monitoring metrics like network difficulty and price.\n\nCME previously launched a pair of bitcoin price indexes last year.\n\nThe filing is notable as bitcoin mining, the process by which new transactions are added to the bitcoin blockchain, is a kind of commodities production. Miners expend energy and manpower in exchange for newly minted bitcoins.\n\nYet, the ever-rising difficulty of mining can mean ever-encroaching costs for for miners.\n\nWith the mining derivative, ""a miner can lock in a projected growth rate of the difficulty factor"", the patent filing reads.\n\nThe application goes on to explain:\n\n""If the network hash rate grows faster than anticipated, the income from mining may fall, but the variation and settlement of the futures or the funds received by exercising a cash-settled call option contract would cover the loss. On the other hand, if the difficulty factor grows more slowly than anticipated or falls, the contract would lose value or the call option premium would expire as worthless, but a miner would make more money than expected on mining operations.""\n\nPer the application, CME envisions the bitcoin mining derivative as a way to position against the depreciation of mining hardware as well.\n\n""...as the difficulty factor rises, mining computers may become less marketable, so taking a long position in the generated contract, or being long a call option on the generated contract, would allow manufacturers to lock in a projected growth rate of the difficulty factor and hedge against the risk of falling hardware prices,"" CME continues.\n\nCME first applied for the patent on 13th October, 2015.

It takes its name after the world’s largest particle accelerator, the Hadron Collider, but instead of physics, the Bitcoin Collider wants to crack one of the digital currency’s cryptographic algorithms used to create wallet addresses.\n\nThe idea, according to Motherboard, is to use a so-called brute force attack to open the bitcoin wallets. Essentially, this attack directs huge amounts of computing power at the bitcoin wallets in order to guess their private keys and prove that the supposedly unique and random string of numbers can be duplicated.\n\nBusting bitcoin wallets open is thought to be impossible today as it involves the painstaking task of creating private keys that are dozens of random characters in length, and then trying them against existing bitcoin addresses. The Collider project, however, claimed that it has created and checked 3,000 trillion private keys, according to the report.\n\nThe Collider’s website listed the group’s so-called “pool trophies,” which include successfully opening over a dozen wallets, although only three had any bitcoin in them.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the group is motivated by the challenge of cracking open the wallets or if the members are in it for the financial gain. The FAQ section on the Collider’s website noted that “it is not illegal to search for colliding private keys,” but “it may be illegal—depending on the jurisdiction you are in—to actually claim possession of funds found that way.”\n\nThe group is inviting anyone to participate, and those who do could potentially share in the proceeds of the wallets that have been cracked open—as long as their jurisdiction allows it.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin traded above the $1,165 price level early Monday morning.\n\nComments']"
04/18/2017,"['Bitcoin price recovered to the $1,200 range for the first time since April 13. At its peak, Bitcoin price surpassed $1,220, reaching $1,222 on most major Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nMajor factor: Japanese market\n\nThe Japanese Bitcoin exchange market has experienced an increasing demand for Bitcoin over the past few weeks. Earlier this month, the Japanese retail giant Bic Camera began to accept Bitcoin in all of its retail centers across Japan. According to local publications, 260,000 restaurants, cafes and bars are set to accept Bitcoin through a PoS system called AirRegi developed by Recruit Lifestyle by this summer.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the Bitcoin community have heard about Bic Camera and its integration of a Bitcoin payment system developed in cooperation with the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange BitFlyer, most Bitcoin users have struggled to acknowledge the brand power and recognition of Bic Camera throughout Japan and its impact on mainstream Bitcoin adoption.\n\nBic Camera operates a large number of electronic retail centers at the largest financial districts and city centers in Japan. Most Bic Camera retail stores are located in prestigious and expensive shopping centers that are often operated by the company.\n\nThe company’s acceptance of Bitcoin brought significant mainstream media coverage on Bitcoin in Japan, South Korea and China. Major news agencies demonstrated the usage of Bitcoin as a payment network to millions of viewers across Asia. Such marketing effect led to a substantial increase in the demand for Bitcoin in Japan, leading to a short-term increase in Bitcoin price.\n\nOther factors: SegWit talks and Indian Bitcoin market\n\nAnother major factor of Bitcoin price is the discussion on Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the Bitcoin Unlimited software. Analysts predict that the activation of a scaling solution such as SegWit which increases on-chain capacity and introduces two-layer solutions including Lightning will lead to a surge in Bitcoin price in the short and mid-term.\n\nEarlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that the world’s third-largest mining pool F2Pool began to mine SegWit blocks and show their support toward SegWit. In an internal poll, 53 percent of the pool’s miners voted for SegWit over Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nWith rising support of user-activated soft fork (UASF) and F2Pool’s decision to signal SegWit, the community has become more optimistic toward the activation of SegWit and the Bitcoin scalability debate.\n\nAny optimistic discussion and talking point on SegWit and Bitcoin Blockchain contingency at this point are likely to demonstrate a direct effect on Bitcoin price. Furthermore, with large Bitcoin markets including the Indian Bitcoin exchange market likely to obtain clarity on Bitcoin legalization, Bitcoin price is expected to climb up in the short-term.', 'Blockchain, the technology that underpins Bitcoin, may be poised to inspire solutions to key societal challenges, offering help with everything from trading carbon emissions to maintaining health records. But only if the companies and developers involved can agree on things.\n\nThat’s the argument Brian Behlendorf, the executive director of Hyperledger, an open-source project overseeing the development of various blockchain technologies, made Tuesday at Business of Blockchain, a conference organized by MIT Technology Review and the MIT Media Lab (follow the conference live on Twitter with the hashtag #bizofblockchain).\n\nBrian Behlendorf speaks at the Business of Blockchain conference.\n\nBehlendorf says that ongoing efforts to deploy these systems in different settings represent a technological shift with broad societal implications. “This is an opportunity to reinvent how much of the world works,” he said, speaking ahead of the event. “This isn’t just about finance.”\n\nThe blockchain on which Bitcoin is built serves as a distributed, cryptographically signed ledger that makes it possible track and verify payments without any centralized authority. The ledger is maintained by computers performing computations that eventually generate more bitcoins. The same distributed cryptographic approach can be used to verify all sorts of transactions (see “Why Bitcoin Could Be Much More Than a Currency”).\n\nAmong other sectors, the diamond industry is currently piloting the use of blockchain technology to distinguish legitimately acquired diamonds from those sourced from conflict regions. By carefully examining the blockchain data supplied with each diamond, it should be possible to identify suspect diamonds and fraudulent transactions. Others are looking at how blockchains could verify carbon-trading deals or serve as a framework for securing digital health records, Behlendorf said.\n\nOne of the big challenges with Bitcoin and blockchain systems is their technical complexity and related questions about security. Hyperledger is meant to help with this issue by offering technical guidance and leadership to the community involved with developing its technology. This is also meant to help with some of the infighting within the Bitcoin community that has arisen as a result of its decentralized nature, threatening to undermine the currency even as its value rises.\n\nIndeed, Behlendorf warned, the excitement and big claims surrounding Bitcoin and blockchains could turn them into victims of their own success. “There are over-inflating expectations right now,” he said.\n\nBut Behlendorf, who was previously the main developer for the world’s most widely used Web server software, Apache, remains bullish. He suggested that blockchain technologies could have the same transformational potential as the Web.\n\nBitcoin gained a huge amount of attention a few years after being released in 2009, as geeks dreamed of technological disruption to the world’s financial system and speculators spied an opportunity to profit from the currency’s ballooning value (see “What Bitcoin Is, and Why It Matters”). Bitcoin’s own blockchain serves as the basis for a number of non-currency applications, but various alternative blockchains have emerged, too. Hyperledger is developing one that is designed to be more amenable to non-currency applications.\n\nAt the conference, speakers will discuss cryptocurrencies and other financial instruments, as well as various emerging blockchain applications. These include monitoring energy transactions, tracking supply chain logistics, and collecting payments for listening to music online.\n\nMany of these applications are already here. The state of Delaware, for instance, is studying the use of blockchain technology from a company called Symbiont for business contracts. IBM and a Chinese company called Hejia recently announced a blockchain system for supply chain management.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Behlendorf isn’t discouraged. “There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical, and there’s way too much hype,” he said. “But it’s a real opportunity to change the rules of the game.”', 'Bitcoin suffered a series of setbacks over the past few days, when the biggest exchange said it couldn’t enable customers to withdraw or deposit money except in other virtual currencies, while another exchange said a technical glitch sparked a crash in prices that caused investor losses.\n\nHong Kong-based Bitfinex—which handles nearly one-quarter of all bitcoin trading, according to cryptocurrency data provider bitcoinity.org—said Monday that its Taiwanese banks, which are responsible for handling transactions in currencies...', 'Theresa May, the British unelected current Prime Minister, has surprised and at the same time excited everyone by all the sudden calling a snap election in what may be an historical two months of campaigning.\n\n“It was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election, but it is with strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond,” May said according to Reuters.\n\nNo one was expecting the British election as May has univocally stated there will not be one, but the surprise u-turn sent FTSE down some 2.46%, Pound is up to months high and so is Bitcoin, rising slightly around 1.50%.\n\nThe outcome of the election is currently seen as somewhat certain because the Labour leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, is generally seen as unelectable. Moreover, Theresa May is 20 points ahead of Labour, but will there be a twist?\n\nAll eyes are now on Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. The party rose to power in a coalition in 2010 with the conservatives. Voters, however, severely punished them in 2015 because they rose student fees when they said they would not.\n\nHowever, now the times are very different. Britain has as good as no official opposition. The only real choice is the Liberal Democrats, a coalition of social liberals and classic liberals. They usually strongly appeal to students, while also attracting libertarian-leaning voters.\n\nIn this election, their main selling point would probably be their pro-EU stance. Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of lackluster campaigning for remaining in the EU prior to the referendum. Some speculate he is secretly in favor of Brexit.\n\nThe only voice, therefore, for some 48% of voters who wished to remain, may be Tim Farron. It is far too early to say what exactly he will promise, but if the party accepts the referendum’s results and campaigns on a soft-brexit, it may actually have a real chance of providing a third political earthquake in just months.\n\nThe election may then be given some meaning, instead of being just a coronation, as the public debates whether they wish to hard or soft Brexit in potentially the biggest decision this nation has faced in almost a century.\n\nWe should, however, expect Tim Farron to botch it all and say we should have a second referendum, something which would probably take them off the election map and relegate them to a joke party.\n\nBritain has voted to leave. The will of the people must be upheld. The question now is how, not if. The nation demands an opposition. Who wants the position is now the question everyone is asking.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'An industry group of Indian bitcoin and blockchain-startups have sought an audience with the government as the latter looks to plausibly outline a regulatory framework for the innovation.\n\nThe Indian government established a cryptocurrency ‘committee’ last week, one comprising of a number of officials from Indian ministries alongside representatives from the country’s central bank to research the framework surrounding digital currencies. The committee was notably co-established by the Ministry of Finance, India’s tax authority.\n\nPertinently, the committee is tasked toward looking into suggesting measures to curb money laundering practices involving bitcoin amid wider research about the regulatory status and growth of digital currencies around the world. The committee’s establishment could be the first move leading to a wider legislative effort for the first time by the Indian government which has, so far, turned a cold shoulder toward bitcoin and the local crypto industry.\n\nTo aid the governmental committee in its effort, a working group of India’s bitcoin startups has stated its intent to partake in those discussions. Established in February this year, the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI), launched as a self-regulatory body and watchdog in the absence of official regulations. The founding members include bitcoin wallet Zebpay, wallet and exchange platforms Unocoin and Coinsecure and crypto-rewarding search engine SearchTrade.\n\nWorking with regulators toward an industry framework is among the primary objectives of the group since its founding. To this end, the DABFI released a statement, requesting an audience with the governmental committee.\n\nIt read:\n\nWe request the committee to give us an opportunity to meet them and showcase the benefits of this technology for our country. Financial inclusion, cheaper cross-border remittance, full trace and track on the movement of value on the blockchain network, and the potential for India to become a financial hub are key benefits that can be derived using virtual currencies.\n\nDespite recent reports falsely claiming that bitcoin was banned in India, the call for regulation of the local bitcoin industry heard among the walls of the Indian Parliament is gaining prominence. The committee is expected to deliver a report on its findings in three months from now.\n\nThe official stance by Indian authorities toward bitcoin was first communicated through a warning by the central bank in 2013, cautioning users against the use of virtual currencies. That warning was repeated in February this year, ultimately leading to the bitcoin industry establish its own self-regulatory body in the DABFI.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Initial public offerings are yesterday\'s news. Who would want to buy a share of a company that\'s wildly unprofitable and whose days of racy growth may be behind it?\n\nThe alternative to the IPO? The ICO\n\nBut there\'s now a geekier and greedier way to bet on a start-up: The ICO.\n\nThe Initial Coin Offering is the Bitcoin world\'s latest attempt to re-create Wall Street in its own image. Rather than exchanging dollars for shares, which usually come with a claim on profits and voting rights, an ICO sees the exchange of Bitcoin (or a rival like Ether) for an issuer\'s newly minted digital currency. That coin is somewhere between a currency and a stake in the business, as Wired puts it, which can then be used to buy distributed computing power or labor hours.\n\nBitcoin\'s Investment Bankers Recent initial coin offerings (ICO) as tracked by Smith + Crown Source: Smith + Crown\n\nThe theory goes that if this business is a ""Good Idea"", its success will boost the value of its own tokens, enriching those who got in early at a discount. There\'s been the inevitable speculative rush, with ICO buyers scrambling to flip their new coins at a premium on exchanges a few weeks later. This doesn\'t always work. There\'s also the potential for scams.\n\nTo a lot of people, this will sound less like a new threat to Wall Street and more like exchanging one set of magic beans for another. Bitcoin itself still feels ""more virtual than real,"" the WSJ\'s Paul Vigna wrote last week, as cautious regulators limit widespread investor acceptance and consumers shun a payment method that can slump 20 percent in a day.\n\nThe Risk-Reward Rollercoaster Bitcoin\'s performance as tracked by an exchange-traded note in Sweden Source: Bloomberg\n\nThat tells you something about the type of start-up willing to flog an even riskier token in return: Experimental, abstract and obsessed with all things decentralized and crypto-currency. It also tells you about the type of investor they\'re looking to attract: More than half of the $20 billion of Bitcoin in circulation are said to be owned by a small oligarchy spread across China and the hedge fund world, according to the Harvard Business Review.\n\nThis is not the kind of deep fundraising pool that\'s going to give Goldman Sachs a run for its money.\n\nA Shallow Pool The total market value of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest virtual currencies Source: coinmarketcap.com\n\nWhere things get interesting is what this means for venture capitalists. Their job depends on taking big early-stage risks in return for juicy rewards when a company like Snap goes public. In terms of the money amassed, recent ICOs aren\'t far off an average Series B financing round, raising around $5 million to $15 million, according to research firm Smith + Crown.\n\nAnd whereas a VC firm might end up owning 20 or 30 percent of a start-up in return for that money, an ICO might only mean one-time costs of less than $500,000, according to Stan Miroshnik, managing director of investment bank Argon Group. Free Bitcoin!\n\nIf the past is any guide, VCs will learn to co-opt this potential source of disruption in much the same way as Wall Street banks have funded, taken over and picked apart fintech rivals. One fund, Blockchain Capital, is adopting the ICO model itself to tap investors for $10 million alongside a traditional $50 million fund.\n\nTrading tokens might also offer VC backers a nice option to cash out of an investment in a more convenient, liquid way than the sometimes trickier wait for the business to sell itself or go public.\n\nIf there is a silver lining in ICOs, it\'s unlikely to be its dream of rebuilding the financial world on open-source technology. It\'s more the hope that tech evangelists preaching digital disruption might have to face a bit of disruption themselves. And given the VC industry\'s role in hyping Bitcoin and Ethereum, that\'s probably fair.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\n(A previous version of this story was updated to correct a typo in the headline.)\n\nTo contact the author of this story:\n\nLionel Laurent in London at llaurent2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nEdward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net', ""Digital currency exchange Kraken is adding support for wire transfers denominated in US dollars and other government-issued currencies.\n\nThe company disclosed the update in an email to customers this morning.

Out of the cryptocurrencies that can be found out there, Bitcoin holds a prominent place. However, Bitcoin mining has become some sort of a challenge. This has tempted engineers to seek the assistance of latest technology for Bitcoin mining. That’s where they paid attention towards Internet of Things (IoT). However, the technological development is not just being used for the betterment of Bitcoin mining. It is being used by people for fraudulent activities. IBM recently discovered such an activity.\n\nFrom a recent study conducted by IBM, the Mirai Internet of Things botnet is being used to install Bitcoin mining code on computers of the victims. With additional investigation, they figured out that the Botnet has been used for some of the bigger DDoS attacks taking place in the recent past. The takedown of the DynDNS is a perfect example for such an attack. According to the experts, this is the biggest attack of its kind yet.\n\nThe Mirai Internet of Things Botnet\n\nThe Mirai Internet of Things Botnet was discovered back in August 2016. A white hat security group called Malwaremustdie; Mirai was able to figure it out after conducting an extensive project. Mirai has the ability to transform the network devices that run on Linux into controlled zombies or bots, which can be used for DDoS attacks. However, it can only use the devices that are based on out of date versions of Linux. This accumulates a considerable amount of devices, which can be used to power up a large scale attack.\n\nThe Mirai IoT botnet was initially created by the team of engineers for two main purposes. These purposes were explained by Dave Mcmillen, who is a Senior Threat Researcher, working for Managed Security Services at IBM.', 'Short Bytes: Bitcoins, a form of digital currency that operates on the principles of cryptography, has lately come under the scanner of the authorities throughout the world. So, it’s become necessary to know what are Bitcoins, how it works, the legal status of Bitcoins as well as what holds in the future of Bitcoins.\n\nIn the year 1976, F.A Hayek, in his book “The Denationalisation of Money,” propagated the establishment of competitively issued private money. In the mid-70s, what seemed like a farfetched idea was conceived by yet another Economist in the year 1999. Milton Friedman, an American economist who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, predicted of time where internet, (still in a nascent stage then) would help abolish the role of a government and evolve a currency free from the shackles of the government control. Less than ten years later the prophecy came true when Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese, invented a form of cryptocurrency called “Bitcoin.” The origin of Bitcoins can be traced to the aftermath of the global recession and money crisis of 2008 that shook the whole world economy.\n\nWhat is bitcoin? How does it work?\n\nIn the simplest form, Bitcoins can be described as a “Peer to Peer Electronic cash system.” Bitcoins can be used as a method of payment for numerous goods and services and for simple transactions like purchasing vouchers, paying bills, etc. In different jurisdictions, Bitcoins are treated as a property, currency, virtual asset, good, security or commodity for the purpose of trading on a stock exchange or commodity exchange.\n\nEssentially Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, i.e., it operates on the principles of cryptography to manage the creation of Bitcoins and securing the transactions. Cryptocurrencies are managed by private parties, without the need for a government authority to monitor the currency system. The currency has been designed in a way that the number of total units of Bitcoins in circulation will always be limited. Going by the pace at which Bitcoins are being minted, the last unit will be mined around the year 2140.\n\nThe cryptocurrencies essentially work on the Blockchain system. A Blockchain is a public ledger of Bitcoins that is designed to record all the transactions. The chronological order of Blockchain is enforced with cryptography and each new ledger update creates newly minted Bitcoins. This is designed in a way that Bitcoin wallets can calculate their total balance and new transactions can be verified. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography.\n\nThe buyer and seller can enter into transactions by using their Bitcoin wallets that are secured by a secret piece of data called, a “Private key.” The key is used to authorise the transactions by the owner of the wallet, and cannot be normally tempered by anyone, once it is issued. The transactions are performed by adding the Bitcoin wallets on an exchange, acting as a facilitator for sale and purchase of Bitcoins. All transactions are displayed between the users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network through a process called “Mining.” It is essentially the process of creating new Bitcoins out of the total Bitcoins that are designed to be “Mined” using computers. The transactions transfer the value between the users and get recorded in the Blockchain, ensuring that each transaction is valid.\n\nIs Bitcoin legal money?\n\nThe legality of Bitcoins is controversial, while some jurisdictions have express laws and regulations to deal with Bitcoins, others still fall in gray areas. As per a recent bill in Japan, Bitcoins and other virtual currencies have been given legal recognition and are accepted as a mode of payment. While in China, trading in Bitcoins come under the regulatory restrictions imposed by People’s Bank of China.\n\nIn the U.S.A, different states have adopted varying approaches to Bitcoins. Recently a U.S Magistrate in the state of New York ruled that Bitcoins are not money, while a contradictory stance was taken by a judge in Manhattan, who ruled that bitcoins are acceptable means of payment. The Internal Revenue Service in the United States, defines bitcoin as property rather than currency for tax purposes. The U.S. Treasury, by contrast, classifies bitcoin as a decentralised virtual currency.\n\nIn Russia, reportedly, Bitcoins may soon be regulated in a bid to tackle money laundering, though, in the past, Russia has expressed its displeasure with Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. In India, as of now, no regulations have been framed by either Reserve Bank of India or Securities and Exchange Board of India, the two contenders, for the purpose of drafting regulations pertaining to Bitcoins and acting as a watchdog.\n\nIn India, who ultimately acts as a regulatory authority can only be decided based on whether the government decides to treat Bitcoins as “Currency” or “Security/Commodity.” As per current Indian laws, “Currency” can only be issued by the government but the residuary powers in this regard lie with the Reserve Bank of India which can notify “Bitcoins” as currency. After the demonetization drive in India, the demand for Bitcoin has more than doubled in less than two months. The Indian government has reportedly set up an inter-disciplinary committee to regulate the Bitcoins amidst the apprehensions that the black money hoarders may have invested into Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin trends in 2017\n\nBitcoins are extremely volatile in nature. While the future trends for Bitcoins can’t be predicted with utmost certainty, as per a report published on Forbes, the market is set to show strong waves in the favor of cryptocurrencies, as predicted by a crypto market intelligence startup. As per the latest position, The 24-hour average rate of exchange across USD Bitcoin markets is US$1184.87, the 7-day average is US$1204.85, and the 30-day average is US$1080.26 confirming only the volatility of Bitcoins.\n\nThere are possibilities that some countries may introduce an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) to make Bitcoin Trading easier and accessible. While a similar application to create an ETF has been rejected by The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the chances of other countries adopting it are not bleak. Currently, sale and purchase of Bitcoins is a multi-step process. Creating an ETF would make it possible for the investors to buy Bitcoins through the stock market.\n\nFurther, In the future Blockchains, the underlying technology to Bitcoins may bring revolution in the music industry. Cryptography could transform the music industry by using Blockchain ledgers. As per reports, an attempt is being made to bring music distribution under the cryptography. This can be done by adding the music to blockchain and letting the users distribute the music by paying a sum. This can also bring down music piracy.\n\nTo sum up the discussion, it can be said that while Bitcoins may not replace the “Fiat Currency” anytime soon, but there has been a phenomenal growth in the acceptance of cryptocurrencies around the world. While the investors may still be reluctant to invest in Bitcoins, given the high risks associated with it, the demand for Bitcoins has grown manifold. In the end, it could be argued that a good legal and regulatory framework for Bitcoins would help the investors decide the viability of Bitcoins in the long run.\n\nDid you find this story on Bitcoin and its 2017 trends interesting? Don’t forget to share your views.', 'China, India and Russia increasingly look to become the major influencers in Bitcoin prices in the coming years.\n\nIn the midst of Japan’s decision to allow cryptocurrency as legal tender in a fully-regulated environment, Bitcoin is again breaking the $1,200 price point.\n\nHowever, traditional Bitcoin powerhouse China is ready to stage a comeback, while India and Russia’s emerging demand and hopeful regulatory future are already unleashing huge potential.\n\nWhile the legal situation regarding crypto exchange in China is still uneven, with business expansion countered by user complaints of funds freezing from above, the classic Bitcoin mecca is progressing, having spent several months in judicial limbo.\n\nCommenting on the People’s Bank of China’s desire to create its own digital currency, analysts ExchangeRates wrote Tuesday that even its existence would “revolutionize the cryptocurrency universe and skyrocket its popularity and acceptability worldwide.”\n\n“China is a major importer and exporter of goods and services. A digital Renminbi can be a gateway for China to internationalize its currency, and offer it as a substitute to the US dollar,” it added.\n\nIn terms of legislation, the Indian environment is on the surface even less certain than China’s.\n\nContradictory noises from government officials over cryptocurrency’s safety and even legality have been matched by the fledgling crypto startup sector, which has formally stated its belief that Bitcoin is legal in the country.\n\nNonetheless, looking forward, the vast potential of an underbanked, mobile-reliant populace suffering under five months of cash reforms means India is gearing up to find a reliable alternative for everyday wealth control.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia’s increasingly soft stance on Bitcoin may see it legalized in 2018, subject to transaction monitoring in forms yet to be understood.']"
04/19/2017,"['One question that a substantial portion of people asked when Ethereum was launched was “Why to develop Ethereum when we already had Bitcoin for the transfer of payments?”\n\nWell, Blockchain is a powerful technology and it is true that we haven’t fully utilized it to its potential. Bitcoin only makes use of one of the many possible applications of the Blockchain technology i.e. peer-to-peer transfer of funds.\n\nEthereum is a platform based on the Blockchain technology used for developing decentralized applications. It has a few benefits over Bitcoin such as the feature of coding Smart Contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nWhat is a Smart Contract?\n\nSimply put, Smart Contracts are a digitized version of a traditional contract. They are computer programs which run on the Blockchain database and can be programmed to self-execute when the conditions written in their source code are met. Smart Contracts are trusted by the users as once programmed, the terms of the contract cannot be changed thus making the contract immutable.\n\nSmart Contracts are coded using the language ‘Solidity’ and offer numerous advantages over traditional contracts:\n\nThere is no dependence on a third party for the enforcement of the contract. The elimination of the middleman considerably reduces the total amount of money spent on the contract.\n\nEliminating third party vendors also mean that the entire process of validation and enforcement of the contract becomes speedy as the users are directly transacting with each other.\n\nSince the terms of the contract cannot be changed, the users are at a lesser risk of being cheated. Smart contracts are free from all kinds of human intervention.\n\nSmart contracts are not prone to failures such as power cuts, node failures etc. There is no risk of misplacing or losing the contract as the contract is saved on a distributed ledger. What this means is that each device connected to the network has a copy of the contract and the data stays on the network forever.\n\nHow does a Smart Contract work?\n\nDevelopers work on writing the code for Smart Contracts. The Smart Contracts can be used for the transaction and(or) exchange of anything between two or more parties. The code contains some conditions that will trigger the contract to execute itself.\n\nFor example, a Smart Contract relating to a rent agreement for an apartment would only get triggered when the owner receives the rent and would send the security key for the apartment to the tenant. This contract could be programmed to ensure regular payments of rent and could be reinitiated every month.\n\nOnce the coding is done, the Smart Contracts are uploaded to the Blockchain network i.e. they are sent to all the devices connected to the network. Relating this to another Blockchain application – Bitcoin – the upload is like how a network update regarding a Bitcoin transaction would be uploaded onto the Blockchain.\n\nOnce the data is uploaded onto all the devices, the users come to an individual agreement with the results of the execution of the program code. After the users have reached an agreement, the database is updated to record the execution of the contract and to monitor the terms of the contract to check for compliance.\n\nHere, there is no possibility of the contract being manipulated by a single party as control over the execution of the Smart Contract does not lie in the hands of any single party anymore.\n\nPotential use-cases for Smart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are already becoming pivotal for many Blockchain applications and will most likely become one of the most important pillars of the Blockchain technology. We are already seeing Smart Contracts being used in fintech and non-fintech domains with new use-cases coming up daily.\n\nSome fields where Smart Contracts can be successfully used include:\n\nSupply Chain Management - Supply chains are vulnerable to paper-based systems, where forms pass through several channels for approval thus increasing exposure to fraud, theft and other setbacks. Blockchain annuals such setbacks by providing a safe and accessible digital version to each party participating in the chain and automates the process of payment.\n\nGovernance - Smart Contracts could be used to provide a more secure and flexible ecosystem to the voters where voters need not come to the polling booths but can transfer their votes from anywhere since they’re already participating in a contract initiated by the governing authority. All it would need for the completion of the contract – an internet connection.\n\nReal Estate - Using Smart Contracts, many hassles surrounding payments to the broker, advertising firms and similar costs could be nullified as the Blockchain ledger would help us cut costs and the tenant and the owner would be able to directly transact with one another.\n\nProtecting Intellectual Property Rights - IPR can be enforced using Smart Contracts, which allow the users to track ownership of any file uploaded onto the network. Content creators can participate in Smart Contracts with other users, allowing the creators to get due credit for their content and be compensated easily since there is no need for any third-party intermediary.\n\nWhat lies in the future for Smart Contracts?\n\nThe Blockchain technology is being integrated with multiple aspects of an average user’s life. Also, Smart Contracts are becoming an important pillar of Blockchain.\n\nBoth Blockchain and Smart Contracts have use cases that have not been fully explored but constant research is being done on the same, with many big companies investing heavily in the research and development of these technologies.\n\nBy Ayush Varshney, CTO and Co-Founder, Darwin Labs\n\nDisclaimer: Darwin Labs is building applications and infrastructures on Blockchain, Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence. Before Darwin Labs, Ayush was a co-founder at two companies – Bluegape and Murmur. His love for new technologies is what drives the whole company to push the boundaries of the imagination of what’s possible.', 'Following a previous announcement by F2Pool that they are now to signal for segregated witnesses (segwit), ViaBTC has publicly reiterated they do not support segwit for a number of reasons. The bitcoin mining pool says:\n\nSegWit, which is a soft fork solution for malleability, cannot solve the capacity problem… Even if SegWit after activation can slightly scale up block size with new transaction formats, it’s still far behind the demand for the development of Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin has been running at full capacity for months with numerous proposals put forward and rejected by miners. The latest ones are segwit, currently at around 32% hashrate share, and Bitcoin Unlimited which stands just under 40%.\n\nSegwit’s main aim is to send transactions off-chain and onto second layers, such as the Lightning Network or sidechains. ViaBTC says such transactions “are NOT equal to Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer on-chain transactions” before adding that “LN will also lead to big payment “centers”, and this is against Bitcoin’s initial design as a peer-to-peer payment system.”\n\nThe main criticism against segwit is its use of a 1:4 ratio, which many suspect is a political decision that will bind bitcoin’s trajectory for decades to come regardless of technical factors. ViaBTC says:\n\n“SegWit lifts the block size limit to 4MB with 1MB base and 3MB witness block. However, from the current transaction data, the average effective block size will be less than 2MB even if all transactions upgrade to SegWit. This is a tremendous waste. If we want to double the capacity of Bitcoin, we’ll need to make sure the internet bandwidth to run full nodes can support at least 8MB blocks, instead of 2MB. This will make it even tougher to increase block size in the future.”\n\nMoreover, the decision to upgrade to segwit is irreversible, according to ViaBTC. So if something goes wrong, bitcoin might be stuck because:\n\n“On technical terms, SegWit uses a transaction format that can be spent by those who don’t upgrade their nodes, with segregation of transaction data and signature data. This means SegWit is irrevocable once it’s activated, or all unspent transactions in SegWit formats will face the risk of being stolen.”\n\nSome 70% of miners have now made a decision on whether to support segwit or Bitcoin Unlimited, a proposal which simply increases the blocksize as set by nodes and miners. It’s not clear what the other 30% are waiting for, but it will be interesting to see what they do decide once they get around to exercising their duty.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.', 'Chinese digital currency exchange OKCoin has stopped accepting US dollar deposits, a move it attributed to banking issues.\n\nOKCoin becomes the latest cryptocurrency service to report problems with USD transfers, coming just a day after Bitfinex revealed that it, too, wouldn’t be able to accept transfers, citing correspondent bank problems that initially focused on outgoing wires.\n\nWhen reached, an online support staffer for OKCoin told CoinDesk that the exchange currently doesn’t have an exact timeline for reactivation. The exchange told users yesterday that it was working to restore deposit functions through alternative channels.\n\n""Please do not make further deposits as your wires may be rejected by intermediary banks,"" a notice posted on the exchange’s website stated.\n\nThe move comes months after OKCoin, as well as other exchanges based in China, shifted policies in light of new regulatory scrutiny and later froze bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals pending upgrades to their systems. That state of affairs continues, a situation local sources have attributed to ongoing discussions with the People’s Bank of China (China’s central bank) and other regulators in the country.\n\nIt also follows the release by OKCoin of beefed up anti-money laundering/know-your-customer requirements on 10th April.\n\nOther exchanges have reported transfer holds as well, though how the developments are connected isn\'t immediately clear.

Some time ago, I became more engaged with the libertarian community and kept hearing about Bitcoin; so, I decided to investigate. The only problem is that I’m an idiot and had no idea what they were talking about when they tried to explain it.\n\nThey would say things like, “Bitcoin is digital cryptocurrency on the blockchain supported by a peer-to-peer network,” completely oblivious to the fact that “cryptocurrency” and “blockchain” aren’t part of a normal dialogue, relegating their explanations to worthlessness.\n\nThe appeal of Bitcoin to libertarians is enormous.\n\nMoney is involved in roughly 50% of all transactions. Having a regulated currency (currency issued by our government’s central bank) entails the government regulates at least 50% of our transactions.\n\nMost of us will work eight hours a day for something which the government decides the value of. Our purchasing power, our ability to obtain goods and services, is controlled by the government. An individual can work for a full eight hours, but what that individual can purchase with that labor is entirely decided by the government; so, in steps an unregulated currency – Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is the confession that money is no longer real combined with the recognition that our governments aren’t eager to relinquish their control and go back to the gold standard. It’s a digital currency, so we can electronically set up an account to hold our money. Each of us can have a unique identifying address, or label, which is the Bitcoin wallet – which tells you how many Bitcoins you have.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has recorded each of the wallets and transactions on a basic accounting ledger.\n\nNow suppose you want to pay someone for work they’ve done for you, and you transfer one Bitcoin to their account; the Bitcoin community keeps a ledger of this and adjusts the balances of the appropriate wallets. In time, the list of transactions will grow, and those will be ordered into blocks of ledgers. The blocks are timestamped and form a chain of transaction history – hence the term blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain data – the list of transactions and accounts – is stored on multiple computers all across the world. This way, if one computer is hacked and the information altered to artificially inflate the balance of the hacker’s account, the account will be checked against the network of computers and will be immediately recognized as a fraud.\n\nThe advantage of participating in the blockchain is that, when new Bitcoins are distributed they are distributed to the network, so those who lend their computers to the network receive Bitcoins for doing so.\n\nThis network is usurping the power of central banks, who control our currency. With Bitcoin, they no longer have the power to erode our purchasing power.\n\nTake the issue of U.S. currency. In 1971, the U.S. currency wasn’t set at the rate the central bank desired to obtain, it was set according to the price of gold ($35/ounce). $35 U.S. dollars in 1971 had the purchasing power of $212.31 in 2017. Meanwhile, one gold ounce today is worth $1280. People who possess U.S. dollars are having their purchasing power eroded because the central bank in the U.S. is permitted to dictate the purchasing power of the currency.\n\nThe difference in purchasing price enables banks to earn record profits. By increasing the money supply – the number of dollars in an economy – they devalue the existing dollars making us poorer.\n\nHowever, banks can lend out the additional money for loans, mortgages, or lines of credit and profit from it.\n\nThis impoverishment of the average individual to profit banks is facilitated by the government. I have advocated elsewhere in owning stocks in banks for this very reason, those of us opposed to the system can at least profit from it if society won’t recognize our preachments on it.\n\nIndividuals who worked their entire lives, find their retirement income in their senior years within striking distance of the poverty line, because the 2017 dollar purchases far less than the dollars that went into their retirement savings and investments.\n\nTake the example of a Venezuelan who invested in Bitcoin – currency their government couldn’t control – this person now finds that the liberated currency is literally the difference between life and death in their ability to purchase food; compared to their neighbor, who cannot, due to their sole reliance on the government-controlled currency.\n\nThough still in its infancy, and highly speculative, liberated currency offers intrigue, and the hope of emancipating ourselves from central banking in a very real way.\n\nThis post was written by Brandon Kirby.

With time, though, they started to consider bitcoin regulation instead of banning it, and this seems to be the sensible direction to go. It’s still not easy and the road to bitcoin regulation has faced many problems.\n\nThe problem in regulating bitcoin\n\nThe main problem in implementing bitcoin regulation is that it goes against the primary feature of such cryptocurrencies – anonymity. The structure of blockchain, which is bitcoin’s backbone, leaves the parties involved anonymous by only assigning a randomly generated address and key. It thus makes bitcoin regulation difficult because it’s not possible to know who is involved in a transaction.\n\nFurthermore, there are other altcoins available, so it’s much harder to keep track of all other forms of cryptocurrency. Finally, the users of cryptocurrency are not willing to cooperate with regulators. This can be seen by the number of people reporting bitcoin in their tax returns in the US even though there are laws on taxing bitcoin in the US.\n\nCountries currently considering bitcoin regulation\n\nDespite these problems, some countries have embraced bitcoin and are seeking to set some kind of regulations.\n\nGiven that bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin regulation would be the most effective way of keeping cryptocurrency under control.\n\nBitcoin in India\n\nBack in 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) warned the public against the use of virtual currencies. This was after the central bank noticed a rising interest in bitcoin, which it saw as risky because it was prone to theft and had no intrinsic or underlying value. The statement by RBI also indicated that the institution was going to investigate issues regarding virtual currency.\n\nThese statements were further compounded this year when the Minister of State for Finance said virtual currency was illegal. In a country with a very robust cryptocurrency industry, the minister’s words were enough to cause a stir. Then on the 12th of April, India’s government declared they had convened a committee to implement bitcoin regulation. Consisting of the central bank itself, several finance-related government institutions and commercial banks, the committee is expected to come up with a final report in 3 months.\n\nIt is a step in the direction of bitcoin regulation in India, even though some believe that the report might suggest some strict regulations based on the tone of the government’s statements.\n\nBitcoin in The United States\n\nIn 2015, the CFTC defined bitcoin as a commodity which would then be covered by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). It was a positive sign, but the fact that it wasn’t considered a security by the SEC showed there was still the reluctance to consider it as a currency.\n\nBitcoin in Australia\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is doing research on blockchain to find out the implications of such technologies. The same group working with the RBA is also involved with other G-20 nations looking at bitcoin regulation.', 'Page not found\n\nThe Bank of 404 appears to be missing, perhaps another victim of the rise of fintechs or more sensibly you’re on a broken page.

Secondly, most of the traffic exchanged between Bitcoin nodes traverse few ISPs and three ISPs can see 60 percent of all Bitcoin traffic.\n\nBitcoin constitutes a target of choice for attackers already but while many attack vectors have already been uncovered. Maria Apostolaki and Laurent Vanbever of ETH Zürich and Aviv Zohar of Hebrew University find that one important vector has been left out: attacking the currency via the Internet routing infrastructure itself.\n\nThe researchers note in their report:\n\n“As Bitcoin connections are routed over the Internet - in clear text and without integrity checks - any third-party on the forwarding path can eavesdrop, drop, modify, inject,\n\nor delay Bitcoin messages such as blocks or transactions.”\n\nThey added that detecting such attackers is challenging because it requires inferring the exact forwarding paths taken by the Bitcoin traffic using measurements (e.g., traceroute) or routing data (BGP announcements), both of which can be forged.\n\nWhat makes such attacks possible\n\nThe routing attacks against Bitcoin are made possible by two key characteristics of the Internet’s infrastructure: the efficiency of routing manipulation (BGP hijacks) and the centralization of Bitcoin from the routing perspective.\n\nThe attack happens by performing a partitioning attack which diverts relevant Bitcoin traffic using BGP hijacking. The BGP is the de-facto routing protocol that regulates how IP packets are forwarded on the Internet - for all the prefixes pertaining to the Bitcoin nodes to be isolated. As a result, the attacker receives all the traffic destined to these prefixes and splits them into two packet streams: relevant and irrelevant.\n\nIn the latter phase, the attacker cuts all vulnerable connections that cross the partition to create leakage points. These nodes are connected to the rest of the network via stealth connections.\n\nImpact on the Bitcoin ecosystem\n\nOne of the reasons why routing attacks have been overlooked in Bitcoin is that they are often considered too challenging to be practical.\n\nEven ignoring detectability, mitigating network attacks is hard as it is essentially a human-driven process consisting of filtering, routing around or disconnecting the attacker.', 'Bitcoin intelligence provider Elliptic is rolling out a program with California-based Silvergate Bank to analyze and screen possible nefarious activity on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe effort is focused on helping banks assess future bitcoin-based business clients. For banks, often the associated risks are deemed higher than the potential rewards when considering new clients that operate in the bitcoin space – an often-cited stumbling block in the industry.\n\n""The banks that are working with bitcoin companies really don’t have much visibility into how effective they are at handling the risk associated with bitcoin transactions,"" said James Smith, Elliptic\'s CEO.\n\nSmith told CoinDesk:\n\n""Until now, they pretty much have had to rely on the word of the exchange or whoever [processed the transaction] to say \'We’re doing the best we can.\'""\n\nElliptic\'s software allows financial institutions to take a more robust approach in vetting bitcoin businesses and complying with know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements.\n\nThe platform will help banks find suspicious bitcoin activity, allowing them to reduce risk assessment costs for current and potential customers, while demonstrating to regulators that there are internal safeguards in place to weed out bad actors.\n\n""We see this as a great step forward in terms of raising the industry standard, in terms of compliance, improving the level of risk mitigation and, ultimately, allowing Silvergate to work with more businesses who are handling bitcoin,"" said Smith.\n\nSilver lining\n\nWhile beneficial in this regard, Silvergate is already one of the exceptions to the rule in the banking world when it comes to bitcoin. The bank currently provides services to more than 30 bitcoin-related companies, including digital currency exchanges, institutional investors, miners and software developers.\n\nStill, those involved in the project argue better visibility will in turn aid banks as the regulatory environment moves to one where banks are now responsible for their customer\'s customers as well.\n\nPlus, Silvergate and Elliptic argue that the platform will allow financial institutions to better assess when their customers\' internal controls may be suspect.\n\n""What we’re looking for is to see how a client is performing over time as an indication of whether their internal control environment is getting stronger,"" said Ben Reynolds, vice president of business development and digital banking at Silvergate.\n\nSimilar to Elliptic\'s other anti-money laundering products, the platform screens each blockchain transaction for potential linkages to suspicious activity and then issues each with a risk score.\n\nProactive push\n\nWhile efforts to separate the allegedly \'good\' bitcoin users from the \'bad\' ones have been met with pushback from certain factions of the bitcoin community, Elliptic and Silvergate emphasize that the goal is not to micromanage clients, but rather to understand holistically what clients are doing to filter out eyebrow-raising activity.\n\n""What they want to know is – at a high level – what percentage of transactions going through this business are suspicious? How has that changed over time? Does it look like they are improving their controls?"" said Smith.\n\nThe bottom line, Reynolds said, is that the software will soften Silvergate’s overall risk management overhead. ""For us, each client that we take on initially is a pretty large investment in terms of the due diligence process that we go through,"" he said.\n\nReynolds went on to explain that while Silvergate has no regulatory obligation to enact such a program, it\'s being proactive to advance the legitimacy, credibility and sustainability of the bitcoin industry and pushback on negative stereotypes.\n\nSmith concluded:\n\n""With this extra visibility, they’re able to understand how effective these companies are at handling risk and therefore get more comfortable with the idea of banking them.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Elliptic.\n\nSilvergate Bank image via La Jolla Center\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Estimations value the amount of cryptocurrency hacked at over $80,000.\n\nNorth Korea might be behind the hacking of thousands of Bitcoins. The cash-strapped nation has elevated its efforts over the years increase financing. Some of the largest hacks over the past few years can be attributed to their efforts. Bold targets are in the crosshairs of the sophisticated army of hackers.\n\nThe New York Times reported that North Korean hackers tried to hack Polish banks in 2016. The hackers left a trail behind, tipping researchers off to other targets such as the World Bank, European Central Bank and Bank of America.\n\nFinancial gain\n\nThe list of targets points to financial motives rather than purely disruptive attacks. The cash-strapped country has lost more aid and support in recent years due to provoking with increased militarization and an expanding nuclear program.\n\nA group of 1,700 hackers and over 5,000 trainers and supervisors are allegedly part of the efforts, according to South Korean estimates. The majority of manpower seems to be located abroad in countries like China, Southeast Asia and Europe.\n\nAccording to South Korean officials, North Korea has been training hackers at least since the 90’s. Yonhap News estimates as much as $88,100 stolen between 2013 to 2015 in Bitcoin alone.\n\nChoi Sang-Myong of South Korean cybersecurity firm Hauri Inc was quoted in Yonhap news saying, “Cyber criminals have turned to Bitcoin for money as it is very difficult to track them down. Since tracking down the culprits is very difficult, North Korea had jumped on the bandwagon of Bitcoin extortion since around 2012.”\n\nBangladesh Heist\n\nThe $81 mln attack on the central bank of Bangladesh and 2014 attack on Sony seem to have common characteristics. Symantec researcher Eric Chen states, “We have found multiple links, which gave us reasonable confidence that it’s the same group behind Bangladesh and Polish attacks.”\n\nAttacks target both more traditional means of finance security such as SWIFT and digital currencies, showing a sophisticated effort. SWIFT is highly regarded for its security, despite attacks becoming more prevalent recently.\n\nThis introduces the opportunity for financial institutions to seek more secure methods of dealing with reserves. With security and difficulty to hack being a key factor of Blockchain technology, it is natural to see how banks and financial institutions can ultimately leverage it for safety.\n\nHow to stay safe\n\nThis should act as a signal to all of those holding cryptocurrencies to increase measures of security. North Korean hackers abroad are known to run illegal gambling sites and this might understandably be the link to Bitcoin wallets being hacked.\n\nUsers can protect themselves by selecting reputable vendors, even if it costs a few satoshis more in the casino example. Frequently the human factor puts wallets at risk. Other factors to increase your assets include holding your own keys, hardware wallets or paper wallets.']"
04/20/2017,"['Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz is betting big on digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether.\n\n""Ten percent of my net worth is in this space,"" Novogratz said at a forum held at the Harvard Business School Club of New York Wednesday. He declined to say exactly how wealthy he is, but he\'s a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and a Goldman Sachs partner who made the Forbes billionaire list in 2008.\n\nIt\'s the ""best investment of my life,"" Novogratz said.\n\nBitcoin was worth under $500 a year ago. Today the digital currency trades at over $1,200. Back in 2013, Novogratz predicted Bitcoin\'s value would soar. He remembers people laughing at him at the time.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin\'s price has been on a wild run. It surged to nearly $1,000 in late 2013 and then fell to under $250 in 2015. It started to fly again last year, around the time of the Brexit vote. It surpassed $1,000 in January of this year again and has kept climbing.\n\nNow Novogratz is saying Bitcoin will go to $2,000.\n\nBut he also warned the Harvard Business School Club crowd that there will ""likely be a bubble"" in digital currencies. The best way to handle it, he argues, is the old Wall Street trick of diversification. Put a little money in a lot of different plays in digital currency.\n\nRelated: What is Bitcoin? Read CNN\'s explainer\n\nFor example, Novogratz was also an early investor in Ether. It\'s another digital currency that has quickly emerged as the No. 2 rival to Bitcoin. Novogratz says he bought Ether when it was trading for about $1. Today it\'s worth over $48.\n\nNovogratz met Vitalik Buterin, the young Russian brainchild behind Ether at a dinner party at a prominent CEO\'s home. He recalls that Buterin, then 21, showed up late, which struck him as shocking -- and a bit ballsy. He figured it was worth paying attention to Buterin.\n\nEther is a currency with a ""smart contract"" function that gives users additional security and abilities to transfer information in addition to monetary value.\n\nWe\'re witnessing the ""3rd inning"" of this digital asset revolution, Novogratz predicts. He\'s not exactly sure how it will play out, but he plans to continue investing in digital currencies and Blockchain, the revolutionary technology behind the scenes that makes Bitcoin work.\n\nBlockchain is literally a digital ledger to record and track transactions. What makes it so technologically advanced is that multiple companies or parties can access the Blockchain and see the history of what happened to an asset.\n\nRelated: Yext: The newest $1 billion tech company\n\nNovogratz has emerged as one of the biggest Wall Street cheerleaders of Blockchain, but his bets haven\'t always gone so well. He exited Fortress in 2015 after the company shut down his Marco Fund for poor performance. It lost around 20% in its final year after his investments in emerging markets, especially Brazil, tanked.\n\n""We have had an extremely challenging two years, and I do not believe the current environment is conducive to achieving our best results,"" Novogratz said at the time.', ""Bitcoin is trading at its best level in a month. The cryptocurrency is up 2.8% at $1241.35 a coin and is within striking distance of its all-time closing high of $1277.65, which was set on March 6.\n\nFour days later, bitcoin put in a record high of $1327.19 before crashing more than 25% after the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the Winklevoss twins' plans for a bitcoin ETF. The SEC rejected the plans for another bitcoin ETF just a few weeks after that.\n\nHowever, bitcoin has rallied off its March 24 low of $959.45 as it has gained acceptance elsewhere. First, Japan announced it was accepting the crypticurrency as a legal payment method, then, Russia said it would consider recognizing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2018.\n\nBitcoin has been the top-performing currency every year since 2010, aside from 2014. It's up 30% so far in 2017."", ""Hirosaki, a city in Japan has started accepting Bitcoin donation in a first of its kind initiative by a public institution in the country. This is coming barely a few weeks after about 260,000 stores in parts of Japan started accepting the digital currency as a payment method.\n\nKnown for its Aomori Prefecture park which has 2,600 cherry trees and 400-year-old castle, the Hirosaki city starts accepting the Bitcoin donation to raise funds for the preservation of the 50 kinds of cherry trees and repair stone walls of the castle for future generations.\n\nAccording to the national Japanese TV NHK which featured the news on Thursday, April 20, the park attracts two mln people during blossom season each year. Thus it is necessary to care of the trees which run into hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe broadcaster cites that city officials chose to collect donations in Bitcoin to encourage donations from overseas because the currency is popular outside Japan and remittance fees are low. It also quotes deputy mayor Noboru Yamamoto as saying that Bitcoin may provide a solution to other Japanese local authorities at a time when most are struggling to raise funds.\n\nCoinCheck, the Japanese Bitcoin company which cooperates with the local government on the initiative, quotes a government staff of Hirosaki as saying:\n\n“We expect Bitcoin donation to be an effective approach to promote Hirosaki’s cherry blossoms and a castle especially to people living outside of Japan.”\n\nHe adds: “When collecting donations from overseas, features of Blockchain such as fast payment process, low processing fees and transparency and security of transaction enhances the efficiency of funding.”\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin donation enables sending money quickly just by reading QR code with a smartphone as well as checking the progress and outcome of donation in real time. We thought these characteristics of Blockchain could help increase satisfaction and provide memorable donation experience for donors. We also expect Bitcoin donations to be a unique tourism promotion. When it comes to more practical benefits, Bitcoin donation requires much lower initial cost and running cost compared to a traditional method.”\n\nThe Business Lead at CoinCheck, Kagayaki Kawabata, points to a change in the Japanese populace perception about Bitcoin. He says via email:\n\n“The Japanese local government accepting Bitcoin donation indicates general audiences perception of Bitcoin is improving dramatically. A few years ago, the government didn't bother with Bitcoin at all. Now even the local government is showing an interest in using Bitcoin as a promotion tool to attract foreign visitors to their city.”\n\nThe Hirosaki Cherry Blossom Festival is held from April 22, 2017."", '4.\n\nWhat are the main arguments against SegWit?\n\nThe key points against SegWit can be roughly divided into three groups: technical, political and ideological.\n\nSome have argued that SegWit, in its current state, will not be able to solve the problems it promises to solve. One of the primary arguments here is that the block size increase proposed by the update is not nearly enough to satisfy the growing needs of Bitcoin’s user base.\n\nThe majority of the experts seem to agree about the high technical competence of the authors of SegWit, as well as the solidity of the technology itself. However, it is nearly impossible for a person who is not a programmer to evaluate the authenticity of the arguments proposed by both sides.\n\nThe fact that the debate is now not purely technological but has a political aspect too only complicates things. A large number of people working on SegWit are also employed by a company called Blockstream, whose primary product is sidechain solutions.\n\nSome from the community claim that this creates a conflict of interest, as the developers are incentivized to obstruct attempts at increasing the block size, in order to artificially increase the demand for sidechain solutions, such as the Lightning Network. There is no definitive proof for this claim but a large part of the community has still chosen to believe in it and is opposing SegWit as a result.\n\nThe main ideological argument, leveled against the update, is that it does not provide scalability while preserving a sufficient degree of decentralization of the Bitcoin network. As has been said earlier, SegWit solves the long-term problems with Bitcoin’s insufficient transaction capacity only insofar as allowing for implementation of second-layer sidechain solutions, such as the Lightning Network.\n\nThe problem some people see here is how the sidechains work. In order to not rely on the highly congested Blockchain, they move the coins to a second-layer system. There, all transactions are processed by a trusted third party, without having to broadcast them across the entire network, which saves a lot of resources and time.\n\nBut a trusted point of authority in charge is exactly what Bitcoin was meant to remove from the monetary system. For some, that is an unacceptable compromise, no matter how little power the third party wields in solutions such as the LN and others.', 'Speculators flocked to Bitcoin and many of the alt-coins in hopes of getting in early and making a big exit, but everyday users haven’t warmed to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are many reasons why, but one of the largest barriers to mainstream adoption is the price volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo the question is, why do the prices change so much in the first place? It comes down to supply and demand: Most cryptocurrencies have only a fixed total supply, and yet demand for the coins is uncertain and constantly fluctuating thanks to speculation.\n\nOf course, it’s easy enough to talk about the problem — coming up with a solution is quite another matter.\n\nWhy is stability so important?\n\nThe need for stability is not unique to cryptocurrency. Any currency needs to be stable in order to be used as a trusted medium of exchange. The more that prices rise and fall, the more ordinary people will shy away from using the coins for everyday transactions.\n\nWhether they hoard the coins in the hope that prices will rise sharply soon, or they avoid using them altogether for fear that they will lose all of their value, people are not yet accustomed to seeing cryptocurrency as real money.\n\nWorse, the unpredictability of prices wreaks havoc on regular money services, like remittance, currency conversion, and the use of ATMs. In order to use cryptocurrencies, businesses have to hedge their risks by charging exorbitant fees.\n\nBitcoin ATMs can charge up to 15 percent just to convert to fiat currency. This totally defeats the original purpose of cryptocurrencies, which was to offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative to other payment methods. With no advantage over government-printed money, why would the average person use them?\n\nPatience is a virtue\n\nPrice volatility has plagued Bitcoin from nearly the beginning. With what we have learned over the better part of a decade, why have cryptocurrencies still not solved this problem of fluctuating prices?\n\nHuman nature gets in the way, as it tends to do. It is difficult to stabilize prices in a world where people would rather play the market and get instant gratification by re-selling their coins for as high a price as possible. Without careful planning from the very onset of a cryptocurrency’s existence, it’s hard to recover from the effects of speculation.\n\nPhase 1: Building a stable ecosystem\n\nWhen building a cryptocurrency from scratch, you first need a solid foundation. From this foundation, the currency can grow and self-correct as it develops.\n\nGauging demand\n\nThe first piece of the puzzle is being able to reliably predict demand. Uncertainty around demand is the main cause of price fluctuation, as every user’s intentions are a mystery to every other user. Having a way to gauge real demand for a coin would go a long way in fixing this problem.\n\nThe issue with predicting demand, though, is the existence of speculators creating artificial demand. This is the core of the problem: With so much speculation, the price for the cryptocurrency will not reflect its actual usage and demand. It simply becomes a bubble that is constantly on the verge of bursting, and no one wants to risk their hard-earned money on that.\n\nTraditionally, the solution to the problem of stability was to have a central bank. The government could then alter the money supply at will, for example by causing inflation. Cryptocurrencies are by definition decentralized — that is part of their advantage — and without a central bank they need an entirely new approach when it comes to squashing volatility. They need to do this without compromising the freedom of the users and without resorting to inflation.\n\nCooperation over competition: A decentralized community\n\n“United we stand, divided we fall.”\n\nWhat if there was a currency that encouraged people to cooperate? What if people were incentivized by a spirit of growth, rather than of greed? Under the ideal model, a network of cooperative businesses and services would coordinate with each other as a single unit. The coin would be shaped democratically by this co-op (shaped not controlled). Every user would have incentives to help the network grow as a whole, and the use of a blockchain would help make the process be fair.\n\nInstead of rampant online speculation, users would visit local exchanges to buy and sell the currency. The community as a whole would vote on when to increase the coin’s price, which would keep things democratic and guard against sharp spikes.\n\nOfficial local exchanges\n\nHaving to look other users in the eye can make a world of difference. Face-to-face exchanges at trusted locations means that the sale of a coin can be more easily limited, and this can act as a throttle to gauge demand. People on the “front lines,” seeing the real demand for the coin in person, can then vote to increase the price. Having stable locations to exchange the currency also creates consistency. It removes the guessing game of wondering where you can buy and sell your coin.\n\nThe advantages are not just purely economic, either. Cryptocurrencies don’t exactly have the best reputation thanks to their penchant for attracting unscrupulous people. Unethical or illegal businesses will tend to be voted out of cooperative networks with face-to-face exchanges, however, which can go a long way toward legitimizing the currency. It would still be possible to run such enterprises of course, but they would never be part of the co-op.\n\nLocal exchange dominance\n\nThis kind of approach can only work if there are dramatically more local exchanges than online exchanges. It would mean that the local exchanges would dictate the pricing of the currency.\n\nMarketing early can be disastrous\n\nMarketing is a powerful force, and as such it needs to be handled with care. On the one hand, founders naturally want to attract investment early on. This will raise the price of the coin and help pay for infrastructure, as well as boost the growth of the coin. On the other hand, historically the earliest investors in cryptocurrency have been extremely low quality — they are the speculators who doom the currency in the long run and scare away mainstream users.\n\nWith speculation, capital infusion is needed to keep the currency stable, which can be a significant task. Take Bitcoin for instance: With a market cap of roughly $20 billion, it would need a huge amount of capital to have a stable floor.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race\n\nCryptocurrencies are still in their infancy, and it’s hard to tell where the path for most of the major currencies is headed. What is the “finish line” that they are aiming for? What will the end game be? Most cryptocurrencies have little direction besides the whims of the market, so there’s no telling where they will end up. However, there are a handful of interesting coins that have invested in strategies that nudge them in a specific direction.\n\nThe central app coin method\n\nThis is a strategy that is centered around creating value with unique products and services that are associated with the currency. In this way, you could say that the currency is backed by something that people actually want.\n\nFor example, the MaidSafe network incentivizes users to provide something of value to the network (storage space), and offers the use of apps and services in return for coins. This naturally leads to better cooperation. People want to create value and channel their efforts toward the growth of the currency that they have in common.\n\nThe setup and switch method\n\nSimilar to the central app strategy, this method establishes a user base first, and then introduces the currency. Bitshares and its array of associated startups is a good example of this. Several networks with varying currencies — Steemit and their STEEM currency, Peerplays and their tokens, for instance — slowly built their user base and value exchange system, and now they plan to adopt a central currency with Bitshares. This allows them to create a stable base first before pooling their resources.\n\nThe grassroots movement\n\nFinally, the best way for a currency to create that all-important foundation of true users is through bootstrapping. Just like a business startup, a currency like this would need a user base that believed in a common mission. It would need everyone in the system to be able to see the inherent value of the coin, and to understand that it could be worth much more than the value it is traded for in its early stages.\n\nAn example of one of these grassroots efforts is FairCoin. It’s a currency established and led by FairCoop, whose strategy is to build an ecosystem where businesses cooperate to give users maximum value. It is a currency built from the ground up to incentivize the long-term interests of users instead of their short-term greed — not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it makes sense.\n\nFairCoin focused from the beginning on building infrastructure for everyday users. Because of the strong relationships among members of the co-op, they can have thousands of ATMs, debit cards and exchanges that make mass adoption much easier.\n\nAn approach like this allows the currency to slowly build itself in the background without the need for a spotlight and the barrage of speculators that come with it. This offers the huge advantage of stability from the very beginning, though it does pose the problem that FairCoin has to bootstrap with less capital than most coins. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, they can’t rely on CoinMarketCap to sing their praises by displaying artificially rising prices (the effects of speculation).\n\nIn other words, FairCoin traded the excitement of volatility and greed for a quiet, long-term stability. The only problem is that people might not notice! Drama catches the human eye, after all.\n\nHard forks\n\nLet’s take a look at the hard fork that looms in the horizon for Bitcoin. As if things weren’t complicated enough, now there could be two competing chains for the currency. There are already many technical barriers to Bitcoin’s adoption among mainstream users, and this is yet another one. This makes the price even more uncertain, and uncertainty is like poison for a currency.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a large community and a co-op on top of an immutable blockchain, then a hard fork is extremely unlikely — and unnecessary. Cryptocurrencies like MaidSafe, Bitshares and FairCoin all represent solid communities that are incentivized to cooperate instead of speculate. This means that the coin can be worth more than its market price; it has a high inherent value within the system itself.\n\nThis makes it so that users have very little reason to defect from the existing community. A hard fork would mean giving up many benefits of the co-op, so people stay loyal to the original vision of the currency. When something deeper than just greed ties a community, hard forks don’t occur as often.\n\nConclusion\n\nStable prices don’t just happen by accident. They are not a miracle of the market — they require a carefully constructed foundation. A stable currency needs a stable ecosystem first.\n\nWhile it’s tempting to market the currency too soon because capital injection can do a lot to raise prices in those critical early periods, it’s better to wait. Advertising is like opening up Pandora’s box and inviting the world to look inside. Some of those users will be interested in the actual currency, but others will be undesirable speculators that just leech off the system. For a currency to be stable, it needs to be used by “the 99%,” not just a handful of investors.\n\nA currency needs to grow with the people, not past them. Look at the state of Bitcoin and its inflated prices. The everyday person can no longer either mine the coin or expect to use the coin in everyday transactions without high fees or risk. It has been given up to the speculators.\n\nWith a truly stable currency, on the other hand, you can have currency conversion, remittance, ATM withdrawals and other financial services with lower fees than fiat systems. In other words, it can be used as intended — as money. This is what will ultimately attract a mainstream audience and will actually incentivize them to make the switch to cryptocurrency.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch', ""In the 21st century, money is no longer limited to bills, coins and credit cards. In fact, some money is truly international -- not owned by any particular government -- and regulated “by the people” instead of a central entity. It also exists wholly on the internet. This type of money is called cryptocurrency.\n\nYou may have heard of or even used Bitcoin when it first became popular several years ago, but where Bitcoin used to rule, other cryptocurrencies are now being used to pay back family members for lunch, charge customers for products and services and make other everyday transactions. As an entrepreneur, it’s important to keep an eye on the most commonly-used cryptocurrencies. Here are six I think you should know about.\n\nEthereum\n\nRather than competing with Bitcoin like many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum complements it; while the Bitcoin blockchain network tracks ownership of its own currency, the Ethereum blockchain runs programming codes for its users’ applications. People use Ethereum to create custom (but trustworthy) crowdfunding platforms, autonomous online organizations and even their own cryptocurrencies. Because these applications are decentralized, they can only be built in the Ethereum network.\n\nThough Ether, the network's money, wasn’t made to be used for everyday payments, anything of value can be traded for products and services; as a result, many developers use it to pay for each other’s help in building applications.\n\nHowever, most online stores that accept cryptocurrency do not take Ether.\n\nRelated: 11 Ways to Make Money While You Sleep\n\nLitecoin\n\nIf Bitcoin were gold, Litecoin would be silver. Litecoin works just like its more popular counterpart, but it’s worth a little less -- there are 21 million total Bitcoin in existence and 84 million Litecoin. Litecoin are easier to mine and quicker to move from person to person due to its faster block generation. It is perhaps the least intimidating cryptocurrency for those who are new to exchanging money online: Litecoin’s wallet can be downloaded from the official Litecoin website, and it’s fully encrypted to prevent accidental spending and computer viruses. This is a super simple network for those who need to move smaller amounts of money fast.\n\nRipple\n\nWhile other cryptocurrencies avoid banks, Ripple embraces them. In fact, Ripple was made for banks, as it allows them to make faster, low-cost, on-demand global payments of any size. Traditional cross-border transactions require banks to go through an intermediary (or often several), which delays completion. Ripple offers a faster and more direct alternative. When a bank customer in the US wants to send a payment to a different bank customer in China, for example, Ripple immediately queries both banks for their transaction fees and makes the transfer in a matter of minutes. It even updates both customers’ ledgers right away so they can view their balances following the transaction. This unique cryptocurrency enables banks to offer new and improved payment products, and it simplifies regular transactions for consumers around the world.\n\nRelated: Habits of the World's Wealthiest People (Infographic)\n\nDash\n\nThough Dash can be used for transactions between consumers, it was made for shopping. Think of Dash as a replacement for PayPal. Many merchants accept Dash just as they do USD, but the transaction is faster -- you don’t have to wait a day or two to see the payment charge to your account. Like any other cryptocurrency, you can buy Dash using government-regulated currency and keep it in a designated Dash wallet until you’re ready to spend it at a compatible merchant. You may even consider adding your own business to the merchant map!\n\nZcash\n\nIf you want to maximize your confidentiality, this cryptocurrency is for you. Zcash has been dubbed the first “zero-knowledge” cryptocurrency with its ability to “shield” the identities of all senders, recipients and values. Each transaction is fully encrypted, so users can enjoy the advantages of a public blockchain without offering up private information. Many view Zcash as a more confidential version of Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: 5 Habits of the Wealthy That Helped Them Get Rich\n\nMonero\n\nMonero is another excellent cryptocurrency option for those concerned about their privacy. This currency was designed to give individual users full control over their money; with Monero, you are your own bank. Transactions are “selectively transparent,” meaning you decide who can and can’t see where your money is going. Crises faced by banks and governments won’t affect your assets or compromise confidential information. Finally, like many cryptocurrencies, Monero is decentralized and community-built -- over thirty developers have directly contributed to Monero so far.\n\nWhy are these so important?\n\nIf your business doesn’t use any of these cryptocurrencies already, you may want to start incorporating them soon. When it comes to online financial transactions, cryptocurrencies like the ones above have quickly started to give PayPal, Stripe and other payment systems a run for their money.\n\nCryptocurrency transactions aren’t validated by a central entity, meaning there are no bank or platform fees associated with payments -- just optional, minute fees (one percent or less) that speed up the transaction. You also don’t have to wait nearly as long to receive cryptocurrency as you may with traditional money.\n\nAgain, a cryptocurrency's most important feature might be that it's truly international; no particular government owns or regulates it. This means there are no fees for payments that cross borders, and the transaction works the same no matter where you or the other party are located.\n\nThe only major disadvantage to cryptocurrency is the need to sell it for USD (or any other government currency). However, this process closely imitates the way you’d transfer PayPal funds to your checking account."", 'LOS ANGELES, April 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BitcoinIRA.com has announced the launch of Ethereum IRA, a self-directed IRA for the second-most popular cryptocurrency (by market cap) in the world.

But under President Hugo Chavez\'s socialist agenda, widespread nationalisations and takeovers of private enterprises compelled many middle-class families such as Brito\'s to leave.\n\nIn 2011, while browsing the internet, Brito discovered the world of bitcoin on a dedicated forum.\n\nA post described ""bitcoin mining"", a fully decentralised process where ""miners"" compete by making their computing power available to process and confirm transactions coming from a peer-to-peer network.\n\nMiners who perform faster transactions earn transaction fees paid by other users, while, in turn, new bitcoins are issued into existence.\n\nThe next year, Brito founded Bitcoin Venezuela as an educational forum to spread knowledge about the digital cryptocurrency.\n\n""At the time, there were maximum 10 profiles on the internet talking about bitcoin in Venezuela,"" Brito says.\n\nThe platform expanded quickly and today has a community of more than 7,000 users. It serves as a beacon for a fast-growing digital currency mining community in a country mired in an economic crisis.\n\nREAD MORE - Venezuela: What is happening?\n\nBitcoin mining in Venezuela\n\nOnce Latin America\'s top performing economy, Venezuela now has the fastest contracting economy in the world. Amid political turmoil, Venezuela is currently experiencing violent protests.\n\nAccording to the IMF, inflation is set to hit 1,600 percent this year.\n\nLong lines of people wait at the government-run grocery stores, where Venezuelans can shop only on designated days of the week depending on the last digit on their national identity card. Shops are suffering from an acute shortage of goods. Hospitals have been forced to operate with inadequate medical equipment and to cope with dwindling supplies. At present, many Venezuelans subsist on a monthly government salary equal to about $14.\n\nIn early 2014, Nicolas Maduro\'s government introduced a new price control law aimed at fighting inflation and tackling the issue of goods shortages - customarily experienced because of a fixed-exchange system imposed by Chavez in 2003. Instead of stemming the problems, the law exacerbated the shortage crisis and inflation soared, leading to massive protests in the country. Bitcoin Venezuela provided a means to import water, food and other essentials which were becoming scarce.\n\n""From then on, mining started going viral in the country,"" Brito says.\n\nBitcoin, created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous computer programmer, is a peer-to-peer currency that runs exclusively on the internet. It has no government, central bank, corporation, or other institutions controlling it. Mining it has become an increasingly popular undertaking in today\'s Venezuela, where the government-issued currency has lost much of its value and even skilled professionals struggle to find work. The last official unemployment rate reported was 7.3 percent in April last year.\n\n""There are some job opportunities, but the pay is truly a pittance,"" says Alberto, a former industrial engineer, whose name has been changed for his own safety.\n\nIn early 2014, Alberto was working as a logistics director for a company selling goods, when the Venezuelan government first started seizing goods-selling shops. At the time, one bitcoin equalled $1,000 for the first time.\n\n""The job I had was clearly getting me nowhere,"" Alberto recalls, ""so I decided to give bitcoin a try.""\n\nWithin the first five months, he made $5,000, which prompted him to turn to bitcoin mining full time. He bought more computers to mine bitcoins. Alberto says he now makes an average $1,000 a month and saves almost all that he mines.\n\nOther miners, instead, use their earnings, which are invariably much higher than the average wage of $58, either to cope with the shortages or to keep their businesses afloat.\n\nDavid, 27, a computer scientist living in Maracay, imports basic staples to help feed his family. He purchases Amazon gift cards through the bitcoin-friendly website eGifter, and then channels his orders through a Miami-based courier service.\n\nFernando, a 29-year-old miner who lives in Valencia, says he uses his monthly revenue to buy insulin from overseas for his diabetic father.\n\nRafael, 34, who owns a repair shop in Caracas, uses bitcoins to import goods that are no longer available in Venezuela and resupply his store\'s shelves.\n\nThe three, who all agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity through encrypted channels out of fear of getting caught, illustrate how a growing number of Venezuelans are using bitcoin to overcome the daily hardships of a collapsing society.\n\nVenezuelans living abroad are also venturing into bitcoin mining to help people back home.\n\n""The currency exchanges rates in Venezuela are unfair,"" says Jon Valencia, a Venezuelan living in Medellin, Colombia, who occasionally mines bitcoins to send money to relatives and close friends in his native country.\n\n""That\'s the reason many people are sending money to Venezuela through \'proxies\' exchangers or using cryptocurrencies to send to a local buyer,"" he says. ""People in Venezuela prefer to have bitcoins in their wallet, because they gain value over time while bolivars lose it due to the inflation.""\n\nTo start mining, one needs a special-purpose computer able to process complicated computational operations at a fast pace and an internet connection. Bitcoin mining consumes a lot electricity as it is a process of essentially turning electricity into currency. In Venezuela, however, electricity is practically free, subsidised by the state after the government\'s decision to nationalise the country\'s largest private power producer in 2007.\n\nALSO READ: Venezuela\'s spiralling mental healthcare crisis\n\nMining despite the risks\n\nWhile bitcoin mining isn\'t illegal in Venezuela, early last year the government began a crackdown on miners, painting the activity as a subversive practice that bypasses the capital controls and is linked to ""cybercriminals"".\n\nThey fear being discovered by the Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional, or SEBIN, the country\'s secret police.\n\n""Not only the SEBIN, the national police has also raided miners,"" Brito says.\n\nAccording to some accounts, agents with the secret police have extorted miners, threatening them with arrest.\n\nMiners who have been arrested have been charged with tax fraud, money laundering, electricity theft and other crimes.\n\nElectricity is also a major issue. Two-thirds of the country\'s electricity comes from hydropower, but dam water levels are at an all-time low. To conserve power, the government has introduced planned power cuts and scaled back the working week for public employees to two days.\n\nFrom a currency perspective, Brito believes the benefits of mining outweigh concerns over electricity usage.\n\n""Bitcoin mining is definitely a good use of electricity in Venezuela,"" Brito argues, ""because it\'s giving the country a relatively stable currency with several advantages over paper currency.""\n\nWilliam Luther, an assistant professor of economics at Kenyon College in the US, says, ""It\'s not surprising at all that many have turned to bitcoin as a currency.""\n\nThe impact of the monetary policy carried out by Chavez and Maduro has forced many Venezuelans to become more and more industrious over the past decade, according to Luther.\n\n""Those of us in rich countries, with relatively stable currencies, might find little use for a medium of exchange as volatile as bitcoin. But things are very different in Venezuela,"" he says.\n\n""Whereas the government of Venezuela has failed to manage the supply of bolivars in a reasonable manner, bitcoin\'s supply is pre-programmed to grow at a steady, predictable rate. Whereas the Venezuelan government can demonetise physical notes and confiscate digital balances, bitcoin balances are secured by encryption. And whereas the oppressive regime can track an individual\'s digital balance of bolivars from one bank to another, bitcoin\'s blockchain only reveals a string of characters, not the user\'s identity.""\n\nOne might argue, Luther says, ""that the Venezuelan disaster is precisely why alternatives like bitcoin are so desirable.""', 'Very exciting news may be coming out of India by this time next month. According to the latest reports, India might officially recognize Bitcoin as money before summer and impose a tax on the digital currency as the answer to its recognition. This is not a new phenomenon going by what’s been happening in some other countries lately.\n\nIndian media: government plans to give Bitcoin legal status\n\nIn the report, there are indications that the committee recently constituted by India’s Reserve Bank to look into activities related to digital currencies such as Bitcoin will make its recommendations known between May 15 and 20.

As per the exclusive information received by CNBC Awaaz, the government is planning to regulate Bitcoin and have necessary taxes on it. The common virtual currency, Bitcoin, is not currently regulated and the government has plans to do so. That means all the activities related to Bitcoin should be properly monitored (and) applicable taxes should be added. The RBI should have guidelines for investing in Bitcoin, sending and receiving money from abroad through Bitcoin should have guidelines from FEMA.

Then, the exchange was trading at a premium of around $200 as traders could not deposit or withdraw fiat currency.\n\nBitfinex recently announced they have been blocked out of the banking system, unable to accept deposits or process withdrawals in fiat currencies. The only way out is by buying bitcoin and sending the currency to a cold wallet or to other exchanges.\n\nSome are suggesting arbitrage opportunities, which might explain the recent overall rise of bitcoin’s price in all exchanges. However, the buying pressure on Bitfinex appears significant, thus the exchange continues to retain a considerable premium.\n\nIf the exchange can account for all of its customers’ bitcoins and other digital currencies, then it should be able to process all bitcoin withdrawals, but they were hacked last year out of some 120,000 bitcoins. Therefore, it is not very clear just how many bitcoins they contain in their cold wallets, nor is it clear how these cold wallets are stored.\n\nThe situation appears very similar to MT Gox, the then biggest bitcoin exchange. They were cut-off from the banking system, leading to a premium of some $200. Eventually, they were unable to process bitcoin withdrawals as the exchange was seemingly running on fractional reserves.\n\nUsers began complaining about bitcoin withdrawal delays from MT Gox around December 2013, with the complaints getting much louder in January and then February, when the exchange announced they were insolvent.\n\nThere have been no such complaints regarding Bitfinex as far as we are aware, but if they start being raised it might be too late. Many, therefore, seem to be getting out, explaining the price premium.\n\nThe lesson here for other exchanges is that they need to be regulated as otherwise they may be suddenly cut off the banking system which would in effect make them as good as inoperational due to lack of liquidity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Coindesk\n\nThere’s a number of reasons why cryptocurrencies are so inherently popular. They are safe, anonymous and utterly decentralized. Unlike conventional currency, they are not controlled or regulated by some singular authority, their flow is determined entirely by market demand. They are also nigh impossible to counterfeit, thanks to the paranoidly complicated code system that encrypts each and every transfer, ensuring complete anonymity and utter safety to each and every user. They even make for a genuinely rewarding, if risky, investment endeavor, despite the fact that any financial advisor in their right mind will caution you against them. Therefore, despite the admittedly high stakes that this sort of dealing entails, not to mention the lack of any government agency to lend credence to them, cryptocurrencies can only thrive and multiply.\n\nIf I were to tell you of the history of cryptocurrencies, I would have to begin with cryptographer David Chaum, who in the 1980s devised an extraordinarily secure algorithm that allowed for the kind of encryption required in electronic fund transfers. Chaum’s “blinding algorithm” laid the groundwork for the future development of all types of digitalized currency transactions, be it alternative currencies like Bitcoin or just plain old digitalized cash transfers.\n\n“I am personally excited for the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general. Current innovations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others are just the beginning for this technology that can help revamp many industries. There is plenty of opportunity in this space.” - Chalmers Brown, Forbes\n\nIn the later part of the 1980s, Chaum relocated to the Netherlands, and, with the help of a few fellow enthusiasts, laid the foundation of DigiCash, a for-profit cryptocurrency network based on his “blinded money” algorithm. Unlike newer cryptocurrencies, DigiCash exercised full monopoly over its supply, a far cry from being a decentralized mode of transaction such as Bitcoin. While DigiCash was founded with the idea of trading directly with individuals, the Netherlands government imposed severe restrictions on the company, forcing it to sell only to licensed banks. This seriously curtailed the company’s profits, and after a decade of struggling and being partnered with by Microsoft, the company finally closed doors in the 1990s. Chaum did go on to try his luck on a few similar cryptocurrency startups at the time, though none of them were really successful to begin with.\n\nFast forward to 2008, when a whitepaper was released under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto, detailing what would be widely regarded as the first modern cryptocurrency initiative. The idea combined concepts such as decentralization, perfect anonymity, finite supply and blockchain technology to pave the way for what we know as Bitcoin. Nakamoto, a pseudonymous individual or individuals operating under a fake name, released Bitcoin to the public in 2009. This idea was soon taken up by a gazillion different startups such as Litecoin. In 2010, Bitcoin received recognition as a proper currency after merchants such as WordPress, Expedia and Microsoft began accepting it as a mode of payment.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies can better adapt to the prevalent challenges of both funding and the emerging digital economy in addition to being a way to engage communities through P2P tech and crowdfunding platforms. There are over 2 billion people without access to the financial economy and even basics of modern civilization. Here at Humaniq, we are a blockchain fintech startup aiming to tackle some of these challenges by tapping into the power of digital currencies to leverage social impact. Approaching these issues from the angle of Initial Coin Offerings, we have so far managed to secure over 10,000 investors and $4M in investments in the last two weeks.” - Dinis Guarda, CEO at Humaniq\n\nSpeaking for 2017, we’re still far from Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency initiative, being officially recognized by a state government as a preferred mode of currency. Mere months ago, Bitcoin saw a 35% fluctuation in price range after a proposed exchange-trade fund by the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was denied by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission due to concerns that the currency could be used for illegal purposes such as black market trading. However, hope is anything but out, and 2017 will be a year to watch out for as far as alternative currencies are concerned.\n\nWhile Bitcoin experienced a drop in its prices, a cheaper cryptocurrency by the name of Ether reached its all-time highs at $40 a unit. While Ether’s current setup prevents it from being used as a direct method of payment, the cryptocurrency still seems to have a bright future ahead thanks to the concept of smart contracts. In the meantime, more privacy-concerned cryptocurrency alternatives are starting to gain prominence in favor of institutions such as Bitcoin, which despite their vigilant security measures, continue to have loopholes that could be exploited for access to personal data.\n\n“In a reminder of just how fickle the market for such newfangled assets can be, just after 4 p.m. Friday, the Bitcoin price took a U-turn and plummeted to lows not seen in months, dipping below $1000 to as low as $980, after Bitcoin investors received some bad news from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.” - Jen Wieczner, Fortune Magazine\n\nAnother interesting turn of events is the acceptance of Bitcoin in the educational industry, what with the University of Ohio hosting classes about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a part of its MFE curriculum. Several colleges have even begun to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment, a move which will clearly help bring this alternative currency to the mainstream. The acceptance of Bitcoin, in general, has already led to a few companies considering genuine investment opportunities in the currency, further fueling its journey to mainstream.\n\nWill cryptocurrencies be the new norm after 2017? Perhaps it is too soon to tell. But if there is one thing we know for sure, it is that the currency seems to have a wide appeal with a particular section of technologically-savvy individuals, a point that is sure to soon work in its favor.', 'Billionaire hedge fund investor Mike Novogratz, who made it into the Forbes billionaire list in 2008, revealed that he holds 10 percent of his net worth in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nNovogratz is considered as one of the early investors of Bitcoin and Ethereum. He first purchased Bitcoin in 2013, when the digital currency was worth around $50. The Bitcoin price declined throughout 2013 due to the Mt. Gox fiasco which led to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in user funds.\n\nEarly holder\n\nEarly investors of both Bitcoin and Ethereum are respected in the cryptocurrency community because they hardly sell their savings in Bitcoin despite extreme volatility and fluctuation at times. In 2013 for instance, Bitcoin price remained at one of its lowest points for 11 straight months, until it started to surge in November.\n\nSince his investment in 2013, Bitcoin price increased from around $50 to $1,270. In fact, it is close to reaching its all-time high price at $1,277, which was established minutes before the decision of the US Securities and Exchange Commission to decline the Winklevoss Twins’ Bitcoin ETF proposal.\n\nAt the Harvard Business School Club of New York Blockchain conference, Novogratz explained that his decision to invest 10 percent of his life savings into Bitcoin and Ether is the best investment of his life so far.\n\nICO purchase\n\nNovogratz also purchased Ethereum’s Ether during its ICO, when the token was worth around $1. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $49, which translates to a 49x return for Novogratz. At the event, Novogratz explained that a meeting with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and a prominent CEO allowed him to understand the true potential of Ethereum and its applicability across various industries.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported previously, the Ethereum network and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance platform are being utilized by some of the largest multi-billion dollar banks and corporations around the world, including the $92 bln firm BHP Billiton.\n\nNovogratz sees a bright future in the development of Ethereum and its evolution as a smart contract-based Blockchain platform for large-scale commercial businesses and corporations.\n\nMore successful multi-billion dollar investors in crypto\n\nTim Draper, the multi-billionaire angel investor of prominent companies including Uber and Skype, has also experienced a huge success in his Bitcoin investment. So far, his investment in Bitcoin alone earned Draper over $16 mln in profit. Apart from his direct investment in Bitcoin, he is a major investor in regional Bitcoin exchanges such as Coinplug and Blockchain startups such as Factom.\n\nOne common link between successful investors like Draper and Novogratz is their firm belief in the long-term success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. Novogratz, in particular, held onto his savings in Bitcoin throughout highly volatile periods when Bitcoin price declined by up to 30 percent in a period of weeks.\n\nHowever, Novogratz noted that the crypto space will likely have a bubble that would be exploited in the near future. Cryptocurrencies or altcoins without clear scalability plans and long-term roadmaps are likely to fail.', 'Bitcoin is heading back towards all-time highs as prices across the ecosystem approach the $1,250 barrier.\n\nFollowing a month of subdued value after the Winklevoss ETF rejection in March, a steady resurgence has been underway.

We wanted to combat this by giving consumers the option to opt in and get paid for their time used on trying a new product,” CEO Simon Yu commented in an accompanying press release on Wednesday.\n\n“With Bitmaker, end-users get paid, businesses only pay upon engagement, and customer acquisition costs are dramatically decreased.”\n\nThe project already has a burgeoning active user base of around 250,000 per month, despite officially being in stealth mode since its incarnation back in 2014.\n\nIn tandem with the 2.0 release, a crowdsale designed as a “limited round intended to increase user growth” and iOS app development will begin April 30 on the Wefunder platform. In future, additional currencies will be added for payouts beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to the release.\n\nCTO Calvin Hsieh, meanwhile, explained the mechanism for generating revenue on BitMaker is in fact based on gaming rewards long extant in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n“While playing, gamers are rewarded for completing a mission for items like digital swords or in-game gold. We made this experience tangible by tying it to the real world; when a user completes a mission on our app, they receive real money,” he added.\n\nThe app is not be confused with Canadian tech skills accelerator Bitmaker.co.', 'Estate planning, which is the process of planning who gets one’s assets after they die, can be a rather confusing, cumbersome process, and those annoyances are amplified when it comes to dealing with bitcoin and other digital assets. In a recent talk at the Zurich Blockchain Meetup, Third Key Solutions CEO and Empowered Law PLLC Attorney Pamela Morgan laid out seven steps for taking care of the estate planning process for digital assets.\n\nStep 1: Take an Inventory\n\nAccording to Morgan, the first step in estate planning for bitcoin and other digital assets is to take an inventory of what is already owned. While this may seem like a simple enough task at first, the reality is there are countless examples of people forgetting about some bitcoin in an old wallet and then finding it again years later.\n\n“Do you really know what you have? Morgan asked during her talk. “You know what you’ve been using recently, but what about that Mycelium wallet that you have the backup for from two phones ago?”\n\nIn addition to listing all of the digital assets currently owned, it’s also a good idea to write down how each specific asset can be accessed again in the future, Morgan added.\n\nStep 2: Separate Assets Into Tiers\n\nMorgan’s next recommended step is to separate digital assets into three different tiers: easily spendable, mid-range storage, and long-term cold storage.\n\n“You don’t want to lock up all of your bitcoin,” Morgan noted. “You may actually want to spend it [somewhat soon].”\n\nStep 3: Plan for Each Tier\n\nOnce tiers are created, Morgan said a plan must be made for each of them in terms of balancing security, ease-of-use, and accessibility.\n\n“When I say make a plan, I don’t mean think about it,” Morgan clarified. “First make a plan, but that’s not the end. You need to actually make the plan and write it down.”\n\nIn addition to assessing what’s already working, Morgan said a holder of digital assets should also looking into options with stronger security protections such as hardware wallets, multi-factor authentication, and multi-signature addresses.\n\n“Please keep it simple,” Morgan added. “Security by obscurity means you lose your keys . . . There are way more stories about people forgetting their passphrases, forgetting their pins, forgetting where they put their backups — all of these things . . . What does work is being smart, keeping it simple, and creating a repeatable plan that you can audit and go through yourself and make sure that you can still access it.”\n\nIn terms of picking the right plan, Morgan noted that it’s all about finding the right spot on the spectrum from security to ease of use.\n\nStep 4: Decide Who Gets What\n\nStep four is the first step that involves actual estate planning. This step is all about deciding who gets what.\n\n“It’s important to know that you need a tech plan and a legal plan for this,” said Morgan.\n\nIn terms of recommendations for dividing up one’s assets to be given to others, Morgan noted that the best rule of thumb is to stick with giving a percentage of each tier to particular people. With this method, individuals can avoid the unpredictable price fluctuations that would come with leaving specific amounts of specific digital assets for each person.\n\nMorgan also pointed out that it’s of critical importance to make sure that heirs can technically access the digital tokens. This means the heirs must have access to important information such as passphrases or the location of a hardware wallet. It may also make sense to make sure someone will be available to help the heirs access or liquidate the assets when necessary.\n\nIn addition to making sure the heirs have access to the assets, the original owner of the assets can also decide under what conditions the heirs can gain access to the assets. When planning this aspect of the process, it’s important to keep local laws related to leaving money for heirs in mind.\n\nStep 5: Test Your Plans\n\nAccording to Morgan, step five is the most important of all the steps. This vital step is to test the estate planning plans from the perspectives of both the owner of the assets and their heirs.\n\n“If you don’t test your plans, they will not work; I promise you, they will not work,” Morgan stated.\n\nTo start, Morgan suggested the use of a very small amount of value for the tests. This would limit losses in a scenario where something went wrong.\n\nAccording to Morgan, it’s also extremely important to test every possible scenario of the plan’s outcome rather than what is most likely to happen. For example, if some sort of multisignature structure is used, every possible multisig-powered transfer of funds needs to be tested.\n\nStep 6: Implement Your Plans\n\nThe next step is to go ahead and implement the plans. In addition to that, regular audits should be scheduled (with calendar reminders) to make sure the funds are always accessible. These audits could happen anywhere from once per quarter to once per year.\n\nStep 7: Store Your Plans\n\nThe final step is to store the plans in a manner that is access controlled, tamper evident, fireproof, waterproof, redundant, and without multiple multisig backups in the same place.\n\n“You don’t want to just store things in your family’s safe and that’s it because if something happens in that location, you could lose access to everything,” Morgan said. “Getting rid of third parties carries risks. One of the risks is that there’s no one to go to if you lose those keys. If you lose the keys and you lose the backups, you won’t be able to access the assets.”', 'Distributed systems have been around since the 1970s, and yet, it is only now that distributed ledgers are gaining widespread attention because of blockchain technology. While many may think it’s a long way from mainstream adoption, others are of the opinion that Bitcoin’s distributed ledger could change the world as we know it.\n\n\n\nDelving into how the blockchain ecosystem can shape our future is Swiss-born economist and filmmaker Manuel Stagars, who filmed the recently streamed eight-part documentary ""The Blockchain and Us."" In conversations with blockchain experts, scientists, entrepreneurs, corporate decision makers, politicians, investors and others from around the world, Stagars takes the viewer on a journey, portraying the technology away from the hype, making it accessible and starting a conversation about its potential.\n\nStagars, who has published books and scientific articles on startups, marketplace lending, impact investing, data quality and Open Data, opens his film referencing the Wright Brothers and how they invented the airplane in 1903. Nearly 115 years ago, it was hard to imagine that today there would be over 500,000 people traveling by air at any one time to various destinations. Fast-forward to 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin and blockchain technology. For the first time, this inventor made it possible to send and receive money anywhere in the world without the involvement of banks or middlemen.\n\n“Just like the Wright Brothers, [Satoshi] solved an unsolvable problem,” said Stagars. “Despite its mysterious beginnings, the blockchain might be the aeroplane of our time.”\n\nIn the first 40 years of the internet we have seen social media, email, online shopping, cloud computing, mobile applications, the Internet of Things, Big Data and Open Data. It’s almost impossible for an individual to get through a day without some form of information technology, and yet while this is the case, the internet still lacks one component: trust. Blockchain technology solves this issue.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Stagars said that he thinks the blockchain is one of those technologies that has the potential to transform industries, governments, and the way we live together in the future, much faster than we can imagine.\n\n“We’re in the early stages, and there will be some trial and error until we see the real long-term impacts,” he said. “This is part of this bigger movement of ‘digital transformation,’ where processes in general become decentralized and democratized with new and unexpected business models emerging.”\n\nHe added that, while this could be the main challenge, it’s also the main opportunity of the next decades, maybe even of our lives.\n\nOf course, while blockchain technology is being touted as a game changer, the financial sector doesn’t appear to be as enthusiastic about its potential. A report in March from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) found that only 25 percent of surveyed executives believe that the technology will impact their business models within the next two years.\n\nHowever, while banks are turning their attention to blockchain technology, Caitlin Long, chairman of the board and president of Symbiont, states in the film that banks aren’t going to rush out and do anything reckless with people’s money with the technology.\n\n“I think it’s going to take a long time for [blockchain technology] to weave its way into the system,” she said. “But, I think within 20 years the financial services will be just software, and the smart contracts technology, in particular, is going to automate a lot of things that institutions and people handle today.”\n\nHowever, while the financial services industry may have been the first sector to consider blockchain technology, it also has wider applications in other industries and is already helping to change many societies, including the unbanked population.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, there are two billion unbanked people around the world. Countries such as the U.S. also have a high percentage of unbanked people.\n\n“In the U.S., one of the wealthiest countries in the world, about 50 percent of the population doesn’t have access to basic financial services, including bank accounts,” Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said in another interview segment.\n\nThrough blockchain technology, disenfranchised people are enjoying what so many of us take for granted: money that can be sent from and received in an account.\n\nEven though the documentary provides no explanation of the technology, the conversations throughout deliver an optimistic and meaningful approach to the future of blockchain technology and how it can improve the lives of everyone.\n\n“There’s so much innovation that blockchain technology has spurred all throughout the world, and I have no doubt in my mind that this technology is going to affect everybody,” concluded Boring. “I would say in ten, twenty years’ time, there won’t be a human being whose life is not impacted by this technology.”\n\nImage (c) Manuel Stagars, ""The Blockchain and Us,"" www.blockchain-documentary.com', 'Over the past couple of years, a Bitcoin-powered mobile application developed by Seattle-based blockchain adtech and payments company CakeCodes has quietly amassed 250,000 active monthly users. The Android app BitMaker incentivizes users to engage with other mobile applications, such as freemium games, in an effort to get the user to download the app. BitMaker users are rewarded for trying out the apps and filling out forms found on traditional survey sites, with payouts made in either bitcoin or ether.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Magazine recently reached out to CakeCodes CEO Simon Yu to get more details on BitMaker’s success, how this Android app works, why they use bitcoin and how they plan to expand their operations in the future.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nThe point of BitMaker is to get users to try out other mobile applications or fill out forms for free trials of various products or services. It’s sort of a form of advertising where the viewer of the ad also gets paid in the process, which is something Brave is working on with their Bitcoin-enabled browser as well.\n\nWhen tasks are completed in BitMaker, users are rewarded with in-app tokens known as Blocks. These “Blocks” can then be converted into bitcoin or ether once a certain threshold has been met.\n\nUsers are able to view an engaging advertisement once every 30 minutes, for which they are paid roughly $0.002 worth of Blocks. One of the advertisements tested by Bitcoin Magazine was more of a quick trial of a mobile game rather than a promotional video that is simply watched.\n\nIn addition to the simpler advertisements, there are standalone tasks that involve a bit more work, such as downloading a freemium game or signing up for a free trial of Hooked on Phonics. These tasks can pay out more than a couple of dollars’ worth of Blocks each.\n\n“Traditional advertising methods include pushing unsolicited ads onto people,” said Yu. “We wanted to combat this by giving consumers the option to opt in and get paid for their time used on trying a new product. With BitMaker, end users get paid, businesses only pay upon engagement, and customer acquisition costs are dramatically decreased. Everyone wins. What we’ve done is create a simple, fun way for consumers to be rewarded for trying cool new products.”\n\n“We are able to understand what the customer needs because we’re also the audience: our team is made of app developers and gamers,” said Calvin Hsieh, who is the founder and CTO of CakeCodes. “That’s why we crafted our app based off the mechanisms behind popular role-playing games, including World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy. While playing, gamers are rewarded for completing a mission for items like digital swords or in-game gold. We made this experience tangible by tying it to the real world; when a user completes a mission on our app, they receive real money. After 700,000 installs, we are proud to state that our business model works.”\n\nPayouts Made via Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nOf course, BitMaker is not the first platform that allows people to get paid for essentially signing up for free trials of products or services. These sorts of survey sites have existed since the early days of the internet.\n\nThe key difference here is the focus on Bitcoin throughout the application. In fact, BitMaker’s logo really isn’t much different from the classic orange-and-white Bitcoin logo.\n\n“Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are more exciting to attain than a $1 gift card, which you just pick up at the store next door,” said Yu when asked why BitMaker does not use gift cards for payouts, which are a common choice on other similar platforms. “The exciting part about bitcoin is that it could triple in a month; it’s like owning a piece of stock and there’s a thrill aspect.”\n\nThe focus on the excitement around the bitcoin price in the app is real. Users will sometimes receive notifications on their phone about the price of bitcoin or ether from the app.\n\n“For people not familiar with crypto, there’s generally two ways to acquire bitcoins, which is to mine (too complicated for the average person) or risk your money buying it,” Yu continued. “But the average person who isn’t familiar oftentimes associates Bitcoin with either Silk Road or exchanges being hacked and don’t want to risk their money. BitMaker allows anyone to try earning their first bitcoin through us, risk free.”\n\nYu added that the BitMaker business model also wouldn’t work on traditional payment rails. “As we are a micro-payments business, utilizing blockchain technology enables us to pay almost no fees for sending 15,000+ payments around the world a week,” Yu said. “With PayPal or a standard medium it’d cost us a $0.30 transaction fee in addition to a percentage point on each transaction. If we did this, we wouldn’t have a business model.”\n\nAccording to the BitMaker website, the app has paid out over 215 bitcoin and 34 ether up to this point. This amounts to over $275,000 worth of payouts at current exchange rates.\n\nThere are four total payout options available on BitMaker right now: Bitcoin, Coinbase, Xapo and Ethereum. Due to increased U.S. dollar denominated transaction fees on the Bitcoin network over the past year, Coinbase, Xapo and Ethereum withdrawals can be made at lower thresholds.\n\nPassing on an ICO for Traditional Equity Crowdfunding\n\nAccording to Yu, CakeCodes has not closed the door on an ICO yet, but he also pointed out some potential drawbacks associated with that particular model.\n\n\n\n“Although ICOs seem to be the more popular way to attain startup capital for blockchain companies, we’ve seen what happened to the companies who didn’t raise enough capital from an unsuccessful ICO,” Yu said. “There’s a big risk of having our token out there and not being able to raise future rounds if we don’t succeed. Our vision is to disrupt advertising the way Airbnb disrupted hotels; we allow users to be paid for their time spent on viewing ads. We made this decision to put us in a better position for the future.”\n\nCakeCodes intends to use the money from the Wefunder campaign to increase user growth, fast track development for an iOS app and add new features to the Android app.\n\nUpdate: On April 28, a CakeCodes representative alerted us to an SEC request to remove the launch date from the Wefunder site. This article has also since removed the link to the campaign.', ""As part of my moral and intellectual duty to be as informed on as much as possible at all times, this week I found myself at a presentation discussing Bitcoin and the wonderful new world of Blockchain.\n\nPerhaps the most understandable part of the proceedings for a technophobic 50-year-old such as myself was the analogy between Blockchain in 2017 and the mobile phone in 1985.\n\nAt that time most people simply did not get the point of paying £2,000 to be able to make and answer phone calls, when there were telephone booths everywhere, and of course answering machines.\n\nBut despite the almost universal take-up of the smartphone now, for much of the 1980s and even 1990s, you could have jumped up and down until you were blue in the face regarding the merits of mobile communications, and still have met with a wall of apathy.\n\nThe same has been true over much of the 2010s so far as the merits or otherwise of using cryptocurrencies rather than fiat currencies, with scares over hacking and volatility only making matters worse.\n\nHowever, it is clear that there is a place for this concept and this technology, the only uncertainty is how widespread it is going to be when it finally comes of age.\n\nFrom an investment perspective I am reminded of my fund manager hero Hugh Hendry of Eclectica, who said it is just as bad to get too early to a party as it is to arrive too late.\n\nSimilar to the Dotcom revolution\n\nPerhaps in the case of all things Bitcoin I might have to tweak the observation of the great man in suggesting that given how we are clearly at the ground floor of this particular revolution, one would imagine that the downside in being “too early” is limited. It is to be hoped that the analogy is akin to the potential of the Dotcoms ahead of the bubble in 1999-2000.\n\nBack in today's world and the highlight in the wake of the Easter Holiday things were certainly livened up by Theresa May's decision to call a “snap” election.\n\nThis was perhaps not too much of a surprise given the way that ahead of this move the Prime Minister was 21% in the polls.\n\nMay headed for a resound victory\n\nClearly, her view was that while polls may not always be as accurate as one would like, even a gross margin of error could still allow for a 50 plus seat majority, as opposed to the 150 seats of the consensus.\n\nFrom a markets perspective though, I have to say that the reaction of FTSE 100 up / Pound down, was opposite to what might have been expected from a Hard Brexit Conservative Government from June 8.\n\nThe trend since the referendum vote has been for Sterling to fall on fears of any aggressive anti EU moves. But at least from the perspective of those who missed out on the best of the rally since last summer, the quick tumble for leading UK stocks has perhaps given them a fresh bite of the cherry. Dips towards 7,000 – if there are any, may prove to be a comfortable accumulation zone as the General Election campaign continues.""]"
04/22/2017,"['Some 70% of miners have now made a decision on whether to support segregated witnesses (segwit) or Bitcoin Unlimited, a proposal which simply increases the blocksize as set by nodes and miners. It’s not clear what the other 30% of miners are waiting for, but it will be interesting to see what they do decide once they get around to exercising their duty.\n\nIf all go for segwit, it would give the proposal some 60%. Far off from a 95% threshold usually used, but that was always unrealistic in any, even slightly, contentious setting. It’s not too far from 75%, but conceptually, if segwit does reach 60%, it would be reasonable to say after lengthy debate a decision has been made and thus should be supported regardless of views.\n\nIf all of the 30% instead support Bitcoin Unlimited, the client would gain some 70% of the hashrate. Not far from 75% and, again, regardless of views, after so much debate one has no choice, but to accept the decision of what would be an overwhelming majority.\n\nIn either case, both sides might dispute the end decision, but intellectually, they would have no standing nor any persuasive power for they would look no different than the “not my president” protestors who thought they can create their own fictitious reality.\n\nThe 51%\n\nIt’s unlikely all of the remaining 30% would decide in favor of just one proposal. If we split them in half, that would give segwit 47% while Bitcoin Unlimited would have around 53%. A very tight result, but, a potential outcome within predictable range as the matter is contentious.\n\nThe question now rises whether the 47% should accept the decision of the 53% or whether they should split? If they do split, which one is to be called bitcoin? If, instead, they decide to not solve the problem at all, in effect rejecting both proposals, due to the fear of a split and its potential ensuing chaos, then what is the wider public to think of an expensive and slow bitcoin that can’t solve its problems?\n\nRationally, the name bitcoin should go to the chain with 53% of the hashrate since bitcoin relies on the honesty of 51% of miners. If the matter is so contentious, then at least some of the 47% will probably split, which is their right. However, they need to differentiate themselves, but what if they don’t, what if they call themselves bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin Norms\n\nHere, the persuasive power of conventions and norms usually assists. Just as the “not my president” protestors, they can call themselves bitcoin, but no one should take them seriously because, objectively, bitcoin is the chain with more than 51% of miners unless such miners are objectively acting maliciously which clearly is not the case in this scalability debate where a genuine disagreement of opinion exists.\n\nThe “not my president” protestors can, of course, go to California and declare independence, but they obviously won’t be able to call California as USA. Likewise, the minority has the right to split without requiring any permission, but they can’t call themselves bitcoin. They can call themselves Bitcoin Core, or BCC; or Bitcoin Unlimited with ticker BTU, depending on which one is minority with the majority one remaining as bitcoin or BTC.\n\nNorms and conventions are not easily enforceable, but they have power because non-adherence leads to chaos. If the president, for example, does not uphold a judicial ruling, he risks revolution.\n\nLikewise, if some exchanges call a minority chain as bitcoin, then the entire currency is put into question, risking its complete downfall, not to mention the ensuing chaos.\n\nAs such, adhering to simple norms and conventions would be in the interest of everyone, including the minority chain, which can happily operate on its own network and fairly compete in the market, instead of risking its own downfall and that of bitcoin.\n\nThe 30% of miners who have not decided, therefore, should get on with it. After now two years of endless arguing, and after some 70% have decided, there is no excuse for the other miners to keep sitting on the fence.\n\nJust signal for segwit or Bitcoin Unlimited and let’s end this constant arguing, stagnation, transaction delays, increased fees, etc.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nDariusz is a Digital Anthropologist who has been closely following the world of cryptocurrencies since 2014. He has been somewhat of a crypto-evangelist, trying to educate more people on the exciting realm of cryptocurrency. During his time at University College London, his Master's dissertation focused on how communities inhabit, modify, and create virtual places via social media."", 'Can bitcoin still provide a truly cheap money-sending service?\n\nWhile the idea might be out of favor in some circles, London startup Cashaa is now using bitcoin price differentials – the same feature long used as evidence for why it wouldn\'t work as a currency – to deliver a novel payments product.\n\nFounded in 2016, the service works by connecting traditional remittance participants with two traders, each of whom are able to execute bitcoin-fiat trades in each local currency. Due to price arbitrage opportunities that exist in the global crypto markets, the traders using Cashaa are able to make a profit while filling Cashaa\'s order book.\n\nThe system works because bitcoin prices tend to be higher in markets that are receivers of remittances, and because of the availability of digital currency exchanges in a range of markets.\n\nAs explained by Kumar Gaurav, the CEO of Cashaa, there is an ongoing price differential between the UK bitcoin market and the Indian and Nigerian bitcoin markets where Cashaa currently operates.\n\n""We consistently see a 3–4% spread between UK and India, and 8–11% spread between UK and Nigeria,"" he said in interview.\n\nGaurav told CoinDesk:\n\n""We are able to split this profit between the two traders, and also keep some of the profits for Cashaa. If the spread is higher, we are able to split this with the receiver as well, which means the recipient in India or Nigeria gets more money than indicated by the market rate.""\n\nWhile limited in jurisdiction today, Gaurav believes the service can be deployed between any two markets where a bitcoin arbitrage opportunity exists.\n\nBitcoin in the background\n\nBehind the scenes, Cashaa is split into two systems.\n\nOne is the traditional remittance service. Here, the remittance user sees the market exchange rate between local fiat and receiver\'s fiat. There are no fees to send the money (Cashaa charges £1 in order to guarantee execution at a fixed exchange rate, otherwise, the rate is floating based on the market price).\n\nThe sender can pay either via cash or bank account, and the receiver can accept money either via cash or bank account.\n\n""The end consumer seeking to send money home doesn’t even need to know what bitcoin is,"" Gaurav explained.\n\nThe second system (working behind the scenes) breaks up the remittance order into two trades against bitcoin. Each of these is put into an order book that can be picked up by the traders.\n\nThe first leg is converting between sender\'s fiat into bitcoin, and the second leg is converting between bitcoin and receiver\'s fiat. Each of these traders can make a profit by filling these orders, since the bitcoin price in receiver\'s fiat is higher than the bitcoin price in sender\'s fiat.\n\nTraders must put 10% into escrow, which is forfeited if they accept an order and don’t fulfill it. This helps guard against bitcoin price volatility and order cancellation.\n\nCheaper remittances\n\nOf course, a number of companies are tackling the remittance market using bitcoin, but there are a few features that stand out with Cashaa.\n\nOne is the ability for Cashaa to process cash payments by the sender. This makes up a bulk of the low amount remittance market currently held by companies like Western Union.\n\nFurther, Cashaa is able to process the whole payment chain without the sender or receiver ever having to interact with bitcoin, which means they are able to truly use bitcoin in the background, Gaurav said.\n\nCashaa is currently working to sign up remittance agents to the service, firms that today use existing players like Western Union to transfer money.\n\nIn this model, the savers will still go to the same agent, but the agent, instead of using Western Union, would use Cashaa to save money on fees. The savings are then split between the consumer and the agent.\n\n""The agent, the receiver, and Cashaa all make a profit,"" Gaurav said, concluding:\n\n""All this happens because the agent uses Cashaa and bitcoin in the background instead of the traditional players.""\n\nHistorical globe image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Furthermore, at key junctures in the War on Terror, Bitcoin has increased precipitously, with its best-known price rises coming during heightened geopolitical conflict. For instance, Bitcoin’s first memorable price increase took place as military conflict in Libya picked up.\n\nRecent events have been no different as, despite consistent discussion about concerns over the bitcoin technology itself, the price has increased. Geopolitical tension is on the rise worldwide, and Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs.\n\nRussia stopped a Security Council statement brought forth by the U.S. on Wednesday to express disapproval of North Korea’s missile tests. China signed off on the measure.\n\n“Russia is slowing this down, and it is not clear why,” the diplomat told CBS News. “The U.S. wanted to get the message out.” North Korea’s failed missile test launch on Sunday mushroomed geopolitical tensions between President Donald Trump and Pyongyang.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that the U.S. remained committed to its allies but that it would overwhelmingly respond to any attack.\n\nThe U.S. military intercepted two Russian bombers in international airspace off Alaska’s coast earlier this week, as two F-22 Raptor aircraft intercepted the Russian TU-95 Bear bombers. Navy Commander Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, called the intercept “safe and professional.” Further, U.S. economic data did little to encourage and confidence in the Trump administration on tax cuts have waned in recent weeks.\n\nAll this should be considered bullish for Bitcoin. Two months after U.S. military action in Libya, Bitcoin begins to increase from approx 90 cents to $32. The United Nations called for “an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to the current attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute crimes against humanity … imposing a ban on all flights in the country’s airspace – a no-fly zone – and tightened sanctions on the Qadhafi regime and its supporters.”\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fell to $4 by the end of 2011, as the U.S. military withdrew from Iraq thus ending the Iraq War on December 18. By the November 2015 Paris Attacks in France, which killed 139 and injured 352, the Bitcoin price had reached the 300 handle.\n\nThere’s been little to inspire confidence in global relations and economy. Since November 2015, the bitcoin price has increased beyond $1,000 and the gold price, further inspiring confidence in its possibilities as a safehaven medium.\n\nGold and silver have long been considered safehavens by investors, who purchase such assets to protect their investment portfolio from global geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nDigital currencies like Bitcoin offer borderless and secure payments. While legacy currencies and payment system are susceptible to capital controls and currency manipulation, many believe Bitcoin is not. This leads to confidence in the digital currency as a potential safe-haven to stave off economic uncertainty.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin has made investors nervous lately. Discussions about the cryptocurrency’s imminent polarization surge across market headlines, deterring traders and hurting its value. Meanwhile, recent months show other alternative currencies reaching unprecedented heights.\n\nThe beginning of this year saw investors swarming in on cryptocurrencies, boosting their value massively in the process. More people recognize alternative digital currencies as stable, rising and secure investments. This year has pushed several altcoins to the peak of their popularity, and as the market grows more uncertain about bitcoin, others like it reap the benefits.\n\nBitcoin has mostly traded above $1,000 since mid-February.The currency proved its worth when it spiked to $1,325 on the 10th of March 2017. Today that stands as the coin’s highest value since the first block was mined. It lingered somewhere below $1000 some four weeks ago, then dipped to figures lower than $900 for a brief while towards the end of last month. Mid-April has bitcoin trading above $1,200 a piece.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here\n\nIt isn’t hard to see how volatility like this can be unappealing for bitcoin investors. Though a bit of stability now looks to be settling in, the worth of this digital asset has fluctuated massively by the week. These large swells and dips are able to wipe off and add several billion to the bitcoin market cap at a time.\n\nThe early 2017 volatility spell is not without cause. Bitcoin has got a lot of push back from global authorities. In America, the appeal for an exchange-traded fund that is backed by bitcoin was recently turned down. All the way in the east, China began tightening its regulations over exchanges of the cryptocurrency. However, it is the course the coin is on which has most investors shaken up.\n\nThere is a limit to the number of bitcoin transactions that can be conducted at any given time on the blockchain. Herein lies the coin’s scaling problem. The system is subjected to recurring slows due to the growing number of transactions that take place. Users of the coin are torn on how to approach the issue.\n\nMany are behind the move to up the size of the blockchain’s blocks. Groups like Bitcoin Unlimited rally strongly behind this solution. It would ideally allow more transaction to processed at a time. Others are not so keen. “To increase the block size would involve splitting the blockchain,” explains CNBC’s Luke Graham, “causing a fork and creating two major blockchains. This would effectively create two different coins and it’s not clear which would become dominant.”\n\nTraders abandon bitcoin for now\n\nTraders have since drew back from the cryptocurrency out of caution. They wait to see if it will in fact split and if so, which of the two products will prove stronger. It is interesting to see the uncertainty over bitcoin has done little to deter people from cryptocurrencies in general. While the world’s most popular fades, others like it soar in value. Their growing worth is fueled by market acceptance and a general need for stronger alternatives.\n\nThe market cap of other blockchain assets stand out massively now. The likes are Monero, Ethereum and DASH in particular. According to ARK Invest’s Chris Burniske, the caps of altcoins excluding bitcoin have gone up over twice their worth since bitcoin hit its recent all-time high. The market has gone from $3.5 million to far over $7 million.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has lost around $3 billion in market cap value over the same period. The combined blockchain market without the coin has gathered more than that figure.\n\n“Given these market indicators, it would appear investors are diversifying their blockchain asset holdings, positioning themselves for a generally rising tide in this emerging asset class,” Burniske writes.\n\nMonero\n\nMonero’s CryptoNote protocol requires ring signatures and secures complete anonymity. It is only district from bitcoin in a few ways. The cryptocurrency is undergoing huge gains this year so far and stands out as a promising commodity.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Monero soared to new heights and went over twice its value. The second half of March saw this coin come over $25, an all time high for this currency too. Monero’s gains are partly fueled by world economic issues. It is also gaining recognition from reputable dark web marketplaces.\n\nAlphaBay added Monero as a payment option in late 2016. The platform is a leading deep web marketplace. Oasis, another, recently did the same. More of these market places are expected to follow suit as a Monero becomes a preferred transaction tool.\n\nEthereum beats bitcoin\n\nAnother cryptocurrency to consider is Ethereum. Analyst reviews cite the currency as undervalued, pegged to do better than Bitcoin by many others. The weeks building up to April had Ethereum go up more than 300 percent. It too reached an all-time high $54. Ethereum is a dark web market favorite beside bitcoin and sees growing usage even on traditional websites. The integrity of each transaction is backed by the currency’s smart contract function. Ethreum is expected to climb considerably before the year is up.\n\nDASH\n\nDash is a very popular player as far as cryptocurrencies go. By market capitalization, this alternative currency is the third largest out there. 2017 began will investors pilling up on Dash’s transaction market. At the peak of this bullish trend, DASH stood at an all-time high of around $116.\n\nThis cryptocurrency was the second major altcoin noticed after bitcoin took off. Darknet marketplaces recognize its value and it is poised to go beyond $200 this year.\n\nDash is the cryptocurrency with the most anonymous usage. Like Monero, transactions with DASH ensure privacy with PrivateSend, a unique coin mixing services.\n\nWhy choose cryptocurrencies like bitcoin?.\n\nLooking at bitcoin alone, the currency recently reached its all-time high in March. The first quarter of 2017 had the coin surpass $1,300. Investors are losing faith in traditional investment assets due to the whiplashing effects of the world’s current economic climate. Months of economic instability persist in adding greater risks to many conventional investments. With numerous countries reforming themselves financially, Britain leaving the EU, growing issues in the Middle East, U.S. elections and more, 2016 proved to be a year filled with economic and currency uncertainties. The need for stable, promising and appreciating assets quickly came into focus moving into 2017.', ""About The Author\n\nDariusz is a Digital Anthropologist who has been closely following the world of cryptocurrencies since 2014.

As well, the digital currency will soon be featured in the ‘My Money’ episode of ‘Dark Net’.\n\nLast week, in the first season finale of The Good Fight, an American legal and political drama, Bitcoin took center stage. The episode, called ‘Chaos’, could be an important part of the show’s next season after the series was renewed for a second in March.\n\nTechnology lawyer and Bitcoin creator ‘Dylan Stack’, played by Jason Biggs, asks show star Diane to represent him. He is the creator of Bitcoin. He tells her he believes he is being framed for an upcoming cyber attack against Chicago’s power grid. Stack has appeared as the bitcoin on The Good Wife, from which The Good Fight spun off.\n\nThe law firm Reddick, Boseman, & Kolstad, known for its police brutality cases, represents Stack. Eventually, however, the malware infects the government’s computers and blocks access to the power grid. The Feds suspect the law firm had a role.\n\nStack doesn’t come forward to authorities. He works instead to uncover who planted the malware on his computer, suspecting it was someone he chats with on 4chan (since the creator of Bitcoin chats on 4chan). Stack – the founder of Bitcoin – is ultimately arrested by the FBI. The blackout hits at the same time.\n\nThe episode, called ‘Chaos’ is set amid bi-annual reviews at law firm Reddick, Boseman and Kolstad. Lucca receives good reviews.\n\nThe Good Wife featured a Bitcoin episode, as well. In Season 3 Episode 13, “Bitcoin for Dummies”, the show dedicated awhile to explaining the digital currency technology based on the blockchain. The Good Fight doesn’t take this path, focusing in on the action instead. In The Good Wife episode, bitcoin featured three inventors. In that episode, Biggs’ character assures he is Bitcoin’s representative.\n\nBitcoin recently appeared will appear in an upcoming episode of ‘Dark Net’. The episode, which will be named ‘My Money’, could have gone in several different directions, as that show’s producers discussed the possibility of showcasing Venezuela Bitcoin miners.\n\n“We originally wanted to interview bitcoin miners in Venezuela who are really risking a lot to mine for bitcoin because money there is so worthless and bitcoin still retains value. So it was a really, really interesting story of survival that you wouldn’t think of because bitcoin is typically associated with the darknet and illicit activities, and this was a completely different take on it,” Adi Kochavi, president of Vocativ Films and executive producer for Dark Net, said. “I’m definitely holding onto this idea.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'One of the big debates happening in the Bitcoin community is over the specification of block sizes, which limits the maximum number of transactions that may be processed per second.\n\nLuno, a Bitcoin exchange and wallet provider, recently explained that transacting in Bitcoin has become painfully slow. It is also much more expensive than it was a few years ago.\n\nA theoretical maximum speed for Bitcoin that has been circulating online is seven transactions per second. However, in reality the Bitcoin network is achieving maximums of 3 to 4 transactions per second.\n\nThis seems low, and raises the question: How does Bitcoin’s maximum transaction capacity compare to the likes of Visa, PayPal, and cryptocurrency Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin – 3 to 4 transactions per second\n\nA few solutions have been proposed for the Bitcoin block size issue.\n\nOne is Bitcoin Unlimited, which proposes removing the block size limit. Another is Segregated Witness, which proposes doubling the block size.\n\nThere is no consensus in the Bitcoin community on which direction to take as yet, with support for Bitcoin Unlimited at around 36% and support for SegWit at around 27%.\n\nSupport is measured as a percentage of the total Bitcoin mined over a specific period, with several miners not indicating explicit support for either of the two proposals.\n\nEthereum – 20 transactions per second\n\nTowards the end of 2016, ETHNews reported that Ethereum had an estimated speed limit of around 20 transactions per second.\n\nA system called Raiden is in development that will use Ethereum smart contracts to increase the maximum speed to as high as one million transactions per second.\n\nThe first version of Raiden was due out by the end of March, but there have been no new updates from the team since February.\n\nPayPal – 193 transactions per second average\n\nPayPal handled 6.1 billion transactions in 2016. This works out to 193 transactions per second on average.\n\nIn 2015, PayPal said it processed 450 payments per second on Cyber Monday.\n\nVisa – 1,667 transaction per second\n\nVisa told MyBroadband in 2016 that VisaNet processes an average of 150 million transaction each day, or around 1,667 transaction per second on average.\n\n“Based on rigorous testing, we estimate that VisaNet is capable of processing more than 56,000 transaction messages per second,” said Visa.\n\nMeaningful comparisons\n\nLuno warned that comparisons of transaction speeds are tricky, as there are significant differences between cryptocurrencies and credit card payments.\n\n“Bitcoin uses a push method of paying, similar to making an EFT with your bank,” said Luno’s Werner van Rooyen.\n\nCredit cards use a “pull” method – your private details are shared with the recipient and they request the funds from your account.\n\nThe system architectures are also different.\n\nBitcoin payments happen peer-to-peer and transaction authentication is decentralised.\n\nCredit card payments are centralised – if the issuing bank, receiving bank, or any other intermediaries have a point of failure, the transaction fails.\n\n“I think it’s difficult to compare centralised entities, such as Google or Visa, with decentralised ones, such as the Internet or Bitcoin,” said van Rooyen.\n\n“Something else to highlight is that Bitcoin is not only a means of payment, but also a storage of wealth – an asset class of its own.”\n\nNow read: The powerful Bitcoin mining rigs you can buy in South Africa', 'Money is a mystery.\n\nSome claim money is an invention by man. But has man really ever invented anything original, something that did not exist before in nature? Technology at its most fundamental level is an imitation of nature.\n\nThe more we learn about nature, the more we are struck by the dazzling complexity hidden beneath the silhouette of the macrocosm. We look at a cell and we find a factory. We look at DNA and we find a database. We investigate the metabolism and we find an economy. We investigate the brain and we discover a computer.\n\nLike zooming into a fractal, every scientific discovery reveals another world that strangely mirrors our own. Money, as Dostoevsky famously said, is coined freedom. But money is also slavery.\n\nThe future of humanity is inextricably linked to the future of money. To understand money we need to first understand biology.\n\nMachine learning trained on biology\n\nLet’s illustrate the nexus of monetary and biological realities by looking at Numer.ai, a hedge fund founded by mathematician Richard Craib that crowdsources machine learning algorithms for stock market prediction. Every week, Numer.ai releases an encrypted dataset that obscures the origin of the data but preserves the relevant structure.\n\nThe data scientists participating in Numer.ai then enter into a tournament to find out whose algorithms will make the most accurate predictions extrapolated from the dataset. The programmers behind the victorious algorithms are rewarded with Bitcoin.\n\nFrom the most accurate prediction algorithms, a meta-model is constructed that is designed to cover the totality of the stock market. Selected algorithms will be deployed in those niches of the stock market where they have proven to be spot-on. Taken together, the meta-model amounts to a super-intelligence for anticipating stock market trends.\n\nGuess who has spawned the most successful algorithms. The Financial Times reports:\n\n""The current leader on Numerai’s tournament board is a user called “NCVSAI”, who works in genomics and biostatistics, according to Mr. Craib. He has earned $5,563 since starting to submit predictions earlier this year, but as the hedge fund grows Numerai intends to ramp up the rewards.""\n\nThe winner is: Someone whose pattern recognition skills have been honed by doing computational biology! It seems those algorithms that were pioneered in modeling living systems are best suited for financial predictions. This, in turn, means that the financial system is itself alive.\n\nOrganic money\n\nRecently, Numer.ai has issued a cryptocurrency of its own called Numeraire in order to fine-tune the competition-based crowdsourcing mechanism underlying their investment strategy into a more cooperative enterprise. The Numeraire, issued exclusively to those data scientists already registered with Numer.ai, will increase in value corresponding to the overall success of the hedge fund.\n\nBy influencing the behavior of its holders, the Numeraire is intended to act as “programmable money.” Money, in this sense, has an innate potential to incentivize collectives of human beings. Conventional fiat currency has turned out to be terribly ill-suited as the underlying behavioral program for humanity.\n\nDigital cryptocurrency, paradoxically, is far more organic. Literally.\n\nWhile fiat has turned the economy into an undead debt zombie, cryptocurrency is here to resuscitate it. This life-giving property of cryptocurrency stems from its kinship with the energy currency of the biological cell – ATP.\n\nInside bacteria and the cells of higher organisms, there is a relentless rush of activity and transformative processes. Despite, many of the biochemical details of how organisms produce and consume energy still being the subject of debate among scientists, major components of the cellular metabolism have been identified.\n\nAstonishingly, the frantic happenings inside a cell can be likened to the way an economy works – in more than just a figurative sense. Economists constantly argue about how certain economic phenomena and indicators may be interpreted and what may be done in order to induce a desirable macroeconomic development such as an increase in GDP or a higher employment rate.\n\nBut few economists will argue that money – in its capacity as a universally accepted medium of exchange – is the attractor that holds everything together. In school, we learn that economy is about the allocation of scarce resources.\n\nPhilosopher, economist and systems theorist Kenneth Boulding suggested another definition. For him, the economy is the study of exchange.\n\nFramed this way, the events inside a biological cell become the subject of economic analysis. Biochemical reactions become transactions and the metabolism becomes a transaction network. It has been suggested that a transaction network has three main components: a currency, a settlement layer with a degree of finality and a ledger to record transfers of ownership. Let’s see whether we find these things in biological systems.\n\nGoing digital means going back to nature\n\nATP is the universal “energy currency” of the cell. Let’s have a look at how ATP is synthesized in a cell in a very simplified way. First, we take up nutrition that is made up of molecules that contain energy stored in their chemical bonds, e.g. carbohydrates or proteins. The food is digested and broken up into smaller parts via a very complex cascade of biochemical reactions.\n\nAll of this occurs inside specialized compartments of our cells, the mitochondria. During this process, energy is released that is used to “coin” the cell’s energy currency, ATP molecules. The ingenious solution found by nature enables this currency to be used to pay for virtually every biochemical reaction, by catalyzing or speeding up the production of desired cellular parts, ranging from new DNA strands to structural proteins that provide the scaffolding for our cells. Like capital, ATP accumulates where it is needed.\n\nWithout delving into the details of enzyme kinetics, it suffices for our purpose to assume that at the cellular level a settlement layer is provided in the form of specialized enzymes that are able to catalyze only one specific reaction.\n\nIf you pay ATP to a given enzyme for building up a certain molecule, you have to pay another enzyme for degrading this molecule once you don’t need it anymore as well. Building an atomic submarine costs a lot of cash, but decommissioning it isn’t cheap either. In both cases, workers with specialized skills need to be paid or they go on strike.\n\nAll of the cellular transactions paid for by gigantic amounts of ATP (between 50 – 75 kg per day, you roughly produce as much ATP as your own body weight) are recorded in the so-called epigenome.\n\nThe epigenome is a vast decentralized network that consists of real-time gene regulatory and metabolic information. Ignoring the molecular details of this system, it is still safe to say that the epigenome can store orders of magnitude more information than your DNA.\n\nIt tracks and keeps the balance of your ATP account so that you produce just the right amount and spend at just the right places to keep your system carrying on in everyday life. Of course, the balance of an Olympic athlete is different from that of an office worker. But, ideally, it keeps both of them able to carry out their job.\n\nSo there you have it: Your body is a transaction network. Vice versa, the economy is alive. With the arrival of Bitcoin and Blockchain, we finally have a cure for the ailments of a techno-biological ecosystem chronically out of balance.\n\nAs pointed out by Nick Ayton, the concept of debt is alien to cryptocurrency. Just like most ATP-catalyzed reactions, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.\n\nCryptocurrency, as programmable money, will bring about within society the same collaborative behavior already exhibited by the sub-units of a complex biological system.\n\nWithin the fractal-like structure of our reality, fixing the economy goes hand in hand with deepening our understanding of what it means to be human. “Crypto” means hidden. In truth, it’s a revelation.\n\nClaudio Flores, M. Sc., and Danilo Flores are the founders of Kybernesia, a lab for thought experiments and biomimetics based in Hamburg, Germany.

04/23/2017,"[""Bitcoin price is nearing its all-time high price, prior to the official decision of the US Securities Exchange Commission to decline the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN set at $1,277.\n\nOn Saturday, the global Bitcoin exchange market opened at $1,257, maintaining Friday’s momentum. On April 21, Bitcoin price briefly surpassed the $1,270 mark, positioning itself to surpass its all-time high price. At today’s peak, Bitcoin price increased up to $1,259 but stumbled, moving back down to $1,220. The market closed at $1,243, with a slight 1.23 percent decrease over the past 24 hours.\n\nStill, Bitcoin price increased by over four percent on average in the past week, from around $1,180 to $1,243. Considering the optimistic trading activity of the Japanese exchange market and increasing interest in Bitcoin in the Indian market, Bitcoin price is expected to carry its momentum throughout next week.\n\nJapan’s factor\n\nThe Japanese Bitcoin exchange market. which holds almost 50 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market share with a $121.5 mln daily trading volume, is demonstrating a high level of trading activity, with an increase in Bitcoin price and trading volume.\n\nAs shown in the price chart provided by digital currency market data company Brave New Coin below, the daily trading volume of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market has increased consistently over the past week, distancing itself from the US Bitcoin exchange market in terms of trading volume and market dominance.\n\nThere exist two main reasons why the interest in Bitcoin is increasing at a rapid rate in Japan, as shown in the trading volume and price chart above. First, as noted by financial analyst and Welt Senior Editor Holger Zschaepitz, Japan’s 10-year yields dropped back to zero percent for the first time since 2007.\n\nYield\n\nIn conventional finance, the yield represents the income return on an investment that is normally expressed as an annual percentage rate. Japan’s zero percent yield shows a severe economic instability and as Zschaepitz explained, the Bank of Japan is attempting to print massive amounts of the Japanese yen in order to increase the inflation rate and keep the economy afloat.\n\nIf the inflation rate in Japan rises, like China, investors usually move to alternative safe haven assets and wealth management products (WMPs) such as gold and Bitcoin. In terms of liquidity and mid-term profitability, Bitcoin appeals to a larger market and thus, in times of financial instability and economic uncertainty, the demand for Bitcoin increases.\n\nOops! #Japan's 10y yields drop back to 0%, could turn negative every minute as BoJ keeps printing money like crazy. pic.twitter.com/9sADIfv31R — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) April 17, 2017\n\nMainstream media\n\nMoreover, the Japanese mainstream media have been offering extensive coverage on Bitcoin, particularly due to the acceptance of Bitcoin by Bic Camera and the legalization of Bitcoin by the Japanese government."", 'Florida lawmakers want virtual currencies like bitcoin covered under the state’s money-laundering statute, a change that supporters claim would ensure criminals cannot use Internet-based currencies to conceal financial activities, according to The Miami Herald. Law enforcement officials support the measure but some bitcoin enthusiasts say it will undermine bitcoin.\n\nThe proposed law was crafted by Miami-Dade cybercrime prosecutors after a judge threw out charges against a man accused of selling $1,500 in bitcoins to buy stolen credit card numbers on the Internet.\n\nMiami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said high-tech criminals use virtual currencies to hide their illegal activities. The proposed law ensures fraudsters and traffickers cannot use Internet-based currencies to conceal and transfer illegal profits.\n\nBitcoin Supporters Weigh In\n\nSome bitcoin supporters claim the law can undermine the cryptocurrency that could be helpful in promoting trade between Florida and nations like Venezuela that rely more on bitcoin since their own banking systems have crumbled.\n\nCharles Evans, an economist at Barry University specializing in bitcoin, said the law sends the message that financial innovation is unwelcome in Florida. Governments in other countries and states that welcome bitcoin will be pleased with Florida’s law from a competitive standpoint.\n\nA state house committee passed the bill, sponsored by Miami Rep. Jose Felix Diaz, unanimously last week. Two state senate subcommittees have also passed the bill, and a state senate appropriations committee will soon vote on it.\n\nMoney laundering applies to transactions that conceal funds earned from criminal activity under existing Florida law. Under the proposed law, “virtual currency” will be added to the list of “monetary instruments” covered under the state money laundering act. The law would define bitcoin as a “medium of exchange in electronic or digital format that is not a coin or currency of the United States or any other country.”\n\nProsecutors will still have to prove intent under the law, according to Andrew Hinkes, a South Florida lawyer. Prosecutors would have to show that the accused changed money for bitcoin or vice versa to conceal funds or further a future illegal transaction.\n\nHinkes said he did not believe the law would impact daily bitcoin users or investors. He said it could impact those exchanging bitcoin for dollars. The path to prosecution of traders for money laundering is currently clearer in Florida.\n\nMoney Laundering Case Raised Issue\n\nPolice presented a case against a website designer, Michel Espinoza, for illegally transmitting and laundering $1,500 worth of bitcoins. Undercover agents bought bitcoin from Espinoza on a bitcoin exchange, LocalBitcoins.com and told him they wanted to use the funds to buy stolen credit card numbers.\n\nPolice arrested Espinoza and another man, Pascal Reid, who pleaded guilty to acting as an unlicensed money broker. Reid agreed to teach law enforcement about bitcoin under a plea agreement.\n\nDefense lawyers argued, however, that bitcoin is not money under Florida law. They told a judge in May 2016 that no bank or central government backs bitcoin and that regulation of bitcoin varies from state to state and country to country, and that the IRS views bitcoin deals as a form of bartering.\n\nThe judge threw out the charges against Espinoza. Prosecutors are appealing the ruling.\n\nAlso read: Economist argues bitcoin isn’t real money in Miami money laundering case\n\nCriminals And Others Use Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has been used by drug dealers.

Shortly after its creation in 2009, one could buy the virtual currency for less than a penny per bitcoin. Now, a bitcoin is worth about $1,250, and many believe that the upward trend for bitcoin could continue indefinitely. Despite there being plenty of skepticism about the inherent value of bitcoin, the currency has survived dramatic volatility without losing favor among its core users.\n\nThe history of bitcoin's value\n\nDuring the first couple of years of its existence, bitcoin saw dramatic gains in price. From its penny valuation in 2009, bitcoin rose to $0.10 by 2010 and first hit the $1 mark in early 2011. That ignited a huge wave of new demand for bitcoin, sending the currency up to more than $10 by mid-2011.\n\nYet at that point, bitcoin showed its propensity for big ups and downs. Within just a few months, bitcoin prices dropped 80%, punishing those who had gotten in at the top and were looking for quick gains. Still, those who stuck with bitcoin earned back their losses, with the currency reaching the $10 mark again in late 2012.\n\nFrom there, the next wave of interest in bitcoin took the currency to the $100 mark and beyond, climbing to nearly $200 by early 2013. The bankruptcy of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange briefly took a big toll on prices, cutting bitcoin's value in half, but before the year was out, the digital currency climbed above $1,000 as market participants increasingly believed that bitcoin would achieve global currency status and prove to be a better alternative to traditional government-issued currency. The frequency of financial crises across the globe during the first several years of bitcoin's history certainly helped feed that theory and added to bitcoin's appeal.\n\nSince then, bitcoin has remained volatile, but not to the same extent as it was earlier in its existence. Prices sank to around $200 in 2015, but the currency picked up steam again more recently. This year, bitcoin regained the $1,000 level and has climbed as high as nearly $1,300.\n\nThe true measure of bitcoin's worth\n\nOne concern that some have expressed about bitcoin is that the currency has no intrinsic value. Gold coins, by contrast, represent a given weight of an actual commodity with practical applications, and gold investors take comfort in the fact that their bullion is worth something beyond monetary terms. That's not true of bitcoin, which one receives as a reward for solving complex mathematical problems.\n\nYet bitcoin advocates note that the same is true of paper currency. It used to be that Federal Reserve notes were tied to the value of gold or silver, but those days are long gone. Just as a dollar bill only has whatever value a buyer and seller assign to it, so too does bitcoin have practical value to the extent that those who make exchanges of the digital currency agree on what it's worth.\n\nOne reason why bitcoin has become more valuable likely has to do with the fact that one can use it more widely now than early in its history. Many major technology and retail companies accept bitcoin in the same way they would older currencies, and small businesses have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon as well. Moreover, with relatively low transaction fees for transfers, bitcoin has become a popular way to move money while avoiding the costly charges that banks and other financial institutions often impose.\n\nKeep an eye on bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has seen dramatic price increases recently, but the one thing investors in the currency can be certain of is that volatility in both directions will continue. With some calling for continued exponential growth in the value of bitcoin while others believe it's a bubble waiting to burst, the market for bitcoin is sure to be exciting for the foreseeable future."", 'Key Points Bitcoin price is currently trading higher and well above the $1300 handle against the US Dollar. There is a monster ascending channel with support at $1280 formed on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD. The price is testing the channel resistance area at $1350, and may correct lower in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price remains in a monster bullish trend against the US Dollar, and BTC/USD is now well supported near the $1280 and $1300 levels.\n\nBitcoin Price Upside Surge\n\nThere were a couple of dips in Bitcoin price towards $1260 and $1280 against the US Dollar. However, the price remained supported on the downside near $1250. Every time there was a decline, the price bounced back and moved above $1300. At the moment, the price is trading well above the $1300 level, and looking to extend gains. There was a break above the 1.236 extension of the last decline from the $1319 high to $1295 low. It has opened the gates for another swing wave in the near term.\n\nThe price is following a monster ascending channel with support at $1280 formed on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. The same channel provided support on the dips near $1250-40. At the moment, the price is trading near the channel resistance area at $1350. It is acting as a hurdle, and may ignite a minor downside move towards $1320. The stated level also coincides with the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1221 low to $1350 high.\n\nSo, if the price declines in the near term, it is likely to find support at $1320. However, the most important support is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1221 low to $1350 high at $1285.\n\nLooking at', 'The Bitcoin Core project, launched by Satoshi Nakamoto eight years ago and today led by Wladimir van der Laan, aims to release a new major release of the software about once every six months. Such a release (0.12.0, 0.13.0, 0.14.0…) includes most of the improvements made since the last major release.\n\n\n\nIn between major releases, the Bitcoin Core project often offers minor releases (0.12.1, 0.13.1, 0.13.2…). These either include soft fork upgrades, which are included in minor releases to make opting out as easy as possible. Or they include bug fixes and other modest improvements.\n\nThis weekend marks the official release of a new minor release: Bitcoin Core 0.14.1.\n\nHere’s what the newest iteration of the first most-used Bitcoin implementation has to offer.\n\nSegWit Signaling\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy change in the new release affects miners, and in particular concerns Segregated Witness (SegWit), the protocol upgrade at the heart of Bitcoin Core’s scaling roadmap.\n\nSegregated Witness is a soft fork, which means that non-upgraded nodes will remain part of the same network as upgraded nodes. This is technically also true for miners; they can continue to mine blocks without including any SegWit transactions if they so choose. (Though, if they do not upgrade at all, they may want to take some precautions to avoid mining on top of invalid blocks.)\n\nBitcoin Core 0.14.1 now also offers miners the option to exclude any Segregated Witness transactions even if the soft fork activates. They can continue to mine blocks that only include “old style” transactions if they prefer.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 miners that prefer to exclude SegWit transactions will, by default, still signal support for the upgrade regardless. After all, SegWit activation shouldn’t really be a problem for them: With Bitcoin Core 0.14.1, they are technically ready to avoid invalid blocks, and they can themselves create blocks without SegWit transactions all the same.\n\nMemory Accounting\n\nFor normal, non-mining users, the biggest change in Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 is probably an improvement in memory use.\n\nBitcoin nodes keep a buffer of recent changes to the state of the blockchain (the “UTXO-set”) in memory. Recent changes are most likely to change again, and keeping this in memory lets nodes access it as fast as possible. This way, nodes can accept and validate transactions and blocks rapidly, and forward them accordingly, thereby benefiting the whole network. Once in a while, the current state of the UTXO-set is “flushed”: This is when the data is stored on disc more permanently.\n\nBitcoin Core 0.14.0 showed some problems estimating how much headroom is needed in memory to perform this flush. This could have detrimental effects on low-end systems in particular, like some Raspberry Pi’s, and other computers with limited memory. In Bitcoin Core 0.14.1, memory usage for the UTXO-set is calculated more accurately, which should help well-configured machines run more smoothly.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 includes a number of smaller bug fixes and optimisations.\n\nThe next major release, Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, is expected around autumn of this year.\n\nFor more information, see the Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 release notes. You can download Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 from bitcoin.org and bitcoincore.org.', ""Cointelegraph spoke to Valery Vavilov, BitFury CEO, about mining, government Blockchain implementation, the first SegWit block mined and future plans of his company.\n\nBitfury is one of the leading Blockchain technology companies and one of the largest private infrastructure providers in the Blockchain ecosystem. It develops software and hardware solutions for businesses, governments, organizations and individuals to move assets across the Blockchain. The company believes the Blockchain can open new doors for global economic opportunity and prosperity and advance the peer-to-peer economy and the Economy of Things.\n\nCointelegraph: Which criteria do you use when you choose which currencies you are mining?\n\nValery Vavilov: Our foremost focus is on security which Blockchain and cryptocurrency is the most secure, reliable and efficient. At the moment, we think Bitcoin is the most secure, reliable and efficient cryptocurrency with enormous potential to transform our world for the better.\n\nCT: Don't you think it is too late to begin mining business for all the individuals and businesses now? If not, which steps shall people take to begin?\n\nVV: It is not too late for an individual, business or even country to begin mining. The industry is still growing as more and more people use Bitcoin. And the future looks as promising as the present, as miners will move away from block rewards and into transaction fees, which will encourage even more to begin Bitcoin mining. We offer our cutting edge 16-nanometer chip and our enterprise-grade BlockBox, which allows you to almost immediately plug into the Bitcoin Blockchain and begin mining.\n\nCT: What is ROI in mining?\n\nVV: We do not disclose our financial figures but one of the best return on investment benefits from mining the Bitcoin Blockchain is knowing you are helping secure a new technology that is being increasingly used for more than just currency.\n\nCT: Where do you recommend to place (geo-wise) farms for mining? Where do you place yours?\n\nVV: Our mining data centers are located in the Republic of Georgia and Iceland.\n\nCT: Bitfury has recently signed a deal with the Ukrainian government. Whose idea was that? How do you see the future of Ukraine with Blockchain introduction?\n\nVV: Our discussions with Ukraine started in late 2016. Given the success we have found with land titling and now broader e-governance in our partnership with the Republic of Georgia, we are happy to expand to another government serving more than 45 mln people. Our goal is to bring the entire country’s e-governance system to Blockchain, including existing e-services and government services that still need to be digitized.\n\nThe project will begin by introducing Blockchain into Ukraine’s existing e-governance platform. By e-governance, we mean government services provided online – which can benefit significantly from the security and efficiency of Blockchain technology. Ukraine already has online “e-services” for many government agencies like business registrations, public procurement, construction licensing and more. The goal of our project is to bring Blockchain to the existing e-government services (like those I mentioned) and bring other services online using Blockchain to improve government efficiency and transparency.\n\nCT: Tell us more about your partnership with the Republic of Georgia.\n\nVV: The Bitfury Group and the National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) successfully implemented a custom-designed Blockchain system that is now integrated into the digital records system of NAPR. This private, permissioned Blockchain is anchored to the Bitcoin Blockchain through a distributed digital timestamping service. Distributed digital timestamping allows NAPR to verify and sign a document containing a citizen’s essential information and proof of ownership of property.\n\nThis important timestamping service also allows citizens to ensure their documents are legitimate without exposing confidential information. This is possible by providing citizens with unique documentation known as a “hash.” This document hash is published to the Bitcoin Blockchain and can be verified whenever a request is made, benefiting from the Bitcoin Blockchain’s unmatched security.\n\nThis groundbreaking project is expected to continue to include smart-contract capabilities to streamline business operations for NAPR, including the sale of property, transfer of ownership and more.\n\nCT: What are the benefits to implementing Blockchain in government registration and transactions?\n\nVV: Blockchain technology first provides an unmatched level of security. A property registry built on the Blockchain can secure billions of dollars in assets and make a significant social and economic impact globally by addressing the rapidly growing demand for transparency and accountability. A Blockchain-based registry also allows governments and individuals the ability to audit quickly. Finally, a Blockchain-based registry allows for substantial reductions in the cost and time required to register and transfer property.\n\nCT: Are government organizations your major clients? Do you also cooperate with investment/trading related companies, such as FX brokers and investment banks?\n\nVV: Our company focuses on advancing any industry, sector, institution or government through the use of Blockchain technology. From EY to the Republic of Georgia, to the government of Ukraine, we are building all different kinds of partnerships around the globe as our industry rapidly evolves.\n\nCT: In March Bitfury mined its first SegWit block with Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 148. Why did you decide to go with SegWit?\n\nVV: Bitfury extensively researches and tests Blockchain/Bitcoin software, and has issued white papers on many topics including block size, incentive mechanisms, Proof of Work and Proof of Stake consensus and the Lightning Network.\n\nSince 2014, the position of the Bitfury Group Bitcoin Blockchain remains the same regarding the block size – we believe the network should increase the block size gradually over time. This is why Bitfury currently supports Segregated Witness, hereinafter SegWit, which is a well-tested and efficient solution.\n\nThe main goal of all block-size discussions is how to increase Bitcoin’s scalability and increase the amount of transactions that can be processed on the Blockchain. SegWit is one such solution. It provides better on-chain scalability, increases the effective capacity of the block and will allow the network to process more transactions. It also fixes some minor code issues and will make Bitcoin extensions like Lightning Network for instant payments and MAST for smart contracts on Bitcoin possible.\n\nSegWit has been fully tested and supported by companies and it is ready and can be activated any moment. Other block size solutions would require at least six to nine months to be designed, fully tested and adopted by businesses.\n\nCT: Does Bitfury have any recent investment news to share?\n\nVV: We recently announced a joint venture with Credit China, which included a $30 mln investment in Bitfury.\n\nCT: What are the plans Bitfury has for the upcoming future? Any exciting projects?\n\nVV: Besides our partnership with the government of Ukraine, we are excited to continue our partnership with the Blockchain Trust Accelerator to source and support Blockchain pilot projects for global good. The accelerator just announced its latest pilot with TechSoup at the US tech conference SxSW.\n\nWe also launched the Global Blockchain Business Council in January 2017, and so far, this year we have launched chapters in Washington D.C. and China, with more to come this year.\n\nFinally, in July 2017, we will be hosting our Annual Blockchain Summit on Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island.

Although this long-awaited release won\'t include dramatic changes such as proof-of-stake or sharding, this stage does incorporate roughly 10 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\n\nAll these EIPs look to pave the way for \'abstraction\' by reducing the amount of features that are hard-coded into ethereum. The aim, much like the aim of ethereum itself, is to leave more room for app developers to make their own design decisions.\n\nEIP 86, for example, allows users or app developers to secure accounts whatever way they wish.\n\nAn Ethcore spokesperson told CoinDesk that Parity, a popular ethereum client written in Rust, has implemented seven of the 10 EIPs, but is awaiting clearer instructions as developers come to consensus on the changes that need to be implemented.\n\nThis \'rough consensus\' approach is common in open-source development.\n\nThe wait shouldn\'t be long for Parity or Geth as these projects are nearing completion. Others, though, written in different programming languages, including python and C++ are further behind.\n\nComplex process\n\nOne tricky part is making changes to all ethereum clients, no matter what programming language they\'re written in, in lockstep.\n\nEthereum Foundation\'s Khokhlov has been writing tests using a tool called Hive to ensure not only that the clients implement the changes correctly, but that all clients agree on consensus-level changes. That\'s because if all clients don’t follow the same rules, there could be an accidental split into different networks (as happened briefly in November).\n\nJust like former phase changes Frontier and Homestead, the shift to Metropolis requires a \'hard fork\' – meaning nodes or miners that fail to upgrade to the new blockchain will be left behind. Because of the possibility of an inadvertent split, hard forks are controversial and taken very seriously.\n\nBut, since this change has long been on the ethereum\'s technical roadmap, the conventional wisdom is that it\'s unlikely to lead to a split.\n\nEven so, the changes require extra care, leading Khokhlov to say:\n\n“I have a headache from hard fork transition rules.”\n\nFor Khokhlov, there are a lot of \'ifs\' in ensuring every corner case is considered to make sure users\' ether is safe in every situation.\n\nFor example, he\'s had to make sure that transactions on the new fork only work if the \'gas limit\' and transaction signatures are correct, and that opcode behavior, which has changed from fork to fork, does not disturb operations either.\n\n""The more changes we have, the more checks are added to the code and the more logic to check. That does not make it a clean code,” he said.\n\nBenefits await\n\nBut when all\'s said and done, the Metropolis update will likely allow better ethereum applications to be created.\n\nStefan George, CTO of ethereum prediction market Gnosis, told CoinDesk:\n\n”Having more abstraction always allows for more flexibility.”\n\nFor example, the added flexibility could allow a recipient or middleman to pay transaction fees rather than app users, he said.\n\nThis could be beneficial for users utilizing ethereum-based based apps, such as a notebook. Normally, the user would need to buy ether to make any change, such as adding to or deleting a note, but with the Metropolis upgrades, the provider can pay the fee and users can make changes without the extra step of buying ether.\n\nUltimately, this moves the ethereum protocol closer to the familiar experience of a traditional app store.\n\n“I imagine we will get a lot more users using ethereum services this way,” George said.\n\nGeorge added that another Metropolis change will also help iron out some kinks for off-chain technologies that allow data to be lifted off the main ethereum blockchain, improving performance and scalability of the network without compromising users\' security.\n\nThis adaptability will, again, put developers in control of their application designs.\n\nAs the Parity team put it:\n\n""Metropolis is a significant step that improves the protocol and makes a few use cases that were previously unfeasible.""\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated a fact about ethereum\'s Geth implementation.

04/24/2017,"[""Holger Zschaepitz, the senior editor of the financial desk and market maniac at Welt, shared a chart which demonstrated Japan’s struggling economy and its poorly performing 10-year yields.\n\nOops! #Japan's 10y yields drop back to 0%, could turn negative every minute as BoJ keeps printing money like crazy. pic.twitter.com/9sADIfv31R — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) April 17, 2017\n\nAs seen in the chart above, for the first time since 2007, Japan’s 10-year yields declined back to zero percent. Zschaepitz noted that the yields could drop to a negative percentage rate at any time in the near future, as the Japanese government continues to print massive amounts of cash.\n\nIn conventional finance, a yield is referred to as the income return on an investment usually expressed as an annual percentage rate. Therefore, Japan’s zero percent yield demonstrates a zero percent profit margin or return for its investors.\n\nSeeking alternatives\n\nAs the Japanese government continues to print large amounts of money, the inflation rate of the Japanese yen will likely increase proportionally and the value of the Japanese yen will likely fall in the mid-term. Analysts expect that such performance of Bitcoin’s largest exchange market could potentially affect the Bitcoin price.\n\nAn increase in Bitcoin price is usually correlated with economic instability and financial uncertainty of a large Bitcoin market. For instance, when the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market was believed to be the largest Bitcoin market in terms of trading volume, the devaluation of the Chinese yuan caused by rising US inflation rates led to a sudden surge in Bitcoin price.\n\nIn other words, as the Chinese yuan weakened, traders and investors in the region sought out for alternative wealth management products (WMPs) and safe haven assets such as Bitcoin.\n\n41 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange affected\n\nAccording to various Bitcoin market data providers including Brave New Coin, the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market currently holds over 41 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market share, followed closely by the US at 30.6 percent.\n\nThus, the economic instability of Japan and the weakening of the Japanese yen have a significant impact on the demand for Bitcoin in the local market.\n\nIn the past week, the daily trading volume of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market increased substantially and as a result, Bitcoin price surged from around $1,175 to $1,257. Bitcoin price in the Japanese exchange market also demonstrated a 1.47 percent increase in the past 24 hours, showing a consistent increase in demand for Bitcoin."", 'Can Bitcoin help people break out of poverty? What if we could build a financial system with Bitcoin that would lead to a more equitable and fairer society?\n\nBitcoin has been around for nearly a decade now and it has survived many doomsday predictions regarding its demise. It has grown to become an accepted medium of transferring money, it has also been recognized as a currency in some countries like Japan.\n\nWhy is the existing system broken?\n\nThe present financial system is supported by large-scale financial institutions that provide financial services. This means banks, insurance companies, credit card companies, housing finance companies, money transfer companies etc.\n\nThe problem is that while these businesses have existed for a long time, accessibility has always been an issue. According to the world bank, two bln people still do not have access to a bank account. Yet this present financial institution based payment system is stuck in an archaic era.\n\nPeople are expected to use cash by withdrawing it from a bank account, they are supposed to deposit money physically at a bank teller or a machine and there are costs attached to just using and maintaining the system.\n\nDigital is the answer\n\nDigitalization and using modern technology like smartphones has many benefits. The World Bank Working Paper titled - The Global Findex Database 2014, Measuring Financial Inclusion around the World says:\n\n“Moving from cash-based to digital payments has many potential benefits, for both senders and receivers. It can improve the efficiency of making payments by increasing the speed of payments and by lowering the cost of disbursing and receiving them.”\n\nThe report points out further that digital payments increase transparency of payments reduce leakages and provide a first entry point to a formal financial system.\n\nThe currency is the financial system\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have emerged have several advantages. Firstly they are digital. There is no cash to handle. You do not need vaults, armored cars or any of the other infrastructure that makes handling cash expensive.\n\nSecondly, some cryptocurrencies have features like smart contracts built in, which can be used by people to conduct transactions securely with each other without the need for intermediaries institutional or otherwise.\n\nAs MIT Technology Review recently quoted Joi Ito, Director of MIT Media Lab as saying about Bitcoin:\n\n“Whether you’re an individual trying to get access or you’re a pensioner with lots of money tied up in the market, you’re going through these intermediaries that don’t represent you very well. [Bitcoin] creates a much more level playing field, and hopefully, it will reduce the complexity of the financial system.”\n\nThe poor need to be unshackled\n\nRegulatory hurdles need to be surmounted before digital currency can truly go mainstream, however, there is hope for the future as countries are getting around to the idea of Bitcoins becoming a part of the system.\n\nThere are advantages as well. Digital currencies are transparent and some currencies like Bitcoin offer a transaction ledger that is public. These currencies can help the poor gain freedom from cash which is money that offers anonymity to drug dealers, corrupt officials and others preying on them. Digital currencies also takes out the need for people living in remote areas to go to centers of population for making transactions.\n\nConversely, it also frees up financial institutions from having to put up infrastructure and staff in remote locations. Whichever way you look at it, the poor gain significant freedom from the advent and use of digital currencies.', 'On April 20, Charlie Lee, Litecoin founder and Coinbase Director of Engineering, announced that Jiang Zhou’er, the founder and operator of a major Litecoin mining pool, was planning to mine several Segregated Witness (SegWit) blocks to test the pool’s system and stop signaling SegWit after the initial testing phase.\n\nYet, Zhou’er’s Litecoin mining pool LTC1BTC is still mining SegWit blocks and signaling the activation of SegWit, according to various mining statistics providers.\n\nInitially, Zhou’er planned to test his system and mining pool by signaling SegWit. He intended to stop after mining a few blocks. On April 21 however, the Litecoin mining community and industry released the “Litecoin Global Roundtable Resolution 001” to portray the general consensus of both the mining community and the industry to the public. The resolution noted that the Litecoin community came to a consensus to mine SegWit blocks and signal for the activation of the solution.\n\nFollowing the resolution and the community’s vision, Zhou’er has continued to mine SegWit blocks and signal his support toward the scaling solution.\n\nDiscussion with Charlie Lee\n\nCharlie Lee participated in the Global Litecoin Roundtable Meeting to discuss the activation of SegWit on Litecoin. As one of the key figures of the community, Lee played a major role in convincing the mining community to activate SegWit for Litecoin scalability.\n\nBy this rate, SegWit on Litecoin will be activated after another activation period, after 8,064 blocks. If the current 75.79 percent threshold continues to be sustained, SegWit will be locked in by the sixth activation period and SegWit will officially be integrated into Litecoin.\n\nMost mining pools that are mining or signaling SegWit on Litecoin plan to push SegWit on Bitcoin if it performs as expected on the Litecoin network. Major Bitcoin mining pools such as F2Pool have publicly announced that they intend to signal SegWit on Bitcoin once its applicability and features are tested on Litecoin.\n\nEven Bitmain’s Antpool, which has been the most vocal opposer of Bitcoin Core and SegWit, is currently signaling SegWit on Litecoin. Thus, Antpool could potentially signal SegWit on Bitcoin if it sees its potential on Litecoin.\n\nAt the moment, SegWit activation on Bitcoin is nowhere close from being executed. Only 34.1 percent of the Bitcoin mining network are in support of SegWit. Mining pools including Bitfury, BTCC, F2Pool and Slush Pool are actively pushing the integration of SegWit into Bitcoin.\n\nIn the contrary, some of the larger mining pools such as Antpool and BTC.Top are signaling their support for the Bitcoin Unlimited software, for undisclosed motives.\n\nWhile some believe Antpool’s opposition to SegWit is their method of eliminating the potential of blocking AsicBoost deactivation, Antpool’s covert usage of AsicBoost has not been proven as of yet.', 'Countries like France, Germany and the UK have already established regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin companies, users and traders. Other European countries have offered their unique regulatory frameworks with clarity, to ensure there exists no conflict between local businesses and regulators due to ambiguous regulations and policies like India.\n\nSmaller countries such as Malta, an archipelago in the central Mediterranean between Sicily and the North African coast, have begun to consider Bitcoin as a legitimate currency and revolutionary technology.\n\nBitcoin and Blockchain included in national strategy\n\nIn particular, local publications including Malta Today reported that the country’s prime minister Joseph Muscat announced the approval of a national strategy to promote Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.\n\nMuscat said at a conference organized by the financial affairs parliamentary committee:\n\n“This is not just about Bitcoin and I also look forward to seeing Blockchain technology implemented in the Lands Registry and the national health registries. Malta can be a global trail-blazer in this regard. I understand that regulators are wary of this technology but the fact is that it’s coming. We must be on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation and we cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them. We must be the ones that others copy.”\n\nAlthough Muscat raised several positive use cases of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, Muscat specifically addressed the Bitcoin Blockchain’s ability to handle, store and process sensitive data such as lands registry in a secure, immutable and decentralized ecosystem.\n\nLand records\n\nMost recently, Ubitquity, a US-based Blockchain startup, partnered with one of the land records bureaus of Brazil to utilize the Bitcoin Blockchain technology to integrate land records to the public Blockchain of Bitcoin. Such method enables land bureaus and other government organizations to store data within an unalterable ledger.\n\n“We are incredibly excited to announce our partnership with the land records bureau, a Cartório de Registro de Imóveis [Real Estate Registry Office] in Brazil. This partnership will help to demonstrate to government municipalities the power and benefits of using Blockchain-powered recordkeeping,” said Ubitquity founder and president Nathan Wosnack.\n\nMalta to become the Silicon Valley of Europe?\n\nThe rest of the government, including Labor Minister of Parliament Silvio Schembri, revealed the government’s vision to transform Malta into the Silicon Valley of Europe. The country will focus on the development of innovative technologies such as Bitcoin and Blockchain technology to stay at the forefront of European technological innovation.\n\nSchembri stated:', 'The number of functioning Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) nodes has plummeted again within a short period beginning April 22.\n\nFrom a steadily declining count which saw numbers go from 786 to 649 in two days, BU’s node count suddenly dropped like a stone - by 65 percent.\n\nAs of press time Monday, only 259 are operating according to statistics from Coin Dance, a slight recovery from a previous bottom of 223.\n\nWhile an official explanation is still forthcoming, commentators on social media are already suggesting the source to be another bug in BU’s software.\n\nSimilar occurrences in recent weeks have seen exploits aimed at shutting down nodes, which in the short term achieved considerable success.\n\nA statement on Reddit from a Bitcoin Unlimited source reads:\n\n“Unfortunately, running with full blocks and a massively bloated mempool is the hardest conditions for efficient block propagation while allowing flexibility for larger blocks. A point release is being prepared for this.”\n\nHistorically meanwhile, the latest crash is the largest in BU’s history. March’s temporary breakdown saw node numbers halve from around 800 to 400, before recovering to pre-bug levels, subject to two more modest drops along the way.\n\nSo far this time, a significant resurgence is yet to happen.', 'The Bitcoin network has seen a sharp increase in U.S. dollar denominated transaction fees and the average amount of time it takes for a transaction to receive its first confirmation over the past year due to blocks becoming increasingly full. While some have claimed these perceived issues are extremely detrimental to the adoption of Bitcoin in developing countries, Bitwala CEO Jörg von Minckwitz told Bitcoin Magazine that this is not necessarily true.\n\n\n\nBitwala is a Bitcoin-focused international money transfer startup that also aims to provide blockchain-based banking services that are accessible to anyone on any part of the planet.\n\nAccording to Minckwitz, the changes in the Bitcoin network over the past year have not had much effect on the particular types of use cases that have become popular on the African continent. Bitwala as a company also likes Bitcoin as it exists today, although they believe off-chain solutions such as the lightning network are the right path forward in terms of future improvements to the network.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Used for in Africa?\n\nAccording to Minckwitz, North Africa is the most popular region of the continent when it comes to new signups and website visits; however, the Bitcoin startup is also seeing a daily rise in signups and generally increased interest from users in other areas.\n\nAccording to data recently released by Bitwala, 30 percent of their new signups are coming from a combination of Africa and South East Asia.\n\n“Bitcoin is also becoming very popular in Sub-Saharan and East Africa where it fills the need to serve underbanked communities and where the cryptocurrency steps in place of sometimes absent currencies,” Minckwitz said.\n\nMinckwitz went on to claim that Bitwala has seen a lot of businesses, especially in Nigeria, that utilize bitcoin to provide bank-like services such as offering loans.\n\n“Bitwala has emerged to fill the gap left by money transfer intermediaries and banks when it comes to cheaper and faster international transfers,” Minckwitz said. “Although we cannot tell for sure, judging by the amounts transferred, people in Africa are using Bitwala for sending money to friends and family, but business-like transactions are also on the rise.”\n\nIn a past interview with CoinJournal, Kenya-based fintech blogger Michael Kimani shared similar statements, noting the use of Bitcoin for filling the gaps between the various online payment systems in the country.\n\nBitcoin’s Network Congestion Not Causing Problems in Africa\n\nWhen asked if Bitwala has been negatively affected by higher fees and longer confirmation times on the Bitcoin network, Minckwitz bluntly responded, “To be honest, no.\n\n“We like Bitcoin as it is and we don’t see higher fees as a threat,” Minckwitz continued. “Higher fees make companies [optimize] their payment flows. Many transactions of a day-to-day life don’t need to be settled on chain. With higher fees, the spam (useless transactions) on chain gets reduced, which is in our opinion a good thing. Bitcoin was not meant to be a payment network. It is the value that the payment network should carry.”\n\nSome in the Bitcoin community would dispute the claim that the P2P digital cash system was never meant to be a payment network. After all, the introduction of the Bitcoin white paper discusses the need for an “electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.”\n\nHaving said that, the earliest of adopters, such as cypherpunk Hal Finney, who received the first-ever bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto, have also noted the digital commodity’s gold-esque properties, which could signify its importance as a store of value.\n\nIn Minckwitz’s view, the bigger Bitcoin companies should settle their bitcoin payments in a manner similar to how traditional banks work today, at least for now. “They calculate their debt or balance during the day and once a day they do one transfer instead of hundreds back and forth all day long,” he explained.\n\n“I think it all comes down to the perspective,” Minckwitz continued. “When you take a look at the current system in Africa, it is way worse than Bitcoin’s transaction fees. When you transfer money to Africa with Bitcoin it is just a fraction of the amount you pay for companies that serve Africa at the moment.”\n\nMinckwitz added that the use of bitcoin as a store of value in Africa should also not be forgotten. “Most countries in Africa have really unstable currencies, so sometimes they lose almost everything overnight,” he said. “We see Bitcoin as the first solution where they are in charge themselves.”\n\nScaling Bitcoin via Off-Chain Solutions\n\nFrom Minckwitz’s perspective, the best path forward for scaling Bitcoin is through the use of off-chain solutions. In addition to having users improve the organization of their payment flows and the bank-esque settlement techniques mentioned previously, Minckwitz would like to see this process improved further through the adoption of Segregated Witness and the lightning network.\n\n“It enables people [to] do transactions off chain during a certain time period,” Minckwitz said of the lightning network. “In the end of this period, there is one transaction on chain to rebalance the accounts. That is an infinite scalable solution and proven since it is in a similar way commonly used today in the banking system already, so I think that is the way to go.”', 'On April 5, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell introduced the possibility of inhibiting a covert attack on the Bitcoin proof of work (PoW) function using a method called AsicBoost.\n\nTo the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Maxwell stated that the exploitation of the flaw of Bitcoin’s PoW function through a covert usage of AsicBoost could lead to a $100 million annual revenue for miners.\n\n“Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in payoff of as much as $100 million USD per year at the time this was written (Assuming at 50% hash-power miner was gaining a 30% power advantage and that mining was otherwise at profit equilibrium). This could have a phenomenal centralizing effect by pushing mining out of profitability for all other participants, and the income from secretly using this optimization could be abused to significantly distort the Bitcoin ecosystem in order to preserve the advantage,” Maxwell wrote.\n\nAlthough the majority of the community alleged Bitmain and its bitcoin mining pool Antpool for using AsicBoost covertly to increase their revenues, no conclusive evidence has been found so far to prove the allegation. The community suspected Bitmain of using AsicBoost to increase their revenues due to the company’s patent on the technology in China. More importantly, Bitmain admitted using AsicBoost on the bitcoin testnet. In its official statement, Bitmain ultimately denied utilizing AsicBoost on the bitcoin mainnet.\n\nMost members of the bitcoin community failed to understand the magnitude of increase in profit margins with AsicBoost covertly active. Maxwell wrote that the covert utilization of AsicBoost provides miners a 20 to 30 percent power advantage. Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos explained that the 20 percent advantage does not translate to a 20 percent increase in revenues. Rather, it leads to a staggering 2,000 percent increase in annual revenue for miners using the technology.\n\nProfit Margins\n\nAt the Silicon Valley bitcoin meetup on April 11, Antonopoulos emphasized that mining centers across the world, even those that are located in mountainous regions in China that provide cold climate to reduce heating of mining facilities and cheap electricity, are constrained by electricity.\n\n“First of all, most data centers that run [bitcoin] mining are not constrained by how many mining rakes they can buy or rack, they’re constrained by how much power they can feed into the building, that is always the constraint. And as soon as they have more power, they can easily buy all of the chips and rack and immediately get to a 100 percent of all of the power,” said Antonopoulos.\n\nThus, if miners and mining center operations can find a way to decrease electricity consumption, they can utilize more mining racks and technologies to mine bitcoin.\n\n“If you reduce consumption by 20 percent, that means you can install 20 percent more miners which means 20 percent more hashing power. That doesn’t mean a 20 percent increase in profits. Because profit margins are less than one percent,” he added.\n\nHe noted that profit margins in bitcoin mining are substantially small that even a slight advantage could allow some miners to move a huge step in front of the competition. In bitcoin mining, if a miner bring in $1 million in revenue, due to the low profit margin, at the end of the year, it can generate around $10,000 at best. However, with a method like AsicBoost in place, a miner can increase the profit margin by around 2000 percent.\n\n“If you reduce the cost of electricity by 20 percent, you earn a million dollars in mining, you spend $750,000 in electricity. And your profit just went from $10,000 to $190,000, by a factor of 19 or 20. This is a huge advantage. If AsicBoost is really happening, it will allow one miner to completely dominate the market and knock all of their competitors out of the market,” Antonopoulos explained.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The weekend has not been kind to Monero holders, which comes as a bit of a surprise. With the XMR value dropping below the US$20 mark for the first time in a while, some holders may have panic sold over the past few days. However, a push for upward momentum is becoming visible on the chart, and XMR should break the US$20 mark with relative ease in the coming hours.\n\nXMR Dips Despite Bitcoin Value Retrace\n\nIt is evident cryptocurrency traders have taken a more bearish approach when it comes to Monero over the weekend. For the first time in over a week, the value per XMR dropped below the US$20 mark. That is quite a surprising turn of events, a site appears Monero would push past US$21 just a few days ago. It is unclear what brought about this change of heart, although it may only be a temporary retrace.\n\nLooking at the current price charts, it is evident this downward momentum cannot be maintained for an extended period of time. Bitcoin’s value is being contested right now, which means there will be some more funds flowing to altcoins in the coming days.Monero is still a more than viable alternative cryptocurrency, both in terms of future gains as well as a way to hedge against bitcoin volatility.\n\nIt looks like fiat currency traders will have to bring some more volume to the market in the coming hours, though. The past 24 hours saw just US$621,500 worth of XMR trading volume, which is substantial, albeit a bit low. On the EUR front, things are looking rather dismal, with just over 90,000 EUR in volume. Considering how a lot of exchanges suffer from USD deposit and withdrawal issues, one would expect the EUR market to grow. Instead, it is shrinking, for some unknown reason.\n\nMonero has lost some value to Bitcoin over the past few days, but it looks like the recovery process is underway as we speak. The past 24 hours resulted in a 0.19% gain for Monero, pushing the price to 0.01611 BTC. We are a long way removed from the 0.0175 BTC mark, but now is a good time for investors to start buying some XMR before the next leg up on the charts. Patience is a virtue for Monero holders right now, as things will improve over the coming days.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'BITCOIN\n\nIn response to last year’s dismissal of money laundering charges involving bitcoins, legislators in Florida are now considering a bill that would add digital currencies to the state’s anti-money laundering law.\n\nThe proposed law was crafted by Miami-Dade cybercrime prosecutors after a judge threw out the money laundering charges against Michell Espinoza, a Miami Beach man who was accused of selling $1,500 worth of bitcoins via bitcoin exchange site LocalBitcoins.com to undercover detectives who told him they wanted to use the digital currency to buy stolen credit card numbers.\n\nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler dismissed the charges against Espinoza on grounds that bitcoin could not be considered “money” as defined in state law.\n\nNow, state prosecutors and lawmakers want to add teeth to the state’s current Money Laundering Act by adding the words “virtual currency” to the language used to define “monetary instruments.” In the proposal, virtual currency is defined as any “medium of exchange in electronic or digital format that is not a coin or currency of the United States or any other country.”\n\nThe bill is currency being considered at the ongoing annual legislative session, according to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle.\n\n“This legislation makes sure that traffickers and fraudsters can no longer try to use internet-based currencies to hide and move their ill-gotten gains,” Rundle said in a statement, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts, however, fear that the law—once passed—will undermine digital currency.\n\nBarry University economics professor Charles Evans, who, incidentally, told the court that bitcoin isn’t real money during Espinoza’s trial, said the draft law sends a message that financial innovation is not welcome in Florida.\n\n“No doubt, officials in China, Europe, Russia, Texas and other places where bitcoin is welcome will be pleased,” Evans told Miami Herald’s David Ovalle.\n\nA House version of the bill, sponsored by Miami Rep. Jose Felix Diaz, already sailed through an appropriations committee last week, while the Senate version is up for voting in an appropriations committee after passing two sub-committees.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nThe price of bitcoin is up at $1,245 during Monday morning’s trading.\n\nComments', 'Bitcoin price is on an uptrend on its short-term and long-term charts but could undergo a correction after some profit-taking activity.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is still trading inside its ascending channel formation and is testing the $1400 resistance as predicted earlier.\n\nPrice could be due for a quick selloff from here as bulls book profits off this strong ceiling.\n\nIf so, bitcoin price could make a pullback that might draw more buyers in and allow the climb to resume.\n\nBitcoin price is on an uptrend on its short-term and long-term charts but could undergo a correction after some profit-taking activity.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA on this 4-hour chart so the path of least resistance is to the upside. In addition, the 100 SMA has recently held as dynamic support and could continue to do so. The gap between the moving averages is getting wider to show increased bullish pressure.\n\nStochastic is indicating overbought conditions, which reflects rally exhaustion and hints that selling momentum could come into play. RSI is also in the overbought area and is already turning lower to suggest that bears are trying to regain the upper hand. If so, another pullback to the nearby 100 SMA support at $1250 or to the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point at $1150 could be underway. A larger correction could last until the channel bottom at $1100.\n\nMarket Events\n\nTraders are now turning their attention to the tax reform plan to be unveiled by President Trump on Wednesday as this might provide support for US assets, including the dollar. Still, there’s a chance for disappointment as the details could fall short of market expectations and there’s also the question of how long it would take before the changes are implemented.\n\nAs for bitcoin itself, the lack of negative news has proved positive for the cryptocurrency as there have been no new regulations from China so far nor any troubles from the network hard fork. With that, the path of least resistance in terms of fundamentals is also to the upside, pending any major surprises from the headlines this week.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

A fund holding the currency could bring more professional investors to the asset and push its price higher.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nYet bitcoin presents a new set of risks to investors given its limited adoption, a number of massive cybersecurity breaches affecting bitcoin owners and the lack of consistent treatment of the assets by governments.\n\nBitcoin traded up 1.7% at $1274.99 earlier on Tuesday. The digital currency has rebounded after initially plunging following the SEC’s initial decision calling the digital currency market “unregulated.”\n\nCBOE Holdings’s (cboe) Bats exchange had applied to list the ETF and appealed to the commission to review its staff’s decision. The exchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', ""A couple of weeks ago Bitcoin legend Charlie Shrem hosted a BlockShow Europe 2017 which was organized by Cointelegraph Events in partnership with Deloitte Germany, nexussquared and BlockPay. The event in Munich became the largest Blockchain-related event organized in Europe so far, attracting over 550 attendees, offering a stage to 32 international speakers and opening an exhibition hall to 25 Blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nShrem himself was impressed by the level of event’s organization. He tells Cointelegraph:\n\n“BlockShow is really great. I’ve been to a bunch of events in the US and this was my first trip outside of the US in the last four years and had to pick a good event. Cointelegraph is not new to the industry, you guys have been around for many years. So it’s not like there are a few events funded by these new entities that do not really understand what the vision was. Of course, you have to know where you came from to know where you are going. So it is a great choice for you guys to organize the BlockShow 2017. It was super awesome and exciting.”\n\nBitcoin is the printing press of our time, Blockchain is what is powering it\n\nShrem opened the event with the keynote discussing the current state of the Blockchain, where he compared the technology with the printing press for its potential to move the control out of the hands of the few back to the people.\n\n“It gave people the ability to publish their own information very cheaply across borders around the world and distribute it in a decentralized way,” he says. “Bitcoin is the printing press of our time and the Blockchain is what is powering it.”\n\nLater, in the exclusive interview with Cointelegraph he elaborated on this thought and shared his view on where we are now in maturing of Blockchain technology, as well as what we should expect next.\n\nLet's not rush the Blockchain Revolution\n\nOnly the laziest is not talking about Blockchain nowadays. As a rule already, the words ‘Blockchain’ and ‘revolutionize’ go together. But with all the hype around the technology, we need to be realistic. Shrem suggests to keep your feet on the ground while dreaming about all of the good it can do.\n\n“We still don’t even know what this technology actually is, we all thought and we were all pretty confident that Bitcoin was going to disrupt finance and that was it,” he notes. “Over the past few years, we’ve seen all these applications that cover supply chain, logistics, content distribution, all this different stuff that you didn’t even know Blockchain could do. And it pushes us back too a little, we are having all these re-discoveries.”\n\nThe use cases suggested by the Blockchain technology seem to be endless, indeed, however, it does not necessarily mean that technology behind Bitcoin is mature enough to be deployed and implemented on a larger scale just yet, or is it?\n\nShrem shares his perception of technology maturation:\n\n“Bitcoin and Blockchain are still in its experimental phase, we are not even in version 1.0 yet, I think we are super early, I think we are in the mid-90s, it can take us another 20 years to see the mainstream adoption that we all are looking for. I’ve always thought that Blockchain tech is in its college years, it knows what it is, it kinda knows what it wants to do, now thinking of how to actually do it. But maybe it’s more like it’s back in high school because we can’t still figure out what we are doing and what we can do. There’s no reason to rush it.”\n\nHurdles of Blockchain implementation\n\nThe most successful implementation of Blockchain technology to this day is Bitcoin and I guess nobody can deny that this is where the tech is actually mature enough. As for the application of Blockchain technology in other areas, there’s a lot of hurdles, both technical and non-technical.\n\nTo start with, how do you convince institutions to replace something that has been operating (even if with relative success) for so many years with something radically new. Besides, there are technical issues that need to be addressed.\n\n“Unfortunately, or rather, fortunately, the tech has grown so much, and now we have all these scaling issues. It’s kind of like champagne problems – when we won the elections what type of champagne do we want to drink? Well, let’s do that later, let’s try to win the elections first! We are kind of at that stage, but now we need to know,” says Shrem and explains: “Because it can break the whole project - how do we scale? Blockchain scaling has taught us that we need to answer these questions now, we need to know how do we scale, how do we grow because we know it’s going to succeed, we know it’s going to do amazing.”\n\nBlockchain technology in other areas is more of a hype perhaps - there is a lot of suggestions (which is great) but we don’t actually see it being implemented, not just yet. Financial services for sure lead the maturity curve nowadays but the adoption rate doesn’t really change. Besides, there are other areas willing to compete in terms of taking a leading role in the implementation of Blockchain.\n\nShrem says:\n\n“We have already seen a lot of finance, we are gonna see smart contracts, ICOs are going to be huge the next year too. Supply chain and logistics – people are not looking at it yet. I think it comes to the ways corporations and governments talk to each other, they need to trust each other. How do they share debt settlement, financial information, content, intelligence? Governments all share, the only way they do it now is through a signed agreement. They all are looking for a common non-trusted way to be able to move information around.”\n\nShrem believes that when it will come to the adoption of Blockchain, small corporations are going to drive this process. “Everything is top down, Bitcoin is bottom up,” he notes. “You'll see corporations first, you'll see small banks. We will not even know how big the Blockchain is being used because we will not even know we are using it. What we see and what is already happening is that small banks, corporate institutions that hold reserves, start to hold some percentage of their reserves in Bitcoin. Because they want to hedge, if there’s a potential there’s the future.”\n\nOnce in crypto, always in crypto\n\nSome believe that eventually, Bitcoin will turn into a digital gold and that’s what is going to drive the price of Bitcoin up. Shrem feels positive for everyone holding at least 10 BTC in their wallets now, as in 30 years from now it will be enough to buy a nice house.\n\nHe recalls the time when the Bitcoin price was going down people would go from crypto back to fiat, however, now when the Bitcoin price is going down, the whole crypto market cap doesn’t move, it is quite the opposite as we see the increase.\n\nShrem explains:\n\n“People are going to Dash, Ether, Ripple, but you are not seeing money exit the crypto. If you are looking at the market capitalization of all crypto for the last five years, you’ll notice that it is constant up. It is super positive, Bitcoin is a reserve currency, you don’t see much USD to Dash trading pair, you see Dash/BTC, you see Steem/BTC, Bitcoin is like the reserve currency of all of these altcoins.”\n\nBetter have Bitcoin regulated - you don’t want a threat of jail\n\nGovernments’ attitudes towards cryptocurrencies around the world are still inconsistent when it comes to defining the concept, treatment and legality. But a brilliant thing is that regulations are evolving together with the market.\n\nSome governments seem to be a little bit more advanced when it comes to regulations. China, India, and Japan set off on to finally make up their minds concerning the status of cryptocurrencies. “The Chinese government is taking more like a ‘work with the businesses’ approach, they are visiting exchanges, they are going there, they are speaking to them, they are not just shutting them down not taking away their money,” remarks Shrem. “I’ve always admired the way the Chinese government has been handling innovation comparing to how other governments have been doing this.”\n\nShrem points out that the Chinese have been a big influence on the Bitcoin price lately. He continues:\n\n“If you go to China everyone is excited about Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, even the government is. The Chinese government is actually funding a bunch of different projects. They just want to protect their national interests. And they want to make sure that people aren’t money laundering and that’s understandable. As long as they are not trying to block innovation and they are taking the right attitude, I do applaud the Chinese government so far.”\n\nThe measures taken might feel a little uncomfortable but who would argue that in the long term it is not going to be good for Bitcoin? Chinese, and now Indians are actually begging the government to regulate Bitcoin because that would mean the acceptability, relevance and approval. “A lot of early adopters were like – no regulation,” notes Shrem and continues: “We shouldn’t use regulation. But the issue is that it's not a question of regulation or no regulation, it is a question of illegal or regulation. And you don’t want it to be illegal, you don’t want a threat of jail. Because jail really sucks, but you have to engage governments, they are going to do what they want to do anyway, but we should try to get the best out of it.”\n\nOn Bitcoin ETF being declined and other crypto dramas\n\nDoes it sometimes feel like we are living in some kind of crypto soap opera, with these never-ending dramas, heartbreaks, and mysteries? We have lived through fake Satoshi story, all kinds of internal misunderstandings, certain consortium’s decisions to abandon Blockchain altogether and so on and so forth. Then there was Bitcoin ETF denial.\n\nShrem tells Cointelegraph:\n\n“If you asked me about the ETF before it was declined I would say I wish they have never even applied in the first place. Because I felt that a denial would look really bad in the short term. Indeed, an ETF would have been really cool, ‘cause you know my grandfather could buy Bitcoin but Bitcoin is not ready for that yet, we don’t even know what it is, it is so new still. It’s only less than 10 years old, we might need another five to 10 years until we are going to have an ETF traded product. How are you going to regulate something that’s inherently unregulatable?”\n\nIndeed, so what they said No? We just dusted off the fluff and moved on. Now, however, we are in the middle of another drama, the outcome of which is said to significantly alter the future of Bitcoin, and the drama is - SegWit vs. BU.\n\nShrem says:\n\n“Bitcoin is not free from agenda. Satoshi was very smart and he said – who has the most to gain and the most to lose when it comes to the honesty and integrity of the Blockchain? And that was the miners. The miners spend all the money and they have the financial incentive, which is the best incentive, to keep the Blockchain with its integrity. So governments, institutions, corporations, all these other players, businesses, they are incentivized of course, but they are not directly as incentivized as the miners actually - the miners will always try to make the most of money, but also try to keep the integrity of the Blockchain.”\n\nSo, are the miners actually represent the power that controls Bitcoin and its future?

The cryptocurrency was trading up 2.1% at $1,281.76 a coin as of 1:57 p.m. ET, and on track to top its record-high close of $1277.65 set on March 6.\n\nFour days later, bitcoin put in an all-time of $1327.19 just hours before crashing more than 25% after the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the Winklevoss twins' plans for a bitcoin ETF. The SEC rejected the plans for another bitcoin ETF just a few weeks after that.\n\nHowever, bitcoin has rallied off its March 24 low of $959.45 as it has gained acceptance elsewhere. First, Japan announced it was accepting the crypticurrency as a legal payment method, then, Russia said it would consider recognizing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2018.\n\nBitcoin has been the top performing currency every year since 2010, aside from 2014. It has gained 33% so far in 2017."", 'BitTorrent Founder Bram Cohen has said he wants to create a “storage based” cryptocurrency to combat “centralization in Bitcoin mining.”\n\nThe veteran tech entrepreneur told TorrentFreak that a “new currency” is required to tackle what the publication describes as “Bitcoin flaws.”\n\nHe says:\n\n“My proposal isn’t really to do something to BitCoin. It really has to be a new currency. I’m going to make a cryptocurrency company. That’s my plan.”\n\nWhile the exact details are still forthcoming, Cohen apparently intends to use a Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) algorithm to reduce mining expenditure. Bitcoin, by contrast, uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nCurrencies that use PoC rely on stored data banks to verify blocks, which reduces the energy load required to run the network considerably on the miner’s end.\n\n“Another benefit of storage based things is actually that there’s a lot less centralization in mining. So there’s a lot less concern about having a 51% attack,” he continues.\n\nCohen is a fair few stages behind fellow tech mogul Kim Dotcom in his entry into the cryptocurrency realm, the latter having already demonstrated the latest incarnation of his Megaupload file-sharing site.\n\nIncorporating a Bitcoin-based content distribution system called Bitcache, the project makes direct use of Bitcoin wallets to allow content creators to receive payments for the material they publish.\n\nIn preparation for Bitcoin’s latest rival, meanwhile, Cohen says he will shortly begin spending all his time on development.\n\n“In the next few months I’m going to devote myself full-time to the cryptocurrency stuff,” he concludes.', 'The price of litecoin surged to a more than three-year high earlier today.\n\nOver the course of a particularly active session, the cryptocurrency, once marketed to as the ""silver to bitcoin\'s gold"", reached as much as $15.09 at approximately 00:30 UTC, its highest since March 2014, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nAt the time of report, the digital asset had fallen slightly to $14.48 – yet this figure was still three times higher than price observed last month.\n\nAfter years of dormancy, litecoin has seen its price rally lately as it comes ever closer to obtaining the miner support it needs to activate a technical upgrade called Segregated Witness. (Should current support levels hold, it\'s expected upgrade will ""lock in"" in about two weeks).\n\nAt the time of report, 77.81% of litecoin miners were signaling their support for the upgrade. SegWit, a solution originally created for bitcoin, would increase litecoin\'s block capacity by reducing the amount of data associated with each individual transaction.\n\nAs such, the support that miners have been showing for this solution is cited as the primary influence on the recent price increase.\n\n""Over the past week, LTC basically moved in tandem with the percentage of miners supporting it. Miner support is now 99.65% [in the past 24 hours], so litecoin is doing well,"" said Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Management.\n\nOver the long-term, litecoin\'s implementation of SegWit could have many positive implications, other analysts said.\n\nJacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to this situation:\n\n""I think this is very positive for litecoin.

The digital currency has yet to be officially recognized as money by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Pune police cyber investigators recovered Rs 4.58 crore from the alleged thieves, including Bitcoin worth Rs 1 crore (approx $155,000) .\n\nAlongside the seized Bitcoin, police also seized 40 cellphones and 27 SIM cards from the accused: Jitendra Maruti Rindhe (42), Sandip Ashok Mule (30), Dipak Sarjerao Kharat (26) and Rajesh Janardhan Budkhule alias Soni (48).\n\nThe accused, many of whom held their own accounts with BoM, hacked the UPI app to gain access to bank customer accounts. The alleged hackers exploited a bug in the bank’s app, which was developed by Mumbai-based InfrasoftTech. The accused also used real-time gross settlement (RTGS) to send money received into accounts they controlled.\n\nInvestigators allege that the 50 accused had developed a chain of account holders at BoM whom the either paid off or exploited. For instance, the accused contacted 15 farmers with accounts at the bank and took their SIM cards, saying they’d pay Rs 5,000 per month.\n\nCybercrime investigators determined that some misappropriated funds had been transferred to intermediary firms like Zeb IT Services Pvt Ltd, Oracle Retail Pvt Ltd and Milton Medocore Pvt Ltd located in Ahmedabad. At least Zeb IT Services Pvt. Ltd had its accounts frozen by police.\n\n“Rajesh Budkule is the prime accused in this case,” cybercrime cell senior inspector Sunil Pawar told Pune Mirror. “ We have found that the accused had formed a chain-like a multi-level marketing (MLM) system and approached farmers from Narayangoan and Junnar. They took their SIM cards, which were linked with account numbers of BoM on the pretext that they will be provided monthly funds from Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. In this way, they used the UPI app to commit the offence. Two accused are still absconding.”\n\nThe BoM filed a complaint with the appropriate court in which it demanded strict action against, in particularly, the Bitcoin businesses involved.\n\n“The RBI circular in February says it has not given any license or authorisation to any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency,” BoM representative Rajas Pingle said. “The government needs to clear India’s position on virtual currencies, especially when there are growing concerns of their use in money laundering or financing terrorism.”\n\nAbhijeet Bidkar, representing Zeb IT Services Pvt Ltd, told Pune Mirror that bitcoin exchange Zebpay is legitimate. “Virtual currencies are legal in several countries, including Japan,” he said. “Users can only do transactions on Zebpay after submitting KYC documents. All purchase and sale happen strictly via bank accounts only and no cash. Hence, all transactions are recorded and easily identifiable. All these users were easily identified and we are helping the local agency to recover the funds.”\n\nThe RBI said in February it has not issued any licenses for Bitcoin companies to operate in the country.\n\nFeatured iamge from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BitPay CEO Stephen Pair has signaled progress in the company’s Bitcoin upgrade. BitPay wants extension blocks, but no hard forks.\n\nPair suggested the company has been doing some groundwork on testing extension blocks longer than what they’ve made public.\n\nPair has been careful to not dub the efforts as “auxiliary blocks” or “extension blocks” due to it being a political term – depending on whom you ask. Instead, he prefers to think of the additional blocks as “secondary blocks.”\n\nTheir view of a possible hard fork is that it is best avoided. Pair feels that although it is important to support progress and alternative implementations, Bitcoin Unlimited “has made a few poor technical implementations.”\n\n“At the same time, I am concerned that many people may not be aware of extension blocks and how they may be a better way to upgrade Bitcoin and avoid unnecessary contentious hard forks.”\n\nSpecifications and working code\n\nThere are GitHub pages for both the specification and working code. As a step further, BitPay explains how to join the public testnet. Pair writes: “You can be running a bcoin node on this extension block testnet in just a few minutes. If it holds up scrutiny we may support activation on the main net.”\n\nJust days after the Litecoin community announced it will go ahead and start SegWit activation after a unanimous decision, it is understandable that leading figures such as Pair might push forward for Bitcoin progress in one form or another.\n\nSuggested roadmap\n\nAn article released on March 16 sets out the following guidelines for a “safe, non-contentious upgrade process.”\n\nPhase 1. Soft fork adoption of new rules.\n\nIn the form of network adoption and miner adoption.\n\nPhase 2. Depreciation.\n\nPhase 3. Hard fork.\n\nThe full mini road map of what the company would like to see happen can be found here.\n\nBitcoin Litecoin drama\n\nIn related news, the Bitcoin community has been watching and in some cases even worrying about Litecoin’s adoption of SegWit. The possible success or failure of SegWit in a substantially capitalized coin such as Litecoin might alter Bitcoin’s path forward.', ""Dear Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited Supporters,\n\n\n\nA contentious hard fork isn't your only nightmare.\n\nYour nightmare is that the Bitcoin brand becomes so tarnished by the scaling debate that the general public, regulators, legislators and businesses decide that it’s not wise to adopt it ... ever.\n\nAs the debate rages, the public is hearing about it ... and the press isn’t good. If you want evidence, take a look at Laura Shin’s recent article in Forbes. That’s the one where she compared your in-fighting to that of the Democrats and the Republicans.\n\nAside from terrorist groups like ISIS, it’s hard to imagine any two groups that are more universally vilified than those two right now, at least in the United States.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I’m a huge fan of Shin. Like all of us who are devoting their lives to this “space,” she WANTS Bitcoin and the Age of Decentralization to succeed. At the same time, she has a responsibility to tell the truth as a journalist.\n\nHer metaphor is accurate when you consider just what these two largest American political parties known for these days: not getting anything meaningful done, constantly attacking and bickering with each other, defending entrenched ideologies and putting selfish interests above the needs of the greater good.\n\nAnd like Republicans and Democrats who are losing the respect of the country, you developers, miners and other representative stakeholders on both sides of the block size debate, who, like it or not, represent our community, are making us all look bad. The results of this loss of respect can have implications far beyond the philosophical and technical issues.\n\nThe world is watching and deciding what to make of this Bitcoin-Blockchain-Decentralization experiment.\n\nWe are one side of Geoffrey Moore’s adoption curve chasm, known for mapping out how technologies move from early adopters to mainstream usage. The key lesson of Moore’s curve is that the people who are just on the edge of the Early Majority (as opposed to the Innovators like you and the Early Adopters like me) are the ones who are deciding if they will embrace it.\n\nHowever, if these potential adopters read, “Oh, it’s like Democrats and Republicans” when they are considering Bitcoin, they will probably react the way that they do with the real Democrats and Republicans.\n\n“Forget all of them.”\n\nPerception Is Key\n\nThis new perception, combined with previous negative press that has accumulated since the days of Mt. Gox and Silk Road and the natural enemies of decentralization, will give additional ammunition to the people who want to keep Satoshi’s fantastic innovation from spreading. And they will use it to instill fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in the general public.\n\nPrimavera de Filippi, a research fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, introduced me to Schopenhauer’s three stages of technology adoption:\n\nFirst, innovation is ridiculed.\n\nSecond, it is violently opposed.\n\nThird, it is recognized as inevitable.\n\nFor many others and for me, Bitcoin reaching stage 3 is indeed inevitable. We just don’t know when. What we do know is that stage 2, violent opposition, can be lengthened or shortened.\n\nMy fear is that the longer the block size debate continues, the more FUD is created, and the longer that stage 2 lasts.\n\nThe ongoing drama of the block size debate is not just bad for Bitcoin, it’s bad for everyone who cares about decentralization. It’s bad for the startups who are actively thinking about how to market their projects to more mainstream audiences. (We even have a network just for them.)\n\nWorse, it’s bad for the people who don’t even know they should care about decentralization and are being harmed daily, like the 2 billion unbanked and immigrants paying exorbitant fees for international remittances.\n\nBitcoin is the poster child for the decentralization movement, which is why I care so much about putting this block size/scaling debate behind us.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize–winning, NY Times columnist Tom Friedman has a new book out called Thank You for Being Late. In it, he talks about a number of macro-trends all contributing to the “Age of Accelerations.”\n\nInterestingly, he says, “I am sure I will be writing about blockchain in the paperback edition of this book” (p.146). And on page 275: “If we want to liberate society, we first need to liberate the Internet.”\n\nA thought leader like Friedman, who can push a significant segment of the early majority to action with a single column, doesn’t fully understand the technology yet (I’ve already pinged him and begun that process) but is thus far optimistic. Conversely, we need to recognize that the LAST thing we want for him and others like him to say is, “It has potential, but it’s not ready for prime-time because they can’t get along and that just puts you at risk.”\n\nAt the end of the book, Friedman talks about how government is broken and about his upbringing in Minnesota. For many years, according to Friedman, Minnesota had a tremendous legacy of bipartisanship that was a model and inspiration for the nation. Democrats and Republicans worked together. They compromised. They got stuff done.\n\nOn a larger scale, government used to be about compromise. In the U.S. at least, we need a grand compromise on things like taxes, spending, immigration reform and healthcare, but no one is willing to budge from their rigid positions. Politicians today just dig their heels in. It’s frustrating, angering, and it makes us vulnerable in so many ways.\n\nSo, if everyone from the outside looks at the “civil war” between Core and Unlimited and reads in a major publication like Forbes, “Well, it’s like Democrats and Republicans,” it’s hard to imagine anyone saying, “Yes, I would love to have MORE of that in my life.”\n\nI understand the basic technical mechanics of the block size debate. I understand there are philosophical issues (and real money) at stake, and I understand enough to recognize that we have a great thing going here. To make it even greater, we need a whole bunch more people to realize that it is, in fact, better than our current systems of centralization because it has less risk, less friction, greater security and lower costs — all of which is better for everyone.\n\nWhat I don’t have is the answer to what the compromise is.\n\nBut, as a marketer with over 20 years’ experience in disruptive technology, I recognize that the people on the other side of the adoption chasm are not like us. They are much more risk-averse. They’ve been burned by promises of technology panaceas and they aren’t going to read Satoshi’s white paper, try to figure out what SegWit or lightning networks are, or understand what hashrates are all about.\n\nThey are just going to ask themselves, “Is the risk worth it?”\n\nWe have a chance to do what the Republicans and Democrats are seemingly unable to do: make a compromise for the sake of the endeavor.\n\nI can’t tell you what it should be. All I would just suggest is that the parties agree to come together with open minds and possibly a world-class mediator. It’s time to be like the leaders of old who were able, when necessary, to put personal feelings and self-interest aside for the benefit of the cause.\n\nThe longer the scaling debate drags on, the longer the larger cause of decentralization will suffer a setback.\n\nAs I look around at the state of the world and the challenges that Friedman accurately identifies facing all of humanity, we can’t afford any unnecessary delays.\n\nI just hope we can resolve it soon.\n\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Jeremy Epstein.

We started out in and around the 1150 level just a couple of weeks ago, and things we’re really on the fence as far as a bias was concerned. Price could have dropped below 1100 and signaled a longer term bearish bias. Alternatively, it could have run and broke the 1200 mark, and got us on the side of a bullish bias longer term. As it turns out, the latter of these two scenarios played out, and we’re not trading in and around the 1350 mark – fresh highs, and with some of the strongest volume (and corresponding support) we’ve seen in a while.\n\nSo what are we looking at going forward as supportive of our long term bias?\n\nWell, we want to see 1300 hold, for sure. That said, we’re ideally looking for a break above 1400 as strongly indicative of the suggestion we’re going to see long term strength, and that current levels will hold.\n\nThat’s long term, of course.\n\nLooking short term, here’s what we’re going for. Take a quick look at the chart below to get an idea what’s on, and where we are looking to get in and out of the markets according to the rules of our strategy.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range we are looking at right now is defined by support to the downside at 1345, and resistance to the upside at 1351. We’re going to look out for a close above resistance to signal an immediate upside entry towards an initial upside target of 1365. A stop at 1348 looks good. If we see a close below support, we’ll be getting in to a short trade towards 1335.

04/26/2017,"['Bitcoin price officially reached $1,300 on April 26, surpassing its previous all-time high price at $1,277. This occurred minutes before the decision of the US Securities and Exchange Commission to deny the Winklevoss twins’ ETF was announced.\n\nThe Winklevoss Twins strike again\n\nMost analysts seem to believe that the recent surge in Bitcoin price was caused by the SEC’s decision to re-examine the Bitcoin ETF proposal of the Winklevoss Twins. The commission accepted a petition submitted by BATS Global Markets and began a one month process to review the proposal of the COIN ETF once again.\n\n""The news of the review has definitely excited speculators, although it\'s unclear if this will alter the SEC\'s decision. So the gains in the last 24 hours may be temporary,"" Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at regulated cryptocurrency trading platform Gatecoin, said in an interview.\n\nHowever, the upward trend of Bitcoin price has maintained its momentum over the past week. It is difficult to conclude that the SEC’s recent ruling led to a surge in Bitcoin price as the demand for an ETF significantly decreased after its initial denial. More importantly, Bitcoin price recovered rapidly after the denial of the COIN ETF.\n\nThus, while the Bitcoin ETF re-examining process could be one of the factors to affect Bitcoin’s recent price surge, it isn’t the driving factor.\n\nThe recent price trend of Bitcoin is not organic\n\nRather, it is likely that the arbitrage in the US market caused by Bitfinex and other exchanges’ inability to process withdrawals and deposits in fiat money is causing Bitcoin price to increase at a rapid rate.\n\nAccording to various Bitcoin market data providers including BraveNewCoin, Bitcoin price in the US, which holds 26.6 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market share averaging at $1,315. On the other hand, Japan, the largest Bitcoin exchange market, is demonstrating an average price of $1,297.\n\nCompetitors in the US Bitcoin exchange market including Bitstamp expressed their concerns over the current Bitfinex issue and its conflict with its intermediary banks. Nejc Kodric, CEO of the major US exchange Bitstamp, said in an interview that the recent Bitcoin price trend is not organic. It demonstrates a high level of instability.\n\nKodric stated:\n\n""There are three things that an exchange can have trouble with. The first is having a hack, the second thing is being shut down or warned or anything around regulators and the third is getting your accounts shut down. You can survive the first two. But the third is a big one. That\'s a lethal injection for an exchange.”\n\nIf one of the largest exchanges in the US, the second largest Bitcoin exchange market, demonstrates a $100 premium, it would likely act as a driving factor of Bitcoin price. Some analysts predict Bitcoin price will decline in the short-term due to this inorganic growth.', 'Bitcoin is targeting record highs as data suggests support for Segregated Witness (SegWit) could be as high as 91 percent.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap’s Bitcoin price tracker, current conditions put the virtual currency at $1,277 at press time, extending an upward trend lasting since March. On some exchanges, it has been trading above $1,300 for the past week.\n\nIts success comes as new information compiled by Coin Dance shows a huge overall majority for SegWit support among Bitcoin businesses.\n\nOut of 146 tracked by the information portal, only nine said they were “explicitly opposed” to SegWit activation, with the remainder either “explicitly supporting,” neutral, unknown or “ready” to implement it.\n\nTaking those opposed and neutral out of the equation, the already healthy 88 percent figure is increased further if Coin Dance’s “weighting” feature is enabled.\n\nWeighting adjusts the figures to take into account that some businesses have a bigger effect - and voting power - than others.\n\nIn total, up to 91 percent of respondents may be in favor of SegWit, placing the solution far ahead of a used-activated soft fork (UASF) (16 percent explicit support) and Emergent Consensus (17 percent).\n\nA further boon for Bitcoin may be coming from temporary optimism surrounding the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s review of its decision to block the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF in March.\n\nA petition submitted by the BATS exchange following the initial rejection is currently under consideration, along with the first-ever decision on whether or not to allow an Ethereum ETF.', 'Major Bitcoin mining hardware producer Bitmain can remotely shut down almost all active Antminer machines. Dubbed the “Antbleed” backdoor, abuse of the vulnerability could probably knock half of all hash power on the Bitcoin network offline.\n\n\n\n“Even if Bitmain had no bad intent, this is a gaping security hole,” said our source, who discovered the backdoor but asked to remain anonymous.\n\nThe backdoor code can be seen on Pastebin and on GitHub, and today a website has been put up for Antbleed as well.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe Antbleed backdoor is “stupid simple,” as our source described it.\n\nWhenever an Antminer appears online, and once every one to eleven minutes, it contacts a “port 7000 service” on the domain auth.minerlink.com, which is owned by Bitmain. The domain currently does not connect to any IP-address, and therefore does nothing.\n\nHowever, the domain could in the (near) future start connecting to a corresponding IP-address. If that happens, it will report the Antminer’s serial number as well as the MAC address and the IP-address to Bitmain.\n\nThis could be enough for the company to link the machine to a specific user.\n\n“Bitmain can use this data to cross check against customer sales and delivery records making it personally identifiable,” our source explained. “And Bitcoin mining is a small industry, so it shouldn’t even be hard to connect the machines to specific pools, or blocks.”\n\nOnce connected, the server the Antminer connects to — Bitmain’s server — sends a message back. If that message is “true”, the machine will continue mining. But if that message is “false”, the code produces a piece of text that reads: “Stop mining!!!”\n\nIt seems obvious that this piece of text would make the machine stop mining, which is indeed confirmed by our source, who tested it on an Antminer machine. Additionally, it can be checked by anyone with an affected miner; antbleed.com explains how.\n\nThe backdoor can be verified, since it is embedded in open source code. In fact, it seems rather strange Bitmain would include such a backdoor “out in the open”, for anyone to see.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, who was quick to comment to the issue on Twitter and Reddit, suggested:\n\n“Bitmain probably underestimated how much source code actually does get audited — it\'s a common myth that code never gets read. Also, if you\'re going to add a backdoor, you do want plausible deniability in case it does get found. Hiding in plain sight, amongst thousands of lines of undocumented code, helps. Perhaps Bitmain will claim this is actually a feature.”\n\nWhat It Affects\n\nThe backdoor probably affects most Antminers in use today: the S9, the T9 the R4, as well as Litecoin’s L3.\n\nThe commit date indicates the backdoor was introduced in July 2016. This is one month after the first S9 machines were shipped. All machines that shipped since July 2016 should have the backdoor on board, which means they can be shut down by Bitmain. Machines that were shipped before July 2016, but have been updated since, should be vulnerable, too.\n\n“It’s difficult to say with certainty how much hash power on the Bitcoin network is subject to the vulnerability,” our source said. “But since Bitmain is by far the market leader for hardware machines, it’s not a stretch to attribute at least half of all hash power to the vulnerable machines. As such, Bitmain could potentially shut down an enormous share of Bitcoin’s hash power with the push of a button. In addition to that, the company can target specific machines or customers.”\n\nAnd it’s not just Bitmain who could shut down the machines. Because the connection is unauthenticated, the code will connect to anything that appears like ""auth.minerlink.com"", which can be spoofed by certain third parties. Apart from Bitmain, it could, for example, be an internet service provider, anti-DoS service CloudFlare (used by Bitmain), or anyone who can hijack DNS records: rogue ICANN employees, hackers, the U.S. government, and more.\n\n“The nicest possible explanation is that Bitmain is incompetent at security, putting the whole Bitcoin network at risk,” Todd concluded. “But given the history we have of miners threatening with attacks, it wouldn\'t surprise me if this was added as a last resort option for shutting down competitors if they needed to push something through with hashing power.”\n\nUpdate\n\nA representative for Bitmain commented on the issue:\n\n\n\n""The code running on the machines is open source, everyone can review it so no secret features exist in it. The code that was pointed out is a feature to allow owners of the Antminers to be able to remotely control their miners. It is not a secret and it does not provide any kind of remote control to Bitmain for the Antminers it does not own or operate in its own mining farms.""\n\n(Note: The representative provided this comment a bit before publication of the article, but due to a miscommunication this update was added only briefly after publication.)\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nIt should be noted that if you own an affected machine, a fix is available on antbleed.com as well.\n\nUpdate\n\nBitmain has issued an official press release commenting on the issue. In it, the company acknowledges the existence of the feature, stating:\n\n\n\n""This feature was intended to allow the owners of Antminer to remotely shut down their miners that may have been stolen or hijacked by their hosting service provider, and to also provide law enforcement agencies with more tracking information in such cases. We never intended to use this feature on any Antminer without authorization from its owner.""\n\n\n\nThis story will be updated as more news becomes available.\n\nThe identity of our source is known to us and considered to be reliable.', 'Ripio, the bitcoin startup formerly known as Bitpagos, has officially closed its Series A funding round with a $428,000 investment from Overstock subsidiary Medici Ventures.\n\nAs revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Series A – led by China-based VC fund Huiyin Blockchain Venture – brought in a final total of $2.25m and is intended to fund the newly rebranded firm\'s plans for international expansion.\n\nFurther, the Medici investment marks a change to Ripio\'s original funding plans, which had been to close the Series A with smaller investors via the AngelVest platform.\n\nIn interview, Ripio senior vice president David Garcia said that, in addition to launching new features on its platform, his firm is seeking to expand to Mexico and Colombia in coming months.\n\nGarcia said:\n\n""We are looking to use the funds to keep the leading positions in the countries where we have operations and also grow our operations to new countries.""\n\nThe Argentina-based firm, which now employs 25 people, has already expanded into Brazil and aims to establish itself in the new markets as early as the end of this quarter.

At this value, bitcoin on Bitfinex was trading more than $130 higher than it was on OKCoin, nearly $100 above its price on Kraken and roughly $90 higher than Coinbase\'s GDAX exchange.\n\nNotably, the cryptocurrency\'s price on Bitfinex was also trading more than $100 above the price of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), an index from which it was recently suspended.\n\nAt press time, bitcoin was trading at $1,299, just below its all-time high of $1,325.\n\nAt the time of report, the cryptocurrency’s price had pared these gains somewhat, trading at roughly $1,410.00. But, as for what to make of the increase, traders have been less clear.\n\nOn one hand, the cryptocurrency\'s price rallied in spite of the industry\'s ongoing scaling dilemma and continued banking challenges, while on the other, those very issues have stoked concerns across the ecosystem.\n\nWhen asked about the sentiment among traders, BTC VIX, organizer of bitcoin trading community Whale Club, said there are now concerns Bitfinex ""may never have access to USD clearing again"", and that this was creating a ""Bitfinex premium"" in the market.\n\nThe result, he alleged, has been heightened bitcoin buying amid concerns that access to fiat funds at exchanges could decline.\n\nBanking freeze\n\nIndeed, spreads have widened as cryptocurrency exchanges – most notably Bitfinex – have struggled with ongoing banking challenges that are preventing customers from making formerly routine deposits and withdrawals.\n\nHowever, the exchange is not alone, as OKCoin and BTC-e have also recently reported issues with US dollar transfers.\n\nEarlier this month, Bitfinex announced that it was experiencing delays in its outbound wire transfers as a result of problems involving its Taiwan banks. Bitfinex cited the refusal of Wells Fargo, its correspondent bank-to process these transactions as causing the problem.\n\nOnly days after revealing this challenge, the exchange announced that it was refusing incoming wires. At the time, the spread between Bitfinex bitcoin prices and prices on other exchanges widened, rising to more than $90 in some cases.\n\nDangerous heights image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It also called on the government to provide clarity on India’s position on virtual currencies especially as “there are growing concerns of their use in money laundering or financing terrorism.”\n\nLeading Bitcoin exchange affected\n\nPolice have frozen the accounts of the three companies involved in the Bitcoin transactions and recovered Rs 4.58 crore from the accused, which include Rs 1 crore worth of Bitcoin. Zebpay, one of India’s leading Bitcoin exchanges, is among the companies affected by the situation.\n\nIts advocates explain that the platform has not conducted any form of illegal activities as suggested by the bank. It says all transactions on its platform, which a user could only perform after submitting KYC documents, happen strictly via bank accounts and not through cash. Hence, transactions are recorded and easily identifiable for accountability.\n\nThough Bitcoin is not currently regulated in India, the country is very strategic with regards to the currency’s global growth.\n\nThe demonetization exercise embarked upon by the country late last year played a role in the rise of Bitcoin price over the $1,000 range. With its vast population and developing market, a regulation of the digital currency by the Indian government has been considered in place to advance its adoption. Reports have it that the government has plans to regulate it so that all the activities related to Bitcoin could be properly monitored and applicable taxes added.\n\nHowever, the bank hack comes at a time when a committee recently constituted by India’s Reserve Bank looked into activities related to digital currencies such as Bitcoin. In effect, it is expected to slow things down. The committee has to make its recommendations known by May.\n\nThe Bitcoin market has been on the lookout for a positive outcome from the Inter-Disciplinary Committee set up earlier in April to take stock of the present status of virtual currencies both in India and globally. It was also established so as to examine the existing global regulatory and legal structures governing the currencies. It would also be expected to suggest measures for dealing with issues related to them, including consumer protection, money laundering, etc.', ""Mixed feelings have trailed Roger Ver's announcement of his plans to start a cloud mining project soon with some respondents crying scam while others being fairly neutral.\n\n\n\nBasically, the move somewhat contradicts the Bitcoin Unlimited champion's view about mining, expressed last year. He'd stated in a post that he doesn't think Bitcoin mining is a good investment for various reasons. They include the fact that everyone can see the Bitcoin price, the mining difficulty, the price of electricity and that everyone has access to similar mining hardware.\n\nExploiting vulnerability\n\nThe post also states that it is those who have an advantage over the price of electricity and mining hardware that could pull through in Bitcoin mining. This assertion is now leading to suggestions that Ver could be counting on using the contentious AsicBoost from Bitmain which reportedly gives Bitcoin miners a 20 percent advantage over others by exploiting a patchable vulnerability in the protocol for his cloud mining operation.\n\n\n\nSeveral cloud mining projects have failed in the past and millions of dollars worth of investment vanished. Tying such projects to bitcoin.com - which is run by Ver and is usually one of the first landing sites for newbies to cryptocurrencies - could create a media frenzy for Bitcoin in the event it fails.\n\nBU chances\n\nOthers think the cloud mining project idea is a way to improve BU's chances at signaling for changes to the Bitcoin protocol through its generated hash power.\n\nThis is particularly interesting considering that his announcement comes as reports show that the Bitcoin Unlimited nodes crashed in its capacity. On April 22, the number of functioning BU nodes dropped briefly from 649 to 223 according to Coin Dance. There are 5,764 Bitcoin Core nodes as at the time of writing.\n\nHowever, despite the pessimism, others in the community think he is an ideological person and his agenda should be supported in some ways.\n\nThis is hinged on the view that whether the cloud mining project will be a good investment for anyone or for Ver is still not clear.\n\nAnother argument is that it could be improper, on the other hand, to automatically assume that he could be up to something unworthy simply because he is on the BU side of the scaling debate instead of being in support of SegWit."", 'Bitcoin price climbed all the way up to the channel resistance at $1400 and could be due for more gains after a quick correction.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is now testing the $1400 mark at the top of the ascending channel as indicated in the previous article.\n\nPrice could head back to the short-term channel support at $1375 for a quick pullback to draw more buyers in before the uptrend resumes.\n\nA bounce off this near-term support could lead to another test of resistance or even a break higher for a steeper climb.\n\nBitcoin price climbed all the way up to the channel resistance at $1400 and could be due for more gains after a quick correction.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA on this time frame so the path of least resistance is to the upside. In addition, the 100 SMA is close to the bottom of the channel, adding to its strength as potential support in the event of larger pullback.\n\nMeanwhile, the 200 SMA is closer to $1325, which might be the line in the sand for this uptrend. Note that the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to suggest weaker buying pressure and a potential downward crossover.\n\nStochastic is turning down from the overbought zone to reflect a pickup in bearish momentum while buyers take it easy. RSI also appears to be heading south so bitcoin price might follow suit. A break below the 200 SMA could confirm that a longer-term drop or pullback is underway.\n\nMarket Events\n\nMarket watchers appear to have been disappointed by the Trump administration’s tax reform plan as it fell short on details and contained nothing new from previous speculations. This includes reducing the tax brackets, cutting the corporate tax down to 15% and reducing the tax burden on middle-income American families.\n\nWith that, the attention is now shifting back to political headlines and the next US event risk on deck, namely the advanced GDP reading for Q1. Analysts are expecting to see a 1.3% growth figure, a few notches below the earlier 2.1% GDP reading. Weaker than expected results could undermine dollar gains and Fed rate hike hopes, thereby boosting bitcoin price.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'A mining chip vulnerability that could potentially be used to remotely shut off bitcoin mining machines was revealed yesterday – with a fix from the manufacturer following shortly after.\n\nInvolving controversial mining chip manufacturer Bitmain, the issue is what some are calling a ""backdoor"" in the code that controls its hardware, offering the company a way to remotely shut off the miners. Since the code, released anonymously last evening, is vulnerable to attackers, the main concern is whether, in a worst-case scenario, it could be misused.\n\nThe fear is that bad actors could exploit the vulnerability to switch off bitcoin mining equipment in bulk, and with Bitmain supplying such a large number of machines to the market, the impact could have catastrophic implications for the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nKnown as Antbleed (a title bestowed by the website that dramatized its release), the vulnerability is open-source, making it easy to verify. Leading up to the reveal, a group was told about the code feature, with some developers, such as Satoshi Labs CEO Marek Palatinus independently verifying that the backdoor exists and that it can be used to stop Bitmain miners on trigger.\n\nBitmain quickly responded with a fix that erases this part of its mining firmware. Further, its team claimed that the feature was never finished, and that it was intended to help customers recover stolen miners, a past problem for industry firms.\n\nThe statement reads:\n\n""We never intended to use this feature on any Antminer without authorization from its owner. This is similar to the remote erase or shutdown feature provided by most famous smartphone manufacturers.""\n\nMuch of the recent buzz in the community is around whether the so-described ""backdoor"" could have been used for malicious purposes, for example, to shut off a miner if it wasn’t complying with rules set by Bitmain.\n\nAdding to the confusion is that bitcoin developments have been highly politicized lately, with Bitmain often sitting at the center of bitcoin’s long-standing scaling debate, opposing proposals authored by members of the Bitcoin Core community. For example, the vulnerability reveal follows allegations that the manufacturer was using a secret mining advantage to boost its profits.\n\nIn conversation with CoinDesk, Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun might have summed up the issue and surrounding atmosphere the best:\n\n""The drama in social media today surrounds the question of whether there exists a security hole that would allow this remote-control feature to be exploited for nefarious purposes.""\n\nCode details\n\nStill, it seems that there are other reasons to be concerned about the backdoor.\n\nSince it can be exploited by bad actors from outside the company, the mining chips are now viewed as a security risk to the network. Every one to 11 minutes, according to the open-source patch introduced on July 12th, 2016, the machines send calls back to a Bitmain server.\n\nThe idea is that the mining manufacturer can scan for identifying information about the mining chip, including its serial number and IP address.\n\nBut, arguably the biggest concern is that the code isn\'t limited to use by certain people or companies, so it can be exploited by any man-in-the-middle or attacks coming from the same DNS server.\n\n""Even without Bitmain being malicious, the API is unauthenticated and would allow any MITM, DNS or domain hijack to shut down Antminers globally,"" the Antbleed website reads, further outlining concerns about the potential for technical or political misuse.\n\nVulnerability or \'malicious\' backdoor?\n\nWhether or not it was intended to be malicious seems to make up the bulk of the surrounding debate, and so far, it seems that sentiment has broken along the lines of the scaling debate.\n\nStill, some broke away from so-called party lines.\n\n""This was reckless of them to leave the unfinished feature in the code since this represents a major security issue,"" said Henry Brade, CEO of bitcoin service provider Prasos, a past defender of Bitcoin Core’s scaling proposals.\n\n""However, based on the statement it is not accurate to call \'Antbleed\' malicious in nature. It\'s simply a serious security issue.""\n\nF2pool operator Wang Chun further noted that, he isn’t particularly worried about miners within his pool falling victim to manipulation by Bitmain. He noted in conversation with CoinDesk that it doesn’t seem like the company ever used it to shut down miners.\n\n""They have been able to do that for a long time, but they didn\'t,"" he said.\n\nGuy Corem, former CEO of Israeli mining chip maker Spondoolies-Tech, chalked up the controversy to ""incompetence” and ""negligence"", rather than malicious intent.\n\n""It make sense they wanted to develop such feature and it also make sense they didn\'t complete it and abandon it,"" he added. Further, he cited Spondoolies-Tech’s own past issues with stolen mining equipment.\n\nStill, some in the community are skeptical of Bitmain’s response.\n\n""Denial of many people is unbelievable. \'Antbleed\' is not bug or mistake. The purpose of the code is clear; shut down miner on remote flag,"" Palatinus tweeted.\n\nPublic info?\n\nOthers have raised concerns about this vulnerability being made public, since outsiders can then take advantage of the attack vector.\n\nBitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo argued that owners of these bitcoin miners needed to know about the potential vulnerability in order to fix it.\n\n""The issue is it\'s already integrated in a ton of deployed hardware,"" he said, adding:\n\n""It was reported to Bitmain via that bug report months ago, and their customers need to know to protect their operations from potential [man-in-the-middle attacks].""\n\nThe issue was first reported to Bitmain on Github in September 2016.\n\nOne question is how prevalent the practice is in bitcoin. Secret backdoors seem to be par for the course in the technology world, often drawing security-minded critics as they\'re uncovered. Do other hardware manufacturers have the same vulnerability? Two mining manufacturers, at least, claim that they don’t.\n\n""Our hardware doesn\'t [have] such issues, we [don’t] offer remote update for firmware – it\'s the customer\'s decision update them or not,” said blockchain startup Bitfury Group CIO Alex Petrov.\n\n""My miner has no ASICBoost or backdoor,"" Jack Liao, CEO of mining LightningAsic, told CoinDesk.\n\nAlong with the details about the backdoor, those who detected it released a patch that closes it up with a single line of code.\n\nMining centralization\n\nStill, there are lingering worries that the vulnerability betrays a weakness in the bitcoin network – namely, it\'s lack of mining chip makers.\n\nNo clear data is available about how many miners are running this software, but Bitmain is one the largest chip manufacturers in the space, with bolder estimates suggesting it produces 70% of all mining chips.\n\nThat the backdoor could be used to impact any of those chips is unsurprisingly alarming to advocates that the network be ""decentralized"" and open to competition that enables different actors to engage on it.\n\nFor now, the impact seems to be that Bitmain will take action to look at the rest of its codebase in order to spot other vulnerabilities.\n\n""The controversy around this code has brought our attention to improve the design in order to address vulnerabilities that were pointed out by the community recently,"" its statement reads.\n\nStill, others are lamenting the state of the drama and conversation around the issue, noting how quickly it became politicized.\n\nRizun concluded:\n\n""All-in-all just another day in bitcoin.""\n\nImage via AntBleed website\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Android was originally intended to be an operating system for cameras.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency based on cryptography, a crypto- or virtual currency that can be exchanged among people around the world without the intervention of intermediaries such as banks or governments.

Not only is bitcoin not regulated, through a process called bitcoin tumbling, it is increasingly difficult to trace any transaction through the bitcoin system.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nAs Financial Times technology reporter Sally Davies put it: “Blockchain is to bitcoin what the internet is to email: a big electronic system, on top of which you can build applications. Currency is just one.”\n\nBlockchain is the technology that underpins bitcoin. It is an encrypted distributed (or decentralised) ledger of transactions shared across anonymous users on the internet. As such, it can be used for storing, securing, managing and validating all types of digital records and transactions, not just payments. Blockchain has the potential to simplify and improve how we store and validate all types of records including contracts, deeds and mortgages, as well as identity data.\n\n‘Bitcoin has evolved as a trustless payment system. As such, it attracts a lot of so-called ‘bad actors’ and a lot of bad press’\n\nLike Android, while blockchain was initially used for bitcoin, its potential reach and impact is much greater.\n\nMcKinsey reports that more than $1bn has been invested by VCs in blockchain ventures in the last 24 months, and the banking sector will spend a further $400m by 2019. So what’s the problem?\n\nBitcoin gone bad\n\nThere is no problem with blockchain per se; the problem is bitcoin. Bitcoin has evolved as a trustless payment system. It is largely anonymous, unregulated and has no central consortium guiding the technology infrastructure development. As such, it attracts a lot of so-called ‘bad actors’ and a lot of bad press.\n\nBitcoin relies on attracting more users to the network to mine bitcoins. As such, power users in the bitcoin economy market extensively to attract new users or miners by offering awards in the form of bitcoins. Our research at IC4 suggests that a significant proportion of the visible discourse (and arguable value-generating activity) on bitcoin is related to attracting and rewarding new miners, and not activities that legitimise bitcoin in the eyes of the general public or wider financial ecosystem.\n\nCui bono? Who benefits? Arguably, who benefits most from this activity are those using bitcoin as a payment or money laundering mechanism – the criminal underworld.\n\n‘Bitcoin is the most (in)famous application of blockchain technology and yet it has evolved largely without guidance from industry or regulators’\n\nThe anonymity of the true power players in the bitcoin economy is exacerbated by lack of regulation. Clearly, lack of transparency and bona fides for those behind bitcoin make it difficult to police in the first place. However, introducing regulation of bitcoin is problematic even if one wanted to. It would require an international and synchronised coordinated effort. Bitcoin is extremely distributed and if a significant market, eg the US or China, decided to regulate bitcoin or access to bitcoin (through firewall prohibitions), it could significantly disrupt, destabilise and disincentivise use of bitcoin.\n\nAnd yet, regulation is clearly needed. For example, in 2014, Mt Gox, one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges, suspended trading due to ‘losing’ a reported $473m in bitcoins through a combination of alleged fraud, theft and mismanagement.\n\nLegitimising blockchain\n\nBitcoin is the most (in)famous application of blockchain technology and yet it has evolved largely without guidance from industry or regulators. It is not only trustless, it is standards-less and lawless.\n\nBlockchain is the real story but it is the lesser-reported one. It is an opportunity worth billions of dollars and can transform how society stores and validates many of the records and transactions that permeate our daily lives. The 12th labour of Hercules involved entering the underworld to capture Hades’ three-headed dog, Cerberus, controlling him with magical chains. The potential of blockchain may only be realised by controlling bitcoin. Failing that, legitimising blockchain may require killing it.\n\nBy Prof Theo Lynn and Dr Pierangelo Rosati\n\nProf Theo Lynn is the lead principal investigator and Dr Pierangelo Rosati is a postdoctoral researcher at the Irish Centre for Cloud Computing and Commerce (IC4) at Dublin City University.

For a growing number of people, Bitcoin acts as an alternative store of value that can help to protect wealth in times of severe economic distress and hyperinflation.\n\nVenezuela\n\nA great case study of how Bitcoin can act as a much-needed store of wealth and a means to make financial transactions outside of a country’s traditional economic system can be found in the South American country of Venezuela.\n\nIn the last six months, the demand for bitcoin in Venezuela has spiked, according to bitcoin trading volumes on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins. The Venezuelan sovereign currency, the bolívar, has suffered from severe hyperinflation and Venezuela’s already struggling economy suffered a further blow last year when a drought prevented its hydroelectric dams from generating enough electricity for the country to sustain itself.\n\nAs the country’s currency is falling into near worthlessness and with no sign of an economic recovery in sight, Venezuelans are struggling to pay for basic goods and services with their own currency, let alone hold onto their savings. Due to strict capital controls, it isn’t easy for the local population to adopt the U.S. dollar or other major currencies to conduct daily transactions. This is why Bitcoin has witnessed such a strong surge in demand there.\n\nBitcoin can be easily accessed by anyone with an internet connection and the government has no control over who uses it. For individuals who want to store their savings in a more secure currency than the bolívar, bitcoin offers that possibility despite strong volatility.\n\nZimbabwe\n\nAnother example of how Bitcoin can play a positive role in a struggling economy by acting as an alternative currency and as a store of value can be found in the African country Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwe has been plagued economic distress since the early 2000s when President Robert Mugabe blamed the country’s economic problems on its white minority and incited his followers to violently seize white-owned farms. The fallout from these actions led to food shortages and famine in Zimbabwe as the agricultural sector collapsed. International trade, as well as foreign investment, deteriorated quickly in the years to follow, causing the Zimbabwean economy to collapse and its sovereign currency to suffer from severe hyperinflation. The year after, the Zimbabwean dollar was abandoned and the U.S. dollar became the country’s primary legal tender.\n\nHowever, in 2016 it became evident that the country does not have sufficient funds to keep its economy afloat using the U.S. dollar, as President Mugabe’s government announced that it would issue a new currency, called “bond notes” to replace the dollar notes in circulation. The new currency has been met with much skepticism by Zimbabweans and fears of a return of hyperinflation are simmering in the country.\n\nSurprisingly, in a country with relatively low internet penetration by global standards, there is a small but growing Bitcoin community and user adoption is growing. Due to a lack of trust in the country’s currency, Bitcoin has become an increasingly attractive alternative to store wealth but also to send and receive international remittances, which many Zimbabweans rely on to live.\n\nLocal Bitcoin startups such as bitcoin wallet provider BitMari and bitcoin exchange BitFinance, which recently secured a new round of funding, are providing Zimbabweans with the opportunity to purchase bitcoins and utilize them for remittance purposes. While the Bitcoin community is still very small in Zimbabwe, the demand for the digital currency is on the rise. Given the inability of Zimbabwe's leaders to turn around its failing economy, bitcoin user adoption will likely continue as the need for an alternative currency is imminent.\n\nTurkey\n\nSince a coup attempt on July 15th, 2016, the Turkish economy has been on the decline. The fallout and policy actions of President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an caused the Turkish Lira to drop by over 20 percent in value against the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, for the first time since 2009, the Turkish economy contracted in Q3/2016 as tourism and domestic demand was heavily hit by the coup d’etat.\n\nThe demand for bitcoin, on the other hand, increased substantially since the summer months, as the value of the lira continued to drop and it became evident that Turkey’s economy would struggle to recover. According to data from LocalBitcoins, bitcoin trading volumes shot up in September and continued to increase in the later months of the year. Not only is Bitcoin providing Turks with the possibility of sending and receiving money abroad, but it also provides the ability to temporarily store wealth while the local currency is sharply declining.\n\nDespite Turkey’s largest Bitcoin exchange BTCTurk closing down in August due to an inability to find a willing banking partner, Turkey’s Bitcoin community and user adoption is growing as concerns about the country's economy and the value of its currency are mounting.\n\nIt should be noted that in all of the above-mentioned countries, Bitcoin is only being used by a small minority. Having said that, the examples given also clearly demonstrate that there is real-world demand for a truly global currency that anyone with an internet connection can access. Currently, the only currency that fits that description is bitcoin."", 'Going by the prediction of the CEO of ShapeShift that the market capitalization of global cryptocurrency market may grow by ten times in the next four years, we may see Bitcoin price going over $10,000 by 2021 if the current top digital currency maintains its share of the market by then.\n\nErik Voorhees predicts that the entirety of the token market, which as an asset class has surpassed $30 bln, would be worth more than $300 bln in the next four years.\n\nIn response to a question on which is the most used token for something other than speculation, Voorhees cites Bitcoin. He says it is used “to send hundreds of millions of dollars all over the world instead of expensive and slow and censored bank networks.”\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap.com, the market cap of all digital currencies as at Wednesday, April 26 stood at approximately $31.6 bln. Bitcoin’s dominance is put at 66.3 percent even as at the price of each unit hits $1,300.\n\nTipping point\n\nAccording to the number of Bitcoins that will exist in the near future, there is likely be 19,031,250 units in circulation by the end of 2021. If Bitcoin is still dominant with a 66 percent share, a projected $300 bln market cap will leave it at $198 bln. This gives us a projected Bitcoin price of $10,403.\n\nThe World Economic Forum had suggested that a tipping point wherein 10 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) would be stored on the Blockchain technology would occur around 2027 - though 58 percent of its study’s respondents expect it to have occurred by 2025.\n\nAt around $20 bln, WEF puts the total worth of Bitcoin in the blockchain at about 0.025 percent of global GDP of around $80 tln. Unlike Voorhees’ view that remittance is playing a role in the token market, the international organization cites some impacts to be expected in the next four to 10 years.\n\nThey include increased financial inclusion in emerging markets, as financial services on the Blockchain gain critical mass; disintermediation of financial institutions as new services and value exchanges are created directly on the Blockchain and an explosion in tradable assets “as all kinds of value exchange can be hosted on the Blockchain.”', 'Three separate partnerships this week are seeing Dash further integrate itself as a currency for everyday payments.\n\nGift card operator BitCart, payments gateway CryptoWoo and Venezuelan exchange Cryptobuyer have all added the altcoin to their books.\n\n“One of the most important things we need to do to help cryptocurrency adoption grow is to give potential users a strong reason to overcome the technical hurdles and start using digital currencies every day,” CEO Daniel Diaz said in a press release Wednesday.\n\nBitCart offers gift certificates for Amazon with a 20 percent discount for paying with Bitcoin and will shortly begin working with Hotels.com to add similar functionality.\n\n“Offering a 20 percent discount on Amazon purchases is a powerful incentive for new users to try Dash out, learn about it and most importantly and start realizing its benefits,” Diaz added.\n\nThis week saw rival Bitcoin gift card business Gyft receive scorn on social media for initially refusing to refund a customer who was banned from Amazon for using what the website described as “invalid” gift certificates.\n\n“Dash allows our merchant platform to completely eliminate the chance of chargebacks and it opens up more options to anyone in the world,” BitCart CEO Graham De Barra added.\n\nDash will also become the fourth currency merchants can accept using CryptoWoo’s plugin, alongside Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin.\n\nIts entry into the Venezuelan exchange market meanwhile appears to be a direct challenge to Bitcoin, the country’s interest in cryptocurrency spiking as its national currency devalues further and further.\n\nThe press release even suggests Dash would become “a viable alternative to the Bolivar.”', 'Grayscale Investments has officially made the long awaited Ethereum Classic Investment Trust available to investors on the market. The firm announced on Wednesday that the fund is live for accredited investors.\n\nThe fund is not the first offer from the firm. Barry Silbert introduced a similar fund for Bitcoin tracked shares as early as in 2013.\n\nThe fees differ though. While the Bitcoin Trust has an annual fee of two percent, the new Ethereum Trust is at three percent this includes a one percent “development contribution” that Silbert announced. This will go to development and marketing of the currency for the first three years.\n\n1/ ANNOUNCEMENT: 1/3 of @EthereumTrust mgmt fee will be donated to Ethereum Classic development, marketing & community activities for 3 yrs — Grayscale (@GrayscaleInvest) March 31, 2017\n\nConflict of interests\n\nThe initial capital comes from Silbert himself, Digital Currency Group and Glenn Hutchins who is the co-founder of private investment company Silver Lake.\n\nWhen the fund was initially announced, some within the community raised questions about a possible conflict of interest, or rather the influence of the fund via Digital Currency Group.\n\nDCG has business interests in news provider CoinDesk.\n\nETC price skyrockets\n\nThe trust was announced to the public in early 2016 and immediately caused waves in the ETC market, which was depressed since the fork of Ethereum/Ethereum Classic. The anticipation of the fund going live has already caused a surge of over 200 percent over eight weeks for the $419.1 mln market capital of ETC.\n\nSilbert explains to Reuters:\n\n“We’re excited about the Ethereum Classic, as opposed to Ethereum because ETC has a fixed supply and the potential to serve the smart contract and micropayment layer to the Internet of Things.”\n\nAll eyes on SEC\n\nAlthough the Winkelvoss application for an ETF was shot down, the cards are back on the table.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the SEC is reconsidering a number of exchange traded funds that could be made available to the public. Ethereum’s possibility has gained renewed interest after it was pointed out that the digital currency is not purely a store of value.', 'A St. John\'s-based company that received nearly $1 million in government assistance to help expand its data centre operations in Labrador is now locked in a legal dispute with its business partner, a Hong Kong-based bitcoin mining firm.\n\nBitmain Technologies sued Great North Data last month, alleging problems pretty much from the start of the agreement between the two companies.\n\nGreat North Data denies those allegations, and points the finger at the Chinese firm for not holding up its end of the bargain.\n\nCourt documents filed by both sides indicate that Great North Data has experienced financial difficulties since last year.\n\nBitcoin mining equipment is shown in this image posted on the Great North Data website. (www.greatnorthdata.com)\n\nThe company received infusions of $500,000 from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency in December 2015, and another $420,000 from the Newfoundland and Labrador government between January and August 2016.\n\nNeither Bitmain nor Great North Data is doing interviews, but their lawyers both issued statements.\n\nDaniel Simmons, the lawyer representing Great North Data, noted in an email to CBC News that the company ""continues to carry on business as usual without interruption at its facilities in Labrador.""\n\nMeanwhile, Megan Taylor, who represents Bitmain, says her client ""has no direct knowledge of the current status of their equipment,"" and Great North is no longer hosting for Bitmain.\n\nBitcoin \'mining farm\' in Labrador\n\nBitmain Technologies develops and produces computers to mine the bitcoin cryptocurrency. It operates some of its hardware out of third-party ""mining farms.""\n\nGreat North Data provides space to companies like Bitmain to install and run their bitcoin mining equipment.\n\nBasically, those computers churn through complex calculations to validate bitcoin transactions. In return, they earn payments that are also made in bitcoin.\n\nIn the past, Great North officials have publicly touted Labrador\'s cold climate and surplus electricity as a perfect combination for the industry.\n\nBitmain signed a deal with Great North last June to have its bitcoin mining equipment hosted at the Labrador City facility.\n\nBut problems soon became apparent.\n\nBy August, Great North Data ""was unable to continue with its construction program to ready the facility for hosting computer equipment due to higher than anticipated construction costs,"" the St. John\'s-based company said in court filings.\n\nGreat North Data says it told Bitmain ""it was considering halting the project.""\n\nIn an email Bitmain included with its court filings, Great North director James Goodwin wrote Aug. 30 that ""we have had significant cost overruns and have failed to find financing to cover them.""\n\nGreat North Data operates out of this former retail building in Labrador City, pictured in a 2016 file image while it was under construction.

It will allow Bitmain to divest from the mine with your funds, and it will allow me to have clients who pay a much higher rate. Otherwise I will not be able to pay my employees or power bills.

Users would log into the service, only to be confronted by a graphic of a whale with the message: “Twitter is over capacity.” Ultimately, Twitter’s fail whale problem came down to scalability, and it’s the same issue that’s facing blockchains today.\n\nBlockchains are in a promising, yet precarious state. As more governments and private entities seek to understand and harness the technology, their shortcomings become more glaring. Growing pains are real indeed, and companies seeking to leverage the undeniable power of the blockchain are being confronted by its scalability limitations. Just as Twitter had to answer tough questions as it prepared to go public, the blockchain industry now must adapt to concerns that accompany many burgeoning new technologies.\n\nSo, how do we as an industry confront the scalability issue? Bitcoin and Ethereum were not built to successfully scale, because all their transactions and smart contracts exist on a single public blockchain, rather than on state channels. State channels are a two-way transaction channel between users or between machines. Smart contracts inside these state channels dictate how value flows and what is executed automatically, while still keeping the cryptographic properties of a single public blockchain: trustless transactions without intermediaries, here even with the speed of light. Blockchains of the future will require private state channels to scale, in a similar way to how the public court system only deals with contract infringements (edge cases) and not every single contract written.\n\nBeyond the issue of state channels, successful blockchains must be willing to provide a platform for applications by third-party developers. Just as Bitcoin was introduced by Satoshi, every decentralized system starts as centralized, and innovations work best when there’s an individual party at the helm.\n\nWhichever blockchain achieves mainstream adoption will also be adopted for private use cases, and the blockchain that is suitable for both public and private use will instill guidelines to build a user-friendly experience. Ethereum has thus far failed at this.\n\nEthereum’s blockchain architecture offers only a ground layer, providing no coherent design, no coherent API for web apps and no straightforward naming system. Much like Apple took over the computing industry by incorporating hardware and software with design and user experience in mind, successful blockchains will need to do better in enforcing guidelines for developers.\n\nBy incorporating state channels to enable trustless smart contracts, and maintaining standards for design, blockchains can overcome scalability roadblocks and tackle the “fail whale” issue head-on. We’ve created a modular yet holistic approach to blockchain technology, built from the ground up to be scalable for mainstream adoption and private use cases.\n\nDevelopers will be able to introduce apps (æpps) using private state channels, benefiting from trustless smart contracts and instant transactions. We hope to set a new standard for blockchain development, one that can usher in a new era of decentralization.\n\nFeatured Image: Yuji Sakai/Getty Images']"
04/28/2017,"['Bitcoin has gone up from around $890 to a high of $1,449.70 at Bitfinex in just one month, continuing a two years long bullish run after a bottom of $162 was reached during summer 2015.\n\nIts market cap now stands above $21 billion, an all-time high, but its market-share has fallen to around 63%, an all-time low. During those two bullish years, bitcoin’s community has been consumed by a “debate” on scalability which continues to today with much of it turning to in-fighting.\n\nIt has further faced draconian measures by PBoC which has ordered Chinese bitcoin exchanges to halt bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. When the exchanges announced the new measures, they said the withdrawals and deposits were halted voluntarily and temporarily.\n\nWe now know the former is not true. Since it is PBoC which has given such orders, we cannot be sure the latter is true either until they do actually start processing bitcoin deposits and withdrawals.\n\nDuring this period bitcoin was also slapped by the SEC which announced the rejection of a much anticipated bitcoin ETF at, literally, the very last minute. Usually, they allow the proposer to withdraw the application if they intend to reject, but it’s not clear whether that was the case considering that it would have offered an easy opportunity for insider trading.\n\nThe currency is also facing a challenge from ethereum which has attracted a number of bitcoin businesses as bitcoin’s fees have considerably increased with transactions often delayed for hours or days.\n\nMoreover, if a halt of bitcoin withdrawals and deposits was not sufficient in China, American banks intervened to cut off Bitfinex from the banking system, forcing one of bitcoin’s biggest exchange to halt fiat deposits and withdrawals.\n\nDespite all this, the currency continues to rise, up and up. There are a number of reasons, with monetary mismanagement last year being one factor and awareness being probably another main reason.\n\nBlockchain went mainstream last year, at least at a corporate level. That means bitcoin probably has too. That’s because most articles, from newspapers to corporate brochures, mention bitcoin when introducing the blockchain.\n\nInitially, it was all about “blockchain, but not bitcoin,” which probably led some to wonder what is bitcoin. Now, they usually say “blockchain, which was introduced by bitcoin” or is used by bitcoin, etc. That means bitcoin is probably a household brand now. Most Americans have probably heard of it, at least by name.\n\nThat means it is probably the gateway to digital currencies, although eth is beginning to gain awareness in its own right. As such, it continues to attract new users and wider adoption, increasing its utility and thus its price.\n\nThat might be a good and probable explanation until Bitfinex halted fiat deposits and withdrawals. Since then, the drying up of such liquidity should have had a downwards pressure, but instead it has sent the price up, increasing by around $50 just on the day it was announced.\n\nThat’s probably because those who hold assets at Bitfinex are forced to purchase bitcoins or other digital currencies, thus increasing demand and price due to constraints. This then dragged up other exchanges, perhaps because some arbitrage method has been found or maybe because of the psychological effects it may have.\n\nBitcoin still trades at around a $100 premium at Bitfinex, while the Chinese exchanges are at a $200 discount. Interestingly, there wasn’t a notable downward pressure by Chinese exchanges, perhaps because since you can’t move bitcoins no one has found an arbitrage method.\n\nStill, the liquidity situation for bitcoin is at its worst since 2014, but, at least for now, the market, as judged by the price, does not seem to care. Whether that will continue and how it will develop, only time can say.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are those of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Blockchain currency is revolutionizing money. Since Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled his cryptocurrency in 2008, we’ve witnessed a proliferation of digital cash companies and codebases. Utilizing his public, distributed ledger, dozens of promising currencies have emerged. Only a select few have proven themselves as true contenders to Bitcoin, however.\n\nHere are the top 10 altcoins on CoinMarketCap (note that the list is changing constantly, especially in the tail part, with other altcoins like MaidSafeCoin, Golem and Augur playing musical chairs with others):\n\nEthereum\n\nJ.P Morgan Chase, Microsoft and Intel allied in order to create the fiercest rival to Bitcoin in circulation today: Ethereum. The main purpose of the endeavor was to program binding agreements into the Blockchain itself. This incarnated into the now-popular smart contract feature.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum is not just a currency. It’s a Blockchain platform powered by the Ether cryptocurrency. The New York Times describes the technology as “a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether.”\n\nRipple\n\nRipple attracted a great deal of venture capital during its inception. The Google-backed altcoin startup managed to pull in upwards of $50 mln from banking institutions, gathering an impressive $90 mln in total funding. Ripple is unique in that it allows for transacting with any unit of value, from fiat currency to frequent flier miles.\n\n“Ripple provides global financial settlement solutions to enable the world to exchange value like it already exchanges information giving rise to an Internet of Value (IoV). Ripple solutions lower the total cost of settlement by enabling banks to transact directly, instantly and with certainty of settlement,” reads the company’s copy on their official website.\n\nInitially a middling contender, Ripple has gained momentum in the cryptocurrency market, seeing a marked surge earlier this year. In fact, Ripple experienced a 100 percent increase in value within a 24-hour period in late March.\n\nLitecoin\n\nFormer Google engineer Charles Lee created this altcoin in an effort to improve upon Bitcoin. Namely, the speed to generate a new block is improved dramatically. Transactions are much faster. By the same token, however, this speed makes Litecoin’s Blockchain larger and more prone to producing orphaned blocks.\n\nDash\n\nDash, a combination of the words “digital” and “cash,” is the Internet’s cash-in-hand. Dash is quick. Its transactions are instant. “Your time is valuable. InstantSend payments confirm in less than a second,” Dash claims. By comparison, Bitcoin’s transactions can take up to an hour to process.\n\nGPU/CPU mining is no longer cost effective. In order to mine, you’ll need specific hardware, computers known as ASICs to complete Dash’s proof-of-work puzzles.\n\nNEM\n\nNEM is written in Java; built on an entirely new codebase separate and apart from Bitcoin’s open-source code. There are a few other intriguing differences from Bitcoin as well. In NEM, you harvest rather than mine. It’s essentially the same as mining in Bitcoin, only that multiple people profit - albeit in much smaller quantities - from a generated block.\n\nNEM introduced the proof-of-importance algorithm to the digital ledger. A user’s wealth and number of transactions are used to timestamp transactions.\n\nNEM has seen rapid growth in its valuation since the beginning of 2017 as the altcoin is currently being embraced in Japan.\n\nEthereum Classic\n\nA parallel Ethereum platform exists and sustains a sizeable usership with a market cap hovering just below $430 mln.\n\nWhy do two versions of the same platform exist?\n\nThe Ethereum community fractured when a disagreement over how a technically legal theft of funds should be handled. The majority of users wished to change Ethereum’s code in order to get the lost funds back. A minority believed that Ethereum should not be tampered with or altered by third parties. Even in cases of users exploiting the smart contract feature to trick others, the Blockchain must remain “immutable.” Thus, the minority created the Classic version of Ethereum, which still survives and thrives.\n\nMonero\n\nMonero is geared toward those who desire greater anonymity. The cryptocurrency allows you to “send and receive funds without your transactions being publically visible on the Blockchain.” Transactions are completely untraceable due to Monero’s leveraging of ring signatures. Unfortunately, because of Monero’s emphasis on privacy, it has seen adoption by the darknet and other criminal organizations.\n\nZcash\n\nZcash, like Monero, offers greater privacy to users. Unlike Monero, transactions are shielded rather than made completely private. Meaning, the details of the transaction itself, such as the users involved and the amount traded, are hidden. Zcash does this by using a “zero-knowledge” proof that allows for parties to exchange funds without revealing each other’s identity.\n\nDecred\n\nDecred’s primary aim is to focus on “community input, open governance and sustainable funding and development.” The currency melds proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining algorithms to ensure a minority of users do not own the majority of the funds and that decisions are led by the community rather than a handful of developers or early investors.\n\nPIVX\n\nPIVX stands for Private Instant Verified Transactions. Another open-source decentralized Blockchain currency, it is built upon Bitcoin Core. Like Zcash and Monero, PIVX boasts its heightened privacy and security.\n\n“[W]e believe that you have the right to exchange privately and securely, without interference from corporatocracy pressures, governmental influences, prying eyes, and nefarious individuals and movements,” PIVX contends.\n\nPIVX is highly volatile, experiencing massive spikes in trading volume and valuation as of March of this year. Again, because of the currency’s emphasis on privacy, PIVX is susceptible to criminal activity.\n\nCryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and the altcoins it has spawned, may bring about a new global economy. They allow us to transact in a peer-to-peer fashion, without third-party bodies governing us. Bitcoin introduced the Blockchain, but other developers are quickly improving upon Nakamoto’s idea. Some currencies have focused on speed, as is the case with both Ripple and Litecoin. Others have honed in on privacy, currencies like Zcash going so far as making all transactions private and untraceable. Each altcoin comes with its own strengths and weakness. Surely, we’ll discover more as time goes on. For now, these 10 currencies are at the top. Their fate could turn, however, at a flip of a coin.', 'As Bitcoin breaks its own all-time high (ATH) on multiple exchanges, it appears as though a rising tide raises all boats.\n\n\n\nMost important, GDAX/Coinbase, a crucial on/off ramp for digital currencies, has taken the lead in ETH/USD volume and is reporting higher ETH/USD than BTC/USD volume over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis is anecdotal evidence for a key metric of “new money” coming into the space. Although the $4–5 premium remains on Bitfinex due to USD withdrawal halt, GDAX now leads in volume and holds a small premium above a few of the other exchanges as well. Poloniex and ETH/BTC volume continue to lead globally (not shown).\n\nEthereum hash rate also continues to push ATHs almost daily, showing strong confidence in miner support.\n\nFor weeks now, I’ve been watching the slow formation of the head and shoulders bearish reversal chart pattern. The pattern convincingly formed with the appropriate and important descending volume profile.\n\nThe trick with trading these patterns is to not jump the gun. The short entry signal is always a break of the horizontal support on volume. That never happened. Instead, price held above the 200 EMA and refused a bearish 50/200 EMA cross as well. When reversal patterns form and do not play out as expected, that is generally considered to be a strong continuation sign.\n\nIt’s also possible that this was simply a bullish continuation pennant all along, with a measured move target of ~$115 (0.088).\n\nGoing forward, we should watch for price to test previous local highs and push for the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, yielding a target of ~$115 (0.0873).\n\nThere is also a high probability that a higher high in price will not yield a higher high on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator. Although this result is days or a few weeks away at this point, watching out for this now will prevent you from entering a trade based on emotions. Sure, price can go parabolic at any time and break the rules of divergences, but should a divergence form, it suggests continuation is far less likely than reversal. We will also want to be watching volume. If volume does not break previous local highs, it adds to the bearish divergence confluence, all of which would suggest bullish momentum is waning.\n\nSummary\n\nAs Bitcoin breaks ATHs, it’s likely that any digital currency on associated on-ramps increases as well, simply by association. Bitfinex ETH/USD premium continues and should continue until USD withdrawals resume, if ever. Although chart patterns and indicators were leaning bullish, price did not break down and is now projecting a target of ~$115. Watch for the new Ethereum ATH to occur and create a bearish divergence with a swift pullback in price.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Both bitcoin and Ether prices are currently trading at an all-time high.\n\nAccording to Coindesk’s price index, you could buy one bitcoin for $1,343 earlier today. It roughly represents a 6 percent increase in 7 days, and a 34 percent increase in a month.\n\nAnd when it comes to the price of an ether, things are even more impressive. One ether is currently worth $64.04, up around 24 percent in just a week.\n\nEther prices are a bit correlated to bitcoin prices as many people trade bitcoins against Ethers. But it doesn’t explain why it was such a good week for Ether’s price.\n\nBitcoin still faces a scalability issues. It seems like bitcoin stakeholders can’t agree on a solution to make some improvements on the core bitcoin protocol to speed up transactions and lower transaction fees. As a result, it has never been so expensive and slow to send and receive bitcoins.\n\nBut there’s one thing I noticed. Prices tend to go up when there’s bad news around the world. If Donald Trump tweets about North Korea, chances are it will have positive effect on cryptocurrencies.\n\nConversely, I noticed a micro-crash minutes after the results of the first round of the French election — prices went up again minutes later. Marine Le Pen arrived second, which was a good sign for traditional currencies like USD and EUR.\n\nIt’s still hard to predict those market changes as many depend on macro-economic rules in China. But as many worry about the current political outlook, cryptocurrencies could counterintuitively look like a safe investment.', 'A New York-based bitcoin trader has plead guilty to unlawful money transmission and making false statements to federal officials.\n\nRichard Petix of Rochester, NY was originally charged with making false statements in late 2015, according to court records, after he told probation officials in October of that year that he wasn’t using any computer device, as required following of a 2009 conviction on a charge of knowingly transporting child pornography in interstate commerce.\n\nYet Petix, the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York said this week, had been operating a bitcoin trading business, and on 3rd December 2015, sold 37 bitcoins (an amount worth roughly $13,000, according to then-current prices) to an undercover agent.\n\nThe office said in a statement:\n\n""Using his laptop computer and smartphone, the defendant transferred approximately $13,000 in the form of 37 bitcoins to an address specified by the agent. When confronted by federal probation officers at the scene, however, Petix claimed that the laptop and smartphone were not his and that he could not access them.""\n\nProsecutors further alleged that Petix sold more than $200,000 worth of bitcoin between August 2014 and December 2015. Yet court documents show that one point, the defense argued that the allegation of unlawful money transmission wasn’t valid, given that Petix didn’t charge a fee for those transactions.\n\nPetix was initially set to go on trial on 1st May. According to court documents, he will attend a sentencing hearing on 14th August.\n\nJustice statue image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The BU and SegWit debate has created a deadlock that seems to have stalled the community without innovation.\n\nIn the latest edition of Double Down, the radio program on sputniknews.com with Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, Charlie Shrem, the Bitcoin advocate who co-founded the startup Bitinstant in 2011, notes that the debate reflects how emotion could be powerful than rationality.\n\n""As I see in this case, the miners are being rational. Roger has as much money as he wants to spend. He is not being rational. He is being emotional,” says Shrem on air. “He is just saying whatever he wants, doing whatever he wants. He is wasting half a million dollars of his own money per month - those were his words to me directly so I know that it is true. However, these miners run a business and business is everything. It\'s bad business to support Bitcoin Unlimited at this point and Roger can\'t prop up all of the miners for so long. The only reason that this certain group of Chinese miners that have 40 percent of the hash rate are still supporting Bitcoin Unlimited is because that is the Asian culture - when you give someone your word, you have to follow it through. But at some point, it becomes economically infeasible.""\n\nHe explained how the situation resulted in F2Pool\'s change of direction:\n\n""These guys can\'t continue to make money to run their business. So as it seems, one of the largest Chinese mining pool, F2Pool broke away from Bitcoin Unlimited and started signaling SegWit and he wasn\'t happy about it. He (F2Pool) said \'I don\'t have a choice: whether I like SegWit or not, it\'s not economically possible for me to continue supporting Bitcoin Unlimited. We\'ve had talks with our miners and users and they all want SegWit. Although I\'m not happy about it, I\'m now supporting Segregated Witness\' which is the Bitcoin Core development team. That\'s what\'s going to happen: slowly, all of these miners are going to fall over into Segregated Witness. There would be one or two holdouts but eventually, they\'ll all fall in line.""\n\nA successful adoption of SegWit will demonstrate the possibility of resolving technical challenges through debates and collaboration and by validating nodes. Its adoption has been touted to be one of the most important financial technology milestones of the decade if accepted collectively.\n\nHowever, going by the crux of the current situation, according to Shrem, the struggle between a group of Bitcoin miners whose incentives are not the same with the network\'s and the rest of the miners, users and nodes who keep rejecting them will continue until the right situation prevails.', 'The Cabinet of Antigua & Barbuda has instructed the Attorney General, Steadroy “Cutie” Benjamin to draft laws for the implementation of Bitcoin.\n\nThis, after a group connected with the Antigua Leisure & Gaming Association met with Cabinet, on Wednesday, to discuss and share knowledge and experience on a new method of transacting the sale of goods and services, which is known as the Bitcoin technology.\n\nThe Cabinet has agreed to place the country on the cutting edge of this new technology.\n\n“Here in Antigua & Barbuda we know we are always very much front and centre of new developments; we are leaders, trendsetters in the Caribbean,” Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs, EP Chet Greene said at the post-Cabinet briefing, yesterday.\n\nHe added that what is of interest to the country is the fact that “this new currency is immutable; you can always go and trace transactions, so in the context of allegations of our country being involved in tax havens, it allows for better traceability”.\n\n“The currency benefits us in Antigua & Barbuda in respect to our Internet gaming sector. It will allow us,the satisfaction needed as a jurisdiction in respect to questions that would be asked of us in the Global Environment,” Greene said.\n\nSeveral countries, including Korea and Japan, have already begun the process of recognising and regulating the use of the virtual currency, BitCoin, for business transactions, while other countries, such as Switzerland and Malta, are either already engaged in this technology or have given commitments to get onboard with this development.\n\nThe minister is encouraging the public to conduct online searches on BitCoin which came onstream in 2009, and has increased in value several times since it was patented.', 'South Korean bitcoin exchange Yapizon was hacked earlier this week, losing more than US$5 million worth of user funds and bitcoin.\n\nAccording to the exchange’s official statement translated by CCN, four hot wallets of the exchange were hacked by an unknown group of hackers. The Yapizon legal team noted that approximately 37 percent of user funds were hacked and exactly 3,816 bitcoins were stolen from the exchange.\n\nUsers of Yapizon outraged over the exchange’s decision to spread losses from the theft equally amongst all bitcoin accounts. Considering that the exchange lost 37 percent of its bitcoin reserves, the exchange announced its plans to deduct exactly 37 percent of user balances.\n\nYapizon’s deduction of funds across all user accounts remains highly controversial, due to the difference in the financial status of Bitfinex. In August, Bitfinex lost $72 million worth of bitcoin after a major hacking attack. To recover the funds of their investors, the exchange issued Bitfinex tokens, which the company purchased over time to compensate their traders. Ultimately, Bitfinex purchased all of the remaining Bitfinex tokens, effectively recovering the balances of every user affected by the hack.\n\nThe South Korean exchange is issuing a similar token to Bitfinex tokens called Fei, which would allow traders to reclaim their losses by obtaining company profits. According to the Yapizon management team, 1 percent of Fei is equivalent to 1 percent of Yapizon’s profit. Therefore, users will be able to recoup their funds as company profit in the long run.\n\nHowever, the calculations of Yapizon’s Fei distribution is not clear. The exchange stated that users will be credited with one token of Fei per $78 of loss. Therefore, a user who has lost $100,000 from the hack would be credited with $1,282 Fei tokens.\n\nYapizon further noted that the company generates around $1.8 million of profit per year. Thus, users would have to wait over two years to have their funds recovered. This time period is substantially longer than that of Bitfinex, which completely recovered the balances of users within eight months that was significantly larger than that of Yapizon, by at last 14x.\n\n“As seen in the security breach of Ethereum investment fund DAO that resulted in the loss of 3.6 million ETH and the hacking attack of Bitfinex which ultimately led to the loss of $70 million, Yapizon can certainly recover from the recent hacking attack. Yapizon entered the cryptocurrency industry four years ago and it is expanding services and operations rapidly across the region. From January to March of this year, Yapizon generated over $325,000 in profit and the company projects a total profit of $1.8 million by the end of 2017. If customers trust in Yapizon and its practices, the company believes it can make up for the losses of all customers relatively soon,” said the Yapizon team.\n\nAs of the now, the exchange remains closed to all users until further notice. The exchange stated that Fei tokens will be issued to users in the upcoming days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Here's a look at what we are focusing on in the bitcoin price this evening.\n\nSo we’re going to take a final look at the bitcoin price for this evening, and as part of this final analysis, attempt to put some levels together with which we can draw a profit from the market during the late US session, and beyond into the weekend.\n\nAction today has been similar to that which we’ve seen all week – price has jumped around in moves of all sorts of shapes and sizes, and we’ve managed to get in and out of the markets on a number of occasions on the back of this volatility.\n\nAs we noted this morning, from an intraday perspective, it doesn’t really matter if price goes up or down – so long as we see some movement. Sure, it’s nice to get some sustained upside momentum, as everyone’s happy when long term holdings appreciate, but it’s not necessary for us to make shorter term profits.\n\nSo, with this in mind, let’s get some things outlined for the session today, As ever, get a quick look at the chart below before we get started to get an idea of what happened during the session today, and where we are looking to get in and out of the markets according to our strategy rules as and when prices moves.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range in focus for this evening is defined by support to the downside at 1310 and resistance to the upside at 1328.

04/29/2017,"['CakeCodes’ BitMaker App rewards consumers with Bitcoin and Ethereum to try new products and perform additional small tasks for businesses. Thanks to cryptocurrencies, the face of the advertising industry is about to take a different form.\n\nCCN spoke to Simon Yu, co-founder and CEO of CakeCodes.\n\nCCN: In a nutshell what is CakeCodes’ BitMaker app all about?\n\nSimon Yu: BitMaker rewards users free bitcoins (and now Ethereum as well) when they try new games and apps. It’s a fun way for users to try cool new products and be rewarded free cryptocurrency in the process. We’re only on Android with no seed raise so far but we have over 700,000+ downloads and we have active users in 187 countries. What we’re doing is unique because, typically an average person can be exposed up to 5,000 ads a day but because there are so many ads being thrown at people’s faces, it’s not as effective. We’re letting users opt-in to trying new products for some free bitcoin and it’s been extremely popular and growing fast\n\nCCN: So what actually inspired this?\n\nSY: So two main reasons. 1) My cofounder and I believe that bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain has so much disruption potential and is extremely exciting. But before our app was launched, there was no way to acquire bitcoins unless you mine it (which is too complicated for an average person) and risk your money buying it. But because mining was too complicated and average people who didn’t know about bitcoin didn’t want to risk their money to buy bitcoin (due to negative press on silk road and exchanges being hacked) we figured we could create an easy way for users to earn bitcoin to get exposed to it.\n\n2) On the other side, there’s a huge potential in global advertising as it is a $600B industry, however, there are just too many advertisements floating around now that the dollars spent are extremely ineffective. The end goal of companies is to get users to try out their products (which there are lots of great products out there) but the money is going to media companies instead of the users themselves. We thought why not just let the users earn some money when they decide to try new products? It’s extremely simple and we proved there are millions of people out there who are willing to try new products if they get paid for their time making the advertisement spend extremely effective.\n\nCCN: Any challenges encountered so far?\n\nSY: Of course. The recent one was when the average transaction to send out bitcoin continued to increase, we thought we had to shut down because we were sending out payments for $0.00 and all of a sudden it increased to $0.48 per transaction. We were sending 13,000 transactions per week and this was a critical decision. But our team especially Calvin our CTO and founder, worked extremely quickly to redo our code so we could send payments for free again. We launched Ethereum as a result and selected two main bitcoin wallets so we can send payments with a low withdrawal limit.\n\nCCN: That’s very innovative on your part.\n\nSY: We work fast whenever there’s an issue :)\n\nSimon Yu: But whether it’s Hard Fork or Segwit we’re hoping something gets implemented fast to fix this issue. Bitcoin’s innovation and disruption come mainly from lowering transaction fees in our belief.\n\nCCN: Any success story you want to share?\n\nSY: Yes we’re extremely proud of the fact that we were able to acquire 700,000 users without raising a seed round of financing and have users in 187 countries makes us happy. We will be launching a campaign on Wefunder next month to allow anyone to own a stake in CakeCodes to help us disrupt traditional advertising and earn free cryptocurrency\n\nCCN: Tell our readers your future plans?\n\nSY: We’re hoping the funds will help us build an iOS app quickly, and we want to continue spreading our app globally as quickly as we can. We signed up to over 300 apps on our platform already since February 2017. There are 5 million apps out there in the market and we want to feature as many as we can.\n\nCCN: How much do you intend to raise and are you going the ICO route?\n\nSY: We are still debating the ICO route, but for now we’re going the traditional route. We have investors who are already part of our recent round including Bill Shihara, CEO of Bittrex\n\nCCN: And what’s your target?\n\nSY: We’re raising $1 million for our seed round and we’ll be using Wefunder for the public crowdfund, although we’re expecting to get most of the funds from private investors\n\nCCN: Any message for your fans, users and investors?\n\nSY: We’re extremely grateful for our early users and investors who have believed in our vision to help us get this far. Our idea was so different that when we first started, we didn’t get a lot of support from the general public.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While earnings, tax reform and a looming potential government shutdown held the front page of the financial news this past week, the alt-currency market had a newsworthy week itself.\n\nThe Chinese exchanges announced that it would charge a 0.2% fee on bitcoin transactions. Japan said it would recognize bitcoin as legal tender. But the biggest news may be that the previously-rejected Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF (COIN) might be back on the table again. The SEC has agreed to review its decision to reject what would be the first bitcoin ETF in the marketplace. While it’s not a done deal that it’ll be approved, it now seems more likely than not we’ll have a bitcoin ETF sooner rather than later. The price of bitcoin shot up in response hitting a new all-time high of just north of $1340. Bitcoin was just over $1000 at the beginning of April.\n\nAnother alt-currency also hit an all-time high this past week. Ethereum’s ether token topped $65. What is Ethereum you may ask? Ethereum, like bitcoin, is a blockchain network. It’s an open software platform that allows developers to build and run the programming code for applications. Ether is used to pay for services and fees on the Ethereum network but, like bitcoin, can be used as a tradeable currency.\n\nWhile the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF may be getting most of the cryptocurrency headlines, the SEC announced at nearly the same time that it has begun considering approval of an Ethereum ETF. The backers of the EtherIndex Ether Trust, which would issue the fund’s shares, believe they have enough in place to get it approved. And it may actually end up hitting the market first.\n\nSo how would an Ethereum ETF differ from a bitcoin ETF?\n\nPotential uses – While ether can be traded in the same way as bitcoin, the SEC notes in a statement that ether, unlike bitcoin, was not designed to be a pure store of value. It’s designed as a means of payment for activities on the Ethereum network.\n\n– While ether can be traded in the same way as bitcoin, the SEC notes in a statement that ether, unlike bitcoin, was not designed to be a pure store of value. It’s designed as a means of payment for activities on the Ethereum network. Regulation – Part of the reason that the Winklevoss ETF was originally rejected was its lack of regulatory oversight. Gemini, which ether trades on, is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. This type of regulation may give the SEC a degree of comfort that it may not have had with the bitcoin ETF.\n\n– Part of the reason that the Winklevoss ETF was originally rejected was its lack of regulatory oversight.

This type of regulation may give the SEC a degree of comfort that it may not have had with the bitcoin ETF. Corporate backing – At the end of February, a group of roughly 30 companies announced the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance whose goal is to create and develop the standards that will enable businesses to more easily use Ethereum as a means of tracking data and financial contracts. Some of the biggest names in the alliance include Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, Intel, Accenture, UBS and Thomson Reuters.\n\nAt this point, the Ethereum network looks like it’s better built for a number of wide ranging long-term applications. That’s good for the outlook for ether but bitcoin is further down the road as a cryptocurrency. The Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF also looks like it’s further along in the SEC approval process but don’t be surprised if it’s the Ethereum ETF that gets the nod first.', 'Spotify, the $8 billion music streaming service provider, which is projected to reach 100 million users and a $53 billion valuation by 2020, acquired Mediachain, a startup backed by leading venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, to simplify royalties utilizing bitcoin’s underpinning technology.\n\n\n\nIn March, Spotify found itself amidst legal troubles with its partnered musicians, record labels and producers over unpaid royalties. According to the announcement of the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), Spotify settled a $25 million deal and a $5 million penalty over unpaid and unmatched songs.\n\nUpon the settlement of the $30 million deal, Spotify’s Global Head of Communications and Public Policy Jonathan Prince admitted that while the company has been committed in compensating its musicians and publishers since its launch in October of 2008, tracking all of its registered songs streamed by tens of millions of users and distributing royalties accurately and proportionally has been difficult.\n\n“As we have said many times, we have always been committed to paying songwriters and publishers every penny. We appreciate the hard work of everyone at the NMPA to secure this agreement and we look forward to further collaboration with them as we build a comprehensive publishing administration system,” Prince stated.\n\nAt the time, NMPA President and CEO David Israelite emphasized that through the multimillion-dollar deal, music streaming service providers including Spotify will allocate more resources into compensating musicians and publishers transparently and properly. He further noted that NMPA and Spotify found the appropriate method of distributing royalties to music creators.\n\n“I am thrilled that through this agreement both independent and major publishers and songwriters will be able to get what is owed to them. We must continue to push digital services to properly pay for the musical works that fuel their businesses and after much work together, we have found a way for Spotify to quickly get royalties to the right people. I look forward to all NMPA members being paid what they are owed, and I am excited about the creation of a better process moving forward,” Israelite said.\n\nSpotify’s recent acquisition of Mediachain represents a large part of the vision established with NMPA. By utilizing blockchain technology, which is transparent, immutable and irrefutable, Spotify aims to develop and integrate a more fair platform for musicians and publishers. For this reason, Spotify acquired media-and-information-sharing-focused blockchain infrastructure provider Mediachain.\n\nThe Spotify development team explained that the engineers and developers of Mediachain will join Spotify in its New York offices to help co-build an efficient royalty-tracking platform specialized for Spotify.\n\nIn an official statement, Spotify announced:\n\n“Brooklyn-based Mediachain Labs has been the driving force behind the Mediachain project, a world-class blockchain research agenda and open source protocol to better manage data that is critical to the health of the music industry. The Mediachain team will join our New York City offices and help further Spotify’s journey towards a more fair, transparent and rewarding music industry for creators and rights owners.”\n\nNext year, in 2018, Spotify will officially launch an initial public offering (IPO) and take the company public. The acquisition of Mediachain and the Spotify team’s dedication to solve issues in regard to royalties and creator compensation, which could potentially emerge as a major financial setback in the future, demonstrate the company’s eagerness to justify its valuation to its investors and its presence in the music industry.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Not a good mix, as one recent criminal case out of Arizona has proven.\n\nA multi-agency federal task force raided local bitcoin trader, and anarchist blogger, Morpheus Titania’s apartment last week.\n\nCourt documents, available online in electronic court filings and first reported by CoinDesk, demonstrate that US Magistrate Michelle Burns ordered Costanzo to remain in custody until his trial after a hearing. Costanzo is considered a “serious flight risk” thanks to a long history of criminal conduct and “a record of prior failure to appear in court as ordered.”\n\nMorpheus, whose legal name is Thomas Mario Costanzo, was being held until his case was to be heard, but will remain in custody for longer.\n\nAccording to court records, he’s been charged with possession of three boxes of Winchester ammunition for an altogether 60 cartridges “in different calibers.” He denied ownership of the ammunition, but admitted they were in indeed his apartment, according to records, which did not say who owned them.\n\nThanks to a 2015 conviction in Maricopa County for a felony marijuana possession charge, Costanzo is not legally permitted to possess firearms or ammunition, and was therefore in violation of Arizona state law. Homeland Security Investigations steered a raid on April 20 of Costanzo’s Mesa apartment. However, it it did not have to do with his marijuana offenses nor illegal possession of guns and ammunition.\n\nThe warrant issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge David Duncan sought evidence, instead, that Costanzo may have operated as an “unlicensed money transmitting business,” – a license which requires one to go through an application process with government. Prosecutors also contend that Costanzo sold drugs and hid the profits from his operations.\n\nAgents could seize illegal drugs, Bitcoin records and financial documents, computers, cellphones and other items. Costanzo’s cell phone company received a search warrant to produce tracking information on his prior whereabouts.\n\nFreedom’s Phoenix, a conspiracy website run by Libertarian activist Ernest Hancock, published warrant records on Tuesday obtained by his radio show Freedom’s Phoenix, for whom Costanzo works as sales and marketing manager. Hancock said on air the two have been friends since 2003.\n\nPhotos from the raid in Mesa feature SWAT team members and other officers, as well as an armored vehicle, surrounding the Costanzo’s building. The apartment landlord said Costanzo has lived there alone for approximately one year. Costanzo often refers to himself online as one of the most prolific bitcoin traders in the area. Localbitcoins record show he has made more than 100 trades in four years, and has about a dozen reviews on the website.\n\nOn the bitcoin trading website, Costanzo’s profile reads, “Hey I’m Morpheus let’s get together and do Bitcoin :)”.\n\nHis feedback score is 100%, and the first activity on the account was nearly four years ago. He is trusted by 30+ people on the website. He has apparently been active in both Florida and Arizona.\n\n“Awesome to work with!” one of his customers wrote in a review.\n\nAnother wrote: “MorpheusTitania is a great trader! He went above and beyond on my last trade. There was a mix-up and he waited for over an hour before we could meet. You can trade with confidence with MorpheusTitania.” Costanzo thought highly of himself, as well.\n\n“Because of his rock-solid reputation, he is one of the biggest sellers in the Phoenix area,” Costanzo wrote about himself in 2014 on one of his web sites, Titanians.org. “Morpheus is now semi-retired as a bitcoin trader / entrepreneur.”\n\nCostanzo has been arrested numerous time and served eight months in prison in the mid-1980s after fleeing from police.\n\nHe received probation after a 2015 guilty plea for misdemeanor convictions in two marijuana cases, as well as a felony in the third, according to court records.\n\nIf Arizona had similar laws to the eight states and Washington D.C. where marijuana is legalized for adults 21 and older, Costanzo would never have been charged and convicted of possession three times, nor been stripped of his gun rights. According to local Homeland Security spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe tells New Times, the investigation is “open and active”.\n\nThis is the second time in the past month Arizona has made Bitcoin and blockchain headlines. The Senate of the state of Arizona recently passed the bill, HB 2417, which was introduced by state representative Jeff Weninger on 6 February, 2017. The bill passed with a vote of 28-1 where it was then passed along to Arizona’s governor Doug Ducey.\n\n“Smart contracts may exist in commerce,” reads the bill. “A contract relating to a transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely because that contract contains a smart contract term.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While there are many different methods for evaluating the price of bitcoin, fundamental analysis may be the most integral for figuring out its true value.\n\nFundamental analysis is the evaluation of economic, financial and other key variables, known as fundamentals, to determine a security\'s true value. This differs from technical analysis (the counterpart to fundamental analysis) in that the former is more interested in looking at a security\'s price movements to make better-informed decisions.\n\nWhen evaluating bitcoin, though, investors are keen to evaluate key aspects of the cryptocurrency\'s underlying technology, for example, how its scaling challenges might affect the digital currency\'s value.\n\nAfter all, if the digital currency\'s transactions grow costly and time-consuming on account of block size limitations, this could reduce demand, in turn lowering the price.\n\nLaying the foundation\n\nWhile investors use fundamental analysis to evaluate different asset classes, such as equities and fiat currencies, several analysts assert that using this approach to evaluate bitcoin is more complex.\n\nFor instance, investors can evaluate a company\'s stock by looking at certain items on its balance sheet, but bitcoin does not produce revenue or earnings numbers.\n\nJacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to this situation, telling CoinDesk: ""It\'s hard to derive an even remotely precise valuation for bitcoin from future cashflows"", the way you can for other assets such as General Motors stock.\n\nAs a result, traders interested in conducting fundamental analysis on bitcoin have developed ""a whole new set of metrics,"" according to Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare.\n\nHowever, even though bitcoin has been described as a new asset class, the same rules that apply to fiat currencies also apply to cryptocurrencies, said Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management. ""All the laws of economics apply – in full – to cryptocurrencies,"" he said.\n\nAs a result, he emphasized that the starting point for all fundamental analysis should be the supply and demand that drives prices.\n\nKey role of demand\n\nSeveral variables affect bitcoin demand, including user adoption, transaction activity and trading.\n\nMany analysts noted the importance of user adoption, which is crucial to a cryptocurrency\'s long-term viability. As for what drives user adoption, the analysts said money can have many uses. At its most basic level, money is a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account.\n\nOutside of small circles, bitcoin has never really been used as a unit of account, said Enneking.\n\nBut bitcoin has managed to gain significant traction as a medium of exchange. Hundreds of companies – including eBay and PayPal – have agreed to accept the digital currency since its inception in 2009.\n\nIn addition, the number of confirmed transactions per day has generally followed a steady, upward trend, according to data from Blockchain. Transactions started surging in early 2012, rising from more than 7,000 per day at the start of April 2012 to more than 300,000 per day now.\n\nWhile this data is informative, Eliosoff asserted that it\'s not the best indicator, because many blockchain transactions are ""generated by automated systems and don\'t represent economic activity, [especially] on scalable chains with low fees.""\n\nInstead, traders must figure out which transactions are an actual person sending to or accepting from another person.\n\nBut as bitcoin obtains more widespread adoption and retailers aren\'t seeing increasing sales via bitcoin, there\'s been a major shift in focusing on the cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange and to a store of value, concluded Enneking.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, said similar things, telling CoinDesk that the extent to which bitcoin is perceived as a store of value is a major driver of the digital currency\'s price.\n\nKey role of supply\n\nWhile demand for bitcoin can be a complex study, supply is a bit more straightforward.\n\nThe bitcoin protocol limits the total number of units at 21 million, and 16.3m bitcoins were in circulation at the time of reporting. Further, the rate of new supply is also determined by the bitcoin protocol. This contrasts sharply with the traditional monetary system, in which central banks have the ability to print money whenever they want.\n\nHowever, there are some caveats that affect bitcoin\'s supply.\n\nFor starters, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, supposedly holds roughly 1.1m bitcoins which have not moved since they were mined. And many people in the bitcoin community think they won\'t ever be, seeing these coins as ""dead bitcoins."" Past that, it is impossible to know just how many ""dead bitcoins"" there really are, noted Enneking.\n\nThat\'s because for the first several years of bitcoin\'s existence, units of the digital currency didn\'t have much monetary value. When the price began moving upward, stories of people throwing away hard drives that held the private keys for their bitcoins were commonplace.\n\nMajor events\n\nAnalysts also noted the key role major events play in determining the price of bitcoin. These incidents are sometimes directly related to bitcoin, such as the hack of a major exchange, or a setback in the community\'s push to solve the scaling dilemma.\n\nHowever, Enneking told CoinDesk:\n\n""The events that impacted bitcoin prices the most were non-bitcoin events like Cyprus and Greece.""\n\nBitMEX\'s Hayes also spoke to the importance of macroeconomic events, emphasizing that ones fueling instability usually bolster alternative assets like bitcoin.\n\nARK Invest\'s Chris Burniske agreed. During times of economic turmoil, bitcoin can act as a ""disaster hedge,"" he said.\n\nKey considerations\n\nBy leveraging fundamental analysis, bitcoin traders can get a better sense of the cryptocurrency\'s true value and get a better sense of whether it\'s a good time to buy or sell.\n\nHowever, some analysts criticize fundamental analysis because it reflects more what a security should be worth than what its actual market price is. Relying too much on fundamental analysis, without also using technical analysis, could cause a trader to buy or sell at a less-than-ideal time, they said.\n\nTo manage this risk, bitcoin traders can combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis. For example, a fundamental analyst might look at several indicators of demand, concluding that bitcoin is underbought, and then leverage technical analysis by reading charts to find the best entry point.\n\nAlternatively, a trader might use technical analysis to determine that it\'s a good time to sell, and then leverage fundamental analysis to confirm this view by looking at key drivers of demand.\n\nChart analysis image via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Not only are they looking at bitcoin and altcoin prices, but app developers are doing so as well. Stockfolio, a rather popular app among mainstream traders, added bitcoin price support. Additionally, they now also list some of the top altcoins. An interesting decision that may bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream.\n\nEvery time a major app adds cryptocurrency support, there is cause for celebration A lot of people on the planet remain unaware of bitcoin and altcoins. In some cases, that is due to sheer ignorance. On the other hand, there is very little mainstream attention for cryptocurrency as a whole. It is up to individual trading apps to change all of that.\n\nA Bold Move By The Stockfolio Team\n\nStockfolio, an application exclusively available on OSX, has done exactly that. Users who update their client will now have access to cryptocurrency information as well. Keeping tabs on the Bitcoin price is now a possibility, as well as the value of prominent altcoins. It is interesting to see investment apps pay attention to cryptocurrency at this point in time.\n\nOne caveat is how the app costs US$11.99. That is a bit of a steep price for an investment application. Then again, major traders need apps like this to keep track of their stock portfolio. At this rate, bitcoin may become part of these portfolios as well. Diversification remains key, as always. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have become quite popular investment vehicles as of late as well.\n\nAs of right now, two altcoins are supported by Stockfolio. Both Ethereum and Litecoin prices are tracked in real-time. Moreover, there is also a built-in news feed for cryptocurrency news. All things considered, the Stockfolio app adds the necessary tools to keep tabs on cryptocurrency. Whether or not traders will invest in this market, remains to be seen.\n\nIt is good to see Apple approve these app updates related to cryptocurrency. The technology giant has a bit of a rocky history when it comes to bitcoin and altcoins. However, it appears the situation is slowly improving. It is not unlikely more financial apps will focus on cryptocurrency support in the future.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

And, I expect next week will be even more so. I will give a brief rundown of many of the more actively traded coins, ending with my favorite of the day.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nETCUSD\n\nThis sleeper has rallied hard all week. She got past the $4 mark, but is staring at a 5th arc at ~ $5.70. This was a great catch for those traders who at least doubled their money in a week. That is not an easy thing to do.\n\nREPUSD\n\nAnother sleeper which sprang to life several days ago like the alien spacecraft in “Independence Day” when the mother ship approached. Like ETCUSD however, she is now facing a 5th arc overhead (in the $17 area). If she can cross that resistance, the next larger target will be considerably higher.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nMonero\n\nLike the two preceding coins, this coin also ended a long period of consolidation and advanced strong to a 3rd arc, where it is currently sitting. It may take a bit of time for this coin to get through the arcs, but when it does, the 5th arc is all the way out to $40 or so. This could double in the near future.\n\nZECUSD\n\nI am sounding like a broken record now. ZECUSD also came to life several day ago and has traversed a 3rd arc pair. An energy point beckons and I am of the opinion that another advance is on the horizon. A move from $85 to $125 is clearly a possibility. It may take a few weeks to get there.\n\nXRPUSD\n\nRipple is a mystery. It is the only coin that has so far refused to join the party even though it has a bit of ‘establishment credentials’ (maybe those credentials are the problem?). In any case, the coin seems to have awoken. A (wide) 2nd arc pair is standing in the way of a rapid advance, but once it clears that arc pair there will be A LOT of unimpeded room to the upside, IF IT CHOOSES TO TAKE IT.\n\nXBTUSD\n\nBitcoin disregarded my published concern about a double top last week and went on to make a new ATH. My previous forecast/target was for a run to $1400-$1440. It now seems that $1400 is the area it will hit 5th arc resistance.\n\nLitecoin\n\nAs my regular readers will know, I was very bullish litecoin last week, with a $15 target. Since hitting that target last week, the coin has been consolidating. It has crossed a 3rd arc pair and is waiting for a kick in the pants to move to the 5th arc at ~ $24. My guess is that move will begin sometime this week.\n\nETHUSD\n\nEthereum made some of our community a ton of cash this week, and is my favorite trade of the week. It moved sharply higher from $50 to $65. As discussed in yesterday’s article, the smaller setup I was using seems to have needed being re-sized, because pricetime was growing past its constraints. So, I am now using the next-larger sized setup.\n\nAs of this writing, price has closed at the 2nd arc of the 3rd pair and has just opened a bit higher. Barring an unexpected reversal (unexpected but certainly possible) this is looking great. The 5th arc pair is substantially higher. I think we will see $100 much sooner than seemed possible just a week ago. Time will tell.\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgment.

04/30/2017,"['“We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land… we must think big and dream even bigger…\n\nDo not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America…\n\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow…\n\nSo to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again.” President Trump’s promise to the American People at his inaugural address on January 20th 2017.\n\nChairman, Commissioners, SEC personnel, Ladies and Gentlemen. A new force has risen in the world, code based technological innovation. It promises to transform almost all industries, from village fishing to the towers of banking. Reports say billions will be saved, others stupendously claim trillion dollar industries will be created.\n\n“We are on the brink of yet another industrial revolution. One that has the potential, once again, fundamentally to transform the structure of the global economy, and the way we live our lives.” Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the British Exchequer, at the inaugural International FinTech Conference in London.\n\nAs a journalist in this space, I’ve detailed some of these potential transformations. Meet Candy, an IBM blockchain and internet of things (IoT) demo. You can get a sort of online code ticket organized through the blockchain, give it to Candy, which then uses sensors, data analytics, speech recognition, and other advances in computer science, to dispense some candy.\n\n“Towards the end of the Fair there was a girl in her twenties who approached the booth to know what it was all about. She didn’t want sweets, she just wanted to chat. When Candy learned the girl didn’t like sweets, Candy expressed her feelings. “You don’t like candy… so you don’t like me? You make me feel sad, I think I’m going to cry.” Interestingly the girl ended up apologizing for not liking candy and they became friends.”\n\nIgor Ramos, Senior Software Engineer at IBM says: “Although it sounds like science fiction, it isn’t, it’s real and here.” As you might appreciate, this is a demo. It’s not showing a product, but showcasing, in effect, a specialized robot and the tools that built it.\n\n“In view of the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the project plans to install battery storage units within the grid in order to keep the lights on at least temporarily during the next storm-related emergency.”\n\nThat’s what Siemens said when announcing they are working with a new start-up, LO3 Energy, to test energy re-sale from solar powered microgrid through ethereum’s public blockchain. Siemen says the ethereum (eth or ether) blockchain:\n\n“Can ensure that users receive original replacement parts, because it can seamlessly retrace a part’s journey back to its origins with the help of an RFID chip and the blockchain – one of many potentially interesting applications for Siemens.”\n\nThere are many other eth based projects which would probably require a book to detail. So perhaps it would be easier to explain just what exactly is ethereum.\n\nEthereum, The Code\n\nEthereum uses smart contracts, which is a fancy way of saying code. But it does so in a unique manner. Code is usually held in your own machine, or a server, but for ethereum, the same exact code is held in around 10,000 machines, otherwise known as nodes.\n\nThis means no one can change it, making it very useful for record keeping, from energy sale, to health records, to fishing supplies to whatever else you can imagine. One such use of record keeping is a unique code string which is produced through complex cryptographic maths to ensure that you alone have a copy of it. That copy is called one eth or ethereum. It can’t be duplicated, but it can easily move.\n\nThe way it moves is through those 10,000 machines which obey the rules of complex open source code. Through cryptomaths, you (or rather a code software called a wallet) tells them you have ten eth and want to send it to Alice, the machine verifies it, and then the eth moves in around 15 seconds with the transaction finalized in a way that can’t be reversed.\n\nThe Coded Machines\n\nThis is the simple application. A far more interesting application is the fact that code itself, the smart contract, can do the above too, with no human intervention, automatically. You just write a piece of code that lays out the rules of how the code has to use the eth. You then send this code to the 10,000 machines who verify and ensure that it does exactly what you coded and that it uses the eth in exactly the manner you code ordered.\n\nThis has two interesting applications. First of all, it allows physical machines, like a car, or some factory machine, to hold eth in a way that no one can steal or make it do something other than what you coded. That is, it allows machines to autonomously act by sending and receiving value in a completely transparent fraud proof manner with no human intervention.\n\nThe second interesting application is that it turns static money into dynamic code. In this new world, money doesn’t just move from a to b. Money, instead, can analyze all sorts of data, can use artificial intelligence, can operate under complex rules which it fully obeys, even can run its own business with no or minimal human involvement.\n\nInnovation is happening in many areas, with an interesting one being the use of eth’s public blockchain to act as a glue that joins together the forces of freelancers in a company with no CEOs or Board of Directors as all the freelancers in combination would be the CEO or Board of Directors.\n\nI’ll leave it to your imagination to further wonder how this technology could be used. Suffices to say, almost all household brands, as diverse as JP Morgan and the oil giant BP, have formed an alliance in support of ethereum’s platform.\n\nIn this context, hopefully, it won’t take much imagination to see why so many want a piece of this code called eth. The digital currencies market has surpassed $30 billion, a valuation higher than many listed companies. Eth itself is currently valued at $5 billion after just one year. From China to America, Britain and the rest, many see it as the future.\n\nUnderlying Utility\n\nEth, the unduplicable piece of code itself, is used for many projects and applications, such as some we’ve briefly highlighted above. Thus giving it an underlying utility. Moreover, not much different from a stock, its price tends to react dependent on how the network at large is doing.\n\nIf utility is increased, say through the announcement of a new project or alliance/consortium, then its price tends to increase, just as stocks would increase if sales increase. Conversely, if its use is lacking or there’s bad news related to the network itself or one of the projects, then price tends to react accordingly.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between the number of eth transactions and its price, suggesting that the market, while speculative as all markets, is also acting objectively. In the one year that I have been following ethereum, its price has behaved in an expected manner. Suggesting that there is no manipulation or, if there is any, then it is very limited as otherwise someone would have noticed some discrepancy somewhere.\n\nMost Eth Trading is on Regulated Exchanges\n\nTrading volumes necessarily change up and down, but looking at them at the time of writing, Coinbase, an American regulated exchange, handles most of the eth/usd volume, currently standing at around 105,000 eth per day according to Cryptowatch. Kraken, another eth exchange, handles around 75,000 eth a day. Bitfinex is going through some considerable difficulties due to being shut out of the banking system. Any volume they currently handle (around 65k), therefore, is probably individuals getting out or probably temporary arbitrage.\n\nHowever, that Bitfinex handles any volume at all is partly, if not largely, the fault of regulators and, in this case, CFTC specifically. They have denied full margins and futures to regulated exchanges such as Coinbase, therefore forcing the market to unregulated exchanges as margins and futures are very much necessary for traders.\n\nNonetheless, for eth/fiat pairs, the majority of trading by far still happens on regulated exchanges which account for a daily volume of around 200,000 eth with the only other unregulated eth exchange for eth/fiat pairs that has any significant volume besides Bitfinex, is BTC-e which handles only 25,000, around 10%.\n\nThis wasn’t always the case because when eth launched the infrastructure wasn’t quite in place (Coinbase added eth around summer 2016). Therefore, most of the trading happened in an unregulated exchange which allows for digital currencies to be traded against bitcoin, rather than fiat currencies such as dollars or euros. That exchange, Poloniex, today accounts for around 40% of eth trading, probably due to inertia and probably because it offers margins.\n\nAs ethereum has grown in market cap with a shift in attitude, from eth/btc to eth/usd, occurring sometime last year after Coinbase added eth, the trend has been a movement away from Poloniex (which last year accounted for almost 100% of eth trading) and to other exchanges, primarily Coinbase, but also Kraken.\n\nThat trend is likely to continue, especially as now Coinbase has announced they are to offer margins for traders that handle $5 million or more in volume. Overall, therefore, the majority of trading for eth/fiat and a very considerable amount of overall trading occurs on regulated exchanges, making any manipulation very difficult and detectable.\n\nThe Public Interest\n\nThe second part for which SEC requires comments is “protecting the public.” This is a general, catch-all, subjective phrase that can mean anything. If we are to be objective, Congress’ intention must have been protecting the public from fraud, or some other criminal activity, or deception. It certainly can’t mean protecting the public from volatility or natural risk that comes with all investments, including the fact that all of it can be lost.\n\nStock listed companies have gone bankrupt. The stock market has crashed. Can ethereum go to zero? It’s possible, in the same way it’s possible America could collapse. However, I’d put the chances of ethereum reaching zero in the foreseeable future at around zero.\n\nThe network is literally just code. There may, of course, be difficulties, but code is malleable and easily fixable. We saw, for example, with the Slockit DAO, that around $250 million, as valued at the time, was stolen. However, for the first time in history, this theft was fully prevented by a simple code upgrade.\n\nHundreds of millions were also stolen from the SWIFT network, but they were unable to fully recover them as far as I can recall from memory. In my view, therefore, ethereum is not so risky for the entire value to be lost.\n\nOf course it’s possible, in the same way it’s possible the sun might not rise or the moon might fall, but if we are to deal with objective matters, such as probabilities, I find it extremely unlikely ethereum would just completely lose value in a very sudden manner. If it ever does, it would probably be a slow and gradual loss of interest by investors who, since they are the ones losing interest, would have notice of it.\n\nThat doesn’t mean some bug might not be found, but it’s code. Such bug would most likely be very quickly fixed with the entire event very temporary and perhaps with no effect on the price at all.\n\nI don’t think, however, there can be a bug which basically sends the network down to zero because much of ethereum is conceptual and conceptually it does work and has been working for now almost a decade. It’s an invention, you know airplanes just work or don’t, cars just work. You can’t uninvent them – well, as long as we’re staying within probabilities.\n\nAs for volatility, the currency is volatile, but that volatility tends to be upwards on medium to long time frames. Very much similar to stocks which for traders are very volatile as anyone can see by going to wallstreetbets, but in a medium-long time frame tend upwards.\n\nOne aspect the SEC might be worried about may be the loss or theft of private keys. As stated earlier, we have already seen such theft successfully resolved, but even if that option was not used, keys are not necessarily easy to lose or steal.\n\nThe easy analogy here is to gold. If one drops a neckless then that might be lost. If one’s home is not secured, then it might be stolen. If you are a bank, then of course you’ll use underground vaults with armed guards.\n\nSimilarly, one might be reckless with one or two eth. Perhaps they might not very securely hold 100 eth. But for Coinbase, which is to act as custodian for the ETF, I think the measures they take are not very much different from an underground vault with armed guards.\n\nThe exchange has never been hacked. It’s two co-founders came from the famous Silicon Valley based Ycombinators, an incubator that is in extremely high demand thus has fierce competition. The exchange was regulated from inception and generally has been very professional.\n\nThey are the first port for most who want to buy eth, with the exchange having some ten million accounts if memory serves me well. They also have a service which they do call vault.\n\nNow, of course it is possible they could nonetheless be stolen, but as far as probabilities go I’d put them around the same level as a theft of the Bank of England’s gold. Moreover, if the latter happened, they might be able to get away with it. For eth, as we saw with the Slockit DAO, and although of course it’s not guaranteed, but, eth does, if so designed, have an ultimate fail save mechanism against thefts of huge scale.\n\nThe flip side of public interest needs to also be considered. Would the public benefit from new innovative activity that increases productivity while lowering costs? Is it in the interest of the public to reward innovators and encourage entrepreneurs to make productive use of capital so as to increase and encourage growth?\n\nThe public, including giant household companies, have clearly a significant interest in this technology and are investing in its ecosystem because they see many benefits. I would, therefore, strongly argue that the public’s interest is served far more by listing, rather than denying, this ETF.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nThe invention of ethereum has opened a new world of opportunities and has energized a new generation which looks forward to building a better world. A generation which, in the case of ethereum, is overall responsible, scientifically minded, politically diverse, pragmatic and grounded.\n\nThe monetary uses of this technology are just one aspect with its industrial uses perhaps far more numerous. From supply lines to fancy dresses, social networks to artificial intelligence. Just the applications we can see and are being deployed are so many, let alone what we have not yet thought of.\n\nThe innovative work of many in this space, from start-ups to giant tech companies such as IBM and Microsoft, is what makes America, America and is one of the great success stories of this nation.\n\nThe SEC, with this ETF application, is being invited to celebrate this great American success story. I’d urge the SEC to do so and to let people dream of a new future and to take part in it. To let them be inspired. To welcome innovation. And to bring optimism to this great nation.\n\nOr they’ll just leave to Britain and other more welcoming jurisdictions while at the same time the best of a new generation concludes that American regulators are standing in the way of innovation for no good reason. A generation which is driving forward the future.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'On April 29, the Bitcoin mempool, the holding area for unconfirmed and pending transactions, recorded more than 82,000 transactions. Most transactions were delayed for up to 48 hours.\n\nWhen a Bitcoin transaction is signed and sent to the network, it is first verified by the Bitcoin network’s nodes. Once the transaction successfully passes the first stage of verification, it then sits on the mempool awaiting for miner confirmation. After several confirmations from Bitcoin miners, the transaction is broadcasted to the public Blockchain of Bitcoin.\n\nDuring the second verification phase, miners prioritize transactions with high fees. In order to have transactions confirmed faster, transaction initiators attach higher fees to incentivize the miners. Even though a transaction with a higher fee is initiated long after a group of transactions with lower fees, miners tend to prioritize the transaction with a higher fee and broadcast it to the network.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin’s block size is capped at one MB. According to Blockchain.info, the average block size as of April 29 is 927 KB, which is extremely close to the maximum capacity of Bitcoin’s one MB block size cap.\n\nThe Fee Market in Bitcoin - what it is like\n\nThe increasing size of Bitcoin blocks are leading to a larger amount of delayed transactions stuck in the Bitcoin mempool and the growth of the fee market. In Bitcoin, fee market is referred to an ecosystem wherein users compete to add higher fees to have their transactions confirmed at a faster rate.\n\nUntil a Bitcoin scaling solution such as Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness, Andrew Lee’s Extension Blocks and Bitcoin Unlimited is activated to increase the capacity of the Bitcoin Blockchain, the fee market will continue to exist.\n\nTo ensure that the recipient of the transaction does not suffer from long confirmation period that could range up to 72 hours, it is important to utilize Bitcoin wallet platforms with appropriate fee estimation features.\n\nWorld’s most popular Bitcoin wallet platform\n\nBlockchain, the world’s most popular Bitcoin wallet platform with over 12 mln users, have an accurate fee estimation feature which allows users to predict when the transaction will be confirmed.\n\nFor instance, when a fee is attached, Blockchain provides its users a certain time period, such as 10 minutes one hour, until the first confirmation is secured. Once the first confirmation is secured, it will take approximately 10 minutes for additional confirmations. On Blockchain, three confirmations is the standard for all users.\n\nThere are various innovative platforms such as 21 Inc’s Bitcoin Fees that allows users to find the optimal transaction fee for their transactions. Since the optimal transaction fee could vary depending on many variables such as the size of the transaction, 21 Fees note that 140 satoshis/byte is the optimal fee for Bitcoin transactions.\n\nOn average, the Bitcoin transaction size is 226 bytes. Thus, a $0.4 fee would allow a user to secure its first confirmation within 10 minutes.\n\nSamourai Wallet, a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet platform, is currently working to release the full version of its application that features Peter Todd’s replace-by-fee function, which allows recipients to add fees on top of the initial fee attached by the sender to speed up the confirmation process.', 'Antigua & Barbuda might go “full bitcoin” and accept the digital currency for government services.\n\nThe Cabinet of Antigua & Barbuda instructed the Attorney General, Steadroy “Cutie” Benjamin, to draft news laws for the possible implementation of Bitcoin throughout the various level of government on the twin island nation, which include numerous smaller islands.\n\nThe move comes after the Cabinet met with an Antigua Leisure & Gaming Association on Wednesday, to discuss the benefits of using Bitcoin on Antigua. The Cabinet, apparently seeing an opportunity to put Antigua ahead of the curve on this new technology, made the move.\n\n“Here in Antigua & Barbuda we know we are always very much front and centre of new developments; we are leaders, trendsetters in the Caribbean,” Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs, EP Chet Greene said at the post-Cabinet briefing.\n\nThat “this new currency is immutable, [and] you can always go and trace transactions; so, in the context of allegations of our country being involved in tax havens, it allows for better traceability”, contended Minister Greene.\n\nThe minister added: “The currency benefits us in Antigua & Barbuda in respect to our Internet gaming sector. It will allow us the satisfaction needed as a jurisdiction in respect to questions that would be asked of us in the Global Environment.”\n\nParticularly, the minister is referring to the Caribbean’s reputation as a global hub for money laundering, especially after U.S. led lawsuits put an end to old school “Swiss bank account practices” in Switzerland and Austria.\n\nThe minister has encouraged the public to conduct online searches on Bitcoin to learn more about the digital currency.\n\nAntigua hosted the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Week and Symposium where Prime Minister Gaston Browne delivered the feature address at the opening ceremony. The 15th Caribbean Ministerial Strategic ICT Seminar focussed on ICT in financial services, and explored, among other things, the use of cryptocurrencies towards innovation in the region’s ICT development.\n\nThe gaming mogul who might have edged the cabinet towards their decision is likely Calvin Ayre, who has long championed the benefits of Bitcoin for the island.\n\nAyre, who reportedly is working with self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright made a similar pitch in October at a sod turning ceremony for a $25 million USD call center to operate in Antigua. “I’m a major enthusiast and advocate of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology,” he said at the time. “I see a growing convergence to bitcoin online gaming…and progressive countries like Antigua are poised to take advantage of this convergence by developing a truly global service industry.”\n\nHe said cryptocurrency represented “[a] vast untapped potential in the Antiguan market” for BPO firms.\n\nThe mogul added: “A similar phenomenon happened in Manila [Philippines] where I was one of the first people to open a BPO offering service to the online gaming industry, and today, just about all the major online gaming companies … have established their BPO operations there.”\n\nOn CalvinAyre.com, Hon. Melford Nicholas, Minister of Information Technology, Telecom & BROA Antigua and Barbuda, echoed Mr. Ayre’s vision for cryptocurrency in Antigua & Barbuda.\n\n“It is absolute a delight for us here. I, too, from the minister responsible for information technology, [am] responsible for the bitcoin work and to see cryptocurrency as it emerges and put Antigua to the forefront of this development. So I’m delighted. I welcome this development and I’m looking forward for the project’s implementation in every step,” he said.\n\nMr. Ayre has become a large figure on the island thanks to its controversial Citizenship-by-Investment program, a common scheme in the Caribbean for the small countries there to create additional income for government services.\n\nWell-known Bitcoin entrepreneur Roger Ver launched a website called Passport for Bitcoin, which helped individuals buy citizenship for the cypto-currency on the island of St. Kitts, but the island quickly ensured the service was shut down and made a statement that it did not accept Bitcoin for Citizenship.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has had its eye on Antigua and Barbuda. “Antigua and Barbuda is an offshore center which continues to be vulnerable to money laundering and other financial crime,” writes the Bureau of Narcotics and Law Enforcement in the U.S. State department. “Its relatively large financial sector and internet gaming industry add to its susceptibility. According to the Antiguan Office of National Drug Control and Money Laundering Policy (AONDCP), the collaborative efforts between Antigua and Barbuda and United States law enforcement agencies have brought about a decrease in drug trafficking activity.\n\nFeatured image of Antigua Port from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The US is known to the vast majority of the world as the global financial and economic powerhouse. Yet, the US holds the largest amount of external debt at $19.9 trillion. The UK, France and Germany fall behind the US respectively as the second, third and fourth largest debt holders in the world.\n\nSince mid-2016, investors and traders in the largest bitcoin exchange markets including US, China and Japan began to perceive bitcoin as a safe haven asset and wealth management product (WMP). Since then, bitcoin has been the go-to asset for avoiding economic uncertainty and financial instability.\n\nConceptually, the debt of the US carries a low level of importance to both the country and the rest of the world due to the US government and its economy’s impact to the global economy and financial system. As the holder of the world’s largest reserve currency, at times of economic and financial instability, the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the US, rely on its ability to print massive amounts of money to keep the country’s economy afloat.\n\nBut, such strategy is leading to the build up of perhaps the largest bubble in modern history; the bubble of the central banks and the global financial system.\n\nRealistically, financial systems of countries are overseen, manipulated and controlled by their respective governments. Thus, similar to the attempts of Greece in 2015, central banks and regulators could impose harsh regulations or policies such as a haircut to seize funds from private investors, individuals and businesses through private banks.\n\nSimply put, funds or money stored in bank accounts and even fiat money or cash carry no actual value that is wholly dependent on the market. Their value is completely based on the governing party and its central bank. As seen in the decline of the British pound, the value of a currency could plunge in short period of time due to political conflicts and financial disagreements.\n\nAt this rate, fiat money is approaching its decline and the emergence of a decentralized and market-based currency such as bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies that hold the philosophy of bitcoin could threaten the global financial system. The US is able to hold on to massive amounts of debt due to their leverage over the global economy and financial system. If it loses its leverage due to a complete restructuring of the financial system as a result of the popularization of bitcoin or other decentralized stores of value, the country could be placed under serious economic trouble.\n\nFor instance, the gross debt of the Australian government in 2007 was valued to be $53.25 billion. Today, the debt of Australia is $484.6 billion. Within a decade, the national debt of Australia increased by over 9x, as seen in the chart below.\n\nBitcoin is a practical and viable hedge against debt-based economies because its value solely depends on its market. Since bitcoin is decentralized by nature and has a fixed monetary supply, the value of bitcoin is decided by a simple concept of supply and demand. But, since the supply of bitcoin is fixed, as long the demand for bitcoin continues to increase, the value of bitcoin will proportionally surge.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The skyrocketing prices of bitcoins should not come as a surprise to those familiar with the concept of crypto currency. As an electronic payment system, one bitcoin is now more expensive than one ounce of gold. Surprising, isn’t it?\n\nWhile prices of gold has been falling, the value of this digital currency is booming. This rise can be attributed to the recent series of major worldwide events such as Brexit and the election of the new US president. As Britain decided to leave the European Union, bitcoin prices more than doubled due to the uncertainty sensed by traditional financial markets. Similarly, in the US bitcoin worth increased despite faltering global stock markets..\n\nThe volatility of prices is also a result of the fluctuation in Bitcoin’s perceived value. The reason for this fluctuation is due to the perceived store value of Bitcoins against fiat currencies. While bitcoin has properties similar to that of gold, it is governed by a design decided by the developers of the core technology to limit its production to a fixed amount. This differs markedly from fiat currency, which is managed by governments desiring to maintain low inflation, high employment, and satisfactory growth through investment in capital resources. However, as economies built with fiat currencies show signs of strength or weakness, investors may allocate more or less of their assets into Bitcoin.\n\nThe mining process that generates bitcoins using computer processing has also significantly reduced, cutting rewards for bitcoin mining by half. This decrease in supply has resulted in an increase in prices as per the fundamental principles of Economics. Yet, bitcoin developers have assessed the price surge to last a short time, forecasting a downward trend in the prices over the long term.\n\nThe bitcoin community perceives that the failure is due to the lack of important institutions involved in the use of this new and decentralized form of currency. Investors too have turned against the currency because of concerns over a concept called “hard fork” which would break bitcoin into two different currencies: bitcoin and bitcoin unlimited. Bitcoin transactions are accumulated into blocks. Currently, the maximum is one-megabyte for processing batches of transactions. While some industries want to increase the size with the increase in network capacity, others perceive this as unsafe. This rift can cause a split or hard fork in the currency.\n\nMoreover, some understand the recent rise of bitcoin due to the removal of high value bank notes in India and Venezuela as well as the significant devaluation of Chinese currency Yuan. As the Yuan depreciates, investors will consider investing in assets which can preserve value and hedge risks.\n\nIn terms of technicality, the currency requires a redesign of its transaction limits. Bitcoins can only handle about 7 transactions per seconds compared to Visa which can tolerate many thousands. Researchers agree that the capacity could be raised up to 27 transactions per second.\n\nOther reasons include factors such as fees, perception of legitimacy and stability of the exchanges. News about security breaches make investors react. Bitcoin can also become volatile when the Bitcoin community exposes security vulnerabilities in an effort to produce massive open source responses in the form of security fixes.', 'A 32-year-old Brazilian woman was recently rescued by the Civil Police on the east side of São Paulo, Brazil. The woman, married to a bitcoin businessman, was kidnapped in Florianopolis on Wednesday. The ransom was demanded in bitcoin and another unnamed cryptocurrency, according to local publication Diário Catarinense.\n\nThe kidnappers approached the victim right after she dropped her daughter off at school, 50 meters away from where she lives. While on their way to the city, they kidnappers contacted the victim’s husband demanding the ransom, sending him a video of victim in which she said she didn’t know where she and that was being kidnapped.\n\nAccording to Anselmo Cruz, the officer in charge of the investigation from Deic, a criminal investigation unit, this is the first time kidnappers in Brazil demand a cryptocurrency ransom. Access to bitcoin, according to the police, would be given by the victim’s husband.\n\nIn a translated Statement, Mr. Cruz said:\n\n“Early on in the investigation, I spoke with a few colleagues from all over Brazil and there was never a kidnap attempt in which a payment in virtual currency was demanded. This is unprecedented in Brazil. The main goal was to expedite the transaction, but that wasn’t possible.”\n\nThe husband then contacted the police and started negotiating with the criminals – who demanded a “large amount of bitcoin” – in an attempt to delay paying the ransom. The victim’s husband told criminals that cryptocurrency’s trading volume in the country wasn’t large enough for him to have the demanded amount available.\n\nDue to bitcoin’s nature, it would be extremely hard for police to track down the criminals based on the address they would use to receive the money. During negotiations, however, the officers were able to locate and rescue the woman.\n\nPolice believe the victim was handpicked, and that there were at least six people involved in the crime. So far, only one has been arrested and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nOfficer Raphael Werling, who participated in the operation, said:\n\n“It was a very difficult operation, but we managed to free the person. She isn’t injured.”\n\nThe victim’s daughter turned six this Saturday, the 29th, the day her mother was rescued. Her husband told local news agencies having her mother back was the best birthday gift she could ever get.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

Watching grown men hurl insults at each other on Reddit and Twitter is just sad.\n\nWhen I became involved in 2013, bitcoin\'s potential seemed endless. It was heralded as a possible solution for micropayments, remittances, microfinance, parking meters, email spam and so on. Many women, myself included, believed in bitcoin as a means to address world problems of poverty by providing access to capital for the remaining three-quarters of the world.\n\nAs time passed, I became discouraged that many needed use cases did not come to fruition. Startups attempting to build companies with those business models have died. Anything involving small payments in bitcoin has been mostly eliminated due to high fees.\n\nThe most popular use case is as a store of value. It\'s not to say that isn\'t useful: in the growing number of countries with devaluating currencies, bitcoin is an attractive alternative. Bitcoin has had an indelible impact as a groundbreaking technology. But it\'s disheartening that it has stalled in doing more.\n\nThere are fundamental issues that will likely never be solved, as evidenced by the two-year debate on how to scale bitcoin. The community is more divisive than ever. I can\'t help but think part of the reason it\'s so dysfunctional is because it\'s devoid of women.\n\nWomen (or any rational person) do not want to participate in this dystopian community: it\'s juvenile and filled with vitriol. Bitcoin desperately needs a Patronus Charm, ""a pure, protective magical concentration of happiness and hope.” [1]\n\nMy disappointment in bitcoin caused me to look at the blossoming landscape of alternate blockchains: eg litecoin, zcash, monero, ethereum and dash have all grown in market size and popularity.\n\nIt\'s clear that more alternative coins (altcoins) will develop innovative solutions and come to market. This is why MimbleWimble caught my interest.\n\nStarting point\n\nAs a brief background, the original MimbleWimble white paper was placed by someone called Tom Elvis Jedusor (Voldemort’s French name in JK Rowling\'s Harry Potter book series) on a bitcoin research channel in July 2016.\n\nTom\'s white paper ""Mimblewimble"" (a tongue-tying curse used in ""The Deathly Hallows"") was a blockchain proposal that could theoretically increase privacy, scalability and fungibility. It remained theoretical until recently.\n\nAt the end of 2016, someone named Ignotus Peverell (the original owner of the invisibility cloak, if you know your Harry Potter characters) started a Github project called Grin, and began turning the MimbleWimble paper into something real.\n\nAndrew Poelstra, a mathematician at Blockstream, presented on this work in January 2017 at Stanford University’s Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2017 conference. More recently, Ignotus posted a technical introduction to MimbleWimble and Grin.\n\nIt took me a while to wrap my head around MimbleWimble. The more I internalized it, the more hopeful I became that something more magical than bitcoin could appear. I will attempt to explain MimbleWimble and why what it proposes – privacy, freedom of choice, equal access, fungibility, and sustainable growth over time – are so important.\n\nPrivacy matters, a lot. One of the most important rights we have is the right to privacy. It’s our right to “keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity."" [2]\n\nPrivacy matters\n\nI consider privacy extremely important.\n\nIt\'s very apparent how valuable it is when you lose it or when someone violates it. In my 20s, I was stalked. A person whom I had met in passing on a military base waited for me after work and surreptitiously followed me home.\n\nHe did this for several weeks – all unbeknownst to me – until one day he knocked on my door and told me he had been following me and professed his undying love. I immediately slammed the door and called the local and military police. I lived alone in the woods and was so freaked out that I moved.\n\nOnly someone who has been stalked can understand how frightening this experience was. To this day, it affects many of my behaviors to guard my privacy.\n\nPhysical trespass of privacy is often preceded by online privacy violations. Recent events, such as Congress granting ISPs (internet service providers) the right to sell your personal information – browsing habits, app usage history, purchasing habits, location data – are very concerning.\n\nAs Luke Mulks from Brave elegantly wrote, ""[Y]our digital data trail is the evidence of your human presence online. Your data is valuable, private, and most important, it’s yours.""\n\nWhat\'s available\n\nIf we cannot rely on our legislature to protect our constitutional rights (can we rely on them for anything anymore?), technology needs to intercede to make it harder for greedy capitalists to put your privacy up for sale.\n\nPrivacy extends to what to share publicly about what we buy or whom we donate to. These transactions should not be open for all to see.\n\nWomen, especially those trying to escape repressive social or economic conditions, have a dire need to stay anonymous. That\'s a fundamental flaw in bitcoin: every transaction and address balance is available for the world to watch and track.\n\nThere are some things you can do to hide your transaction, such as tumbling, but you need to go out of your way to use them and they are breakable. Privacy oriented cryptocurrencies like monero and zcash improve privacy significantly.\n\nIn monero, the transaction is not natively private, but relies on ring signatures to mask exchanges. Zcash leverages a technology called zk-snarks to build private transactions, which is a huge improvement.\n\nHowever, it still requires a lot of extra resources to build a confidential transaction, so most users still issue their transactions ""in the clear"" (clear vs shielded counts).\n\nThe big change\n\nMimbleWimble is natively private.\n\nThere are no ring signatures or zero-knowledge proofs on top of a transparent bitcoin-like transaction. In a MimbleWimble transaction, all values are fully obscured. There are no reusable or identifiable addresses. Every transaction looks the same to an outside party.\n\nThe two properties verified in a MimbleWimble transaction are:\n\nNo new money is created The parties sending money must prove ownership of their keys.\n\nTo verify no new money has been created, you must demonstrate that the sum of outputs minus the inputs equals zero. To verify key ownership, the transacting parties must legitimately prove their public and private keys exist to authorize the transaction.\n\nMimbleWimble uses a blinding element to obscure all values – transaction amounts and keys – while holding true basic mathematical facts. The blinding element relies on multiplying and adding secret factors to obscure real values.\n\nFor example, let\'s say I have a transaction with these amounts: (1) 17 + 12 = 29\n\nThe balanced equation shows no new money was created, complying with property 1) above. The equation remains true if I apply a secret blinding number (eg 11) to all terms. (2) 17*11 + 12*11 = 29*11\n\nWithout knowing my secret number 11, you would have a hard time guessing what the original transaction values are in this equation. (3) 187 + 132 = 319\n\nIn equation (3), I’ve managed to keep both the values and blinding number private while still allowing others to verify I have not created new money in my transaction.\n\nThe big picture\n\nStill don\'t think this is a big deal? MimbleWimble offers other extensive benefits that indicate it could form the foundation of the kind of network bitcoin was meant to be.\n\nFreedom of choice\n\nBy obscuring all values, MimbleWimble provides full privacy and gives you the choice of what to reveal. It\'s similar to donor levels in various non-profits. You’ll see the range a donation was made for, but you don’t necessarily know the exact donation.\n\nBoth the donor and the non-profit know exactly how much was donated, but no one else needs to know.\n\nThis ""right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose."" [2]\n\nEqual access\n\nAnother aspect of bitcoin that disturbs me greatly is there is little opportunity left for an average person to participate in securing the network. The requirement of a highly specialized and expensive chip for bitcoin mining – the ASIC – has almost eliminated anyone from becoming a bitcoin miner, whose primary responsibility is validating transactions and placing them into blocks.\n\nThe mining community is now heavily centralized and this has greatly contributed to bitcoin\'s woes.\n\nThe ability to grow over time while still providing equal opportunity to participate are key tenets of Ignotus\' Grin implementation of MimbleWimble. Grin is designed to be ASIC resistant, so that anyone who wants to try mining can buy a widely available GPU chip at a local Best Buys or online for a reasonable price.\n\nMaking MimbleWimble ASIC resistant democratizes access. I’ve even toyed with the idea of building a GPU miner with my kids to see what it can do.\n\nAbility to grow over time\n\nAnother way to safeguard equal access over time is to ensure the blockchain network doesn\'t get dragged to a standstill when transaction volume increases.\n\nThis is the core issue in the bitcoin block-size debate: there are more transactions than can fit into a 1Mb block. As long as there\'s a restrictive size limit, there will be a capacity issue. A dirty little secret is that to get around scalability issues, almost all payment processors and exchanges do off-chain transactions. Which begs the question: why bother using a cryptocurrency with blockchain?\n\nIncreasing usage will increase transaction volume. So how do you ensure that a block size can continue to accommodate volume increases? By streamlining each block.\n\nThe principle is similar to simplifying equations. If there are terms that are identical on both sides of an equation, you can cut them:\n\n(8) 2+y = x+2\n\n(9) 7+3+5+4+2+y = x+7+3+5+4+2 Both equations (8) and (9) simplify to: (10) y = x\n\nMimbleWimble maintains that if an output spends an input, you no longer have to keep them because they cancel each other out. This greatly cuts down the amount of data you have to store and process.\n\nThe only data that nodes keep is unspent outputs and block headers. Instead of thinking of blockchain capacity in terms of number of transactions, MimbleWimble is designed to grow with the number of users. The streamlined blocks make growth sustainable over time as the transaction data set does not continue to get bigger.\n\nThis increases privacy since transaction data gets removed and it also enables fungibility.\n\nFungibility\n\nFungibility is the ability for equal units to be interchangeable.\n\nLet\'s say I give you a dollar – either as a coin or a paper note. The Federal Reserve prints the paper dollar and the US Mint produces the coin dollar, but both are equal. Neither is lesser or greater than the other and you can chose to use a dollar coin or bill interchangeably.\n\nThis is a key characteristic of currency: equal units must be interchangeable, or fungible. The US dollar is fungible. Bitcoin is not.\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain keeps every single input and output forever and so each coin carries a legacy. It\'s similar to equation (9) above.\n\nAnother dirty little secret is that when picking which transactions to process – in addition to the fee – payment processors, miners, and exchanges will look at the inputs (ie 7+3+5+4+2) to assess the quality of the transaction. The consequence is one bitcoin is not fungible with another.\n\nThe most valued bitcoins are called \'coinbase transactions\', which are the ones created when a block is found. They are newly minted and \'clean\' and some parties pay a premium to buy them. A hierarchy in coin quality develops. The consequence is, if you receive bitcoins that have inputs that are tainted (eg they have been used in a dark market), spending them may become increasingly difficult.\n\nIn MimbleWimble, because the (7+3+5+4+2) inputs and outputs are all discarded when spent, each coin is exactly equal to the other. In other words, MimbleWimble coins are interchangeable and fungible.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\'m very hopeful seeing the accelerating pace of research and innovation in public blockchains.\n\nIf privacy and scalability are solved, MimbleWimble could be the Patronus Charm for bitcoin, perhaps as a complementary sidechain. Imagine what a universal fungible digital coin could enable with access for everyone.\n\nOne hesitation I have, however, is that many people developing it have taken on Harry Potter-themed pseudonyms. It\'s understandable given the personal attacks rampant in the community, but it does conjure a mystical aura. I’m glad Andrew Poelstra, a highly qualified real figure, is actively involved with MimbleWimble.\n\nI hope I can add my voice to the mix, also as a real person. I realize that by not using a pseudonym, I\'m opening myself to the troll armies. I’ve attempted to explain why MimbleWimble is interesting to me.\n\nI hope it intrigues enough people and inspires both men AND women to engage early; it would be great if this community doesn’t wind up as a testosterone-filled boys club.\n\nApparently, Merope Riddle (Lord Voldemort\'s mother) is already very involved in MimbleWimble’s development. I believe it’s worth learning, participating in its genesis, and helping to develop a healthy community around it.\n\nHogwarts/Harry Potter image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The Bitcoin community harshly criticized Bitmain for developing malware which has the potential to shut down 70 percent of Bitcoin miners.\n\nThe Antbleed backdoor is a type of firmware that enables Bitmain to surveil on the customer sales and delivery records of Antminer users. According to Antbleed.com, the remote service of the firmware can return “false,” which ultimately can stop its miners from mining.\n\nApproximately 70 percent of the world’s mining community rely on Bitmain’s Antminer to confirm Bitcoin transactions. Hence, Bitmain has the power and capacity to shut down 70 percent of Bitcoin miners in an instant.\n\nAs the community outraged over the discovery of the Antbleed malware, Bitmain released its official statement on April 27. A section of the statement read:\n\n“This feature was designed and coded by the same team that is responsible for the firmware of Antminers. As the firmware has always been open-source, the feature was never intended to be malicious.”\n\nThe intent is not important\n\nThe intent of the Bitmain development team is of less importance. Frankly, it does not matter if the Bitmain development team introduced the Antbleed firmware update with good intentions because it creates the possibility of the majority of the Bitcoin mining community, which serves an important role in maintaining Bitcoin security, of shutting down in an instant.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether Bitmain can justify the intent of the activation of Antbleed on any ground or basis if it was designed specifically to surveil on its customers. Simply put, Bitmain developed a specific type of firmware to control its miners and customers, with the intent of centralizing the industry. Thus, to explain that the initial intent of the Bitmain team was to bring positive impact to Bitcoin is quite illogical and irrational.\n\nAndreas Antonopoulos, security and Bitcoin expert, explained:\n\n“I honestly doubt Antbleed was in any way malicious. It shows the intention to centrally control customers, is reckless and poorly implemented.”\n\nAntonopoulos further noted that the decision of Bitmain to implement firmware designed to centralize its customers and the mining industry was reckless and incompetent. He said, “reckless implementation combined with the intent to centrally control customers is a very dangerous thing in a decentralized system.”\n\nMore experts including Slush, the lead architect of hardware wallet Trezor and CEO of Satoshi Labs, the parent company of Trezor, stated that Antbleed is dangerous, regardless of the intent of the Bitmain development team.\n\n“ASICBoost and Antbleed are real and create a threat to Bitcoin. I'm not sure if they're just incompetent or malicious but they're dangerous,” said Slush.\n\nMore importantly, to Bitmain’s official response to the allegations, wherein the company claimed to have never completed the Antbleed feature, Slush explained that the feature is in fact very complete."", 'Popular Bitcoin betting platform Bitcoin Games has recently paid out a record amount of 154.3 BTC worth of prizes in a single week. The winnings were paid out to 11 players, all in the form of progressive roulette winnings.\n\n[Note: This is a press release]\n\nPrior to the record week’s winnings, the increasingly popular Bitcoin betting platform had already paid out over 1,000 BTC worth of prizes in the last six months.
