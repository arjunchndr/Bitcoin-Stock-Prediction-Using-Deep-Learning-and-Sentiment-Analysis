Bewerking door de auteur.\n\nBitcoin, a digital currency worth $43 billion USD, is in uncharted and potentially risky territory after a split created two versions on Tuesday: the original bitcoin that\'s existed since 2008, and the new Bitcoin Cash, which aims to be a more populist alternative.\n\nThe split in the network was triggered on Tuesday afternoon (all times EST) when an upstart group of bitcoiners pushed the button on a ""hard fork""—an unprecedented event in bitcoin\'s history, and one that the majority of the community had tried to prevent for two years. In fact, just one week ago, it seemed like the possibility of a split had been safely avoided altogether.\n\nThe fork was scheduled for Tuesday morning, and bitcoiners anxiously awaited the split. Due to some of bitcoin\'s quirks, the event actually happened six hours later. The hard fork was marked at 2:20 PM by the creation of an inaugural ""block"" of transaction data for Bitcoin Cash: nearly two megabytes in size. Bitcoin\'s blocks are capped at one megabyte, and Bitcoin Cash can support up to eight. Bigger block sizes is the major difference between the two virtual currencies and the impetus for the split. A second vanity block was quickly added to the chain and contained the phrase, ""Hello world.""\n\nRead More: The Next 24 Hours Will Decide Bitcoin\'s Fate\n\nNow two near-identical versions of bitcoin exist, each with their own set of rules and diehard supporters. Everybody who owns bitcoin automatically received the same amount in Bitcoin Cash, and this brand-new currency will have to fight to survive.\n\nBitcoin\'s price dipped $200 USD to roughly $2,700 per coin ahead of the split, but as of our time of publication, the currency is chugging along. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, is extremely volatile but showing signs of life. Before Bitcoin Cash was created with the inaugural block, popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken credited customer accounts with the currency and allowed trading; basically, issuing IOUs. In about 10 minutes of trading, the imaginary price of Bitcoin Cash crashed to $140 from $400. It seemed bad, but immediately after the fork, the price rebounded to $200.\n\nBitcoin Cash\'s success largely lies in the hands of ""miners,"" who run server farms to create the blocks that sustain the bitcoin network. At present it\'s unclear how many bitcoin miners have moved over to Bitcoin Cash, but it seems to be only a fraction. In the time that it took Bitcoin Cash miners to create a single block of transaction data for their public ledger, bitcoin proper had created dozens, which could indicate that Bitcoin Cash doesn\'t yet have the horsepower to take on bitcoin.\n\nThe split is a last-minute twist in a two-year debate that turned the bitcoin community into warring camps. The ""civil war,"" as some called it, centred around the question of how best to change bitcoin so that it can handle more people using it without slowing down.\n\nBy late 2016, the ""blocks"" of bundled transaction information that are chained together to make up bitcoin\'s public ledger, called the blockchain, were full. This resulted in transactions being marooned for hours or even days before being processed in a block. Think about how long it takes for a debit transaction to be approved at the corner store—it might feel like forever, but on bad days bitcoin can be much, much worse.\n\nRead More: The Dream of Buying a Coffee With Bitcoin Is Dying, If It\'s Not Already Dead\n\nThere was an exemption for those who could afford it, however: attach a high ""fee"" to your bitcoin transaction for a miner to include it in the next block. This is presumably fine for any of the many powerful financial institutions looking into bitcoin as a way to streamline parts of their existing business. They can afford the fees. This is bad, however, for people who want to use bitcoin to pay for everyday things like deodorant or a sandwich.\n\nAfter a long period of debate, bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille proposed ""Segregated Witness"" (or segwit), a new rule that would free up some space in bitcoin\'s one megabyte blocks—but not much. Still, the community largely came around to the idea.\n\nAfter a user-led campaign to strongarm holdout bitcoin miners into supporting segwit succeeded in July, the network was set to ""soft fork"" on August 1 to implement the change. A soft fork is a way to change bitcoin\'s rules without splitting the network, but everyone has to be in agreement. At the time, miners didn\'t unanimously support segwit, and so major Chinese bitcoin firm Bitmain coded a hard fork as a contingency plan.\n\nThat hard fork plan, initially just a hypothetical, actually succeeded in splitting bitcoin into two versions on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe hard fork was unexpectedly taken from ""contingency plan"" to ""Plan A"" and branded ""Bitcoin Cash"" by a group of users and developers that believe Segregated Witness didn\'t go far enough to increase the size of bitcoin\'s blocks. The ""cash"" bit in the name of bitcoin\'s new rival is meant to emphasize how this version is for anybody to use, not just financial institutions or large companies. Right now, the main differences between Bitcoin Cash and the original bitcoin are: no segwit, and a maximum of eight megabyte blocks instead of one.\n\nIt\'s tempting to see Bitcoin Cash and the hard fork as aberrations, but in hindsight they\'re expressions of an impulse that\'s been in bitcoin\'s DNA the whole time.\n\nWhat\'s keeping bitcoin together isn\'t code or even money: it\'s a belief. The bitcoin protocol, when it was released by an anonymous person or group called Satoshi Nakamoto nearly a decade ago, was anti-establishment and petulant. Bitcoin called out the banks and regulators as bullshitters and beat them at their own game with a currency that went on to become just as ""real"" as the US greenback, even though it\'s an abstraction created with math and computers. It\'s a pretty good joke, and it channels a libertarian politics that\'s bound to attract true believers.\n\nIt\'s arguably bitcoin\'s own anti-authoritarian impulse that motivated the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. That, and a gambler\'s instinct that drives people to dump billions of dollars into a made-up currency in the first place. When everybody is yelling at you to fall in line, like during the years-long scaling debate, the most ""bitcoin"" thing you can do is tell them to shove it.\n\nIt will probably be many weeks, or even months, before the real impact of Bitcoin Cash is felt. Regardless, it\'s an historic day.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.', 'A battle is afoot over the future of Bitcoin.\n\nThe front line of that war is a new iteration of the cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash that launched today and that advocates say will make it easier to use Bitcoin to buy and sell things. Bitcoin ""miners,"" who effectively control its supply, have been clamoring to upgrade the underlying technology used to execute transactions using Bitcoin so it can compete more effectively with other payment networks, such as PayPal and credit card systems.\n\nThe impetus for Bitcoin Cash stemmed from a dispute over the addition to Bitcoin\'s code of software called Segregated Witness that, in principle, is supposed to help process transactions. But critics of Segregated Witness argue that the software limits its utility. Hoping to take the currency in a different direction, they developed Bitcoin Cash.\n\n""Bitcoin Cash was created by people who don\'t approve of Segregated Witness,"" said Tone Vays, who hosts a Bitcoin podcast and who favors the push to change the currency. ""Many of them just don\'t like the people who wrote [it]. Whoever writes the code controls Bitcoin.""\n\nOn a technical level, Segregated Witness blocks AsicBoost, a software program that helps miners more speedily solve the mathematical problems they\'re required to complete to earn Bitcoin. Miners receive most of their income through these rewards.\n\n""Segregated Witness was forced onto the miners by the community,"" Vays said.\n\nMany Bitcoin companies, including Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, are taking a pass on Bitcoin Cash and are sticking with the original Bitcoin. They argue that Bitcoin Cash is too risky and may not last, a view echoed by Vays.\n\n""Bitcoin Cash won\'t be a viable alternative to Bitcoin,"" he said. ""It will basically die out in a few days.""\n\nBitcoin Cash is currently worth a fraction of Bitcoin. According to CoinMarketCap, it was recently valued at $375.82, compared with nearly $2,700 for Bitcoin Classic. Experts say the market for the new currency is likely to be volatile. As a result, Coindesk and many other Bitcoin exchanges are temporarily preventing customers from making deposits and withdrawals.\n\n""A lot of money is also involved – many people believe that Bitcoin is destined to revolutionize our current monetary system, so naturally companies and individuals will aim to have as much influence in the cryptocurrency space as possible,"" said Norbert Radoki, managing director of Bitcoinist.com, a news site that follows the currency, in an email.\n\nThe emergence of Bitcoin Cash comes at an eventful time for the cryptocurrency market. For one thing, Coinbase is raising $100 million from outside investors, resulting in a $1 billion valuation. That puts the company among the so-called ""unicorns,"" emerging private businesses that are worth an estimated ten digits.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts have raised concerns that Bitcoin and some other digital currencies, such as Ethereum, are in a bubble, noting the recent run-up in prices.The Bitcoin market has crashed three times since 2011, plunging more than 50 percent on each occasion. Bitcoin prices as of 2013 were around $110, so even with the recent pullback the currency has gained more than 2,300 percent.\n\n""Two Bitcoins might be better than one in the sense that there will be less infighting and more focusing on ideas and development,"" Radoki wrote.', 'Stocks tied to cryptocurrencies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) have been on fire due to the rise in the underlying asset, until now.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been crashing after hitting all-time highs, although leading virtual currency bitcoin has been holding up better than that rest. But, to well-known investor Doug Casey, they are just speculative vehicles.\n\n""You have to consider them like penny stocks and treat them that way,"" he said in the last part of a three-part interview with Kitco News. \'You can\'t buy them now and look at them as a store of value because they are not.\'\n\nDespite a pullback, bitcoin is still up on the year, up over 100% since January, according to Kitco\'s aggregated charts. However, the well-known gold bug is not convinced. ""Just like penny stocks, most of them are burning matches. I think you hold onto them long enough, you will get burned.""\n\nThat said, Tuesday is a big day for the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin is making a split today, but that may not mean investors should, too.\n\nBitcoin\'s transaction history and blockchain will fork, giving everyone who stores bitcoins in a participating wallet or exchange an equivalent number of coins in a brand new cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash. According to the future\'s market, Bitcoin Cash will be valued at around $300. Bitcoins are more than $2,800 each, up more than 180% in 2017 to date.\n\nBreana Noble tells you what you need to know.\n\nThis story comes via www.kitco.com.\n\nMore of What\'s Trending on TheStreet:', 'Bitcoin is trading down 5.78%, at $2,715, after word that bitcoin cash, another version of the cryptocurrency, has started to go live.\n\nBitcoin\'s rival Ethereum is spiking on the news, up 9.15%, at $224 an ether.\n\nTwo years of disagreements about how to scale bitcoin came to a head on Tuesday, the deadline for a decision.\n\nSo-called core developers want to limit the size of the blocks that make up bitcoin\'s network to protect it from hacks, but miners want to make the blocks bigger to improve its speed.\n\nThe deadline\'s passage lead to a fork, which the bitcoin exchange Coinbase describes as a ""change to the software of the digital currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history.""\n\nWhat emerged was a bitcoin rival called bitcoin cash, bucking a proposed solution called SegWit2x.\n\n""Bitcoin cash basically came out of nowhere,"" Charlie Morris, the chief investment officer of NextBlock Global, an investment firm with digital assets, previously told Business Insider. ""A group of miners who didn\'t like SegWit2x are going to opt for this new software that will increase the size of blocks from the current 1 megabyte to 8.""\n\nBitcoin holders will see their holdings double, but that doesn\'t mean the value will double. The decline in bitcoin will most likely equal the price of bitcoin cash, according to Morris, because bitcoin cash will initially draw its value from bitcoin\'s market cap.\n\nBitcoin is up 190% so far this year.', 'Izabella Kaminska AUGUST 1, 2017 31 When bitcoin, the crypto currency, first arrived on the scene in 2009 it sold itself on a simple principle. Unlike central bank money, the supply of which could be expanded on the whim of a non-democratically elected committee, bitcoin’s supply would remain capped at 21 million coins at any cost. This would be effected by way of a decentralised protocol, making it theoretically impossible for any single authority to override or control it. This, ultimately, was bitcoin’s promise to the world: a currency manufactured and supported by the users for the users, which no single entity could manipulate, and which no third party was required to intermediate. Understandably the pledge appealed most to those who might describe themselves as hard money enthusiasts. Their view was that uncontrolled money creation was the probable cause of most economic instability in the world, and must therefore be constrained. Bitcoin offered them the perfect conduit for this vision. More than eight years after bitcoin’s arrival, most of these principles have fallen by the wayside. Bitcoin spawned a litany of copycat systems — each with its own profiteering opportunity for early adopters. It no longer matters, for example, that the system is being engulfed by rogue and untethered private money creation. Nor does it seem to matter that it’s been a long time since bitcoin could be honestly described as a decentralised system, free of intermediaries. Economies of scale, as is their habit, have ensured only a handful of professional mining outfits and pools control the bitcoin production scene — they can collude oligopolistically if they so want. What matters is that the crypto scene’s popularity and profitability is soaring, especially for those who have become the new bitcoin power elite. Even bitcoin is succumbing to the pressure. As of Tuesday, a bitter ideological dispute over how the protocol should scale in the future has led to a breakaway version of the original currency. Because of the way bitcoin is designed, if this breakaway copy gains traction with miners, corporations and users — something we could know within a few hours or days — it could immediately expand bitcoin’s lifetime money supply to 42m from 21m. Dubbed “bitcoin cash”, this money-creating breakaway ironically owes its existence to the more puritanical part of the community, who insist replica bitcoin systems (known as sidechains) should never be allowed to tie themselves to the core system without limit: that would replicate the conventional and inflationary banking system. Unsurprisingly, it is the miners, corporations and intermediaries who support these sidechains: only by forgoing some of their core principles can they remain profitable in this sector. Bitcoin purists tend to be the staunchest critics of the expanded crypto scene, pointing out that almost every day a new token or coin is being issued into the market on the flawed assumption that full convertibility and liquidity can be guaranteed. Today’s crypto system is beginning to replicate the pre-crisis financial system of the UK, when banks — as long as they had acceptable assets to pledge at the central bank — could receive whatever official liquidity they demanded. For everything else, such as self-created assets, there was the wholesale funding market. We know many of these assets were self-valued at entirely fantastical rates. When the wholesale market froze up, only the central bank had the capacity to support them. The purists understand that the crypto scene will not have that saving grace. That makes the bitcoin fork a judgment of Solomon moment. Only a decisive win by either side will prevent bitcoin from splitting itself apart. Who, if anyone, gives way in the event of a stand-off will be a telling indicator of what really motivates the community. izabella.kaminska@ft.com Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT', 'On Tuesday, bitcoin ruptured into new distinct currencies: bitcoin and bitcoin cash.\n\nAustralian Bitcoin Exchange has opened and interest in the new bitcoin cash are exploding.\n\nNEW YORK - Sebastian Quinn-Watson has had more than 12 cups of coffee since he woke up around 24 hours ago.\n\nQuinn-Watson is a venture partner for a bitcoin exchange operator based in Australia.

As the popularity of bitcoin has increased in the last few years, so has the time and delay in processing its digital transactions.\n\nSome bitcoin users have reported that it can even take days for their payments to clear.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin\'s capacity allows it to handle a few transactions per second (about seven), whereas conventional payment methods like Visa can process thousands per second.\n\nBitcoin cash is expected to be able to process eight times more transactions than its predecessor.\n\nBut it is uncertain which digital currency exchange operators will support the spin-off currency — and how well it will perform in the marketplace.\n\nFuture currency or store of wealth?\n\nFor the original bitcoin to be more widely accepted as a currency, its speed would certainly need to improve.\n\nOn the other hand, there are those who buy bitcoin and hold onto them (instead of spending them like a normal currency).

It could be 18-24 months before this becomes how we do business.""\n\nUntil the technology behind cryptocurrencies is mature and more widely used by businesses, the controversy over bitcoin still rages.\n\n""I think bitcoin is probably going to stay on the sidelines,"" Dr Oliver said.\n\n""It\'s going to remain of interest to tech heads and people who are worrying about paper currencies collapsing in value.\n\n""But I\'d be very surprised if in the next few decades it becomes mainstream.""\n\nIn the meantime, for bitcoin\'s users and investors, it remains a case of ""buyer beware"".\n\nTopics: business-economics-and-finance, computers-and-technology, consumer-finance, money-and-monetary-policy, australia\n\nFirst posted']"

But just a few weeks ago, Twitter star and wealth manager Josh Brown admitted he was diving in to the cryptocurrency craze even as he admitted not fully understanding the currency’s use or where it will ultimately wind up.\n\nAnd, of course, there’s the recent record highs of about $2,800 for the value of a single bitcoin — up dramatically from $100 in 2013 and a low of just $500 a year ago.\n\nBut will bitcoin — or any of its imitators — last? And should regular investors give this “asset” serious attention, or consider it a short-lived quirk of the market?\n\nFor the record, I don’t think bitcoin is a fad, even if it has its flaws. It’s dangerous to roll your eyes at a technological advance simply because it’s different and you don’t fully understand it — as is proven by this 1995 piece scoffing at the internet or this classic TechCrunch prediction that “the iPhone will bomb.”\n\nBut it’s fair to say that while there have been big strides for bitcoin over the last few years, the digital currency may be at an inflection point in 2017. Not only does it face competition from other cryptocurrencies, but it also seems to be a source of tension from within the bitcoin community itself.\n\nSo what’s up with bitcoin, and is it worth your money?\n\nBoth proponents and detractors are very strong in their opinions. But for those still in the dark about bitcoin, here are 10 things you need to know before you consider investing:\n\nThe good news about bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a real currency. Those who think bitcoin can’t be used to buy anything real are either stuck in the past or just spreading misinformation. Many independent businesses accept bitcoin, but even some big brands are getting in on the act, including a Pennsylvania Subway restaurant and software giant Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.77% It simply isn’t true that you can’t use cryptocurrencies to buy actual stuff.\n\nBitcoin transfers are fast and flexible. While many financial institutions charge you or take days to process transactions, bitcoin allows transfers from one account to another almost for free and at will. You must have some technology, of course, and you must already have your money in bitcoin form. But there are no middlemen, and users are able to transfer value more quickly and without costly processing fees.\n\nDigital currencies are here to stay. While bitcoin isn’t perfect, its potential has won over many of the biggest names of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Icons from Bill Gates to Richard Branson to Mark Cuban see potential — at least in the concept and blockchain technology behind bitcoin. Even if volatility in bitcoin prices is the norm and competition is heating up, there clearly is a future for digital currencies in some form.\n\nRead: 4 blockchain companies that could change everything from accounting to money transfers\n\nYes, bitcoins leave a trail. While there is some level of anonymity in the world of bitcoin, some investors misunderstand how the currency works. That stems from the fact that the digital currency uses a widespread network of users who all keep transaction ledgers using blockchain technology, instead of a central institution of record. But the important thing to remember is that the long chain of transaction histories is shared, encrypted and independently verified by a disparate group of users — not simply made up out of thin air or subject to deletion at a whim. Yes, it is very different to collectively record who has how much currency and where it has been rather than relying on a verified financial institution. But to many bitcoin users, this decentralized system is a big part of the appeal, not a drawback.\n\nBitcoin has a long way to grow: While many techies are excited about the prospects of bitcoin, everyone admits the currency is in its infancy. Merchants are slowly learning the potential of connecting with bitcoin, and individual consumers are slowly becoming more comfortable with digital currencies; the learning curve is encouraging. What’s more, techies and other proponents of blockchain technology continue to look beyond bitcoin at the big-time potential behind the scenes. When you look at the amazing strides in mobile payments and e-commerce over the past 15 years, it’s awfully hard to write bitcoin off.\n\nThe bad news about bitcoin\n\nExtreme volatility. The uncertainty bitcoin faces as a new technology is not unique. However, the fact that bitcoin is easily linked to the U.S. dollar means the ebb and flow of sentiment is painfully obvious — and may make volatility even worse. Remember, there are plenty of stocks like Twitter Inc. TWTR, +4.25% that are innovative and seem to have staying power … but have still lost investors a bundle. Don’t confuse the potential utility of bitcoin with a guarantee that its value needs to rise.\n\nA fractured future. Adding to the volatility and the prospect of losses is the fact that even if digital currencies become mainstream, there’s no guarantee that bitcoin will, despite being a first mover. It’s not just competition from Ethereum and others, either; the bitcoin community itself is fractured about where to go from here and just saw a splinter group create a competing cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin Cash. After all, BlackBerry Ltd. may have kickstarted the smartphone revolution almost 20 years ago … but it isn’t exactly sitting pretty these days.\n\nBitcoin isn’t truly frictionless. While it’s true that bitcoin-to-bitcoin transfers are theoretically easy, it’s an error to think participation in the market is free or without frictions. For starters, users have to exchange real-world dollars or euros for the currency, and most third-party exchanges charge a fee for that. Furthermore, many merchants “accepting” bitcoin still don’t actually deposit bitcoin into their accounts — they use a similar third-party exchange to instantly convert bitcoins back to dollars, which often comes with a cost.\n\nPerhaps most seriously, the different value of bitcoins on different exchanges shows that the market itself remains quite inefficient and bid-ask spreads remain problematic. All that may change over time, but for now the idea that there is no “cost” associated with bitcoin is not technically true.\n\nHigh-tech high jinks are a risk. I don’t pretend to be a blockchain expert, but I do know that the tail of the chain — the most recent transactions — are a common playground for thieves. While bitcoin itself may be legitimate, there are plenty of bad actors looking to game the system – including one hacker who bilked $65 million from exchange Bitfinex a year ago. And of course, the deficit in public awareness has led to plenty of misbehavior, including fraudulent exchanges that take your money and never issue any bitcoin in return.\n\nAgain … bitcoin has a long way to grow. Some of the fraud risks and inefficiencies may resolve over time. Surely better systems and consumer education will help in the long run, but that begs the question of why you would want to buy now when the digital currency remains largely on the fringes of investing and commerce.\n\nIf you like taking massive risks on things like emerging-market penny stocks, I guess bitcoin is no big deal. But for the typical investor, there are many reasons why it makes sense to wait until the market is established and stable rather than chase potential reward at a massive potential risk.', 'The Winklevoss twins, whose plan to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund has so far been thwarted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, are a step closer to making the cryptoasset more palatable to Wall Street, and possibly to regulators.\n\nTheir latest attempt at legitimacy for a bitcoin ETF: an agreement with a major exchange operator that could make it easier for big trading firms to get involved.\n\nFor the most part, big institutional traders have stayed out of cryptoassets like bitcoin. One of the many problems is that the market is far too small for them to take substantial positions. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of about $44 billion, meaning some big hedge funds could swallow the market whole. Derivatives, however, have a ceiling that’s theoretically infinite; their value is derived from another asset but can exceed that asset in market value.\n\nFutures are one type of derivative—they allow traders to speculate on what a price will be at some later point in time. And that’s what the deal announced today (Aug. 2) enables, assuming it receives approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nCBOE Holdings, which runs major markets for stocks, options, and futures (and owns the rights for the famed VIX Index of volatility, sometimes called the fear gauge) now has the right to create bitcoin futures using data supplied by a bitcoin exchange called Gemini, which is run by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\n\nThe brothers, made famous by their legal battle with former Harvard classmate Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook, previously tried to list a bitcoin ETF on an exchange now owned by CBOE. The SEC shot down that attempt, citing a lack of regulation in the bitcoin market, but the agency agreed to review the matter again.\n\nThe availability of bitcoin futures could ease several issues for the big firms. Institutional traders frequently use futures to hedge their ETF positions. A bitcoin future at the CBOE, if approved, would also be a relatively easy plug-in for banks and hedge funds since it’s within a framework they’re already using. And while bitcoin was designed to bypass the traditional financial system—and thus became a notorious haven for drug dealers and cyber ransom—anchoring it in old-fashioned markets like the one for futures will ensure that it’s highly regulated, making it more attractive to big investors who want to keep the red flags to a minimum.', ""The response to the Bitcoin Fork (discussed here) has been overwhelming - people like free money!\n\nFor those people who kept their wallets at exchanges that would support it, you woke up with your 'old' Bitcoin and got some shiny new digital Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe appeal of Bitcoin Cash is that it is meant to be able to handle transactions much more quickly - which is important as transaction volumes rise exponentially. The one view, which I am admittedly only getting up to speed on, is that Bitcoin Cash will be easier to transact with.\n\nWhile I am not sure about that - what I am sure about is interest in Bitcoin and Crypto Currencies has skyrocketed. The fact that Bitcoin, as I'm writing this, remains around $2,700 and the new Bitcoin Cash is rising (some have an expected valuation of 1 Bitcoin Cash = 0.5 Bitcoin or $1,300) creating even more free money that you had when you woke up.\n\nIt is clear that Crypto Currencies aren't going away any time soon (much to the chagrin of some very famous investors who have been calling it a bubble or fake for years - just one example here). I think this latest burst of interest really started with the stories that Fidelity was allowing employees to use Bitcoin in their cafeteria (here)\n\nIt is also becoming a gaping hole in big Wall Street research. The one big area of potential growth, the one areas where customers really need some help to understand if Cyber Currencies are right for them, or how they fit into their portfolio, is being under-served.\n\nMy goal is to help fill that void. I have followed and occasionally been involved in Bitcoin. It first hit my radar screen in a meaningful way during the Cyprus Banking Crisis - when use of Bitcoin soared."", 'The community supporting bitcoin has long tried to avoid a so-called ""hard fork"" splitting the currency in two. On Tuesday, it happened anyhow. The idea behind the change is to speed up transactions and, consequently, mainstream acceptance -- but even an early adopter community like the bitcoin one can be conservative about its money.\n\nBitcoin transactions are validated as more currency is ""mined"" by computers solving certain mathematical problems. To be validated by the decentralized network of bitcoin miners, the transactions are bundled in ""blocks."" The bigger the size of the block, the more transactions can be validated in a second. For bitcoin, with a maximum block size of 1 MB, it\'s just two or three transactions per second. Enthusiasts compare that with the 2,000 per second that Visa processes. A bitcoin payment can take an hour to clear. Nobody wants to wait that long at a gas station or a store. That hinders bitcoin\'s acceptance as an everyday means of exchange and partly explains why speculation (or investment, if you want to be more charitable) remains its main use.\n\nQuickTake Bitcoin and Blockchain\n\nBitcoin\'s slowness also leads to the proliferation of other cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, some of which claim higher processing speed as an advantage. As of Wednesday, eight cryptocurrencies had a market capitalization of more than $1 billion. Bitcoin is still by far the biggest, with a market cap of more than $44 billion, but that\'s not much as far as currencies go, especially global ones; rivals such as ether, with a $20 billion market cap, have the potential to catch up.\n\nThat has prompted various proposals to improve bitcoin, and one of them, which would eventually double the maximum block size, was accepted by most of the community. A sizable group of dissidents, including some exchanges where the cryptocurrency is traded, were against the solution, though, and pushed onward with their own. They -- led by former Facebook developer Amaury Sechet -- moved ahead with new software that would increase the maximum block size to 8 MB. The first big block using it, 1.915 MB in size and containing 6,985 transactions, was ""mined"" on Tuesday, followed by smaller ones. The ""hard fork"" became real.\n\nPeople who kept their cryptocurrency on their hard drives got a choice between bitcoin and the new version, bitcoin cash. Some hastened to sell bitcoin and buy bitcoin cash, driving up the new currency to $563 per unit at the time of this writing, while bitcoin dipped a little but remained worth more than $2,700. But many investors, who held bitcoin through exchanges that didn\'t support the ""hard fork,"" such as Coinbase, were deprived of the choice. Many exchanges are still hesitating whether to trade bitcoin cash.\n\nApart from concern about trading volume, the hesitation has to do with the innate conservatism of any currency\'s holders. Germans still hold billions of Deutsche marks, which can be converted into euros if necessary; holding bitcoin is far less quaint since most of the mining capacity is dedicated to the ""old"" version of the currency. Bitcoin cash isn\'t being mined as actively yet. It\'s still untried, and experts aren\'t sure how safe it is. There are some strong technical arguments against bitcoin cash, too.\n\nBut whether or not bitcoin cash is ultimately successful, cryptocurrencies need to make technological progress if they are ever to outgrow their current status as glorified poker chips. The most recent success stories in the field have had to do with tokens that can be used within specific closed systems. For example, Gnosis, a prediction market, has its own currency with a market cap of $225 million. This function of cryptocurrencies has been used to bypass strict initial public offering rules, something that has invited regulatory attention. But it shouldn\'t be the only, or even the main, direction in which the technology develops.\n\nTo become actual money -- accepted everywhere, for any kind of purchase -- cryptocurrencies must become convenient to a layman. That means instant processing. Holding back developments that lead to it makes little sense. Bitcoin is only eight years old. The cryptocurrency industry is still experimental; fewer than 6 million people use the currencies. There is no reason to fear drastic change at such an early stage.\n\nEthereum, the platform running the biggest altcoin, ether, appeared to commit suicide a year ago when it decided to reverse the results of a major hack in which $70 million worth of ether was stolen. Cryptocurrencies are supposed to be decentralized, and such interference appears to go against their nature, as opponents of the move -- who stuck with the ""classic"" version of the currency -- pointed out. But the new ether is now more popular and 15 times better capitalized than the ""classic"" one.\n\nA widespread global cryptocurrency is still a dream. Implementing it one day trumps the interests of those early adopters who want to go slow, as if bitcoin were already mature. That money is made and lost on cryptocurrencies today is just a side effect of an important work in progress.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.', 'LONDON, Aug 2 (IFR) - CBOE Holdings has entered into a agreement with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini for bitcoin data that will support the Chicago bourse’s plans to list bitcoin derivatives.\n\nThe multi-year agreement sees Gemini, which was founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, provide daily bitcoin auction values to the exchange giant. The data will support the development of CBOE’s cash-settled futures that are slated for launch on the bourse’s CFE futures exchange in the fourth quarter of 2017 or early 2018, pending a review by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThe agreement also provides CBOE with exclusive rights to use Gemini market data for the creation of new indices. That could extend to VIX-style indices that would provide a measure of volatility on the cryptocurrency and potential volatility trading opportunities if a liquid bitcoin options market were to emerge.\n\nInterest in the cryptocurrency has increased alongside a near-tripling of bitcoin’s value since the start of the year. The currency hit an all-time high of US$2,954 in mid-June. Trading volume has grown substantially over the last five years as market capitalisation of outstanding bitcoin tokens jumped from under US$1bn to almost US$50bn. The currency represents around half of the entire cryptocurrency market, which has around US$100bn, outstanding according to CBOE.\n\nPerformance defies a setback in March, when the SEC rejected an application from the Winklevoss twins - most noted for their high-profile bust-up with Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of Facebook - to list exchange-traded funds linked to the digital currency on the BATS exchange.\n\nThe agreement with CBOE, which acquired BATS earlier this year, could help to allay some concerns around the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market - cited by the SEC in its ETF rejection.\n\nGemini is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. With limited liability trust company status, it has a legal obligation to protect the interest and assets of customers.\n\n“Gemini’s key concerns in the cryptocurrency ecosystem have always been security, compliance, and regulatory oversight. By working with the team at CBOE, we are helping to make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies increasingly accessible to both retail and institutional investors.” Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Ed Tilly, CBOE’s chairman and CEO, the bourse’s broad focus on options, derivatives, VIX, ETFs and FX makes it a natural home for the development and trading of bitcoin futures.\n\n“We very much look forward to responding to the growing interest in cryptocurrencies through the creation of bitcoin futures traded on a regulated derivatives exchange, with the many expected benefits that this brings, including transparency, price discovery, deep liquidity and centralised clearing,” he said in a statement. (Reporting by Helen Bartholomew)', 'Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin look like the future of consumer payments, precious-metals expert David Yoe Williams says.\n\n""Is it going to happen today or tomorrow?

You should be\n\nA new currency called Bitcoin Cash has appeared, split from bitcoin in a technical manoeuvre called a “hard fork”. It’s the project of a group that says bitcoin’s keepers are limiting its reach by resisting change.\n\nThe creation of Bitcoin Cash is the most striking result yet of a two-year-old feud over bitcoin’s future. Bitcoin is collectively valued at $47 billion but remains a niche product. Backers of the new currency say it’s necessary if bitcoin is to make a real mark on how the world uses money.\n\nRead next Steering spy planes using air flows could make them harder to detect Steering spy planes using air flows could make them harder to detect\n\nSubscribe to WIRED\n\nBitcoin Cash’s confusing origin – and name – risk making it harder for cryptocurrency to gain wider acceptance. “Bitcoin’s an incredibly well-known brand, and to the extent it’s fracturing into various pieces, that’s confusing to regulators and consumers,” says Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital, which invests in bitcoin and digital-currency startups. Morehead says he’s neutral on the dispute. “It just sounds bad; we’re not used to currencies that split into two.”\n\nAdding to the confusion: Not everyone who holds bitcoin will get an instant stash of Bitcoin Cash today. Some leading bitcoin-storage services have said they won’t recognise the new currency, forcing people to move their business if they want to claim the new variety of cryptocoins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin was created by a pseudonymous coder (or coders) known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who released the software that powers the currency in 2009. It relies on a network of computers linked over the internet that collaborate to process and record all transactions in a digital ledger called the blockchain. Computers dubbed “miners” keep the ledger updated by adding to the sequence of “blocks” that make up the blockchain as new transactions take place. Proponents say this system creates a trustworthy currency free from political oversight and capable of faster, cheaper digital transactions than possible with conventional currencies.\n\nAcrimony among bitcoiners stems from disagreement about limits on the blockchain’s capacity baked into Nakamoto’s design, and what to do about them. The bitcoin network can only support around seven transactions per second, compared with thousands per second piped through conventional financial networks such as Visa.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nRead next Google is getting serious about hardware, but it won't win easily Google is getting serious about hardware, but it won't win easily\n\nBitcoin Cash is a variation on bitcoin’s design, incorporating much bigger blocks, allowing for more transactions in a given time. Supporters say their project is necessary because planned changes that could expand bitcoin’s capacity are not sufficient. “At this point, it seems that the differences are irreconcilable and a split is unavoidable,” says Amaury Séchet, an ex-Facebook engineer who has developed code to implement Bitcoin Cash.\n\nOwners of pre-split bitcoin will be recorded as owning cryptocoins on both blockchains. Some bitcoin exchanges – where owners transact and store cryptocurrency – have said that they will support the new currency and credit customer accounts with Bitcoin Cash when it appears. But others will not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin Cash’s value, and its effect on cryptocurrency’s place in the world, will be determined by how many investors and users switch from traditional bitcoin. Late Monday, one futures market pegged the value of a unit of Bitcoin Cash at about $300, roughly 1/10 the value of one Bitcoin. After launch, the value briefly fell, but has now surged to $466 at the time of writing.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash adjustment to Nakamoto’s original creation does help address the currency’s capacity problem, says Emin Gün Sirer, an associate professor at Cornell who has studied bitcoin’s design. “The science to the extent we’ve measured it aligns with their reasoning,” he says. More important, and trickier, is whether enough people will use and invest in Bitcoin Cash to keep it going. “The crucial part is the amount of economic interest in this new currency,” Sirer says.\n\nSupport by bitcoin exchanges will enable use of Bitcoin Cash. Crucially, that could motivate more miners to put their computing power to work on maintaining Bitcoin Cash’s new blockchain, making it more reliable and stable, Sirer says. Miners are incentivised with new bitcoins for their work, and if Bitcoin Cash looks healthy, earning some early could strike miners as a good bet.\n\nWill success for Bitcoin Cash come at the expense of the original bitcoin’s ideals?\n\nIt depends on whom you ask.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefenders of the original design say too sharp an increase in capacity could raise the computer hardware requirements for contributing to the blockchain too much, opening the door to centralising control in the hands of a few dominant players. Séchet argues he’s fighting for the soul of bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash will force the cryptocurrency community to take scalability more seriously, even if the project fails. “Either bitcoin does not scale and Bitcoin Cash will overtake it over time, or it will scale because of the pressure created by Bitcoin Cash,” Séchet says. “Either is a win for bitcoin users.”\n\nSome trying to build businesses on top of bitcoin are becoming frustrated by the ongoing arguments. “It really has dragged on,” says Morehead of Pantera Capital. Nobody ever said that upending the financial system would be easy."", 'On Tuesday, bitcoin split in two, doubling the holdings of some investors.\n\nWith bitcoin cash trading around $400, those investors got a big payday.\n\nNot everyone is benefitting because not every exchange backed the new cryptocurrency.\n\nThe bitcoin split doubled the holdings of some investors, and today they appear to be reaping the benefits of the much anticipated fork.\n\nTo recap, on Tuesday, bitcoin split in two following a years-long battle in the community over the rules that should guide the cryptocurrency\'s network.\n\nThat split resulted in the creation of a new currency, bitcoin cash, which has the same basic underpinnings, but plays by different rules. In essence, it\'s almost like bitcoin cash is a copy of bitcoin, but running on a faster network.\n\nThere are numerous exchanges and wallets in which bitcoin investors can hold their money.\n\nInvestors who were holding their bitcoin on an exchange that backed bitcoin cash before the split, or in a wallet, saw their holdings double. But that wasn\'t the case for everyone. Some big name exchanges, such as Coinbase, which serves nearly 9 million customers across 32 countries, refused to back bitcoin cash. As such, investors using Coinbase, for example, saw no change to the quantity of their holdings.\n\n""In the event of two separate blockchains after August 1, 2017 we will only support one version,"" David Farmer, the director of Biz Ops at Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, wrote in a blog post. ""We have no plans to support the bitcoin cash fork.""\n\nAaron Lasher, CMO of Breadwallet, told Business Insider that larger exchanges didn\'t back the coin because it\'s a hassle.\n\n""You have to consider the cost of updating your coding and security capabilities,"" he said. ""Also, they probably didn\'t think it was going to take off.""\n\nBut it is taking off. Bitcoin cash, by market cap, is already the third largest cryptocurrency, and it is now trading around $403 a coin.\n\nIn other words, a person with one bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase, for instance, is missing out on $403 of essentially free money.\n\nBitcoin is down only 3% today, whereas bitcoin cash is up 66%.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Attention this week has so far focused on a group of bitcoin users that successfully split off the blockchain to form their own cryptocurrency.\n\nBut fascinating as the real-time market creation of Bitcoin Cash has been, for those who have closely watched developments, August 1 marked another lesser-acknowledged milestone – the passing of the deadline for a controversial scaling proposal Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 148.\n\nThat\'s when a vocal group of users had scheduled a so-called ""Independence Day."" The goal was to push through a long-stalled coding optimization called Segregated Witness (SegWit), designed to increase and redefine the network\'s capacity. The software upgrade would find node operators (users who store transaction history) initiating the move, hoping to lead the way for miners and startups.\n\nAnd while it\'s faded a bit into the background, you could argue that, even amidst a busy season for scaling proposals, BIP 148 was perhaps the most influential.\n\nThe scaling ""agreement"" Segwit2x followed soon after, proposing to add a feature that BIP 148 wouldn\'t have provided: a boost to the block size parameter. Bitcoin Cash was even more explicitly a response to BIP 148 – hence, why both were scheduled for the same day.\n\nBut those two proposals had one other thing in common, and that was giving some degree of power over the software transition to the miners that secure the blockchain.\n\nBefore its introduction, for example, SegWit had stalled for months due to its reliance on the idea miners would signal support to activate the change. However, only about 25 to 50% of mining pools did so from November to June.\n\nThen, suddenly, two weeks before the scheduled UASF, and with little time to spare, mining pools rallied around either Segwit2x or BIP 91 on its own, to activate SegWit.\n\nUASF supporters don\'t see this as a coincidence.\n\nBlockchain startup founder Ragnar Lifthrasir, a public UASF proponent, told CoinDesk:\n\n""UASF worked as designed and predicted, it is activating SegWit.""\n\nBalance of power\n\nIt\'s a narrative that adds evidence to the idea that some changes to the bitcoin protocol (and perhaps all public blockchains) are destined to be political.\n\nAs ethereum classic and bitcoin cash have now proved, there\'s capital to be created in splits. The more nuanced argument is that they also seek to aid research and understanding of the science behind open blockchains, though with economic risk to users.\n\nIn bitcoin, it could be said the scaling debate has called to mind the balance of power between its major network participants – startups, miners, developers and users. And the argument continues to be that UASF was a movement of the people, one that like any social revolution, was perhaps destined to be feared by the powers that be.\n\nWhile bitcoin users may be predisposed to such narratives, it\'s certainly one that has resonated with supporters.\n\n""We found out that not just miners, but some VCs and bitcoin startups didn\'t like the power of users, that\'s why they came up with Segwit2x, to obscure UASF\'s success and precedent,"" Lifthrasir he said.\n\nHe argues that it was a question of incentives. Mining pools didn’t want to risk that their 12.5 bitcoin block rewards (worth approximately $33,000 today) would be rejected, but they didn\'t want to support the UASF effort.\n\n""This means hashing power follows nodes and users, not the reverse,"" Lifthrasir argued, and he isn\'t the only UASF supporter to feel this way (or that this is important).\n\n""Basically, BIP 148 was an early success,"" remarked Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, one of the UASF\'s more ardent supporters.\n\nLasting impact\n\nIn the end, BIP 148 was sidestepped by another network proposal. But it\'s the mere threat of action, supporters argue, was enough.\n\nCalin Culianu, a developer for Bitcoin Cash, the version of the bitcoin protocol boasting no SegWit and 8MB blocks, even agreed that Segwit2x was likely a response to BIP 148 on some level.\n\nAlthough, Culianu has a different way of thinking about it, arguing that BIP 148 supporters used scare tactics to make it sound like it had more support than it did.\n\n""Miners got antsy, people got scared and everyone met in New York to hash out a plan,"" he said, alluding to how Segwit2x was originally determined.\n\nThe question now seems whether this tactic is good for bitcoin\'s development.\n\nCulianu almost seesawed on the question of whether UASF was a good thing for his project, as it could be said it spurred the ""big block movement"" to action.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""UASF was the spark that made all this happen, for better or for worse.""\n\nImage via Michael del Castillo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

An activist group have threatened to sue Coinbase for its decision, equating it to a brokerage withholding new shares from its investors.\n\nThe group’s stated mission to allow users to “trade or withdraw the Bitcoin cash tokens that rightfully belong to them following the 8/1/2017 Bitcoin hard fork.”\n\nCoinbase set out its decision on Bitcoin Cash in a July 27 blog post. The platform has seen an exodus of users ever since.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart\n\nBitcoin Cash Price Chart']"
08/03/2017,"['Coinbase, one of the world’s largest (if not the) largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has reversed its stance on Bitcoin Cash and said it will introduce support for the fork next year.\n\nCoinbase was among numerous exchanges to opt out of trading Bitcoin Cash after it came into existence on August 1 on the grounds that it wasn’t proven or safe. Beyond refusing to facilitate trading, Coinbase also said it wouldn’t allow customers storing original Bitcoin on its platform to claim their Bitcoin Cash entitlement. Those who wanted it were told to remove their coins and go elsewhere to do that.\n\nBut now the company — which was started by former Airbnb engineer Brian Armstrong (pictured above) and is reportedly raising funding at a $1 billion valuation — has changed its stance slightly. It told customers via email that it will introduce “support” for Bitcoin Cash by January 1.\n\n“Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw Bitcoin Cash. We’ll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support,” Coinbase said.\n\nIn other words, let’s see what happens before we commit to trading\n\nThat’s almost certainly a response to anger from Coinbase customers, who threatened to move their coins elsewhere and, in some cases, take legal action over their Bitcoin Cash entitlement. (Tl;dr people like free stuff, especially people who are into crypto.) It is unclear exactly what impact this had on the Coinbase business, but signs aren’t great. One analytics firm estimated that its cold storage reserves dropped to half of their previous level following customer withdraws.\n\nYet, despite that, a number of Coinbase investors told Business Insider that they aren’t overly concerned about the pushback, while the overall future of Bitcoin Cash itself is unclear. Principally that’s because the fork has the same mining difficulty as Bitcoin, but a smaller fraction of its hashrate.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin Cash became the third largest cryptocurrency based on total coins in the market on day one, but it’s $7 billion market cap trails Bitcoin ($44 billion) and Ethereum ($21 billion) by some way. Its situation may have changed by January, too, while also Coinbase has tended to take a conservative approach to bringing new currencies on.\n\nRight now it offers trading for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin — the latter of which was only added this past May despite gaining significant attention in 2013. Indeed, Litecoin’s founder had been director of engineering at Coinbase for nearly four years before leaving this summer — that gives some insight into how stringent its policy is.\n\nNote: Article corrected to note that Litecoin founder Charlie Lee is no longer with Coinbase.', 'The cryptocurrency online exchange Coinbase has decided to support the new bitcoin cash, days after a user exodus temporarily brought its website to a halt.\n\nIn a blogpost on Thursday, Coinbase Director of Communications David Farmer said the exchange intends to support the new Bitcoin Cash currency by January 1, 2018 — ""assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.""\n\nThe news, which Business Insider first reported was in the works, represents a dramatic turnaround from Coinbase\'s initial rejection of bitcoin cash. The company\'s rejection of bitcoin cash caused many users to stop using Coinbase, raising fears that it could suffer a customer exodus.\n\nCoinbase told users last week that they would have to remove their bitcoin from the Coinbase system if they wanted to participate in Tuesday\'s ""hard fork"" — the official creation of bitcoin cash, a currency that was cloned from bitcoin but which operates separately and follows different technological protocols from the original.\n\nCoinbase initially decided against supporting bitcoin cash because of a longtime strategy to exclusively support established and vetted cryptocurrencies. However, bitcoin cash was still automatically created out of the bitcoin stored on Coinbase — the same way it was in every other digital wallet.\n\nCustomers who had bitcoin balances at the time of the fork on Tuesday now have an equal amount of bitcoin cash, the company said. It will remain stored on Coinbase until support is established, at which point customers can withdrawal their bitcoin cash.\n\nUntil this announcement, many users feared their bitcoin cash would disappear, or be used by Coinbase for its own gain — a rumor which the company went out of its way to deny on Twitter.\n\nCoinbase hasn\'t announced if or when it will allow users to trade bitcoin cash on its system, but it said in the post that it will decide at a later date. It currently only allows users to trade 3 cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin.\n\n""We operate by the general principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events,"" Farmer wrote.', 'More than £108,000 in bitcoin paid by victims of the WannaCry ransomware attack, which crippled parts of the NHS as well as businesses in 150 countries worldwide, has been withdrawn from the digital wallets the funds were being held in.\n\nNearly three months after the ransomware struck computers, locking up data, demanding ransoms and causing chaos in hospitals and firms including Spain’s Telefonica and FedEx, a total of £108,953 worth of bitcoin was withdrawn. The money, presumably moved by the hackers, was taken from three bitcoin wallets associated with WannaCry, according to tracking firm Elliptic.\n\nVictims of WannaCry were asked to pay between $300 (£228) and $600 in ransom with the promise of unlocking the files taken hostage by the malware, of which there were believed to have been around 230,000 computers worldwide. While law enforcement advised against paying the ransom, saying that it would only fund further acts of cyber criminality, victims appear to have done so in their hundreds to try and get their data back.\n\nBetween 24 July and 3 August, more than £18,000 in bitcoin was removed from the three wallets, with the remainder of the funds taken out in the early hours of Wednesday morning in seven batches worth between £15,000 and £21,000 each.\n\nSince the attack, few anticipated that the ransom money would move. Part of the ransomware program gave the addresses of the digital wallets to victims and therefore law enforcement, which has been tracking them ever since. While bitcoin is considered a pseudonymous currency that cannot be tracked in the same way as traditional currencies, monitoring its movement is possible due to the way transactions are written into a distributed ledger called the blockchain.\n\nThat makes turning ill-gotten gains into traditional currencies harder to do anonymously. To do so requires the use of techniques such as a bitcoin mixer or tumbler, which intentionally confuses the trails of bitcoin transactions to protect the anonymity of the bitcoin owners.\n\nBTC-e, a major bitcoin exchange accused of laundering $4bn in bitcoin since it emerged in 2011, was shut down in July after the “internationally sought criminal mastermind” behind it was arrested in Greece, which will make anonymously turning the ransom bitcoins into cash even harder.\n\nElliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CNBC: “We believe some of these funds are being converted into Monero, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.”\n\nThe funds may also be used to purchase goods and services directly in bitcoin on the dark web, adding another layer of difficulty to tracking the wallets’ owners.\n\nThe ransomware attack, which has been linked to North Korea, is thought to be at least partially politically driven rather than an outright move for money. As a piece of ransomware designed to extort users, WannaCry was a victim of its own success hitting large firms and spreading across networks using holes in Windows XP and Windows 7 to propagate far and wide.\n\nBut while ransomware targeting business and institutions causes large amounts of disruption, such as reducing some NHS hospitals to emergency care only and forcing them back to pen and paper, businesses are unlikely to pay the ransom.\n\nWhere individual home users may not have backups of their data that can be easily restored, and therefore are more likely to pay the ransom to try and get their files back, most businesses will have routine backups and can restore the majority of files relatively easily once the infection has been purged.', 'Summary: In a groundbreaking agreement the stage is set to give traders access to Bitcoin through a traditional and well-regulated market. The CBOE and Gemini plan to allow more sophisticated options to traders as soon as later this year.\n\nBitcoin futures and options\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange, hereafter CBOE, and Bitcoin exchange Gemini announced a joint agreement on Aug. 2. As part of the deal, Gemini will supply data to support the CBOE in a future listing of Bitcoin derivatives.\n\nGemini, owned by the Winklevoss brothers is known for multimillion dollar auctions of Bitcoin and recently launched Ethereum auctions as well - although they lack the buyer interest that Bitcoin has captured. It should be noted that the CBOE and Gemini still await regulatory approval, although it is expected to be granted soon.\n\nThe news comes just days after the CFTC regulated SEF and DCO (swap execution facility and derivatives clearing organization) announced that is has received approval from the Commodity Future Trading Commission - a milestone as the first federally regulated platform to offer options and future contracts for Bitcoin.\n\nSophisticated trades\n\nThe agreement gives the CBOE exclusivity to Gemini data that can be used to create indices. Coupled with futures and options, we see that the cryptocurrency trading space is quickly becoming more mature and sophisticated. In a statement, Gemini CEO does note that security and compliance remain at the forefront.\n\nTyler Winklevoss says:\n\n“Gemini’s key concerns in the cryptocurrency ecosystem have always been security, compliance, and regulatory oversight. By working with the team at CBOE, we are helping to make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies increasingly accessible to both retail and institutional investors.”\n\nTaking seriously\n\nThe CBOE seems very welcoming of Bitcoin to the market, chairman Ed Tilly states:\n\n""We very much look forward to responding to the growing interest in cryptocurrencies through the creation of Bitcoin futures traded on a regulated derivatives exchange, with the many expected benefits that this brings, including transparency, price discovery, deep liquidity and centralized clearing...Gemini has demonstrated time and again its foresight and expertise in this area of finance. The team’s focus and determination to grow the Bitcoin market and secure appropriate regulatory oversight as a New York trust company makes them ideal for this venture. We are incredibly proud of this agreement and look forward to all that we can achieve together.”\n\n""If all goes to plan, we will see Bitcoin included on the CBOE as soon as Q4 this year early 2018.""\n\nAs more traditional financial markets begin to take cryptocurrency trading seriously, the next hurdle is clearly well regulated and safe exchanges.

In October of that same year, the exchange officially received permission from the New York State Department of Financial Services to operate in 31 states. Gemini’s major focus had originally centered around Bitcoin trading, however, with the popularity and value of Ethereum rising exponentially, the exchange added Ethereum trading in May of 2016. Currently, the exchange has a daily transaction volume of $52 million.\n\nAn Agreement with the CBOE\n\nAccording to an official press release, Gemini and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) entered into an agreement to exclusively use Gemini’s Bitcoin market data. The details of the agreement state that CBOE will have an exclusive global multi-year license to use the exchange’s market data.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange’s market data will help the CBOE to create bitcoin derivatives products for listing and trading. Currently, the CBOE is awaiting regulatory approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), in order to launch its cash-settled bitcoin futures. The report suggests that cash-settled bitcoin futures will be available for trading on the CBOE Futures Exchange in the fourth quarter of 2017 or early 2018.\n\nEd Tilly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CBOE Holdings, said:\n\nGemini has demonstrated time and again its foresight and expertise in this area of finance.

But it\'s price may be inflated because of some technical issues underpinning the new coin.\n\nTo recap, on Tuesday, bitcoin split in two following a years-long battle in the community over the rules that should guide the cryptocurrency\'s network.\n\nThat split resulted in the creation of a new cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash, which has the same basic underpinnings, but plays by different rules. In essence, it\'s almost like bitcoin cash is a copy of bitcoin, but it\'s built to process more transactions and faster.\n\nFollowing the fork, bitcoin investors who had their holdings in certain wallets and on certain exchanges now have just as much bitcoin cash as they do bitcoin.

Kind of like when you have a pending deposit on your checking account.\n\nLasher told Business Insider that wallets are playing catch-up, and working on updating their infrastructure so bitcoin cash investors can move their coins over to exchanges where they can be actively traded.\n\nSome bitcoin cash investors have taken to Twitter since the split to complain that they can\'t trade their bitcoin cash (BCH).\n\nu can\'t move it\n\n\n\nu can\'t sell it\n\n\n\nno, it\'s not a rock, it\'s $BCH! — #SatoshiMoku (@CarpeNoctom) August 2, 2017\n\nHere are one bitcoin cash investor\'s Lamentations:\n\n?

Trezor, another wallet, is also having some problems making bitcoin cash available for its users. Here\'s the company\'s statement on the matter (emphasis ours):\n\nBCH wallet is still offline in TREZOR Beta Wallet, as the Bitcore backend (BitcoinABC) is reindexing. The fix was found, however, its deployment has been complicated due to changes in BitcoinABC’s code (vis-a-vis Bitcoin Core). There is no ETA for bugfixes and deployment.

In other words, sellers in the market can\'t find buyers.\n\n""The market for [bitcoin cash] is so illiquid and fragmented that the price, and by extension the market cap, mean almost nothing,"" Mow told Business Insider.\n\nIn other words, the only reason why bitcoin cash is trading at $400 and has the fourth highest cryptocurrency market cap is because a large swath of the marketplace can\'t move their coins.\n\nSo what happens when folks are able to unleash those coins onto exchanges?\n\nAccording to Lasher, it will likely increase the number of folks in the market who want to sell their coins. When more people look to sell a good than buy it, the price falls.\n\nMow told Business Insider the bitcoin cash house of cards will completely fall apart.\n\n""It\'s unlikely that [bitcoin cash] will survive at prices above $100 in the long term,"" he said.\n\n""We have some of our key traders telling us that they will be getting out of their BCC positions by 8 August ,"" Sebastian Quinn-Watson, a venture partner for a bitcoin exchange operator based in Australia, Blockchain Global.\n\nAugust 8 is the day on which SegWit, a software update for the original bitcoin blockchain, will go into effect.\n\n""We see 8 August as the day the bell tolls for bitcoin cash,"" Quinn-Watson said.

VC intermediaries have been advertising regularly … the government silence can be construed as permission for such activities.\n\nThe official added:\n\nUsing the coin for transactions are fraught with dangers of sudden value erosion.\n\nThese latest comments from India’s finance ministry comes at a time when the use of bitcoin trading is experiencing a surge in popularity.\n\nIn May, digital currency exchange Zebpay hit a notable milestone when it saw more than 500,000 installs of its app-only service on Android. As a result of user demand, the exchange was forced to impose ‘temporary’ buy limits on bitcoin purchases due to a shortage of bitcoin stocks.\n\nAnother factor brought on by the boom in digital currency trading can be linked to the country’s demonetization last October, which saw the government wiping out 86 percent of the nation’s currency overnight. Then the price of bitcoin was trading around Rs 40,000. Now, though, according to Zebpay, it’s valued at Rs 180,000.\n\nBitcoin continues to be a popular form of trading in India. If the government does implement campaigns designed to dissuade people from employing the currency, it remains to be seen whether the measure will have any impact on them.\n\nIn June, the finance minister Arun Jaitley held an inter-ministerial meeting to discuss the risks associated with the digital currency.

BCH was last down 22% near $373.00 for a market cap of roughly $6.2 billion.\n\nHash Power Remains Low\n\nLow hash power is one of the bigger problems facing BCH.

Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nSpeculation of collusion is widespread, with some users arguing that miners are purposely creating no blocks for hours at a time.\n\nDifficulty Accessing BCH\n\nAccessing BCH deposits remains a chief concern for many investors since most exchanges have not supported the new currency. Users have also been warned about withdrawing their BCH from cryptocurrency wallets given the security implications of doing so. Users who spend from a BCH address do not reveal their private key, but do give up their public key. This is not the case with a bitcoin address.\n\nCoinbase is perhaps the most prominent cryptocurrency exchange to refuse Bitcoin Cash. It has drawn the ire of disgruntled members who are demanding to trade or withdraw their BCH token. Together, they’ve threatened Coinbase with a class action lawsuit.\n\nBitcoin Prices Stable\n\nBitcoin has defended its market share since the August 1 fork, with prices showing remarkable stability in comparison with previous months. The BTC/USD exchange rate broke above $2,800.00 on Friday. At present values, bitcoin is capitalized at roughly $46 billion.\n\nHowever, some analysts say bitcoin could be in for greater volatility as the full effect of the hard fork materializes. This could occur once BCH deposits are enabled.', 'Bitcoin has reached a record high valuation of $3,000 per coin to complete a rollercoaster week that begin with the long-awaited split of the cryptocurrency.\n\nA number of exchanges, including popular destinations Coinbase and Kraken, valued a single bitcoin at over $3,000, an all-time high that is up $485 on the valuation one month ago. Earlier this year, Bitcoin surged to surpass $2,000 for the first time in May going on to almost reach $3,000 in June only for the valuation to crash.\n\nOver the last twelve hours, bitcoin’s value has jumped by over 10 percent as forked currency bitcoin cash has seen its valuation crash by 30 percent. Some exchanges including China’s OkCoin even put the value of one bitcoin above $3,200 right now.\n\nFinally, the surge means that the total market cap of bitcoin is more than $50 billion — $51,737,289,581 at the time of writing according to Coinmarketcap.com.\n\nA Coinbase chart shows bitcoin’s valuation has passed $3,000 per coin\n\nOne chief concern around the currency was uncertainty around the potential of a split. Some factions of the bitcoin community urged for change to counter the slowing processing rates of bitcoin. The result was a fork called bitcoin cash (known as BCH) which came into existence on August 1.\n\nBCH duplicated the original bitcoin blockchain, meaning that anyone holding BTC was entitled to BCH, too. However, not all exchanges — including Coinbase — supported the forked currency from day one. That led to droves of customers apparently taking their coins out of Coinbase, and even threats of legal action, which ultimately prompted Coinbase to change its mind and pledge to support BCH withdrawals from customers by January 1. Although it hasn’t committed to trading at this point.\n\nBCH has endured a fairly volatile first week, even for bitcoin standards.\n\nThe currency started life valued around $555, before peaking at $727 on Wednesday. It later crashed to its current price of around $220 as bitcoin, conversely, soared to cross that $3,000 mark.\n\nThe first week of trading for bitcoin cash, via Coinmarketcap.com\n\nExperts are skeptical of BCH’s long-term future because, at this point, beyond the unstable valuation, there isn’t actually anything that can be done with it. That could change in the future if the project attracts enough companies and developers, but the difficult that it takes to mine BCH versus bitcoin isn’t justified to many miners. That may adjust change in the future, as a Coindesk story recently suggested, but bitcoin remains the more lucrative option as of right now.\n\nNote: Story updated to change bitcoin cash abbreviation to BCH.', 'WannaCry addresses were emptied in a day as speculations over where the money goes are emerging.

A key factor of Bitcoin transactions is that they are pseudonymous. Despite not being anonymous, there is no way of knowing who control the keys to the addresses.\n\n“I have not idea why they would move the money… Wouldn’t imagine they are going to try and turn those Bitcoins into real money. If they do, it’s going to give someone a track to an actual person.” Patel told the BBC.\n\nFollow the money\n\nAlan Woodward who acts as a cyber security advisor to Europol points out that many assume Bitcoin is anonymous - this is very different from being pseudonymous. The Bitcoin ledger is entirely visible to all.\n\nHe goes on to explain that “cluster analysis” is a technique used to attempt locating addresses controlled by the same person.\n\nThis is no different than the classic “follow the money” approach used to catch money laundering and illegal financing. However, with the complexity of digital currencies, a difficulty level is added.\n\nWhile there were different assumptions as to where the money went or will go, some suggestions included swapping the Bitcoins for privacy orientated Monero or even running it through a mixer to try to lose the trail.\n\nIt should be noted that recently AlphaBay was taken down and the world’s largest Bitcoin mixing service suddenly closed doors.\n\nShapeShift has since released a statement confirming that the attackers used their service to exchange Bitcoin to Monero but did breach the terms of service.\n\n“As of today, we have taken measures to blacklist all addresses associated with the WannaCry attackers that are known to the ShapeShift team, as is our policy for any transactions we deem breach our terms of service. We are closely watching the situation as it continues to unfold as to block any further addresses associated….Any transactions made through ShapeShift can not be hidden or obscured and are thus 100 percent transparent, making laundering of any digital tokens impossible.” - ShapeShift statement regarding the transactions\n\nHero arrested\n\nMeanwhile, Marcus Hutchins who was the first cyber security expert to shut down the first attacks “accidentally,” has been arrested in the US. According to mainstream media, he has been accused of involvement with Kronos - a malware used to steal bank logins.\n\nCointelegraph cannot confirm the validity of these allegations. The 23-year-old Brit was visiting the US to attend Black Hat and Def Con conferences\n\nFellow researcher Kevin Beaumont tweeted:', 'Bitcoin has continued consolidating near all time highs over the past week, with little price action. Hash rate is also essentially unchanged, while SegWit is on track for lock-in and activation sometime later this month.\n\nAll eyes were on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork of Bitcoin, which occurred on August 1st. It’s had a few issues from the start. Initial hash rate was extremely low. BCH still needs several difficulty adjustments before miners are incentivized to switch from any profitable cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile a select few miners have begun mining BCH, block times and confirmations have been highly variable, with up to four hours between blocks. Below is a visualization of the mempool.\n\nEarly trading on ViaBTC, who was accepting single confirmations of BCH, had several large sell offs, timed with the initial few blocks.\n\nAdditionally, due to problems on their end, Bitfinex distributed about 15% less BCH than was owed to their customers. Trezor, a hardware wallet, also initially had problems distributing BCH to their users. In the mean time, Coinbase reversed their initial stance on on the digital asset, after they were threatened with a class action lawsuit for not distributing BCH to their users.\n\nWith liquidity low across the board, slow confirmation times, and mining centralization, it’s far too early to speculate on the true price of BCH or whether it will be successful in any way.\n\nIn the meantime, despite the dead and then undead COIN ETF, the Winklevoss twins are back at it again. It was announced this week that the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) will use the Winklevoss Bitcoin exchange, Gemini, to provide market data for potential derivatives products.\n\nA futures product is planned for the fourth quarter of 2017 or early 2018 pending the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s approval. In the press release, CBOE acknowledges that, “trading volume of the bitcoin market has grown substantially in the last two years.”\n\nOne veteran institutional trader told BNC, ""If the CBOE obtains regulatory approval to launch a Bitcoin future on the Chicago Futures Exchange, I expect it to do well based on the grandfathered institutional liquidity pools as well as exposure to traditional brokers and retail order flow. With volatility flattening out in most sectors, trading firms are excited about the potential of a traditionally listed volatile asset. The added interest can only be a boon to the underlying market price of the Bitcoin asset.”\n\nBitcoin Technical Analysis\n\nOngoing consolidation with several failed breakout and breakdown attempts may represent the underlying fundamental changes surrounding the Bitcoin protocol happening this month. With continued consolidation, there is very little new to say this week on the road map or price targets. There are two building chart patterns, both of which represent continuation. There is a building ascending triangle, with a projected target about $4000, and inverted head and shoulders with a projected target around $3200.\n\nAn alternative roadmap would look similar to a Wyckoff distribution phase, where this would essentially be the top of the current trend. A failed breakout above $3000 and a successful breakdown below $2000 would be conclusive for a distribution phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash fork has come and gone, with the event itself continuing to show Bitcoin’s anti-fragility. Whether BCH will gain any traction remains to be seen, but it certainly will create brand confusion if it becomes more popular.\n\nWhile there are several chart patterns representing continuation, continued stagnation in this price zone may match Wyckoffian distribution market structure. However, it is difficult to make this assessment until after SegWit is activated as this represents a substantial increase in network efficiency and should therefore increase price long term as well.', 'The Centre on Friday admitted that there has been a ""notable growth"" in the bitcoin market in India over the last few years.\n\nThere is evidence that crypto currency/bitcoins are being used in the country, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told the Lok Sabha in a written reply.\n\nThis is even as there are no regulations governing bitcoins in India. It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had in February this year advised that it has not given any licence/ authorisation to any entity/ company to operate such schemes or deal with bitcoins or any virtual currency.\n\nJaitley said that there are mainly two categories of players operating in India, one with presence in public domain and other who operate in an unorganised manner through social media sites and mobile apps.

Stealing the Bitcoins of targeted users would represent a valuable source of potential income"", said Trend Micro researchers Gilbert Sison and Janus Agcaoili.\n\nCerber isn\'t the first family of ransomware to steal data from victims - two previous examples are RAA ransomware infecting victims with data-stealing Pony Trojan malware and Merry Christmas ransomware being bundled with information stealing Diamond Fox malware - but it\'s worrying to see the most common form of file-locking malware adopt this technique.\n\nWhile Cerber has added this new ability to its payload, the email phishing attack method remains the same, so educating users to be vigilant when it comes to mysterious attachments or unverified sources remains one of the best ways to avoid infection.\n\nWhile the identity of the hacking gang behind Cerber remains a mystery, its continued evolution and development of the ransomware points to it being the work of a highly organised operation.\n\nResearchers have previously noted that Cerber doesn\'t infect targets in former Soviet states, suggesting that it could potentially have a Russian origin.\n\nREAD MORE ON CYBERCRIME', 'As cryptocurrency comes to the forefront with more investors jumping aboard, it is important to be aware of the tax issues and how to report gains accurately to the Internal Revenue Service. No excuses!\n\nAccording to Node40, a blockchain tech company, only 800 Americans reported their Bitcoin gains from 2013 through 2015. It is important to abide by the law as you enjoy your winnings.\n\nLet us remind you of the ongoing IRS lawsuit against Coinbase; with heightened probes into cryptocurrency tax evasion, it has never been more timely for cryptocurrency users to declare profits.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, you must be aware of relevant issues and regulations and of the technology out there to assist bitcoin investors.\n\nRobert Graham partner and head of the digital currency services practice at Friedman LLP, believes in educating investors in important legal pointers and definitions to make sure that, if they\'ve made gains, they have no uncertainties.\n\nFirst of all, be aware of the regulations. Graham explains that the IRS offered guidance on how to apply existing tax principles to transactions using virtual currency in Notice 2014-21.\n\nMore of What\'s Trending on TheStreet:\n\nThe basic premise under the IRS guidance is that virtual currencies are treated as property, and not as a currency, for federal tax purposes. As a result, general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to virtual currency transactions.\n\nGraham adds that one of the initial questions the IRS fielded was ""what is the definition of a virtual currency?"" The IRS defines a virtual currency as ""a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value"".\n\nBig week for Bitcoin.\n\nMany of the mainstream cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are considered virtual currencies under the IRS guidance. ""Keep in mind that new digital currencies and tokens are being created every day,"" Graham adds. ""Per coinmarketcap.com, there were 1,025 cryptocurrencies listed as of Thursday. Individuals looking to invest in or use these cryptocurrencies should ensure that they evaluate the currencies for security, valuation, and tax implications amongst other considerations prior to investing.""\n\nAndrew Howlett, counsel at law firm Miller & Chevalier who practices in the area of federal income tax with an emphasis on tax planning and tax-related transactional matters, also notes that failure to report and pay tax on gains realized from bitcoin transactions could result in civil penalties or even criminal liability.\n\n""Taxpayers will need to know the exact price at which they purchased and sold a given bitcoin or fraction thereof, and specifically identify which bitcoin was used for each transaction,"" Howlett says. ""For taxpayers with multiple bitcoin transactions per year, these calculations and identifications may be quite complex. Even with assiduous record-keeping taxpayers using bitcoin are likely to run into a number of unresolved questions about the taxation of these transactions.""\n\nWatch More with TheStreet:\n\nRemember - it is crucial to keep records. ""Investors in virtual currencies should keep detailed records of purchases and sales of the virtual currencies to support their tax filings,"" Graham said. ""Investors are tasked with determining the cost basis -- in U.S. dollars -- of the virtual currency and applying a basis on the date of sale to determine if there is a gain or loss on the sale.""\n\nNode40, is a blockchain tech company which offers tax compliance to American cryptocurrency users recently launched bitcoin support on its popular software as a service, Node40 Balance.\n\nPerry Woodin, CEO of Node40, says not only is accounting inherently complicated, but it\'s also ""currently under heavy legal scrutiny. Since the IRS considers digital currency property, each and every input to a transaction has a potential gain or loss.""\n\nGraham stresses that individuals who are investing in or receiving virtual currencies through mining operations, service agreements or other transactions should discuss the transactions with their tax advisors to ensure they are in compliance with the current guidance from the IRS.\n\nEditors\' pick: Originally published August 4.', 'Earlier this week, Yongsan Electronics Market, an iconic center in South Korea which houses some of the largest electronic retailers and South Korean headquarters of major computer manufacturers including ASUS, officially banned Bitcoin mining after discovering that some of its smaller stores have used Yongsan Electronics Market’s electricity to mine Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mining craze\n\nLocal sources including Hankyung revealed that some stores established mining equipment to mine Bitcoin with the market’s electricity. Employees of certain computer retail stores even had normal CPUs running overnight mining Bitcoin.\n\nOwners of computer stores and electronics retailers submitted formal complaints to the Yongsan Electronics Market management and expressed their concerns over overheating computers posing as a potential fire hazard.\n\nIn fact, in early 2013, many cryptocurrency enthusiasts in South Korea tried to mine Litecoin, which had significantly lower difficulty levels than Bitcoin, with normal CPUs or computers. After days of running Litecoin mining software, some reported that the motherboards of their laptops melted due to extreme overheating.\n\nIn a public statement, the Yongsan Electronics Market announced:\n\n“Running of Bitcoin mining equipment results to significant consumption of electricity within the center. If electric consumption reaches its limit, electricity costs will drastically increase and they will have to be covered by merchants, computer stores and electronic retailers within the center. Some merchants and stores submitted formal complaints that due the rapid increase in electricity consumption caused by Bitcoin mining, air conditioners stopped functioning properly.”\n\nDuring an investigation, the Yongsan Electronics Market management discovered that some stores that were initially rented out as computer stores were being used as Bitcoin mining centers, with ASIC miners and GPUs in racks placed throughout the space. The management further revealed that consumers and clients passing through stores that had Bitcoin mining equipment running felt a drastic increase in temperature in the area.\n\n“100 ASIC miners running simultaneously”\n\nThe Yongsan Electronics Market management noted that one store had $300,000 worth of ASIC miners and GPUs running full time, 24/7, to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n“One store had over 100 ASIC miners running simultaneously, which led to an unexpected rise in energy consumption,” the management added.\n\nBitcoin mining, which once was a lucrative business and industry, has become increasingly difficult to profit from.\n\nMajor mining pools including Antpool, which is operated by arguably the most influential Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer in the industry Bitmain, also struggle to record high-profit margins despite exponential development in ASIC miners and Bitcoin mining equipment.\n\nLast month, Cointelegraph previously reported that the South Korean government has officially legalized and approved Bitcoin as a remittance method, similar to the Philippines.\n\nWhen the South Korean government and financial regulators fully legalize and regulate the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market, clarity on Bitcoin mining will also be provided.', 'Interview\n\nThis week news.Bitcoin.com spoke with Jack Kingston, a cryptocurrency trader from Melbourne, Australia, who lost $430,000 USD worth of bitcoins at the exchange BTC-e. Mr. Kingston was quite surprised when he tried to log in one day, and the exchange was “under maintenance.” However, the Australian trader was even more astonished to find out the U.S. government painted all of the platform’s users as criminals and took his money.\n\nAlso Read: BTC-e Operator Indicted and Connected With Missing Mt Gox Funds\n\n‘Can You Imagine the Horror?’\n\nBitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers about your story?\n\nJack Kingston (JK): I was trading on BTC-e, and there was nothing illegal tied to my funds. The only reason I was trading on BTC-e is because it was so easy. I’ve been trading cryptocurrencies for years, even during the Mt Gox debacle, but I lucked out on that one. I have an account with Poloniex as well, but I could not get second level verification, and that was making getting my funds difficult.\n\nI sent Poloniex an Australian passport which pretty much opens doors for me everywhere, and they have my email addresses and a bill for my living address. Yet, still 2-3 months pass, and I still cannot get better verification. Which means I can put $400,000 into an account, but you can only withdraw $2,000 a day.\n\nBTC-e was easy, and that was the only reason why I traded there, and the rest is sort of history man. A lot of the money came from a bunch of dash nodes that I sold, as you know a few Dash nodes are worth a lot of money. A lot of traders in the troll box were talking about selling for USD just before August 1, but then the shit hit the fan, and no one could do anything. This is where I found myself — Can you imagine the horror? Literally right after I sold these Dash nodes and the rest of the money I had on there.\n\nBC: So you lost close to a half a million dollars?\n\nJK: Yes a shitload of money, $430K USD. I’m not in the position of where I am struggling and such, but that’s neither here nor there. I started buying bitcoin when it was just a few dollars and sold at around $800 and then got into dash when it was very low — And dash has gone up twelve-fold since then whereas bitcoin was like 33 percent.\n\nBut the real reason I was trading so much money is because when you’re swinging $100,000 to 200,000 trades and bitcoin moves two percent you’re doing alright. For me, it’s a part time thing on the side.\n\nBC: Will you try to get the money back from the FBI?\n\nJK: Yeah if there’s any way I can access my money. I have email accounts, I can log into my account, I have proof the money there is mine. I’m not sure what I’m planning to do yet.\n\nSome of this shit I’ve been reading about in the news saying that ‘everyone who used BTC-e is laundering money’ is bullshit! I don’t know what kind of idiot comes up with that idea. The reality of it is BTC-e is much easier to use than many of the other exchanges. I like to trade, and I like to short bitcoin. There’s nothing wrong with me doing that.\n\nWhere does the U.S. get the jewels to says that I can’t trade with my own funds? That’s pretty unreal mate, if you think about it.\n\nHow do you feel about BTC-e?\n\nJK: There was never any problems short of the FBI coming in and destroying it. I don’t understand how the FBI can claim jurisdiction over my money. As far as the funds of innocent people who have money on there I don’t know why they won’t let people access it.\n\nIf BTC-e came back and refunded my money, I would continue to use them. I would trade with them after everything they’ve been through for them to be loyal to customers. There’s no reason why I wouldn’t use them.\n\nMaybe they had a bad egg in there, but that doesn’t give the U.S. the right to claim my hard earned money. It’s like the police force, you got some police that do the wrong thing, and if they get charged, you don’t shut down the whole police force.\n\nThe Elite Want Everything\n\nMr. Kingston says he is a little hopeful about BTC-e’s recent announcement and continues to tell me he has no qualms with the exchange whatsoever. It’s the U.S. government doing this and is not allowing him access to his funds, Mr. Kingston explains. There has been little to no information provided by U.S. law enforcement so far about the “purses” BTC-e says they confiscated.\n\nMr. Kingston tells me he’s sorry for talking so negative about the U.S. but thinks it’s really just a government issue that’s affecting us all.\n\n“It’s not just the U.S. mate, but they’re playing a big part. It’s a government thing worldwide. The elite want everything while us regular people flounder. The U.S. has no right to my money,” Mr. Kingston adds.\n\nWhat do you think about the Australian trader and his loss? Do you think the U.S. has a right to the funds on BTC-e?

08/05/2017,"[""On Aug. 5, less than four days after the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork, Bitcoin price surged drastically within a 24-hour period, recording a new all-time high at $3,212.\n\nPreviously, Bitcoin price broke the $3,000 mark mostly due to optimism surrounding the activation of the Bitcoin Core development team’s transaction malleability fix and scaling solution Segregated Witness (SegWit).\n\nHowever, shortly after that, a major market correction led Bitcoin price to fall to $1,900, and it stabilized at around $2,500 amidst uncertainty regarding SegWit and the execution of the BCH hard fork, which was initially proposed by Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Bitmain.\n\nMalleability\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, various SegWit experts including Blockstack co-founder Ryan Shea have described Bitcoin as a “Swiss Army Knife” of a solution, because of the wide of range of Bitcoin’s existing problems it solves.\n\nMost notably, SegWit is expected to scale the Bitcoin Blockchain by 75 percent while eliminating transaction malleability, which has recently become a major security issue for BCH.\n\nBitcoin Core developer Peter Todd emphasized the necessity of SegWit on the Bitcoin network following the announcement of ViaBTC on Aug. 5.\n\nYet another malleability attack! Whew, it's a good thing segwit activates in...\n\n\n\nOh right, #Bcash dev task #1 was to delete most of segwit. https://t.co/WsB6crB3ob — Peter Todd (@petertoddbtc) August 5, 2017\n\nAs various experts and developers including Paxos principal architect Jimmy Song have noted earlier this week, Bitcoin price is likely rising due to the imminence of SegWit activation. Since the mining community has already agreed to activate SegWit via Bitcoin Improvement Proposal BIP 91 and 141, the original SegWit proposal, SegWit is likely to be activated on the Bitcoin network by Aug. 14.\n\nAs the abovementioned date approaches, Bitcoin is expected to continuously increase in value, establishing new all-time highs.\n\nWhy is SegWit pushing Bitcoin price up?\n\nThe debate between the mining community and Bitcoin developers regarding the activation of SegWit has delayed scaling in Bitcoin for years. The first attempt to scale the network which was presented at the Hong Kong roundtable consensus event failed and it took over a full year since then for the Bitcoin industry, mining community and developers to come to a consensus to activate SegWit.\n\nMore importantly, the activation of SegWit marks the first major milestone in Bitcoin in terms of scaling, as Bitcoin has continuously operated within the 1 MB block size limit established by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto upon its launch in 2009.\n\nSegWit will also establish the infrastructure necessary for two-layer solutions such as Lightning Network to operate. The implementation of Lightning Network and other solutions including TumbleBit will further scale the Bitcoin network by enabling micropayments and applications that were not possible before.\n\nAnother driving factor of Bitcoin price is rising demand from institutional investors. This week, CBOE, the largest options exchange in the US announced that it will integrate Bitcoin futures contracts and options on its trading platform by partnering with regulated Bitcoin exchange Gemini.\n\nExecutive of the largest options exchange in U.S. tells CNBC, #bitcoin is here to stay.\n\n\n\nPositive outlook on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies! pic.twitter.com/czYNuEljVZ — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) August 4, 2017\n\nIn opposition to the prediction and analysis of researchers including Vinny Lingham, who has been relatively accurate with his Bitcoin price trend predictions in the past, Bitcoin price is maintaining its upward trend despite the recent execution of BCH."", ""Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University, recently weighed in on Bitcoin and the digital currency market in a recent post and video. He makes no pretense of being as technologically savvy as some, but his experience and knowledge in corporate finance and equity valuation gives him an interesting perspective.\n\nBitcoin’s successes\n\nProfessor Damodaran points out that\n\n“The success part of a cryptocurrency is what they’ve done in the market…Bitcoin has soared and markets have treated it very well.”\n\nToday the market capitalization of Bitcoin is around $53 billion. While that is relatively small in comparison to the market capitalization of companies like Amazon or Apple, Professor Damodaran says that this is a respectable number considering Bitcoin's humble origins.\n\nThe professor cites characteristics of Bitcoin:\n\nDecentralized verification\n\nComplete and open records\n\nAlmost incorruptible\n\nThe currency test\n\nMany economists have put Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through the “currency test.” The definition of currency is three-fold: it must be a unit of account, a medium of exchange and a store of value. Damodaran agrees with this definition but argues that currency is, in fact, a continuum.\n\nWhile the US Dollar, the Swiss Franc and the Venezuelan Bolivar are all currencies, one might reasonably conclude that one is better than another. The “quality” of a currency is fluid and can change over time.\n\nThe professor argues that\n\n“If you define success as a rise in market capitalization and popular interest, cryptocurrencies have clearly succeeded.”\n\nHowever, he qualifies these remarks by stating that in the long term, success is dependant on whether Bitcoin becomes a “good” currency.\n\nWhat makes a good currency\n\nProfessor Damodaran does not believe that there is any “perfect” currency: not gold, nor fiat, nor crypto. While gold holds tenure as a globally respected currency through the ages, it is difficult to use both as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The quality of fiat currencies varies greatly by which government backs them. Damodaran says “...without trust fiat currency is just paper.”\n\nWIth respect to cryptocurrency, he believes it is quite functional, being fungible, infinitely divisible and countable. However, cryptocurrency falls short as a medium of exchange. Very few retailers accept Bitcoin for payment. Those who do accept Bitcoin only do so because of intermediaries who immediately exchange the currency into fiat.\n\nBecause of Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, merchants list prices in dollars rather than Bitcoin. While high volatility is attractive to traders, it discourages mainstream adoption.\n\nAdoption hurdles\n\nProfessor Damodaran makes important conclusions as to why cryptocurrency is not being widely accepted for transactions:\n\nInertia: Cryptocurrencies are still new and it takes time for people to change their financial habits. It took almost twenty years for debit and credit cards to become widely accepted.\n\nVolatility: Attractive for traders, not so attractive for a medium of exchange.\n\nCompetition: With hundreds of cryptocurrencies available, there is competition and confusion.\n\nLess trading, more transacting\n\nRegardless of investor or speculative interest, Damodaran makes the reasonable argument that\n\n“A cryptocurrency that never gets used ...for transactions will not survive...in the long term. There can be no good ending to that story.”\n\nInstead of focusing on a currency’s speculative potential, Professor Damodaran thinks there needs to be more emphasis on dampening volatility and adding features which make digital currencies more useful for ordinary transactions.\n\nCryptocurrencies have risen meteorically in value due to speculation and trading. This might be part of the problem as there is a clear drive market for the tradability of these currencies. Damodaran feels that this is partly the fault of developers. Instead for mainstream adoption, there must be a focus on transactions as a goal."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Later, the price overcame all odds of the Hard Fork and moved to a new all-time high of $3328. The price traded with a lot of positive bias above $2500. It broke many hurdles on the way up such as the $3000 and $3100 levels. The most important break was above the $2920 pivot, which opened the doors for more gains.\n\nThe price traded as high as $3328 and currently placed well above the 100 simple moving average (H4).

On the downside, an initial support is around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $2644 low to $3328 high. However, the chances of any major declines are limited as long as the price is above $3000.\n\nThe 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $2644 low to $3328 high and the $2950 level may act as a strong support. The price is likely to continue higher and might soon break the $3300 level for a run towards $3500.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is strongly placed in the bullish zone.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently in the overbought zone.\n\nMajor Support Level – $3000\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $3300\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Taxes\n\nNode40 just released a software as a service offering (SAAS) to bring tax compliant bitcoiners an easy-to-use and “IRS-friendly” application. According to a Node40 press release, bitcoiners across the globe can begin reporting their taxable crypto-income. This way they do not risk tax evasion, under reporting or over reporting.\n\nAlso read: Germany’s Largest Bitcoin Exchange Hands Over Customer Data Voluntarily\n\nThis new software comes 4 months after the company provided a similar implementation for dash users. Node40 says the software will bring relief to bitcoin users, because prior to their implementation, not many options for tax settlement existed. Now crypto-users can report income to the taxman each year.\n\nPerry Woodin, CEO of NODE40 said, “Not only is blockchain accounting inherently complicated, it’s currently under heavy legal scrutiny. Since the IRS considers digital currency property, each and every input to a transaction has a potential gain or loss. Tracking the cost basis and days carried on every input to a transaction is simply not possible without sophisticated software. Nobody wants to think about gains and losses when purchasing goods or services, much less manually record transactions in a spreadsheet for future record keeping. NODE40 Balance allows digital currency owners to use the blockchain as the public ledger it was always intended to be, and provides users with the most accurate data for their reporting obligations at tax time.”\n\nIRS is Scrutinizing Possible Crypto-Tax Evaders\n\nWoodin is correct about the government agents getting more involved with cryptocurrency and hunting for tax evaders. Recently, the IRS and Coinbase have been involved in a pitched legal battle. IRS agents have been trying to gain access to Coinbase user data to determine if individuals have been paying taxes on cryptocurrency usage. This news surfaced because only 800 Americans reported bitcoin gains from 2014 to 2015. Woodin elaborated:\n\nThe IRS Coinbase summons motivated Dash owners to use our service and get their records in order for the 2016 tax season, and Bitcoin owners have well and truly been put on notice. The voluntary compliance rate for United States citizens is over 80%, which makes it obvious that most people take reporting their tax liability seriously; we believe bitcoin users haven’t had the right tools available yet. If the industry wants digital currency transactions to become commonplace, an integrated service like NODE40 Balance is essential. It validates the legitimacy of a new, complex form of transacting, and compliance is crucial to bringing a new technology into the mainstream.\n\nOther Tax Compliance Software\n\nPrior to the release of the Node40 “IRS-friendly” crypto software, there were very few options for bitcoiners to easily submit their taxes. Many people used FIFO, or first in first out method, which is inaccurate as a result of the high price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOne tax-friendly platform is called Libra, which syncs up with Coinbase, Bitpay, and Circle. It is a blockchain accounting solution that provides ease of use to the documentation collection process. Another option is Bitcoin Transaction Coordinator. It helps users maintain tax-compliant cryptocurrency documentation. It enables models for ease of customer use and bank deposit information. License for the software is free for up to 10 transactions per quarter, but a fee is assessed for more usage.\n\nTaxation in the Cryptocurrency Community\n\nHowever, even with all these “IRS-friendly” tax software options, many people in the ecosystem may feel that taxation is unnecessary and wrongful. They may have gotten into cryptocurrency for the sheer purpose of evading taxation. These class of people are usually called “crypto anarchists.”\n\nThey see the State as a thief and villain, and thus prefer to disobey and not pay taxes. Some even argue that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were created to bring money back to the people and prevent government extortion.\n\nTimothy May, in the Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, was one of them. He said, ” Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner…These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.”\n\nIn the end, there is no telling what people will decide to do, but “IRS-friendly” software is available for anyone interested in complying with current tax laws on bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nDo you believe this tax compliance software will be heavily used?

Rivetz Intl. today announced an advisory agreement with Parity Technologies Ltd (formerly known as Ethcore), the blockchain core technology company and creator of the Parity Ethereum software, to improve cyber security on the blockchain. Parity Technologies will guide Rivetz on the integration of cyber security controls into blockchain networks and smart contracts. The companies’ agreement signals a commitment to developing increased security standards within blockchain transactions, building a broader sense of confidence in blockchain networks and services.\n\n“We look forward to working with Gavin Wood and his team at Parity Technologies to improve security and consumer confidence in blockchain technology,” said Steven Sprague, founder of Rivetz. “Parity Technologies will ensure that Rivetz architecture can be efficiently and securely integrated with modern blockchain and smart contract technology.”\n\n“The Rivetz platform combines trusted computing with blockchain technology to offer provable cyber security controls for blockchain,” said Dr. Gavin Wood, founder of Parity Technologies and lead developer of the acclaimed Parity Ethereum client. “Every exchange and wallet would benefit from the utility of a provable hardware-based multi-sig or multi-factor authentication and secure display of transaction details for transaction instructions.”\n\nRivetz will provide peer-to-peer transactions with provable cyber controls that become a permanent part of the blockchain record, providing cryptographic proof that measured protections were in place before a transaction can execute. Rivetz is built on TEE technology that has already been delivered on over one billion devices containing ARM-compatible processors.\n\nMore details along with a technical white paper are available at: www.rivetzintl.com\n\nAbout Parity Technologies Ltd\n\nFor more information on Parity Technology Ltd please visit https://parity.io\n\nPress Contact Email Address\n\nlawrence@tokenmarket.net\n\nSupporting Link\n\ntokenmarket.net', 'In just four hours of early Saturday trading, the price of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged over 9% to a new record. At the time of this writing, one Bitcoin is valued at $3,169.90, well above the previous record of $3,000 set in June.\n\nBitcoin’s total market value is now more that $52 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap, and the return on Bitcoin investments made on January 1st of this year stands at nearly 220%.\n\nBitcoin will almost certainly remain a highly volatile asset, but its latest high reflects a major positive development. After years of heated debate over how to increase the Bitcoin network’s transaction capacity, major players have finally agreed on a compromise solution known as Segwit2x. That accomplishment is reassuring for those who may have begun to doubt the effectiveness of Bitcoin’s leaderless governance model.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe Segwit2x solution also seems to have driven Bitcoin’s price higher in a less direct way. On Tuesday, a faction who disagreed with the proposal spun off a so-called ‘fork’ of Bitcoin, known as Bitcoin Cash, which implemented a different fix. All holders of Bitcoin received matching Bitcoin Cash, which now trades as BCH on exchanges, and has a total current value of $3.75 billion.\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin Cash has declined steadily over the last two days as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have surged. That suggests investors are cashing out of the upstart fork, which has sparse support from miners and exchanges, and pumping their gains back into older, more trusted, and more widely-adopted cryptocurrencies.', 'Ever since Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, investigators have been puzzled by the disappearance of virtual currency worth hundreds of millions of dollars from its digital vaults.\n\nMt. Gox, which claimed it once hosted around 80 percent of bitcoin trading worldwide, closed in 2014 after admitting that 850,000 coins — worth around $480 million at the time — had disappeared from its vaults. Former CEO Mark Karpeles blamed the loss on hackers.\n\nKarpeles later claimed he had found some 200,000 of the lost coins in a “cold wallet” — a storage device, such as a memory stick, that is not connected to computers. And yet investigators were never able to trace the remaining 650,000 missing coins.\n\nPolice then arrested Karpeles in August 2015 over allegations of embezzlement and data manipulation. However, none of the charges he faces are related to the theft of the virtual currency.\n\nIn its opening statements at the trial in July, Karpeles’ defense team, headed by Nobuyasu Ogata, argued that Mt. Gox’s former CEO was only arrested after investigators failed to solve the case.\n\nOn the other side of the Pacific, however, U.S. authorities last month made some headway in the investigation, charging a 38-year-old Russian national of violating money laundering laws.\n\nActing on a warrant, police in Greece arrested Alexander Vinnik in Athens on July 25. It was multinational effort, involving investigators in Greece and U.S. agencies as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service and Homeland Security, among others.\n\nThe U.S. indictment filed on July 26 alleges that Vinnik was the owner and operator of BTC-e, one of the world’s largest digital currency exchanges. The investigation revealed that BTC-e received more than $4 billion worth of bitcoin over the course of its operation. Among violations outlined in the indictment, Vinnik is accused of using BTC-e and Tradehill, another U.S.-based exchange he owned, to process funds “obtained” from Mt. Gox between 2011 and 2014. BTC-e is believed to have processed more than 300,000 bitcoins in transactions that can be traced to the theft.\n\nKim Nilsson, a cybersecurity expert, has been investigating the collapse of Mt. Gox for the past two years. “Vinnik is our chief suspect for involvement in the Mt. Gox theft (or the laundering of the proceeds thereof),” he wrote in a July 27 blog post on WizSec. “This is the result of years of patient work, and these findings were surely independently uncovered by other investigators as well. Everyone who worked on the case have patiently kept quiet while forwarding findings to law enforcement, so as not to tip suspects off and to maximize the chances of arrests.”\n\nA special agent working on the case in the United States said he was surprised that Karpeles had been arrested in Japan.\n\n“Mark Karpeles may be a terrible businessman and may have run his company into the ground,” the agent said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “He may have realized the BTC (bitcoin) were taken earlier than announced. But we have known for a long time that his firm, like Bitcoinica, was targeted by Eurasian hackers and the stolen BTC cashed out via BTC-e. Karpeles cooperated with the Silk Road investigation. He cooperated with this investigation. In our eyes, he’s a good guy and he hasn’t always been rewarded for doing the right thing.”\n\nSilk Road is an online black market that was using bitcoins to trade guns and narcotics. In fact, corrupt Drug Enforcement Administration and Secret Service agents not only sold Karpeles out to the criminal organization running the platform, they froze Mt. Gox funds worth $5 million and seized the firm’s accounts. They also used Mt. Gox to launder the bitcoin they stole while working on the Silk Road case.\n\n“We know we’ve got the right guy in this money laundering investigation,” the agent said. “We sort of wonder why the Japanese police arrested Karpeles rather than tried to work with him. But, then again, we don’t really understand the Japanese justice system.”\n\nI’d be surprised if they were alone in thinking that.\n\nDark Side of the Rising Sun is a monthly column that takes a behind-the-scenes look at news in Japan.', 'It seems that the birth of Bitcoin Cash has been a catalyst that helped push the price of bitcoin, or bitcoin proper, to the moon, as it surged from around $2,600 in the beginning of the week to record an all time high of $3,270 at the time of writing of this article. As bitcoin price has just hit an all time historical high, chances are big that we can see it head North to even much higher levels. However, note that volatility is extremely high at the moment, and even though the market is bullish, a price correction attempt will emerge sooner or later, as speculators and traders collect their profits.\n\nPowerful Bullish Rally on the 4 Hour BTCUSD Chart:\n\nLet’s examine the 4 hour BTCUSD chart from Bitfinex, while plotting the Williams Alligator and MACD indicators (look at the below chart). We can note the following:\n\nA bullish wave took over the market on the 2nd of August, and higher highs have been recorded throughout the successive trading sessions, since then. The rate of rise increased markedly after breaking through the $3,000 price level, which was bitcoin’s all time high that was recorded on the 11st of June. This reflects the depth of buy orders within the order book beyond this critical price level.\n\nWe will plot a Fibonacci retracement that extends between the low recorded on the 16th of July ($1.825.5) and the high recorded earlier today ($3,420.7) to determine key support levels that will be the target reversal points of potential downwards price correction attempts. So, as shown on the above chart, we can expect bitcoin price to drop down to $2,967.8, which coincides with the 23.6% Fib retracement, if downwards price correction takes over before heading North to even higher price levels.\n\nRight now, the market is extremely bullish as shown by the alignment of the SMAs of Williams Alligator indicator. As you may notice, the green SMA is on top, the red SMA is in the middle and the blue SMA is on the bottom. Also, the three SMAs exhibit a steep upwards slope which reflects the strength of the bullish wave. Moreover, the MACD indicator is exhibiting a powerful bullish signal, as it values around 122 at the moment and the blue positive trend line is above the red negative trend line and both of them are sloping in an upwards direction. Accordingly, we can expect bitcoin price to continue rising towards the $3,800 price level within the upcoming week, yet as we mentioned earlier, a downwards price correction attempt can take over for a while, as speculators and traders close their long positions to collect their profits.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBitcoin price skyrocketed earlier today to exceed the $3,300 mark for the first time ever since the genesis block was mined. Our technical analysis is in favor of continuation of the current bullish wave, so we can see bitcoin price reach the $3,800 price level within a week or so; however, a downwards price correction attempt can take over for a short period, before heading North to even higher levels.\n\nChart from Bitfinex, hosted on Tradingview.com']"
08/06/2017,"['Exchanges are announcing to allow the Bitcoin Cash deposits and withdrawal, which caused Bitcoin Cash price fall. By contrast, Bitcoin price has moved up.\n\nThe fork aftermath\n\nOn Aug. 1 Bitcoin was traded in the long-term $3,000 channel. Technically, the movement needed a pullback, as it had larger scale resistance. The fork resulted in the instant correction for Bitcoin price. The buyers’ prevailed, which is proved by the purchase volumes. There was also an attempt to form a reversal down at the peak of the correction. But you need to remember, that a reversal shatters the previous trend. Price movement is the result of the market demand and supply. So for a reversal, the demand volumes at the correction peak need to be at least equal to the ones, formed previously at this level.\n\nTo conclude, there were all signs for the price to go up.\n\nLong-term growth remains\n\nBitcoin seems to be conquering the world step by step. It was announced that by the end of the year or in early 2018, Bitcoin will be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nAnd the price continues its long-term growth. Providing the trend structure keeps on, the $3,500 seems even more plausible. The current key level is placed at the largest trading volume around $2,800, the point, where the upward trend might break.\n\nIn case there are big sales and the price falls into this zone, no downward reversal will mean the upward trend is still supported. Reversal at the $2,800 channel could trigger the price collapse to the lowest resistance line, around $2,250.\n\nMost likely scenarios\n\nThe maximum pullback level of the upward trend is at $1,830 to $2,800 range. On condition there’s no reversal down during the pullback, Bitcoin has all the chances to go higher.', 'Rumors are swirling about a trader with nearly unlimited funds who is manipulating the Bitcoin markets. This trader, nicknamed ""Spoofy,"" received his nom de guerre because of his efforts to “spoof” the market, primarily on Bitfinex.\n\nWhat is spoofing?\n\nAccording to the Dodd-Frank act, spoofing is the practice of:\n\n""Bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution""\n\nIn other words, spoofers place a large buy order just below other buy orders, or a large sell order just above other sell orders. The idea is to make traders think that somebody with deep pockets is getting ready to buy or sell, in hopes of moving the market. If traders see a sell order of 2000 Bitcoin, for instance, they may rush to panic sell before the whale crashes the price.\n\nThe catch is this: If the price approaches the spoofer’s order, he immediately cancels it. Spoofing is actually illegal, but as Bitcoin markets are largely unregulated, it’s quite common. What is unusual in this case is the enormous bankroll that Spoofy has at his disposal. He regularly places orders approaching $60 mln.\n\nEven more unusual is that most of Spoofy’s activity occurs on a single exchange: Bitfinex. This exchange came under fire earlier this spring when Wells Fargo cut off their banking ties. As a result, it’s virtually impossible to deposit fiat on Bitfinex without going through intermediaries. Spoofy has massive sums of both fiat and Bitcoin on that exchange, and is likely one of the only traders who does.\n\nOther tactics\n\nSpoofy has a number of weapons in his arsenal, including spoofing and wash trading. As BitCrypto’ed points out in a recent blog post:\n\n“Spoofy makes the price go up when he wants it to go up, and Spoofy makes the price go down when he wants it to go down, and he’s got the coin… both USD, and Bitcoin, of course, to pull it off, and with impunity on Bitfinex.”\n\nThe BitCrypto’ed blog also describes Spoofy’s wash trades, when he trades with himself by either selling into his own buy orders or vice versa. Wash trading at high volumes can induce a frenzy of buying or selling, as other traders respond to the high trading volume. Spoofy can execute wash trades at very low cost, about $1,000 per million dollars of volume.\n\nWhen Bitfinex announced its plan to distribute Bitcoin Cash, it initially planned to distribute Bitcoin Cash to holders of short positions. Immediately following that announcement, a single trader short sold tens of thousands of Bitcoin all at once. It’s likely this trader was Spoofy himself, planning on acquiring as much Bitcoin Cash as possible.\n\nThe large number of shorts on Bitfinex also led many to believe that an epic short squeeze was coming, and many Bitcoin traders purchase coins in expectation of this. Suddenly, he “claimed” all of his own shorts, closing them using his own Bitcoin. The number of shorts dropped drastically without affecting the price at all.\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe identity of Spoofy remains a mystery. He may be a single trader, a group of colluding traders or even the Bitfinex management themselves. He sometimes seeks to drop Bitcoin price, and sometimes acts to increase it.\n\nNot just Bitfinex\n\nSpoofy’s activity also drives the price on other exchanges, as arbitrage takes place. Because BItcoin is so thinly traded, a single large “whale” can potentially move the entire market. While Spoofy is certainly exercising outsized control over the Bitcoin price, it is uncertain how much of an affect this is having on the markets. The price is currently rising, having finally surmounted the $3,000 barrier. The only problem? Nobody knows how much of this increase is organic and sustainable, and how much is due to the market manipulation of Spoofy and others.', ""Bitcoin price continued in its upward movement by conquering the $3,000 mark. This happened just days after the cryptocurrency was forked and Bitcoin Cash emerged.\n\nBitcoin is the first and always leading cryptocurrency. According to Kumar Gaurav, Founder of Cashaa - Auxesis Group, it had the longest time to successfully establish and mature when compared to any other cryptocurrency.\n\nThis success cannot only be seen in the continuous growth over the past years but also in the speed of recovery after so-called “crisis.” The fork has eventually turned out in favor of Bitcoin, with investors dumping Bitcoin Cash, buying more Bitcoin and altcoins, with almost all top 100 cryptocurrencies gaining massively.\n\nOther reasons outlined by Gaurav for his positive outlook towards Bitcoin include the fact that more institutional money is going into Bitcoin, with the price increase in itself attracting more investors.\n\nHe tells Cointelegraph:\n\n“There is increasing legal recognition, increasing media attention, a growing usability and acceptance, while the original, political reasons leading to Bitcoin's popularity are strong as ever. Most recently the EU announcing the possibility for it to freeze bank accounts to prevent banks from failing, reminding of what caused the first ever Bitcoin rally, the Cyprus savings raid.”\n\nBitcoin will be $10,000 in three years\n\nGaurav continues by noting that when looking at what Bitcoin has already become during its early years, despite having only a tiny fraction of the population alone supporting it for just some of its many advantages, most important of which is the freedom it brings to people in any troubled system, then we can only imagine how big of an impact we are starting to see now with established institutions and mainstream media finally embracing it.\n\nHe also notes that over the past years, Bitcoin price can be seen as a parabolic curve, which sooner or later will take it to over $10,000 in the next three years.\n\nBitcoin is not controlled by anybody\n\nAnother strong believer in Bitcoin, Simon Dixon, CEO BnkToTheFuture.com, emphasizes that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency in the world that is not controlled by anybody, is secured by the largest network of computer power in the world and has a sound monetary policy.\n\nDixon explains to Cointelegraph that Bitcoin has faced many challenges the latest of which was scaling. He notes that because nobody controls Bitcoin, it took three years of debate to reach the next phase for scaling solutions given the huge increase in demand over the years.\n\nNow with more scaling, Bitcoin can fill the huge demand that it is receiving as more and more use cases emerge and large pockets of money enter the market.\n\nDixon also notes that Bitcoin will definitely encounter more challenges in the course of its development as the community works to improve scalability further, solve more privacy problems and other features the community feel is important.\n\nThere is an increasing demand for Bitcoin\n\nAbout the rally in Bitcoin price, Dixon says that we are pushing past $3,000 as it has been proven that Bitcoin truly is controlled by nobody. No matter how hard people try, the money supply is being sucked up by higher and higher demand as Bitcoin becomes more and more useful.\n\nHe also says:\n\n“I remain bullish as alternatives to Bitcoin keep adding value to Bitcoin and proving there is only one store of value in the crypto market. At the end of the day, people speculate and invest in alternatives, but there is only Bitcoin that they run to as a store of value to lock in any profits or losses they make from alternatives.”\n\nDixon concludes by noting that central banks and governments will soon realize that holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet could be a wise move as financial institutions are realizing today. They will also create their alternatives to compete, but they will all be controlled, centralized and follow a similar monetary policy as traditional fiat money, providing more value to Bitcoin.\n\n“This type of financial innovation will only happen once in many people's life time,” he says.\n\nBitcoin is robust and diversified\n\nFor Michael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins, ignoring market hysteria and looking just at the fundamentals of what Bitcoin is clarifies its value proposition.\n\nVogel describes Bitcoin as a very robust and diversified cryptocurrency. He notes that the fact that Bitcoin has a variety of use cases which include remittances, online payments, store of value, Blockchain applications etc., makes it clear that Bitcoin is not a one-trick pony.\n\nCoupled with the free marketing and publicity that Bitcoin receives in the mainstream media (even if mainstream publicity is negative, it still contributes to Bitcoin awareness), and it is clear that Bitcoin is the gold-standard in cryptocurrency.\n\n$3,700 is in sight\n\nVogel likens the development of Bitcoin to how the internet fared in its early years. Vogel notes that even the Internet itself has gone through its own scaling challenges beginning from the days of dial-up Internet.\n\nHe concludes by predicting even a higher price rally for the cryptocurrency in the near future:"", 'When Ether reaches a price of $2,000, we are looking at a market capitalization of around $188 bln. Although this is significantly higher than today, an eight-time increase, it is still relatively small if we compare it to the market capitalization of a company like Facebook, $492 bln.\n\nCointelegraph attempts to analyze what events need to occur in order for Ether to break this mark.\n\nRaiden network\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum network is limited to around 20 transactions per second. This is twice as much as Bitcoin can handle. However, if we are looking at a future where Ethereum is used as a daily form of payment, this isn’t enough.\n\nThe Raiden Network is aiming to solve this problem. Its developers are building an off-chain solution for Ethereum payments which scales linearly with the number of participants. The network could in the future handle over 1,000,000 transactions per second.\n\nAdditionally, it will allow decreasing transaction cost by seven orders of magnitude, making true micro-transactions on Ethereum a reality.\n\nEther becomes easier to acquire and spend\n\nSo far there are around 60 active cryptocurrency exchanges. This number is growing every single month as digital assets become more and more attractive. However, the average American is not comfortable with buy and sell limits and trading charts.\n\nTherefore, new alternatives need to arise that allow the crowd to acquire Ether. Companies like Dether are working on platforms that allow interested parties to purchase Ether directly with cash. This is definitely a big step in the right direction.\n\nAt the time I’m writing this article, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined sits at around $110 bln. However, most owners of currencies like Ether and Bitcoin don’t actively spend their coins; they use them as an investment.\n\nIn order to see Ether at $2,000, more people need to start using it as a form of payment, and more vendors need to start accepting it. This would prove that Ether is a viable method of value exchange.\n\nZk-SNARKs\n\nMembers of the Ethereum Research and Development team and ZCash are collaborating on a research project addressing privacy on the Blockchain.\n\nThe integration of the tech behind ZCash into Ethereum is a key milestone. It will allow to completely anonymize transactions and certain components of smart contracts. This would make Ethereum ready to be used in scenarios we can’t even imagine yet.\n\nA possible application of this privacy protocol could be in presidential elections or auctions. Once zk-SNARKs is fully integrated, the results of an election or auction could be verified by any observer of the Blockchain, but the individual votes or bids are not revealed.\n\nICOs become preferred method of funding, and solid regulations are in place\n\nSo far, over $1 bln was invested in ICOs by contributors from all over the world. That’s a very impressive figure keeping in mind that this method of funding was practically non-existent before the launch of Ethereum in 2015.\n\nMost startups that hold an ICO, issue Ethereum-based tokens. Therefore, it was also one of the most important growth catalysts for the network in early 2017. ICOs have proven to be an extremely efficient method of funding, enabling hundreds of startups to raise enough money to start operations.\n\nThe SEC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore have clarified in many instances that some of the tokens sold through crowdsales are actually securities and need to adhere to its respective regulations. Despite this, most ICOs still issue tokens that would be declared illegal by most authorities.\n\nOnce this gray area is solved, Ether will likely see a lot of new money flowing in, and more investors getting involved in token sales.\n\nEEA members switch from private chain to public chain\n\nThe Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) connects companies with Ethereum experts. Some notable members of the alliance are Microsoft, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and Intel. The objective of the EEA is to solve the problems of large corporations using the Ethereum Blockchain and the Ether token.\n\nUntil now, most of the integrations these companies have built are working on private chains. However, private chains don’t interact directly with the Ethereum network and therefore don’t use Ether.\n\nIt is fair to assume that just like there was a massive shift from Intranets to the Internet, there might also be a transition from private chains to public chains once the technology is ready.\n\nThis would considerably increase the daily transactions that go through the Ethereum network.\n\nProof of Stake (PoS)\n\nThe current supply of Ether is around 93 mln coins. Vitalik Buterin has pointed out many times that the total supply will probably never surpass 100 mln if PoS is correctly integrated.\n\nIf Ethereum switches successfully to PoS, there will be a significant drop in the daily issuance rate of Ether. This means that less Ether will be created every day, thus reducing the total supply of the coin.\n\nAdditionally, once PoS is activated, Ether investors can opt to use their stake to verify other transactions in the network. In exchange, they will receive rewards paid out in this cryptocurrency.\n\nThis will very likely attract a new wave of investors seeking cash flow producing assets.\n\nUntil now, $2,000 Ether is still just fuel for our imagination. However, the technology has very solid fundamentals and many announcements to come.\n\nWith the support of a growing community, everything is possible.', 'Dear John: I really think you missed the boat on bitcoin.\n\nYou assume bitcoin is just money, when in fact it has many other uses. It’s here to stay, and will disrupt every industry, including governance.\n\nBitcoin ATMs are an easy on/off ramp, since due to regulations in the US it’s very hard to get bitcoin today. If you look at all the companies (including all banks) that are looking into utilizing this technology, I think you may want to rethink your view.\n\nSantander Bank alone will save $20 billion in internal transfers. E.G.\n\nDear E.G.: You are referring to a column I wrote about bitcoin being used to launder money from illegal activities.\n\nIt just so happens that last week a US jury indicted a Russian man for operating a digital bitcoin exchange that he allegedly used to launder more than $4 billion for people involved in crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking. The guy’s name is Alexander Vinnik, and he was arrested in a small beachside village in northern Greece. This is all according to a report by Reuters.\n\nUS officials alleged, “Vinnik and his firm received more than $4 billion in bitcoin and did substantial business in the US without allowing appropriate protocols to protect against money laundering and other crimes.”\n\nSo that pretty much confirms what I wrote about the sudden growth of bitcoin ATMs throughout the city.\n\nBut let’s also look at the illogical stance you are taking. You say that bitcoin is going to “disrupt every industry, including governance.”\n\nIf that were so — if governments were going to be disrupted — why would governments allow bitcoin and other digital currency to survive? They wouldn’t.\n\nWill there someday be a universal currency used by all countries? And will it be digital?\n\nProbably. But that’s not going to happen until bitcoin and the others control the illicit activities they are condoning, and until someone backs these “currencies” with something other than the full faith and credit of nothing.\n\nIn other words, eventually governments will band together to create and back a digital currency. And it probably won’t be bitcoin.\n\nDear John: The only way to make going to the doctor affordable is to get rid of the insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWhen I first began working full-time in 1985, I went to a neighborhood doctor, God rest his soul.\n\nFor a $20 visit and another $20 for a prescription, he got me well.

This is at the request of one customer who contacted us. Plus, there is a constant demand from entrepreneurs across Ukraine who want to engage in this business, that is, buy terminals and sell cryptocurrencies.”\n\nThe plan\n\nAccording to Chobanian, the planned 150 Cryptomat BTMs will be able to support the sale of such cryptocurrencies as Ether, Waves, Golos and Bitcoin. Customers in the country will be able to buy the digital currencies using the country’s official currency hryvnia.\n\nChobanian also claimed that the BTMs do not need user identification and can be used by all types of customers.

Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nWhat actually happened was what cooler heads predicted. The fork would unlock new value, giving everyone exactly what they want. Thus restoring confidence and optimism, leading to a price rise.\n\nIn this case, the price rise has been higher than many thought. That’s probably because bitcoin has become just a bit more interesting and cool. The currency has proved now you can’t control it. It has also proved its decentralized nature is inherent rather than a point of debate.\n\nRather than smoke filled rooms or closed door meetings, bitcoin has now shown its true governance in action. That of giving the free market exactly what it wants by forking, placing both currencies under its mercy.\n\nThat is something that has never happened before in this manner and shows the full power of bitcoin and any public blockchain based currency. You can’t choose your centrally issued fiat. With bitcoin, you get exactly what you want and no one can deny you such right.\n\nIf you want full blocks, empty blocks, or no blocks at all with IOTA, if you want smart contracts or simple multi-sig scrypt, Lightning Network or Raiden, Rootstock or the EON lot, you can have what you want in the great cryptocurrency amazon.\n\nWhere birds have flashy colors and some flowers even eat meat, where lions rule and snakes bite too, where elephants roam above them all yet get terrified by a little mouse.\n\nThe mix in this space isn’t too much different. The wall-street testosterone pumped jockey hangs around with glassy nerds, looked upon by flashy artists with the swindlers all around.\n\nNo wonder we are seeing what looks like a sharp V recovery with the combined market cap of all digital currencies nearing its all-time high of around $116 billion. Currently standing at just under $113 billion.\n\nThat’s more than many household brands. Eth and Bitcoin Cash have not yet even had their all-time bull run. So some are wondering, billions were cool last century, can this space manage a trillion?\n\nI’m not one for hype, but the millenial generation is now entering a stage where their lives and careers are starting to stabilize after the confused teenage years and rocky early 20s.\n\nThey are now getting a stable income, maybe even settling down, with real purchasing power – perhaps higher than any other generation. They experienced first hand how the Middle East wars robbed them from some of the teenage fun. How the bank collapse ruined for many of their friends the early out of university years.\n\nSo when they look at gold they may think it outdated. When they look at stocks they may think it too stiff upper lip, when they look at cryptocurrencies they may think it as fun.\n\nBecause they’re not just buying something, but becoming part of a movement. A movement that returns money to the people. A movement that brings back investing to the masses, taking it off from the restricted and secluded VC ivory towers.\n\nA movement where we are in charge. We, the free market. Where we have liberty and choice by just a click to get the exact thing we like and if its not on offer we’ll just code it and wala – it is now.\n\nThe young, those currently in university or just about leaving, will follow them. The old, those in the 50s or 60s, will hear them, because they are right. As such, real power has or is about to shift to the millennial generation, the late 20s early 30 somethings.\n\nA generation that has found a solution in digital currencies where they may argue about bitcoin or bitcoin cash or ethereum or whatever else, but they all know it’s all just fun, not much different than brothers fickles.\n\nFor while some might see hate, I see passionate love between the three main ones. Sure, there are some currencies that objectively deserve polemics, but bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, some of the tokens, deserve the highest respect.\n\nBecause all three are pioneers in a very new world we are building. All three have sound bases, good foundations, great aims and either could lead. More importantly, the three currencies are all focused on actually achieving something that goes beyond mere price.\n\nThat is, they employ no tricks, through marketing or otherwise. They are not a get rich project, here today, gone as you sleep. They are serious attempts towards providing a solution to the problems the millennial generation saw and experienced as they were coming of age.\n\nTheir competition, therefore, although it may appear ruthless, it is in fact friendly. Long may it live and long may liberty reign above all three and above us all for a very, very long time.']"
08/07/2017,"['Bitcoin hit a record high of $3,402 on Monday. The cryptocurrency\'s value is surging a week after bitcoin split into two. While bitcoin has hit new heights, bitcoin cash, the offshoot also known as bitcash, has been tumbling. ""All that money that seemingly came out of thin air to pump up the value of Bitcash is now being fed right into Bitcoin,"" Mati Greenspan, an analyst at the trading platform eToro, told Business Insider\'s Oscar Williams-Grut. ""Bitcash has fallen from its peak of $12 billion all the way down below $4 billion this morning."" Given the currency\'s alternative nature, the average person still may not understand how buying and selling works. Using the app Coinbase, which lets anyone trade bitcoins for a small fee, we decided to find out. A brief warning: If you\'re going to do this, tell your bank you\'re about to buy bitcoin. More on that later. View As: One Page Slides\n\nThis is what the Coinbase app looks like on an iPhone.\n\nWhen you first open the app, you\'re presented with the latest price of bitcoin and its change within a certain period. You can see in the chart below how wild the latest moves have been. (We bought bitcoin in early January, when it was valued much lower.)\n\nI happen to be one of the many who have never traded bitcoin before. There\'s a level of wariness in buying into the cryptocurrency world.\n\nHowever, Coinbase\'s interface makes it simple to enter the personal information needed to create your account.\n\nUser-friendliness quickly hit a snag. When I put in my address, the app didn\'t recognize I had already selected it from the autofill menu. I couldn\'t proceed unless I switched to the desktop app.\n\nSo switch I did. From the desktop portal, I could easily enter more identifying info.\n\nThe final step before entering my financial information was two-step verification for security, which Coinbase quickly sent to my phone.\n\nI decided to give the app another try and opted to use my debit card to buy the bitcoin.\n\nEntering all my information was just as straightforward as everything else. The problem was that I couldn\'t exit this screen. Neither the ""buy"" nor ""not now"" option registered. I had to press the X and start all over.\n\nUltimately, and frustratingly, it was back to the desktop. So far, the actual process of buying bitcoin was simple — the app itself was my only nemesis. My $50 ended up buying 0.0524 of one bitcoin.\n\nNo looking back! (Until I sell, of course.)\n\nOh. It appeared the price was falling pretty fast the morning I decided to buy. I went back to try again, doing my best to outrun the falling price.\n\nI own bitcoin! Well, a small fraction of a bitcoin. But now this means I can sit on my hypothetical tiny pile of cryptocurrency and hope it amasses value.\n\nInstead, I decide to sell off immediately. (But not before shedding a single tear for the 12 cents I\'ve already had to part with.)\n\nTo sell bitcoin, Coinbase requires users to pair their bank account with the app — a credit or debit card won\'t suffice.\n\nSo I scrolled through the options to pick my bank.\n\nAnd we\'re back to the desktop. When I tried to sell the bitcoin, the app told me that either the amount was invalid or I couldn\'t pay with the given method. I didn\'t understand what that meant and didn\'t want to enter a wrong number.\n\nLuckily, the online experience is much smoother. My bank account showed up right where it should have, and I sold the bitcoin just as I bought it.\n\nSince Coinbase wasn\'t linked to my bank account, the transaction would take a few days to process.\n\nA small hiccup: When I went to sell the bitcoin, I had to estimate the amount. The numbers were inconsistent in certain places depending on the bitcoin value or the dollar value. I ended up with one penny left over.', 'First there was the theft – then the coins stood still.\n\nFor the past 10 weeks, three bitcoin address containing more than $140,000-worth of the cryptocurrency have been given more scrutiny than possibly any others on the blockchain. Now held by the hacker or hackers behind the WannaCry ransomware attack, the funds were sent by victims from more than 150 countries in an attempt to unlock their computers from the malicious encryption software.\n\nBut last week, something stirred – and increments of $20,000-worth of bitcoin began moving into seven new addresses. Slowly, the three addresses that had held the attention of the world began to empty. The question was, where were the coins headed?\n\nThat the subject would gain such attention perhaps isn’t surprising. At the time of the incident in May, WannaCry attracted global headlines, and bitcoin got a share of the blame.\n\nAs bitcoin\'s value grew over the course of the year, and as it attracted a new class of investors, the incident emerged as a black mark – the latest reminder of how the technology can be used to nefarious ends.\n\n""There\'s an implication that [blockchains] are well-suited for criminal activity,"" said Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician at Blockstream. ""Because blockchains make it cheaper to move money around the world quickly and privately, there\'s this meme out there that it\'s making it easier for criminals to do criminal things.""\n\nAs such, for many industry observers, the incident remains a case study with consequences.\n\nShould the criminals be able to cash out the funds, it could be deemed as the latest evidence cryptocurrency can be exploited, despite years of regulations and rule-making.\n\nAnd if the criminals don’t or can\'t? That might signal that a maturing set of startups, and the nature of the technology itself, are more able to guard against the type of activity so frowned upon by the powers that be.\n\nA new blockchain in the mix\n\nIn context, the fact that the coins are moving at all is something of a shock.\n\nAs early as May, it was widely felt the hackers would be unlikely to move the bitcoins for a long time, if at all, as it would be difficult to cash out on major exchanges that monitor stolen funds to meet regulatory standards.\n\nAgain, there\'s also the open nature of bitcoin\'s blockchain. Those interested in watching the coins move were gifted an easy task, as the WannaCry hackers used only three addresses to collect the ransoms.\n\nBut, in an evolving blockchain sector that seems to continue to find new ways to surprise, it could be other blockchains that end up closing the dramatic story.\n\nOf the total funds, $36,000 in bitcoin has now moved through Switzerland-based cryptocurrency startup Shapeshift and into the open-source, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, monero.\n\nAnd the switch to the monero blockchain could make things complicated, since it uses several different means to obscure the identity of its users.\n\nCreated in 2014, monero is best known for its innovative use of ""ring signatures,"" which are utilized to mix user public keys and account keys, creating a ""ring"" of possible signers so outside observers can’t link a signature to a specific user.\n\nThe cryptocurrency protocol also uses ""stealth addresses,"" which allow the recipient to publish a single address, but the coins are sent to a separate, unique addresses.\n\nUnlikely to get away\n\nAs a result, many are now wondering if monero changes the game.\n\nHere the answer is less clear. Monero\'s mechanisms only involve mixing addresses with a small number of other participants, which could generate privacy gaps.\n\nAnd other mechanisms for evading detection, such as coin mixing, and even other privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies like Zcash, all suffer from this lack of scale, according to Poelstra.\n\nZcash, for example, allows people to use ""shielded addresses,"" which make the output of a transaction look indistinguishable from every other output.\n\nBut according to Poelstra, because of the computational power needed to use shielded addresses, many people aren\'t using them. So, again the pool is too small for perfect anonymity.\n\nWhether the hackers are eventually captured is a product of how much information they leak, and how much money and time law enforcement is willing to spend using that leaked information to track them, he concluded.\n\nUltimately, current options for the hackers seem limited.\n\nGiven that no blockchain technologies provide complete digital privacy, ultimately, the attackers may be taking big risks in their attempt to finally get away with their loot.\n\nPoelstra concluded:\n\n""I don’t know whether the WannaCry hackers will get caught or not, but I do know they will not completely hide their tracks; there is information that will leak.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stakes in Blockstream, Shapeshift and ZECC (Zcash).\n\nHacker image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Among the top 15 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, BitConnect Coin points out the branding issue with Bitcoin Cash and the confusion the new altcoin will create if certain exchanges decide to list it as BCC.\n\nThe upcoming hard fork of the Bitcoin network is the topic of discussion among many in the cryptocurrency community. With the fork scheduled to happen on August 1, 2017, many exchange platforms have indicated their support for the Bitcoin Cash fork, which they say will be listed as BCC. These exchange platforms have overlooked the strong presence of BitConnect Coin in the cryptocurrency market as they focus on the developing situation at the Bitcoin front.\n\nBitConnect is concerned about the potential confusion caused by listing of Bitcoin Cash as BCC on exchanges, including the ones that are already supporting BitConnect Coin. The cryptocurrency urge exchanges and trading platforms to list Bitcoin Cash under an alternative symbol to ensure that traders don\'t get confused between BitConnect Coin and Bitcoin Cash. Else, they could end up purchasing or selling one, instead of another.\n\nIf the issue with ""BCC"" symbol is not resolved soon, the confusion is bound to create lots of problems in the coming weeks.\n\nSince the past nine months, BitConnect Coin has registered a phenomenal growth, out-performing the growth of the world\'s top altcoin, Ethereum. In the previous three months, the cryptocurrency has registered over 700% growth, which has been stable compared to that of other altcoins. BitConnect Coin continues to exhibit a constant growth, thanks to the dedicated team and a loyal, rapidly growing community.\n\nWhile hoping for the symbol issue to be resolved soon, BitConnect urges the community members to be aware of the possibility of two altcoins sharing the same ticker, at least on few exchanges starting August 1. These coins have a vast difference in values and users should make sure that they are trading the right coin to prevent any losses.\n\nCommunity members can also use BitConnect Exchange platform to buy/sell BitConnect Coin (BCC) directly to/from each other.\n\nAbout BitConnect Coin\n\nBitConnect Coin is an open source, peer-to-peer, community driven decentralized cryptocurrency that allows people to store and invest their wealth in a non-government controlled currency and even earn a substantial interest on the investment.\n\nLearn more about BitConnect Coin at – https://bitconnectcoin.co/\n\nAccess BitConnect Coin Guide at – https://bitconnectcoin.co/guide/10/How-To-Set-Up-BitConnect-Coin-Wallet-on-Windows-Operating-System\n\nBuy BitConnect Coin here – https://bitconnect.co/user/trade?Market=BCC\n\nTrade BitConnect Coin on Nova Exchange – https://novaexchange.com/\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: Vindee\n\nContact Email: bitconnect@tutanota.com\n\nContact Phone: +16415696739\n\nLocation: Ashford, England\n\nBitConnect is the source of this content.

The stocks of companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which make chips used to mine, or produce, bitcoin — a process that involves heaps of computers solving complex equations — have surged alongside the cryptocurrency, destroying the short positions.\n\nShort sellers betting against those two companies have lost a combined $1.8 billion this year as Nvidia has skyrocketed by 57% and AMD has climbed by 16%, according to data provided by the financial analytics firm S3 Partners.\n\nAnd the fallout is already beginning.\n\nThe Dallas-based hedge fund Carlson Capital\'s $1 billion Black Diamond Thematic fund lost 14.2% this year through July, and it blamed bitcoin for the hit, according to a client update reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe fund chose chipmakers as its top short theme earlier this year, citing ""high inventories, double ordering, massive capex supply responses and actual pockets of weakening demand in smartphones, autos, and the Chinese optical market.""\n\nNeedless to say, that hasn\'t translated into weak share prices — and now Carlson has an ax to grind with the massively popular cryptocurrencies it sees keeping the space afloat to an unsustainable degree.\n\n""The sector has turned into something of a bubble characterized best by the surge in GPU stocks, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia, driven by a cryptocurrency mania,"" portfolio managers Richard Maraviglia and Matthew Barkoff wrote in the fund\'s second-quarter investor letter. ""We believe the other side of this incredibly powerful consensus move in technology will be very profitable for us but to date, it has been a significant drag on performance.""\n\nAs for those directly trading bitcoin, the ride has been bumpy but ultimately quite lucrative. It\'s up by more than 200% in 2017 alone, minting big profits for traders willing to take a chance on such a speculative entity.\n\nBut by no means does the burgeoning cryptocurrency mania start and end with bitcoin. There\'s also ether, the bitcoin rival, which is powered by the Ethereum blockchain. It has been gobbling up market share, surging from 5% of the cryptocurrency market in January to 30% as of June 22. In fact, until June, ether was on track to surpass bitcoin as the world\'s largest digital currency.\n\nRegardless of whether bitcoin, Ethereum, or another vehicle strikes your fancy, the process of mining for new blocks requires the same kinds of semiconductors. So as cryptocurrencies go, so do the stock prices of the companies making those chips.\n\nAnd as Carlson doubles down on its bearish chipmaker stance, other hedge funds are proving happy to chase the runaway performance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nLast Friday, the activist investor Elliott Management disclosed a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductors and said it was pushing for a higher price in the company\'s pending $38 billion sale to Qualcomm.\n\nElliott did not specifically cite the white-hot cryptocurrency industry and its effect on chipmakers in a regulatory filing. After all, semiconductors are also crucial components for smartphones, a familiar stomping ground for the world\'s biggest company. So any bet on the industry can also be read as a play on Apple.\n\nBut even if Elliott\'s investment has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, some market watchers will still interpret it that way.\n\nAnd that line of thinking represents the new reality facing investors of all types: This area of the market is attracting and churning through billions of dollars, so either adjust to it or risk getting caught off guard.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect bitcoin\'s recent year-to-date growth above 200%.', 'Users of Unocoin reported that their funds had been stolen over the weekend, prompting the India-based bitcoin exchange to temporarily close and begin issuing reimbursements.\n\nThe scope of the thefts – constituting transactions of 0.25 BTC (about $840 at current prices) from an undisclosed number of accounts – is not yet immediately known. The startup – which operates both an exchange service as well as a hosted wallet – indicated in a blog post published earlier today that the incident only a small subset of its customers base.\n\nThat said, Unocoin accepted the blame for the thefts and said that it would refund the affected users.\n\nThe startup explained:\n\n""Due to our security protocol, just after a few transactions our server identified the pattern and stopped the subsequent transactions by marking it as pending. We are now working on cancelling the pending transactions to users. Unocoin has taken the responsibility to refund the few transactions that happened to get processed.""\n\nUnocoin suspended logins in light of the incident, though signs on social media indicate that access is being returned to at least some users. In the past couple of hours, several customers have reported on Twitter that their funds had already been given back to them.\n\nThe ability to send transactions has also been suspended, which the exchange said would be brought back online pending further security checks.\n\n""The Send feature will be enabled once our security experts feel that it is perfectly safe to do so.""\n\nThe exchange has raised nearly than $2 million in venture capital to date, including a $1.5 million funding round announced last September.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Unocoin.\n\nWallet theft image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It\'s up 465% since last year.\n\nAccording to analysis by Dennis Porto, a bitcoin investor and Harvard academic, bitcoin\'s price could hit $100,000 per coin if it continues to follow one of tech\'s ""golden rules"" — Moore\'s law.\n\nThe rule, which was devised in 1965 by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, describes the exponential improvements of digital technology.\n\n""Moore\'s law specifically applied to the number of transistors on a circuit but can be applied to any digital technology,"" Porto wrote in an email to Business Insider. ""Any technology that is growing exponentially (i.e., \'following Moore\'s law\') has a doubling time.""\n\nTypically, however, the rule applies to a technology\'s computing power or capabilities. This is the first time Porto has noticed a technology\'s price following Moore\'s law.\n\nSince bitcoin\'s inception, according to Porto, its price has doubled every eight months.\n\n""This poses a unique opportunity for investors: Whereas it was difficult to invest in circuits or internet speeds, it is easy to buy a bitcoin,"" Porto said.\n\nPorto expects that this doubling trend could continue until bitcoin reaches mass adoption. Of course, another cryptocurrency could usurp bitcoin in the meantime.\n\nBy February 2021, Porto believes, it could be worth over $100,000.', ""The anonymity of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has made it a darling of criminals and the so-called dark web.\n\nThe Italian mafia has used bitcoin to launder money for its illicit activities, for instance, and the notorious WannaCry hackers extorted over $140,000 worth of the cryptocurrency from their malware victims.\n\nAnd the reported kidnapping of a 20-year old mother might provide the latest example of bitcoin being used for nefarious purposes.\n\nChloe Ayling, a British glamour model, says she was tricked into going to Italy last month for a photo shoot set up by Polish gang members, as reported by Business Insider's Kieran Corcoran. Those criminals, according to Ayling, kidnapped her when she arrived in Milan in order to auction her off on the dark web as a sex-slave. Ayling told police her captors ultimately let her go after they discovered from her Instagram profile she was a new mother, according to Corriere Della Sera, Italy's second largest newspaper.\n\nAyling told Corriere Della Sera that her abductors could have sold her for at least $300,000 in bitcoin. Here's what she said over the weekend:\n\nI shouldn't have been caught, as their boss had seen some of my Instagram photos where it was clear that I'm a mom with a child, and that's against the organization, which operates on the deep web dealing with various crimes, from drug dealing to hits; auctions for kidnapped girls apparently start at $300,000 worth of bitcoin.\n\nAuthorities arrested one person, Lukasz Herba, a Polish man who lives in the UK, in Italy in connection to the kidnapping case, according to the Daily Mail, a UK newspaper. Authorities in Britain, Italy, and Poland are investigating further.\n\nSince transactions on bitcoin's blockchain network are decentralized and anonymous, the cryptocurrency provides an attractive option for criminals looking to conduct business outside of the watchful eye of government officials.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>"", 'Bitcoin is trading at a record high on Monday, up 3.92% at $3,356 a coin.\n\nIt has gained about 80% over the past month, shaking off fears that a fork in the cryptocurrency would cause its price to plummet.\n\nThese kinds of astronomical gains in bitcoin, it turns out, are correlated with a strong showing by stocks too, according to Nautilus Investment Research.\n\nTo be more specific, the firm says that of the 18 previous instances when bitcoin returned at least 30% in a month, the S&P 500 was higher 15 times two months later and 17 times three months out, averaging gains of 3.61% and 4.66%, respectively.\n\nWhat explains this? Nautilus doesn\'t offer a reason, but it does note that it could just be that bitcoin is a ""barometer for animal spirits in the markets.""\n\nIn other words, when traders are going nuts about a highly-speculative investment like bitcoin, that same risk-loving attitude might turn up among the folks who trade stocks. What we can\'t know from this is whether one affects the other, or if there\'s something else driving strong demand for both.\n\nThough Nautilus only has 18 points of reference, it\'s worth noting that these go all the way back to 2010, so the backdrop for the rallies — the strength of the economy, investor sentiment, and Trump — haven\'t all been the same.

The hackers demand what they say is their “6-month salary” in bitcoin, suggesting it’s at least $6 million.\n\nBitcoin allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties. Although bitcoin isn’t widely used, it has strong appeal in some circles because transactions can be made anonymously. The currency is popular with libertarians, tech enthusiasts, speculators — and criminals.\n\nHere’s a brief look at bitcoin:\n\n___\n\nHOW BITCOINS WORK\n\nUnlike most currencies, bitcoin isn’t tied to any bank or government. Rather, the coins are created by users who “mine” them by lending computing power to verify other users’ transactions. They receive bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies.\n\n___\n\nHOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?\n\nOne bitcoin recently traded for $3,385, according to Coinbase, a company that helps users exchange bitcoins. That makes it far more valuable than an ounce of gold, which trades at about $1,265.\n\nThe value of bitcoins can swing sharply, though. It’s up 33 percent in the past month. But its price doesn’t always go up. A bitcoin’s value plunged by 23 percent against the dollar in just a week this past January. It fell by the same amount again in 10 days during March.\n\n___\n\nIS IT REALLY ANONYMOUS?\n\nYes, to a point. Transactions and accounts can be traced, but the account owners aren’t necessarily known. That’s why it’s a payment of choice among criminals, including the “ransomware” hackers who crippled computer networks around the world in May and June. The shuttered underground e-commerce site AlphaBay required transactions to be done in bitcoin and similar digital currencies.\n\nThat said, investigators might be able to track down the owners when bitcoins are converted to regular currency. To combat that, AlphaBay had offered digital money laundering to shuffle bitcoin through several accounts before the conversion.\n\n___\n\nHOW POPULAR IS BITCOIN?\n\nSome businesses have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage. Overstock.com accepts payments in bitcoin, for example. But most individuals and businesses won’t accept bitcoins for payments.\n\nThe currency has about 280,000 daily transactions, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. That’s minuscule compared with cash and cards.\n\n___\n\nHOW BITCOINS ARE KEPT SECURE\n\nThe bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals’ greed for the collective good. A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction. The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn’t be an issue.\n\n___\n\nHOW BITCOIN CAME TO BE\n\nIt’s a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn’t matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.\n\nAn Australian entrepreneur last year stepped forward and claimed to be the founder of bitcoin, only to say days later that he did not “have the courage” to publish proof that he is.\n\n___\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nThe bitcoin system was under threat recently when some miners were reluctant to upgrade their systems to improve capacity because it could reduce transaction fees they collect. Refusal would have sowed chaos, as no one could be sure which bitcoin belonged to the old or new system. But miners ended up agreeing to the change by the deadline.\n\nStill, a group of developers created an alternate currency, Bitcoin Cash, last week. So far, many individuals, businesses and criminal enterprises consider bitcoin the digital currency of choice, but that could change if any of the alternatives pick up steam.\n\nCopyright © 2017 The Associated Press.

""After that, which looks to end August 21, SegWit will activate and miners will start rejecting blocks that do not support the change.""\n\nArthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, a bitcoin derivative exchange, thinks SegWit marks an important milestone for bitcoin\'s future.\n\n""At long last, the solution touted to solve bitcoin\'s scaling problems, Segwit, is activated,"" Hayes said.\n\n""With Segwit implemented, I believe $5,000 Bitcoin is within striking distance,"" he concluded.\n\nJosh Olszewicz, a bitcoin trader, told Business Insider he thinks SegWit will trigger a ""small price bump overall, but there will be a $300 pullback before it marches to $5,000.""\n\nBitcoin is up 2% today, at $3,457.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Fidelity is testing out a new service to help make life easier for its clients who invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe $2.3 trillion investor announced on Wednesday a partnership between its Fidelity Labs, the firm\'s innovation center, and Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange serving nearly 9 million customers.\n\nAs part of the partnership, Coinbase users will be able to view their bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin holdings alongside their other accounts in their Fidelity Portfolio.\n\nThe company told Business Insider it\'s not entirely sure how many of its users will benefit from the service, but that\'s the whole point of the trial.\n\n""We are trying to create the best customer experience,"" Hadley Stern, managing director at Fidelity Labs, told Business Insider.""When we allowed customers to donate bitcoin to our charitable fund we were unsure about how many people would do it, but it played out well.""\n\nDonations made in bitcoin to Fidelity Charitable, a $16 billion donor-advised philanthropic fund, grew to about $9 million in the first half of 2017. That\'s about $2 million more than what bitcoin donors contributed in all of 2016.\n\nFidelity\'s CEO Abigail Johnson is a bitcoin enthusiast. In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Johnson voiced her support of the cryptocurrency in a speech at a conference hosted by CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency news site.\n\n“Some of you might be wondering: Why am I here today?” Johnson said, according to the Journal.""I’m here because I love this stuff... all that the future might hold.”\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Bitcoin is the biggest and most famous digital currency, but it’s hardly the only one: There are hundreds of other so-called “alt coins” and now, in a significant development, the owners of these coins will be able to spend them at a major retailer.\n\nOn Tuesday, Overstock—a popular online store that sells everything from furniture to bedding—announced it will begin accepting payment via Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and every other major digital currency as payment from customers.\n\nOverstock and many other companies—from Virgin Atlantic to small coffee shops—have accepted bitcoin for years, but this is the first time a well-known retailer has opened the door to other digital currencies.\n\nThe upshot is that customers who check out after shopping at Overstock’s website will have all sorts of options beyond credit or debit card or bitcoin. Here’s a screenshot of the site’s payment page:\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said he expected his company will be accepting up to 40 or 45 digital currencies at any given time.\n\nByrne is a trained economist and a longtime advocate for bitcoin, which he regards as a global currency beyond the control of central banks and governments. He sees the new payment options as a victory for ordinary people.\n\n“Overstock is pro-freedom, including the freedom of individuals to communicate information about value and scarcity without relying on a medium created through the fiat of unaccountable government mandarins. For that reason, we have been an early proponent and adopter of cryptocurrencies,” he said in a statement.\n\nTo process all the new currencies, Overstock will rely on a company called ShapeShift for the backend operations. The Switzerland-based company, whose service lets users instantly convert one type of digital currency to another, built an API that allows Overstock to accept any major digital currency and get paid in bitcoin on the backend.\n\nAccording to CEO Erik Voorhees, other big companies can easily install ShapeShift’s payment API, meaning they could soon follow Overstock’s example and accept payments in other digital currencies too.\n\nA moment of truth for alt-coins\n\nOverstock’s decision to accept lesser known digital currencies, including Dash and the brand new Bitcoin Cash, comes during an unprecedented boom for alt-coins. In 2017, the total market for such currencies topped $100 billion as investors of all stripes began to embrace them as an alternate asset class akin to gold. Meanwhile, the market has become more diverse: bitcoin’s overall share of the digital currency market recently dropped from over 80% to about 50%.\n\nDespite the recent boom, however, digital currencies still haven’t caught on as a mainstream payment method. While bitcoin occupies a niche for certain criminal transactions, very few average consumers use it for everyday purchases.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAccording to Byrne, Overstock customers spend about $50,000 a week in bitcoin. He says that figure has remained fairly constant for some time—suggesting there is a small hard core base of people who use bitcoin as everyday money, while the vast majority are using it to speculate and invest.\n\nBut Byrne thinks Overstock’s decision to accept more alt-coins could jump-start their adoption as a payment tool, and that more people will spend them rather than hoard them.\n\n“This is a red letter day in the crypto revolution. We ship to 129 countries—now any of them can pay in any of these currencies and have goods shipped there,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, though, Byrne is quick to acknowledge that not all alt-coins are created equally. He sees bitcoin and Ethereum as representing superior technology, and that this will drive their adoption, and in turn them into mainstream commodities and currencies.\n\nAccording to Voorhees, there is growing demand for all crypto-currencies. He told Fortune that ShapeShift processed $200 million worth of customer orders last month—a ten-fold increase of what the company processed in December.\n\nBut Vorhees shares Byrne’s view that bitcoin and Ethereum remain the most promising crypto-currencies, and that not all of the “major” currencies will be around in the future.\n\n“A lot of these assets will fail just as startups will fail,” he said.\n\nAn earlier version of this story contained a typo that listed the market cap of digital currency as over $100 million. It has been corrected to say over $100 billion.', 'Excess power in Russia to be put to use in crypto-mining\n\nA company co-owned by one of President Vladimir Putin’s internet advisers plans to raise the cryptocurrency equivalent of as much as $100 million in a push to help Russian entrepreneurs challenge China in bitcoin mining.\n\nRussian Miner Coin is holding a so-called initial coin offering, where investors will use units of ethereum or bitcoin to buy new RMC tokens. These new tokens will have rights to 18 percent of the revenue earned with the company’s mining equipment, according to a presentation posted on its website.\n\nRMC plans to use semiconductor chips designed in Russia for use in satellites to minimize power consumption in computers for crypto-mining, Putin’s internet ombudsman, Dmitry Marinichev, said at at a news conference in Moscow.\n\n“Russia has the potential to reach up to 30 percent share in global cryptocurrency mining in the future,"" Marinichev said, adding that $10 million from the proceeds of the ICO may be spent developing the processors.\n\nMore and more startups are offering tokens as a way to raise money upfront for digital assets in ICOs. Unlike a traditional IPO in which buyers get shares, a startup’s ICO nets you virtual tokens unique to the issuing company or network that grow in value only if the business proves viable.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month warned that ICOs may be considered securities and signaled greater scrutiny of the sector, though it stopped short of suggesting a broader clampdown.\n\nToday’s bitcoin mining requires special computers based on chips with minimized power consumption. China’s Bitmain Technologies Ltd. is one of the leading producers of such equipment and also runs Antpool, a processing pool that combines individual miners from China and other countries. Rival Bitfury Group, founded by Valery Vavilov, a Russian-speaking native of Latvia, produces equipment for mining virtual currencies and runs large-scale centers in Georgia and Iceland.\n\nRussia has 20 gigawatts of excess power capacity, with consumer electricity prices as low as 80 kopeks (1.3 cents) per kilowatt hour, which is less than in China, RMC said in the presentation. The company initially plans to locate mining computers based on Bitfury chips in individual Russian households to challenge Bitmain by using Russia’s lower power prices.\n\nWatch Next: Bitcoin Rebounds and Could March Past $3,000 Soon', 'Bitcoin was worth less than $590 a year ago. Then early Tuesday, the cryptocurrency surged to yet another all-time high above $3,500, as investors likely pulled their funds from the new Bitcoin spinoff, Bitcoin Cash or “Bcash,” to invest it in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin pulled back slightly by mid-day, trading at $3,430.\n\nThat came after the two split Aug. 1, with Bitcoin holders receiving an amount of Bcash equivalent to their number of bitcoin tokens. That appeared to create billions of dollars overnight. But investors, rather than trading their bitcoin in for Bcash, appeared to trade their Bcash in for bitcoin.\n\n“After the split, investors holding Bitcoin were also given Bitcoin Cash. Initially the market cap of Bitcoin Cash rose to $12 billion, but we’ve since seen a lot of people selling their Bitcoin Cash in order to buy more Bitcoin,” said Matthew Newton, a market analyst at online trading platform eToro in an emailed statement. “In recent days we’ve seen $8 billion wiped off the market cap of Bitcoin Cash, and $9 billion added to the market cap of Bitcoin.”\n\nBitcoin has surged about 19% since Aug. 1.\n\nBcash, which is now worth about $376, formed amid a debate among Bitcoin miners over how to make Bitcoin transactions faster and potentially cheaper. That resulted in the Bitcoin community approving SedWit2x, a software upgrade that would scale up the cryptocurrency. But a small faction was dissatisfied with the upgrade, saying it didn’t go far enough. As a result, they formed Bcash.', 'Lawmakers in Australia are reportedly pushing for the recognition of bitcoin as an official currency.\n\nAccording the Sydney Morning Herald, representatives from the country\'s centre and left-leaning political parties are behind the ambitious initiative, one that comes amid a broader call for the government to better accommodate blockchain technology and its evangelists.\n\nLeading the effort are Liberal Senator Jane Hume and Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, who are arguing that Australia should be more proactive about both cryptocurrencies and blockchain. As part of those efforts, Hume and Dastyari have formed a group, dubbed Parliamentary Friends of Blockchain, to advance the issue.\n\nAlso among the proposals is a call for Australia\'s central bank to consider the launch of its own cryptocurrency.\n\n""This will be a revolutionary leap for the Reserve Bank and for Australian financial institutions, what we want to do here in Parliament is to create the political environment to allow that leap,"" Dastyari told the news source.\n\nAlready this year, the Reserve Bank of Australia has revealed that it has created an internal working group focused on the tech.\n\nYet not all members of the Australian Parliament – even from among those parties involved in the blockchain initiative – are on board with the idea of expanding cryptocurrency use.\n\nBill Shorten, who leads Australian Labor Party, used a speech in June to call for tighter controls on bitcoin use in the country – a statement that may hint at potential opposition ahead.\n\nAustralia flag image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

These are some of the questions the Goldman Sachs analysts answered:\n\nHow to Trade Cryptocurrencies in the U.S.?\n\nDigital exchanges and block trades, and options will be coming soon. While individual investors can trade virtual coins on various online exchanges, institutional traders have largely stayed out of the cryptocurrency market due to its relatively small size, structure of mandates and volatility. But block trading exists to facilitate the execution of larger orders. In addition, Bitcoin options exist and are traded on offshore exchanges, and could be traded in the U.S. by the end of the year.\n\nAre Cryptocurrencies a Currency or a Commodity?\n\nCoins have attributes of a currency, as they’re presented and trusted by some medium of exchange, and of a commodity, as they’re a limited resource. The classification of cryptocurrencies varies by country, government and even application. In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has ruled that virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. For tax purposes, the IRS treats virtual currency as property.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nA platform first, and a cryptocurrency second. Unlike bitcoin, which is designed to be an alternative to ""real money,"" Ethereum is more of a platform set up to run any decentralized application and automatically execute “smart contracts” when certain conditions are met. Ethereum offers a digital currency called ether, but this is just one component of its smart contract execution and primarily used to facilitate and reward using the network. The rise of ethereum has not come without setbacks, including the $60 million hack of a venture capital-like organization called ""The DAO.""\n\nWhat is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)?\n\nA fundraiser through token sales. The amount of money funding ICOs has grown exponentially and the speed at which cash is raised with often little more than a white paper and Internet browser has sounded the alarm bells from parties including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the People’s Bank of China.

It was also the point of contention that caused the splinter in the first place. Those who opposed the solution were in support of a different method to achieve the same goal by increasing block size.\n\nRead More: A Second Version Of Bitcoin Has Launched. Could It Threaten The Original?\n\nOther upgrades haven\'t had the same effect\n\nSince the inception of the digital currency nearly nine years ago, Bitcoin has fixed a lot of bugs and upgraded itself several times. “But most performance improvements are non-controversial because they don’t fundamentally change the behavior of the Bitcoin network,” says Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, China’s first and largest Bitcoin trading platform.\n\nBTCC\n\nSegWit probably wouldn’t have gained critical mass if naysayers didn’t cut the cord. But Lee, who is also a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, is among those who believe that spinning off Bitcoin Cash, now also known as “Bcash,” is better for both schools of thought. Each going it alone means progressing without contention.\n\n“We think the price of Bitcoin for the last one-and-a-half-year has been artificially held low because of the impasse,” says Lee.\n\nBitcoin could soar even higher\n\nIndeed the price of Bitcoin has hit a new high, flirting near $3,500 a token and reaching a market cap of $55 billion for the first time ever.

With the activation, some traders are speculating that it’s just a matter of time before the internet currency touches $5,000 a coin.\n\nHighcharts.com\n\nAnd because Bitcoin Cash came from the same ledger as the original currency, Bitcoin owners were issued Bcash upon the split. But many have sold off their new digital cash to chase after Bitcoin and its newfound potential.\n\nCriminals want a piece of the action\n\nAmidst all the cryptocurrency excitement, criminals are eyeing a big payday as well.

Right now 16 million are in circulation. Four million more will be mined in the next 10 years. Based on the open source mathematical formula, “it will take 100 years to mine the last one million Bitcoin,” explains Lee who is very optimistic about the future of the cryptocurrency.\n\n“It’s exciting times, and we have a long way to go.”', 'Bitcoin saw a modest pullback from its recent record run on Wednesday, but the cryptocurrency enjoyed some upbeat news on the session, with Fidelity Investments announcing that it would start tracking the digital unit for its clients.\n\nA single bitcoin was valued at $3,393.76, off by about 2.5%, based on levels from late Tuesday in New York, according to digital-currency research site Coindesk.com. The total market value for the most popular digital currency was at $55.4 billion, according to CoinMarketcap.com.\n\nBoston-based money-management giant Fidelity Investments said it would, starting Wednesday, enable clients to monitor their digital-currency holdings via their accounts, in partnership with digital-wallet provider Coinbase.\n\n“This is an experiment in the spirit of learning what these crypto assets are like and how our customers may want to interact with them,” Hadley Stern, senior vice president and managing director at Fidelity Labs, the company’s innovation unit, told Reuters.\n\nFidelity CEO Abigail Johnson has been one of the biggest champions of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain among traditional financial-services companies. Digital-currency blockchains refer to the peer-to-peer digital network designed to transfer and track ownership of he currency.\n\nRecognition by mature, Wall Street enterprises has appeared to both help support demand and reaffirm to some the growing legitimacy of virtual monetary units, even if they are not totally understood or used by average investors.\n\nBitcoin and its virtual ilk have drawn increased attention from businesses and regulators in recent months, which may also account for its record rally in 2017. Bitcoin’s value has surged by 250% since the start of the year, compared with a 10.5% year-to-date rise for the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.41% and a nearly 12% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.31%\n\nRising geopolitical tensions, headlined by North Korea threatening to launch a ballistic-missile attack against U.S. territory Guam, didn’t appear to influence digital currency moves Wednesday.\n\nRead: Guam’s governor: ‘There is no threat’ but American island ‘will be defended’\n\nElsewhere in digital currencies, the ethereum network’s ether token bought $299.77, up 6.7% from its levels late Tuesday in New York. Ether’s total value was at about $28.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Cash was down about 7% at $308.79, compared with its late-Tuesday value. The new digital currency, which emerged out of the original bitcoin Aug. 1, is the result of a small faction of bitcoin developers’ demand for a version of the currency that allowed for so-called miners, who support the unit, to process transactions in larger increments. The currency is presently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a value at $5 billion.\n\nAlso read: Meet Bitcoin Cash — the new digital-currency that surged 122% in less than a day', 'Previously, Cointelegraph reported that RT host and financial analyst Max Keiser predicted Bitcoin price to “cruise through” $5,000 in the short term.\n\nWith the Bitcoin Core development team’s transaction malleability fix and scaling solution Segregated Witness (SegWit) lock-in achieved, the market and investors are expressing their confidence in Bitcoin and its ability to scale.\n\nThe certainty and imminence of SegWit activation has definitely acted as a driving factor in sustaining the upward momentum of Bitcon’s value.\n\nScaling debate on Bitcoin and its block size has been prolonged since 2015 and the activation of SegWit marks a significant milestone in Bitcoin and the first major step towards scaling.\n\nBut it is also inaccurate to attribute the surge in Bitcoin price solely to the activation of SegWit.\n\nThroughout 2017, mainstream adoption of Bitcoin by general consumers, traders, institutional investors, large-scale conglomerates and merchants significantly increased.\n\nSuch rapid increase in adoption demonstrated the acceptance of Bitcoin as a widely-recognized digital currency, in addition to being a safe haven asset and digital gold to long-term investors.\n\nThree main reasons why Bitcoin price will continue to rise\n\nBitcoin price will likely increase at a consistent rate in the upcoming months mainly due to three driving factors: adoption by institutional investors, elimination of uncertainty in Bitcoin’s scaling issues and increased legalization of Bitcoin in major economies.\n\nBitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market’s daily trading volume has surpassed $5.5 bln, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for nearly $3 bln of the cryptocurrency market’s daily trading volume.\n\nThrough highly regulated exchanges including Gemini’s daily Bitcoin auction and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)’s Bitcoin integration, institutional investors will be able to trade and invest in Bitcoin with higher liquidity.\n\nAlready, some of the largest investment firms in the world including Fidelity Investments, which oversees over $2.13 tln in assets, have announced that they have invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nFidelity CEO Abigail Johnson stated:\n\n""We have built proofs of concepts that accept Bitcoin micro-transactions. We set up small Bitcoin and Ethereum mining operations, just done in the spirit of learning. But I am still a believer – and it\'s no accident that I\'m one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services firm that hasn\'t given up on digital currencies.”\n\nPerhaps more importantly, uncertainty around a hard fork execution and Bitcoin’s scalability have been eliminated with the recent Aug. 1 hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nFor years, the Bitcoin community and industry have expressed their concerns over potential security issues of a hard fork but in actuality, the BCH hard fork had minimal impact on the Bitcoin network and the value of Bitcoin and demands towards the digital currency have never been higher.', ""LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin and other “cryptocurrencies” are big money, virtually as big as Goldman Sachs and Royal Bank of Scotland combined.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Bitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, France, May 27, 2015. REUTERS/Illustration/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin hit an all-time high of above $3,500 this week, dragging up the value of hundreds of newer, smaller digital rivals in its wake. Now some investors fear a giant crypto-bubble may be about to burst.\n\nIt has been a year of unprecedented growth for the largely unregulated market, with dozens of new currencies appearing every month in “Initial Coin Offerings” or ICOs. They have achieved value almost instantly, drawing in those who are eager to get in and make a quick buck.\n\nAt the start of 2017, the total value - or market cap - of all cryptocurrencies in existence was about $17.5 billion, with bitcoin making up almost 90 percent of that, according to industry data firm CoinMarketCap.\n\nIt is now around $120 billion - around the same value as Goldman and RBS together - and bitcoin makes up only 46 percent.\n\nInfographic ID: '2gWgyLc'\n\nBitcoin Cash, a clone of bitcoin that was split off from the original last week by a rival group of developers, was valued at more than $12 billion less than 24 hours after it had started trading.\n\n“It’s just created new value out of nowhere,” said Rob Moffat, a partner at Balderton Capital, a London-based venture capital firm who focuses on fintech. “There’s no fundamentals behind any of this - it’s all based on public perception, so you can start to see some really strange phenomena.”\n\nCryptocurrencies - so-called because cryptography is used to keep transactions secure - allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions between individual users, without the need for banks or central banks. They use blockchain technology, a shared record-keeping and processing system that means digital money cannot be copied and spent more than once.\n\nBillionaire U.S. investor Howard Marks likens the market to the dotcom bubble of the turn of the century - whose demise he predicted. He said in a recent investor letter that digital currencies were an “unfounded fad ... based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it”.\n\nBut advocates of cryptocurrencies say 2017 is just the beginning of bull run. They argue the finite nature of these currency units - there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin, for example - as well as the technological innovation that underpins them will ensure their enduring value.\n\n“The idea of this thing being a bubble is silly. We’re in the bottom of the first innings,” said Miguel Vias of Ripple, the third-biggest cryptocurrency, who was previously global head of precious metals and metal options at CME Group.\n\nDASH TO ETHER\n\nWhichever way cryptocurrencies move, they are likely to move together because their values are highly correlated, feeding off each other and magnifying the market effect.\n\nThat’s partly down to investor sentiment, but also because the start-ups issuing new coins in ICOs generally collect money in a more liquid cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin or, more commonly, Ethereum’s ether - the second-biggest cryptocurrency in total value.\n\nThat has driven demand for ether, which has climbed over 3,000 percent so far this year and now has a market cap of around $28 billion.\n\nBitcoin, which was launched in 2009, was the first successful cryptocurrency and is still easily the biggest, with a market cap of over $54 billion.\n\nIts price has shot up around 225 percent so this year, and performed better than any conventional, central-bank issued currency in every year since 2010 bar 2014.\n\nThe blockchain-based currencies that have been built since bitcoin - 842, at last count - vary hugely in terms of their credibility.\n\nSceptics say bitcoin and its rivals are not particularly useful as currencies, as they are still volatile and not accepted by most merchants. They are mostly just used for speculative trading purposes.\n\nThere are some signs of acceptance of the biggest players by the establishment, however; Ethereum has been piloted by the United Nations as a way to distribute funds to Syrian refugees. Ripple has been successfully used as a payment method between settlement systems in a Bank of England trial.\n\nSome other, smaller cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Monero and Z-cash are seen as having real value by some users because they offer an even higher level of anonymity than the likes of bitcoin. Whistle-blowing website Wikileaks this week said it would accept Z-cash for online donations.\n\n‘DARWINISM IN REAL-TIME’\n\nIt is mainly the new “token” cryptocurrencies that are issued in ICOs with no regulatory oversight, which have exploded since the start of the year, that are causing the most anxiety.\n\nOne, the “Useless Ethereum Token”, which appears to have been set up as a way of showing how worthless many of the ICOs really are, is nonetheless changing hands for 3 cents a unit. “No value, no security, and no product. Just me, spending your money,” its website states.\n\n“It’s just so easy to raise money on an ICO right now, it just feels like there’s a gold rush going on there,” said Moffat. “Some of the new currencies - beyond bitcoin and Ethereum - could crash to zero.”\n\nBy mid-July, about $1.1 billion had been raised in ICOs this year, roughly 10 times more than that in the whole of 2016, according to cryptocurrency research firm Smith + Crown. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2ueAWvr)\n\nThe rapid ascent of ICOs prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to warn last month that some ICOs should be regulated like other securities.\n\nThis is new digital territory and how the rapidly proliferating cryptocurrency market will play out is anyone’s guess.\n\nWhile critics say the highly correlated nature of the currencies means the weakness of newer entrants could bring the whole house down; others argue market forces will ensure the best players prevail.\n\n“Will some of these (currencies) go away? Of course,” said Vias of Ripple. “We’re going to see Darwinism in real-time here. Only the strong will survive.”\n\n(For a graphic on crytpocurrencies, click tmsnrt.rs/2wwsMxK)"", 'There has been noise that the market for an initial coin offering (ICO) is at risk of becoming a bubble. Coins are being sold rapidly and at prices for which there is no fundamental financial statement support.\n\nIt is believed that many buyers have a speculative interest and will seek to resell securities quickly on a coin exchange. What are the risks? Why are ICOs being dubbed the next bubble?\n\nTrace Schmeltz, a partner in the Chicago and Washington, D.C. offices of Barnes & Thornburg LLP, warns there are a number of risks to be aware of when considering the ICO market.\n\nSchmeltz explains: ""Some of the basic risks are, \'Will this investment appreciate in value?\' \'Is the enterprise a new cryptocurrency, for example, really worth anything at all?\' \'Is the white paper describing the enterprise and its expected value-proposition worth the electronic paper on which it is printed?\' \'Can the offeror or the exchange through which the offering is made be hacked?\'""\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved in on the ""Wild West"" world of ICOs by making them subject to federal securities laws.\n\nSchmeltz stresses that there is a fundamental regulatory risk that the SEC will deem the ICO to be an unregistered offering of securities and shut it down altogether.\n\nSo are ICOs here for the longterm? Yes, Schmeltz says.\n\nMore of What\'s Trending on TheStreet:\n\n""ICOs provide a valuable additional tool for anyone looking to raise capital,"" Schmeltz says. ""But, as the SEC has made clear, anyone seeking to offer a profit-interest in their business through an ICO must ensure they follow rules for offering securities found in the Securities Act of 1933 and regulations relating to the 1933 Act.""\n\nThe possibility of a bubble may well stem from the general dearth of information investors and company founders embarking upon an ICO have about the market.\n\n""I think the main common characteristic between ICOs and \'bubbles\' is the lack of clear understanding of the concepts and models of the companies selling tokens by some of the token buyers,"" said Eddy Travia, CEO of Coinsilium, a firm that finances and manages the development of early-stage blockchain technology companies. ""Some token buyers may be following trends and disregard doing a proper due diligence on the companies issuing tokens. The past price performance of some tokens may encourage speculative purchasing but there are also very promising technologies and applications being built through ICOs and token price may only be one measure of their utility.""\n\nBitcoin has been hot.\n\nThat hazy understanding contributes all the more to potential frothiness in the ICO market.\n\n""Tokens are usually generated by early-stage companies so there is a high risk associated to the capacity of these companies to succeed, and that risk may be reflected in the token price,"" Travia added. ""However, there are many cryptocurrency holders who understand the market and the technology and want to support it -- they consciously wish to recycle cryptocurrency profits to help new blockchain companies to thrive. There are also several talented entrepreneurs who choose this method to fund their company as opposed to traditional VC funding which can come with strings attached.""\n\nToken buyers, of course, should do their homework and run a due diligence process before making ay token purchase decision.\n\n(There are many websites out there which now track and evaluate ICO -- here is a list of websites with ICO resources.)\n\nJerome Rousselot, of blockchain microfinance startup Jita Ltd., believes there seems to be no end to the growth of ICO. It appears ICOs are becoming the new way to raise capital. In that sense, the accusations of a bubble market may be overblown. That\'s not to say there are no risks.\n\nSo what else should we be aware of?\n\n""ICOs are a new way to raise capital for projects and a new investment vehicles for individuals and businesses,"" Rousselot said. ""It seems ICO is, as of now, the main use case for Ethereum and many Ethereum early investors are reinvesting their wealth into ICO.""\n\nRousselot explains anyone can setup an ICO and anyone can send funds to an ICO smart contract. ""Recently Bitfinex, a major crypto exchange, launched a dedicated exchange for ERC20 ICO tokens: ethfinex.com,"" adds Rousselot. ""The ERC20 standard facilitates the development of an ICO smart contract and make it easier to trade on a market.""\n\nLast year, blockchain startups raised around $200 million in ICO, which is also considered a new form of crowdfunding based on cryptocurrency.\n\nHow do ICOs differ from crowdfunding?\n\nSchmeltz explains that crowdfunding is regulated by, and must be done according to rules promulgated by, the SEC. Accordingly, anyone attempting to conduct an ICO as ""crowdfunding"" must carefully follow those rules - including offering coin through an SEC registered portal, ensuring that individuals do not invest more than allowed and limiting the overall fundraising to $1,000,000 in any calendar year.\n\n""Compared to crowdfunding, ICOs are much more liquid,"" Rousselot said. ""This attracts a highly speculative demand. Typically, early ICO investors, founders and team get better rates. Large investors and experienced blockchain traders can also ""jump the queue"" by paying high fees and get tokens first. This can make ICO unfair for small investors who enter the ICO at the last stage, or buy the token only after the ICO on exchanges.""\n\nRousselot also adds that some ICOs definitely fund great teams with good projects. Some of them are very well managed from a legal point of view. Some others are only a few web pages, a whitepaper and an ethereum address, with no real product or prototype behind, and even less product market fit.\n\nSometimes some projects seem to raise too much money. Rousselot believes that maybe in the future we will see more capped projects, with a maximum amount to raise.\n\nWatch: Which Cryptocurrency Will Last?\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you investing in cryptocurrency? Don\'t miss TheStreet\'s coverage:\n\n', 'Yesterday, CCN reported that Overstock’s blockchain subsidiary, Medici Ventures, had posted a $3.3 million Q2 loss. That loss followed a Q1 loss of $8.5 million, and the company anticipates Medici will continue to incur losses for the short-term future.\n\nDespite Medici’s losses, Overstock continues to take a long view of its bitcoin and blockchain technology investments. That commitment was evidenced by two major announcements this week.\n\nOverstock Expands Payment Options to 40+ Altcoins\n\nOverstock’s online marketplace has accepted bitcoin payments since 2014 and has made significant donations to organizations promoting cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nOverstock has announced it has integrated the ShapeShift API into its payment system, enabling customers to make purchases using ether, litecoin, Dash, NEM, or any of the other 40+ altcoins supported by ShapeShift.\n\nUndoubtedly, this move will prove a huge boon for altcoins struggling to step out of bitcoin’s shadow and prove their legitimacy as currency.\n\nCustomers will now be greeted by the following image when they reach the payment screen:\n\nShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees lauded the retailer for outpacing its competitors in cryptocurrency adoption:\n\nOverstock’s long history with bitcoin and blockchain technology demonstrates their commitment to innovation….The ShapeShift team could not be more excited for this partnership and are pleased our technology will be helping the next generation of Overstock customers.\n\nFor his part, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne – a trained economist who has been a featured speaker at multiple Bitcoin conferences – said the move was motivated by ideology as well as finances:\n\nOverstock is pro-freedom, including the freedom of individuals to communicate information about value and scarcity without relying on a medium created through the fiat of unaccountable government mandarins. For that reason, we have been an early proponent and adopter of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOverstock to Retain 50% of Cryptocurrency Purchases as Investments\n\nPayment expansion was not Overstock’s only major cryptocurrency announcement. Most companies that accept digital currency payments use a payment processor to exchange their coins for cash.\n\nOverstock, however, has long kept 10% of bitcoin payment funds as investments in cryptocurrencies and cryptosecurities. In a press briefing following the Q2 earnings call, Patrick Byrne revealed the company has received board approval to increase its investment retention ratio to 50%.\n\nWe’ve gone from keeping 10% of what’s spent with Bitcoin to keeping 50%. In Bitcoin, we just got board approval for — to keep 50% of what is spent in Bitcoin or in other cryptosecurities. I mean we can keep it either in Bitcoin or in some assortment of cryptosecurities.

The currency is popular with libertarians, tech enthusiasts, speculators - and criminals.\n\nHere\'s a brief look at bitcoin:\n\nHow bitcoin works\n\nUnlike most currencies, bitcoin isn\'t tied to any bank or government. Rather, the coins are created by users who ""mine"" them by lending computing power to verify other users\' transactions. They receive bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies.\n\nHow much is it worth?\n\nOne bitcoin recently traded for $3,385, according to Coinbase, a company that helps users exchange bitcoins. That makes it far more valuable than an ounce of gold, which trades at about $1,265.\n\nThe value of bitcoins can swing sharply, though. It\'s up 33 percent in the past month. But its price doesn\'t always go up. Bitcoin\'s value plunged by 23 percent against the dollar in just a week this past January. It fell by the same amount again in 10 days during March.\n\nIs it really anonymous?\n\nTranslator To read this article in one of Houston\'s most-spoken languages, click on the button below. Technology\n\nYes, to a point. Transactions and accounts can be traced, but the account owners aren\'t necessarily known. That\'s why it\'s a payment of choice among criminals, including the ""ransomware"" hackers who crippled computer networks around the world in May and June. The shuttered underground e-commerce site AlphaBay required transactions to be done in bitcoin and similar digital currencies.\n\nThat said, investigators might be able to track down the owners when bitcoins are converted to regular currency. To combat that, AlphaBay had offered digital money laundering to shuffle bitcoin through several accounts before the conversion.\n\nHow popular is bitcoin?\n\nSome businesses have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage. Overstock.com accepts payments in bitcoin, for example. But most individuals and businesses won\'t accept bitcoin for payments.\n\nThe currency has about 280,000 daily transactions, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. That\'s minuscule compared with cash and cards.\n\nHow it\'s kept secure\n\nThe bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals\' greed for the collective good. A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn\'t be an issue.\n\nThe future\n\nThe bitcoin system was under threat recently when some miners were reluctant to upgrade their systems to improve capacity because it could reduce transaction fees they collect. Refusal would have sowed chaos, as no one could be sure which bitcoin belonged to the old or new system. But miners ended up agreeing to the change by the deadline.\n\nStill, a group of developers created an alternate currency, Bitcoin Cash, last week. So far, many individuals, businesses and criminal enterprises consider bitcoin the digital currency of choice, but that could change if any of the alternatives pick up steam.', 'Positive publicity for in-game tokens has come from an unlikely source, as Venezuela’s Bolivar is now worth less than World of Warcraft gold. As early as mid-July, World of Warcraft’s in-game ‘gold’ was more valuable than the real-life Bolivar, something keenly spotted by social media commentators and mainstream media.\n\nIt happened again, WoW gold is worth more than the Venezuelan Bolivar.\n\n\n\nBlack Market: Bs.F 8493.97 per USD\n\n\n\nWoW Token: ~8385g per USD. pic.twitter.com/Il7TVqYNsH — Kaleb (@KalebPrime) July 14, 2017\n\nFollowing highly a highly controversial election and threats of US sanctions, the Venezuelan economy continues to nosedive. Its currency has faced rapid inflation over the last few years, with current inflation rates approaching 2,000%.\n\nThe government’s official inflation rate is dramatically understated. Media and economists have eschewed this official number, instead focusing on the value of the US dollar on the black market. Dollars are currently selling at a rate of 13,000 Bolivar to one dollar. Only recently the Bolivar was trading at 8,500 per dollar, according to local monitoring resource Venezuela Econ.\n\nIn contrast, World of Warcraft ‘‘gold’ is trading at around 7,500 units per dollar at press time.\n\nFor the past year, Venezuelans have been turning to Bitcoin to shore up their deteriorating currency holdings. Despite a crackdown on Venezuelan flagship exchange SurBitcoin and even miners, the local industry continues to explode.\n\nVenezuelan businesses have also begun accepting Bitcoin in lieu of the deteriorating Bolivar despite the potential consequences.\n\nThe founder of SurBitcoin told The Atlantic this week:', 'An aide to Russian president Vladimir Putin is raising $100 mln to launch a Bitcoin mining business in competition with China.\n\nAs Bloomberg reports Tuesday, the plans, which caught the international crypto industry by surprise, revolve around the creation of so-called Russian Miner Coin.\n\nI\'d not have guessed funding @BitFuryGroup yrs ago (knowing the ICs would set a standard) our technology would be ""geopolitically relevant"" https://t.co/xqqydEC8yA — Bill Tai (KiteVC) (@KiteVC) August 8, 2017\n\nThe ICO will issue RMC tokens to investors in return for Bitcoin and Ethereum and is a clear albeit sudden push by Russia to become a serious force in Bitcoin mining.\n\n“Russia has the potential to reach up to 30 percent share in global cryptocurrency mining in the future,"" Bloomberg quotes the aide, internet ombudsman Dmitry Marinichev, as saying.\n\nThe implications for the move on the part of the Russian government, with Putin’s aide a joint owner of RMC, are considerable.\n\nWith cryptocurrency regulations in the country still undecided, the involvement of government sources in what is a de facto state-sponsored ICO suggests endorsement of cryptocurrency creation, circulation and use in business.\n\nSuch an angle contrasts sharply even with recent decisions elsewhere in the Russian establishment. For example, a court in St. Petersburg last month banned outright distribution of information related to Bitcoin in public.\n\nThe crux of the scheme appears to lie in beating out China, with Russia’s energy prices on average lower than its eastern neighbors.']"
08/10/2017,"['A Bitcoin company has finally attained the “unicorn” title, an honorific bestowed upon startups valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nCoinbase, a brokerage that established itself as one of the biggest brands in a now-booming cryptocurrency market, has raised $100 million at a private valuation of $1.6 billion that includes the capital raised, the company tells Fortune. The venture capital firm Institutional Venture Partners led the round with participation by Spark Capital, Greylock Partners, Battery Ventures, Section 32, and Draper Associates.\n\nCoinbase had for months been rumored to be raising around $100 million at a valuation of $1 billion or more, as the Wall Street Journal reported in June. That deal, its fourth, is now final.\n\nIn previous rounds, Coinbase had raised a total of $117 million at a private valuation approaching $500 million, as Fortune reported. That sum already made it one of the most well financed Bitcoin ventures around, next to Circle and 21.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter\n\nCoinbase has been riding a wave of interest in cryptocurrencies in recent months. Virtual currency prices exploded this year with the resurgence of Bitcoin—now trading at more than $3,400 per Bitcoin, well above its previous 2013 highs in the $900 range—as well as the ascent of Ethereum, a rival cryptocurrency network that, for one thing, allows people mint and sell their own digital tokens.\n\nOverall, the total market value for cryptocurrencies and tokens combined has soared to more than $120 billion from just under $20 billion at the beginning of the year. This exuberance has led many industry watchers to warn of a possible bubble.\n\nFounded in 2012, Coinbase started as a Bitcoin wallet service that helped customers stash their digital wealth. The company later moved into the brokerage space, opening online exchanges where traders can swap or sell crypto coins.\n\nThis year has been a banner year for Coinbase. According to the company, it has facilitated the exchange of more than $25 billion in digital currency to date, five times more than the total sum it processed from its founding through the end of last year.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fidelity Investments, the asset manager, added the ability for customers to view the cryptocurrency holdings in their Coinbase accounts on its own website.\n\nDuring the recent Bitcoin blockchain fork in which a faction of the network broke off and created a new currency, Bitcoin Cash, some customers blasted Coinbase for saying it did not intend immediately to support the new money. Eventually, Coinbase reversed course and agreed to allow users to access their potential Bitcoin Cash holdings at the start of next year.\n\nCoinbase has also been battling an IRS inquiry in recent months that seeks information about cryptocurrency buyers and sellers for tax purposes. The agency most recently said it would exempt people from the probe who transacted less than $20,000 in digital currency.\n\nThese hiccups haven’t slowed the company’s pace. Coinbase said it would put the newly raised money toward bolstering its engineering and customer support teams, opening a New York office for its professional trading operations, and continuing to develop Toshi, an Ethereum-based messaging and wallet app that it debuted last year.\n\nCoinbase isn’t the only recent benefactor from crypto mania that has lately gripped the world. GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet, formerly known as Google Ventures, recently led a $40 million funding round for Blockchain, a cryptocurrency wallet provider based in London. Other investment firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, and Sequoia have been backing so-called crypto hedge funds, like Polychain Capital and Metastable, that invest in digital tokens and cryptocurrencies too.', 'Coinbase Inc., the digital currency exchange that in the past two months suffered a trading crash and upset customers over how it handled the bitcoin split, received a $100 million investment from a group led by IVP.\n\nSpark Capital, Greylock Partners, Battery Ventures, Section 32 and Draper Associates also participated, according to a statement Thursday. Coinbase plans to use the money to expand its engineering and customer support staff, open a New York office for its professional trading platform GDAX and grow Toshi, “a mobile browser for the ethereum network that provides universal access to financial services,” said Megan Hernbroth, a spokeswoman.\n\nFounded in 2012, San Francisco-based Coinbase said it has seen “unprecedented growth” over the last year as it helped customers buy and sell more than $25 billion worth of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether. Cryptocurrencies have seen enormous price gains -- bitcoin is up 250 percent year to date -- trouncing other asset classes amid an explosion of attention, but there are growing pains.\n\nOn June 21, ether crashed to 10 cents from $317.81 on Coinbase’s GDAX exchange. The cause was a single $12.5 million trade -- one of the biggest ever -- that triggered further selling. It all happened in just 45 milliseconds, after which computer algorithms started buying, driving prices back up to $300 within 10 seconds. “We have reimbursed all customers affected,” Hernbroth said. To help prevent a repeat of the ether crash, Coinbase is considering developing circuit breakers that would pause trading to prevent accidents after consulting with industry experts including the New York Stock Exchange, which has an investment in the company.\n\nEarlier this month, the bitcoin community updated the software it runs to increase the amount of transactions the network can process. In so doing, it created a new digital currency known as bitcoin cash. Initially, Coinbase said it wouldn’t support access to bitcoin cash for its customers, which angered many and led to threats of lawsuits, according to Fortune magazine. Coinbase has subsequently said it would allow customers to access their bitcoin cash by Jan. 1.\n\nHernbroth said they’ll hit the Jan. 1 deadline “assuming no additional risks emerge.”', ""Start your day with what's moving markets in Asia.

Trading volume jumped to $2.6 billion Wednesday, 60 percent higher than bigger rival bitcoin’s volume that day. Volume has been higher only twice in all of ethereum’s history.\n\nMuch of that reflects South Koreans buying the digital asset. The Korean won makes up more than 40 percent of ethereum trading volume, the highest among currency pairs, according to CoinMarketcap. Ethereum rose 4 percent Thursday to $304, near the highest since June.\n\nBitcoin crossed the $3,000 mark this week for the first time and jumped to a record high of $3,486.73, while ethereum has gained more than 30 percent in four trading days. The biggest digital currencies had been gaining in the previous weeks, as relief that a split in the bitcoin blockchain, agreement on how to scale the technology and regulatory developments boosted prices.\n\nInvestors are going into cryptocurrencies even as bitcoin’s volatility is about 10 times that of gold, as proponents view their independence from any central authority as a safeguard against central bank meddling or government turmoil. It also serves a means to protect savings in countries that have high inflation, a weakening currency or capital controls.\n\nWhether investors will at some point need a refuge from the new-found safe haven of cryptocurrencies still needs to be determined."", 'Bitcoin has gone on bull runs before but nothing like this: Prices this week shot through the $3,500 mark as the mainstream media hailed digital currency as a new asset class. Then it got another boost as the blue chip brokerage house, Fidelity, allowed its customers to create bitcoin accounts.\n\nNow, some people are calling for it go even higher. As Quartz reports, a Standpoint Research analyst has called a target of $5000 for bitcoin by 2018. This raises the question of whether ordinary investors should put a smidgen of their savings, or even their retirement accounts, into buying bitcoin. (Keep in mind you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin. Since it’s digital, you can buy a hundred millionth of one—this tiny unit is called a Satoshi after bitcoin’s creator.)\n\nThere are strong arguments to buy—and also strong ones to stay the heck away. Here are three of each.\n\n3 Reasons to Buy Bitcoin\n\nMajor investors and the financial industry is taking it seriously\n\nSince its creation in 2008, Bitcoin’s biggest boosters have been computer geeks and libertarians. But recently, they’ve been joined by a growing number of mainstream investors and entrepreneurs who see bitcoin—and other digital currencies—as a legitimate asset class such as stocks, bonds, or commodities.\n\nIn 2017 alone, famous names like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital have bet on hedge funds that are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into digital currency funds. Meanwhile, the financial infrastructure to support bitcoin and other digital currency is maturing rapidly: Coinbase’s GDAX exchange has supported margin trading since March, while the Commodity Future Trading Commission just gave the green light for firms to sell digital currency options and other derivatives.\n\nThere is only a limited amount of bitcoin\n\nOne reason to buy bitcoins are a valuable asset is that only 21 million of them will ever come into the world—and most of them are already here. As those familiar with bitcoin know, the number of coins created by the mining process drops by half every few years. Right now, around 80% of all bitcoins are already mined and no new ones will appear after the year 2040. This scarcity could continue to drive up demand, especially if (as has been rumored), central banks decide to start buying them as foreign currency reserves.\n\nSome see bitcoin as the new gold\n\nSo-called gold bugs like to own the precious metal because it is an asset whose value is not controlled by governments. Even if a country is ravaged by war or its profligate central bank prints too much money, the value of gold (unlike the national currency) will remain. Bitcoin has many of the same qualities. It exists on a decentralized computer network that transcends national borders, and there is no Federal Reserve-like authority that can devalue it.\n\nThis isn’t a definitive reason to buy bitcoin any more than it is to buy gold. But an analyst cited by Quartz predicts the gold bugs will become bitcoin bugs instead, which means a lot of money flowing into the digital currency.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\n3 Reasons Not to Buy Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s core users are still criminals and fringe figures\n\nFor years, stores like Overstock and Subway have accepted bitcoin as payment alongside cash and credit cards. But despite the promise of true believers that bitcoin could replace cash one day, there is no evidence this will happen. The reality is bitcoin is too slow compared to visa or debit cards, and transaction fees are rising. Right now, you can pay a fee and wait ten minutes for your bitcoin transaction to clear—or swipe a credit card to pay instantly and get a cash reward.\n\nBecause of these limitations, bitcoin’s core use remains what’s it’s always been: paying for drugs or extortion fees on the Internet. For instance, the cyber-criminals who launched a recent wave of “ransomware” attacks known as WannaCry asked for payment in bitcoin.\n\nOrdinary consumers, meanwhile, are not using it as a payment method. That doesn’t mean its not valuable as an investment—just that, in the real world, it’s even less useful than gold.\n\nBitcoin is extremely volatile\n\nOver its nearly decade-long history, bitcoin has been prone to spectacular crashes. In 2013, for instance, the currency went on a run to over $1,100 only to tank to $700 a few months later, and then bottom out near $200 in early 2015. There is no reason this couldn’t happen again.\n\nWhile investors may drool at $5,000 bitcoin, they better be equally ready to kick themselves if it tumbles back to $2,000 or lower this year. This goes double for the many other so-called alt-currencies (other digital currencies some people buy as a proxy investment for bitcoin.)\n\nBitcoin only exists on computers\n\nThis may sound obvious but, as a form of money, bitcoin might be the most intangible stuff in history. Even paper money or securities can be presented to a central bank or company in the hopes someone will redeem them. No such possibility with bitcoin. Digital currency is just a piece of code out there on the Internet (or in special digital storage vaults to prevent hackers from stealing it), and there is no country or company you can ask to honor it.', 'Fidelity held a trial with its own employees first before launching this initiative. The company\'s CEO Abigail Johnson has repeatedly affirmed her belief in cryptocurrencies, and previously claimed that even the Fidelity cafeteria accepts bitcoins. But it\'s also an attempt to glean more info on how clients keep cryptocurrencies behave.\n\n""This is an experiment in the spirit of learning what these crypto assets are like and how our customers may want to interact with them,"" Hadley Stern, senior vice president and managing director at Fidelity Labs, told Reuters in an interview.', 'An Initial Coin Offering, also commonly referred to as an ICO, is a fundraising mechanism in which new projects sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for bitcoin and ether. It’s somewhat similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in which investors purchase shares of a company.\n\n\n\nICOs are a relatively new phenomenon but have quickly become a dominant topic of discussion within the blockchain community. Many view ICO projects as unregulated securities that allow founders to raise an unjustified amount of capital, while others argue it is an innovation in the traditional venture-funding model. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently reached a decision regarding the status of tokens issued in the infamous DAO ICO which has forced many projects and investors to re-examine the funding models of many ICOs. The most important criteria to consider is whether or not the token passes the Howey test. If it does, it must be treated as a security and is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the SEC.\n\nICOs are easy to structure because of technologies like the ERC20 Token Standard, which abstracts a lot of the development process necessary to create a new cryptographic asset. Most ICOs work by having investors send funds (usually bitcoin or ether) to a smart contract that stores the funds and distributes an equivalent value in the new token at a later point in time.\n\nThere are few, if any, restrictions on who can participate in an ICO, assuming that the token is not, in fact, a security. And since you’re taking money from a global pool of investors, the sums raised in ICOs can be astronomical. A fundamental issue with ICOs is the fact that most of them raise money pre-product. This makes the investment extremely speculative and risky. The counter argument is that this fundraising style is particularly useful (even necessary) in order to incentivize protocol development.\n\nBefore we get into a discussion over the merits of ICOs, it is important to have some historical context for how the trend started.\n\nHistory of ICOs\n\nSeveral projects used a crowdsale model to try and fund their development work in 2013. Ripple pre-mined 1 billion XRP tokens and sold them to willing investors in exchange for fiat currencies or bitcoin. Ethereum raised a little over $18 million in early 2014 — the largest ICO ever completed at that time.\n\nThe DAO was the first attempt at fundraising for a new token on Ethereum. It promised to create a decentralized organization that would fund other blockchain projects, but it was unique in that governance decisions would be made by the token holders themselves. While the DAO was successful in terms of raising money — over $150 million — an unknown attacker was able to drain millions from the organization because of technical vulnerabilities. The Ethereum Foundation decided the best course of action was to move forward with a hard fork, allowing them to claw back the stolen funds.\n\nAlthough the first attempt to fund a token safely on the Ethereum platform failed, blockchain developers realized that using Ethereum to launch a token was still much easier than pursuing seed rounds through the usual venture capital model. Specifically, the ERC20 standard makes it easy for developers to create their own cryptographic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSome argue that crowdfunding projects might be Ethereum’s “killer application” given the sheer size and frequency of ICOs. Never before have pre-product startups been able to raise this much money and in this little time. Aragon raised around $25 million in just 15 minutes, Basic Attention Token raised $35 million in only 30 seconds, and Status.im raised $270 million in a few hours. With few regulations and such ease of use, this ICO climate has come under scrutiny from many in the community as well as various regulatory bodies around the world.\n\nAre ICOs Legal?\n\nThe short answer is maybe. Legally, ICOs have existed in an extremely gray area because arguments can be made both for and against the fact that they’re just new, unregulated financial assets. The SEC’s recent decision, however, has since managed to clear up some of that gray area. In some cases, the token is simply a utility token, meaning it gives the owner access to a specific protocol or network; thus it may not be classified as a financial security. On the other hand, if the token is an equity token, meaning that it’s only purpose is to appreciate in value, then it looks a lot more like a security.\n\nWhile many individuals purchase tokens to access the underlying platform at some future point in time, it’s difficult to refute the idea that most token purchases are for speculative investment purposes. This is easy to ascertain given the valuation figures for many projects that have yet to release a commercial product.\n\nThe SEC decision may have provided some clarity to the status of utility vs security tokens; however, there are still plenty of room for testing the boundaries of legalities. For now, and until further regulatory limits are imposed, entrepreneurs will continue to take advantage of this new phenomenon.\n\nICO Resources\n\nResearch:\n\nCommunities:\n\nCalendars:', 'A fresh growth spurt for Bitcoin has seen traditional investors once again surface to comment that the digital currency bubble is on the verge of bursting. But those involved are bullish and optimistic that the real growth has not even begun yet.\n\nIt is not only the growth of Bitcoin, which has been unprecedented this year alone but the birth of altcoins and the ease in which money is seemingly created from nothing through ICOs. Bitcoin’s fork, and the creating of Bitcoin Cash is another ‘bubble-warning,’ apparently.\n\nA year of growth\n\nBitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, have staggered many with the way in which they have grown in 2017 alone. A new high of $3,500 was achieved earlier this month when Bitcoin succeeded beyond its Aug. 1 ‘Independance day.’\n\nThis growth has also seen a host of other altcoins and their value dragged up with the original cryptocurrency.\n\nThese altcoins have come from the creation of highly popular ICOs, which have seen record falls almost weekly as one outdoes another.\n\nAt the start of 2017, the total value - or market cap - of all cryptocurrencies in existence was about $17.5 bln, with Bitcoin making up almost 90 percent of that, according to CoinMarketCap. It is now around $120 bln.\n\nThis is about the same value as Goldman Sachs and Royal Bank of Scotland combined.\n\nFear from the traditionalists\n\nWhile companies like Goldman Sachs have appreciated the value of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, it is traditional investment companies like these that are ringing the bubble panic bells.\n\n""It\'s just created new value out of nowhere,"" said Rob Moffat, a partner at Balderton Capital, a London-based venture capital firm who focuses on fintech, about Bitcoin Cash’s hard fork. ""There\'s no fundamentals behind any of this - it\'s all based on public perception, so you can start to see some really strange phenomena.""\n\nEarlier, in July, Billionaire US investor Howard Marks described the Bitcoin boom as similar to the dotcom bubble, which he predicted.\n\nOther investment firms, like Citadel, have likened it to the Blackberry Bubble.\n\nBullish believers\n\nHowever, there is a whole other camp of believers who are calling this new high for Bitcoin as only the beginning of a Bull run.\n\n“The idea of this thing being a bubble is silly. We\'re in the bottom of the first innings,"" said Miguel Vias of Ripple, the third-biggest cryptocurrency, who was previously global head of precious metals and metal options at CME Group.\n\nThe fear of all cryptocurrencies rising together, along with Bitcoin, is to be expected as their values are highly correlated, feeding off each other and magnifying the market effect, and this should not be seen as a sign of a bubble.', 'A panel of traditional financial experts on CNBC have chosen Bitcoin over both gold and a basket of US stocks as an investment opportunity.\n\nIn a segment on the channel’s Fast Money segment, Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Thomas Lee said when given a choice between the precious metal and US stocks, Bitcoin was “easily” the best option between now and the end of 2017.\n\n“I think Bitcoin is an under-owned asset the the potential for huge institutional sponsorship coming,” he said. “Between now and year end, it’s easily Bitcoin.”\n\nGiven the current money supply trends and gold discovery, Lee added that if Bitcoin could capture just five percent of the alternative currency market, it would take on a value per coin of “$25,000 to $50,000 per token.”\n\nWhile other interviewees were less decided on Bitcoin’s future, suggesting it could still “go to zero,” the mood continues a broadly enthusiastic tone coming from fiat circles.\n\nCNBC has quoted multiple sources on its shows in recent months, many of whom have called Bitcoin being worth multiples of its current price within varying time frames.\n\nA notable counterbalance came in the form of Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget, who in late May repeated the age-old argument that Bitcoin “has no intrinsic value.”\n\nSince then, prices have surpassed the expectations of many, with Max Keiser’s forecast of $5,000 by 2018 now looking increasingly likely.\n\nRead more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, Tips', ""Denise Chisholm, a sector strategist for Fidelity Investments who uses historical probability analysis, spoke to Henry Blodget about whether the stock market is in a bubble. She notes the outperformance of a cap-weighted S&P 500 and one that's weighted equally, and dispels the idea that it's a negative sign. Chisholm also sees the market-beating returns seen in tech as aligned with history, and doesn't view it as a tail event. She then goes on to break down the three main drivers of tech performance, and outlines why she sees growth stock in the sector as cheap. Finally, for investors worried about a correction, Chisholm recommends seeking out defensive stocks, which will outperform in a down market and still ride the wave higher when the market is climbing."", ""The growth of Bitcoin has seen digital currencies thrust into the limelight, and with that has come the customization of altcoins for different niches.

Brown, the chief executive officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management and author of a popular finance blog, has long been skeptical of the digital currency. He finally bought some, he said, “because the goddamn thing won’t go away.”\n\nStill, Brown, who helps manage half a billion dollars, isn’t really a convert quite yet, especially when it comes to security measures at bitcoin exchanges. He researched several before buying his bitcoins at Coinbase Inc. and wasn’t impressed, he said in an interview. “I don’t think any one service is safer than another. It’s too early to anoint any of them as the JPMorgan of bitcoin. I don’t think that exists.”\n\nJoshua Brown Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n\nSuch concerns are the biggest obstacle to growth in the market for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether, the second-biggest. Even as investors are lured by their price gains and volatility, the biggest institutions are reluctant to get in, raising further concerns about liquidity. The challenge for exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini Trust Co. is persuading major financial players that the $121 billion market for digital assets meets 21st Century standards.\n\nThe dangers are apparent. On June 21, ether crashed to 10 cents from $317.81 in trading on Coinbase. The cause was a single $12.5 million trade -- one of the biggest ever -- that triggered further selling. It all happened in just 45 milliseconds, after which computer algorithms started buying, driving prices back up to $300 within 10 seconds. Some digital coin exchanges have collapsed or customer funds have disappeared. All of which is scaring away the very investors the exchanges need to succeed.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Was Cool, But Its Blockchain May Be Useful\n\nCumberland Mining, a unit of Chicago-based high-frequency trading firm DRW Holdings LLC, handles many big orders privately “because the exchanges and other marketplaces can’t handle that type of liquidity or don’t have that type of liquidity,” said Bobby Cho, a cryptocurrency trader at Cumberland. “The marketplace is so fragmented that liquidity is fragmented.”\n\nAt the heart of bitcoin trading stands the blockchain, a so-called distributed ledger that is also touted, loudly and often, as a cure-all for markets that would speed up clearing, eliminate costly delays over disputed trades and reduce capital costs for banks. The hype, however, sometimes outstrips the reality.\n\nWhen Brown bought his bitcoin, he was unaware that the purchase wasn’t secured on the blockchain, that it was only held internally at Coinbase. That puts extra pressure on markets to maintain security to thwart hackers and thieves. After Brown wrote about buying bitcoin on his blog, “People were screaming at me, ‘Coinbase is not for storage!’” he said. In response, a friend helped him set up a wallet to hold his bitcoin that is secured by the blockchain.\n\nWild West\n\n“It’s the Wild West, it’s very much early days still,” said Richard Johnson, a market-structure analyst at Greenwich Associates who specializes in blockchain. Johnson agreed that the time and complexity of moving digital currencies from one exchange to another is “not acceptable” given how modern investors operate, and that while Gemini, Coinbase’s GDAX and other U.S.-based exchanges have strong know-your-customer procedures, more needs to be done. “If people want to get serious about this for real banking transactions, it needs to be better and easier to use.”\n\nInvestment money continues to pour into digital assets. Coinbase said Thursday that it received a $100 million investment from a group led by IVP. It plans to use the money to expand its engineering and customer support staff, open a New York office for its professional trading platform GDAX and grow Toshi, “a mobile browser for the ethereum network that provides universal access to financial services,” said Megan Hernbroth, a spokeswoman.\n\nAdam White, general manager for GDAX, said the company only allows fully collateralized trading and should be thought of as a spot market. That means if a Coinbase user doesn’t have the cash to cover the whole trade, it doesn’t happen.\n\nFighting Fraud\n\n“What we’ve been very good at is preventing people from fraudulently buying digital currency,” he said in an interview. “We’re doing hundreds of trades per minute, and we immediately settle and clear all those trades on our platform,” he said. “There’s no need to post those to the blockchain.” Coinbase is regulated by New York State under its BitLicense program, which among other things requires registration by any company “performing exchange services as a customer business,” according to the state website.\n\nCoinbase has also acquired about 35 money transmitter licenses from U.S. states that require them, White said. The exchange acts as a custodian to many of its users and stores several billion dollars worth of digital assets, according to White. Keeping those funds safe is Coinbase’s No. 1 priority, White said. Still, he acknowledged the spotty history of digital asset exchanges.\n\n“This is an industry that has a less-than-stellar past when it comes to meeting customer requirements,” he said. The general movement is in the right direction, however, he said.\n\nLiquidity Lacking\n\nDV Chain, a sister company to DV Trading in Chicago, handles most of its cryptocurrency trading volume off-exchange, said CEO Garrett See. While DV does transact on a number of platforms, lack of liquidity and the quality of the technology can be a problem on exchanges, he said.\n\n“Some of these exchanges take seconds or sometimes minutes between when you click to buy and when your order makes it to the exchange, if it makes it at all,” See said. Because there are so many exchanges, “liquidity is distributed across lots of different places,” he added. If the market got to a point where there was a centralized exchange and all the volume is there, “then I don’t think you’re going to see flash crashes like that as much,” See said.\n\nSee and Cumberland’s Cho are exactly the type of market makers that digital exchanges need, yet the adage of “liquidity builds liquidity” is a tough problem to solve. “Market makers play that role, of bringing agility and efficiency to the marketplace,” said Javier Paz, a senior analyst at Aite Group LLC. “The role of a liquidity maker requires at the very least close rapport with cryptocurrency exchanges,” Paz said.\n\nBitcoin Futures\n\nThere are signs that the worlds of cryptocurrency and traditional finance are coming together. Last week Gemini announced it struck a deal with CBOE Holdings Inc. to help the Chicago-based exchange create a futures contract based on bitcoin. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month issued its first guidance on digital assets and the exchanges where they trade, saying most coins are likely to meet the definition of a security and the markets where they trade need to register with the regulator.\n\nAnd the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in July granted final approval for LedgerX LLC to offer options contracts on bitcoin. The LedgerX and CBOE approach includes a clearinghouse standing in the middle of all trades, which will give those efforts more legitimacy in many traders’ eyes, said Dan Hodd, co-founder of Digital Asset Investment Co., a hedge fund focused on trading digital assets.\n\n“One of the biggest challenges in this whole space is translating the capability of this new technology and the assets that come with it to the traditional financial system,” said Hodd, who previously traded equity swaps at Citigroup Inc. “It has to fit both sides of the puzzle.”\n\n‘Huge Step’\n\nThe industry is progressing in terms of the volume of transactions on exchanges and the ease of trading, Tyler Winklevoss, who founded Gemini with his brother Cameron, said in an interview. “It’s a huge step” to be developing futures contracts based on bitcoin that will trade at CBOE, he said. “You can’t expect a child who’s learning to walk to sprint, there has to be a sequence to it.” Gemini is regulated as a New York state chartered limited liability trust company.\n\nThe number of bitcoin trades on Gemini and GDAX jumped earlier this year. While in February, Gemini’s volume hit just over 85,000, the next month it was more than 160,000, according to data from TradeBlock. GDAX transactions went from just over 171,000 to nearly 350,000 in the same span, according to TradeBlock.\n\n“Over time all the technology becomes more fluid, better and easier to use,” Cameron Winklevoss said in an interview. “When we first got into bitcoin, we had to go to Mt. Gox,” Tyler said. The former head of Mt. Gox, the bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange that imploded in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of the cryptocurrency, began his trial last month. Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles pleaded not guilty in Tokyo to charges of embezzlement and inflating corporate financial accounts.\n\nJust One\n\nThe growing pains at the exchanges should be expected at this stage of the industry’s development, said Mas Nakachi, an adviser to fintech companies who’s spent nearly 15 years on Wall Street as an analyst and former CEO of OpenGamma, a software provider that specializes in derivatives. When Nakachi was trying to learn the Solidity coding language that is used to create the ethereum blockchain, he could only find one book on it on Amazon.com.\n\n“When was the last time there was only one book on Java? The early ’90s?” he said in an interview. “The biggest misconception coming from the institutional side is the definition of an exchange,” Nakachi said. Traditional markets segregate customer accounts and use clearinghouses to guarantee trades, among other security and operational measures, Nakachi said. “When people refer to exchanges in the crypto space, there is none of that.”\n\nHe’d like to see more steps like the ones taken by LedgerX and CBOE, which will use clearinghouses and other familiar market operations. Clearinghouses collect cash and securities like U.S. Treasuries to ensure if a trader fails there’s enough money to cover losses. They also monitor risk on a daily basis and liquidate positions if traders can’t meet their margin call.\n\n“It’s so early it should be expected” that there are things that still need to be done, he said, “but that’s what the institutional guys are finding as they tiptoe into the space.”', 'Recent tension between the US and North Korea has played its part on the global market, rattling some of the major asset classes. However, not being pegged, or controlled by any centralized force, Bitcoin was totally unaffected by the news.\n\nOvernight US stocks took a big tumble, leaving their calm waters and falling by one percent.

Building tension between nuclear superpowers spooks many assets and stocks but has had little effect on Bitcoin as its value actually rose slightly while traditional markets fell.\n\nWhile the tension drove stocks down a percent, a large move for such steady assets, Bitcoin was trading around its new record high of $3,400.\n\nNot just a Bitcoin thing\n\nIn fact, all digital currencies continued to rise and fall for their own reasons, totally oblivious to what is happening globally.\n\nBitcoin Cash was the biggest faller in the world’s biggest cryptocurrencies, but that more had to do with users reporting difficulty in selling it as the dump of this hard forked coin continues.\n\nEthereum, the second biggest currency by Market Cap, also felt little volatility as it remained above $300.\n\nDifferent swings and roundabouts\n\nCryptocurrencies are famous for their volatility, but the non-correlation between the global market slipping and cryptocurrencies mostly staying up shows that these decentralized forms of currency won’t be affected like traditional assets.', 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is Bitcoin\'s anonymous creator and absentee head of state. In the years since she (or he, or they) disappeared into the ether and left the technology in the hands of a few high-profile developers, Nakamoto\'s words have become nigh-gospel for some in the Bitcoin world.\n\nOn Friday, a user going by ""CipherionX"" on the Bitcointalk forum published five emails allegedly between Satoshi Nakamoto and former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn. In an email to Motherboard, Hearn confirmed that he shared the emails with the user. While Hearn himself, who was one of the earliest Bitcoin developers, has previously quoted most of the juicy bits from his correspondence with Nakamoto, it appears to be the first time much of the material has been shared in full. None of the emails are included on a popular database of Nakamoto\'s writings collected from old emails and forum posts.\n\nRead More: Why Satoshi Nakamoto Matters\n\nThe emails range from 2009 (just months after Nakamoto published the details of Bitcoin for the first time) all the way to 2011, when the anonymous creator sent their now-legendary goodbye note to Hearn: ""I\'ve moved on to other things. It\'s in good hands with Gavin [Andresen] and everyone.""\n\nEven if some of the best quotes are well-known in the community after being published by Hearn in piecemeal, it\'s still pretty interesting to read how Nakamoto took the time to answer Hearn\'s many detailed questions about Bitcoin.\n\nFor example, in one email dated April 12, 2009, Hearn posed a question about how the system could handle billions of global transactions. Nakamoto seems to have believed that Bitcoin could one day become a worldwide payment system like Visa.\n\n""The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide,"" Nakamoto wrote to Hearn in April of 2009. ""Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.""\n\nHearn wrote me in an email that he shared the emails with the Bitcointalk user simply because they asked, and there\'s not much more to it than that. Hearn gave up his post as one of Bitcoin\'s earliest and best-respected developers last year when he exited the space entirely and declared the community too toxic to work in. He\'s now developing a blockchain-based finance tool called Corda.\n\n""I am no longer in the Bitcoin space,"" Hearn wrote me in an email. And just like Satoshi Nakamoto all those years ago, he\'s ""moved on to other things.""\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.', 'Bitcoin hit new highs this week, and Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget is calling it the ""perfect asset for a speculative bubble.""\n\nThe cryptocurrency recently ""forked,"" which resulted in every coin being split into one coin, and one unit of something called bitcoin cash.

Ethereum is projected to replace Bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency, especially after BitCoin experienced a sharp decline this week.\n\nEthereum price started to climb on Wednesday as it reached $314.75, according to CNBC. This is recorded as its highest price in August. Subsequently, the price stabilized on Thursday to $301, as monitored by the platform monitoring CryptoCompare.\n\nThe second-most popular cryptocurrency is expected to take over Bitcoin as the most valuable cryptocurrency. There are some indications that Ethereum will become more powerful than Bitcoin. One of the indications is the steady hike in its price during the last two weeks, while Bitcoin suffered a wild fluctuation before bounced back on Thursday to $3,433.\n\nAnother indication is the number of big corporations that support Ethereum. In February this year, Ethereum supporters formed an initiative called Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). This initiative was established to develop the enterprise-grade and open-source distributed ledger framework for Ethereum. As for now, there are over 150 organizations that joined EEA, including big corporations from technology and financial industries, such as JP Morgan, MasterCard, Microsoft, Accenture, Cisco, and CME.\n\nEstablishing EEA to create an open industry standard is one of the key success factors of Ethereum. As EEA was founded in the spirit of creating an open standard for distributed ledgers, the EEA and its members are able to address critical and important features in the distributed ledgers. This kind of industry standard is not available in Bitcoin.\n\nSince its inception in 2014, Ethereum has regained interest from technology and financial industries in the field of cryptocurrency. Its creator, Vitalik Buterin was a co-founder of the Bitcoin Magazine who decided to create his own cryptocurrency system using the same blockchain technology as Bitcoin. He began to formulate the system and technology for Ethereum in 2013 before launching the cryptocurrency through a Swiss-based company, Ethereum Switzerland with three other co-founders a year later.\n\nAs a software developer, Buterin aimed to develop a system with the focus on higher efficiency of blocks transaction rather than storing them like Bitcoin. Within three years, Ethereum has gained much attention from financial and technology industries with its difference in blockchain technology that allows faster trading than Bitcoin blockchain technology.\n\nRegardless of its rapid rise, many skeptics have doubted that Ethereum, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are able to become trusted and solid currency. Furthermore, the market capitalization for Ethereum has reached $28.8 billion and $57 billion for Bitcoin. It will be a global financial disaster when either one of these cryptocurrency systems collapses. Watch the differences between these two cryptocurrency systems below:\n\n\n\n[Featured Image by monsitj/iStock]', 'Bitcoin prices continue to climb, notching fresh highs as the broader cryptocurrency space keeps gaining momentum.\n\nThe world\'s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization reached as much as $3,646.87 today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), helping the digital asset set an all-new high.\n\nThis price represented a roughly 275% year-to-date increase.\n\n""It\'s an incredible bull trend,"" said Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency platform Whaleclub.\n\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nMarket Optimism\n\nGoing forward, some market experts are quite optimistic about Bitcoin\'s prospects.\n\nIqbal Gandham, UK Managing Director at eToro, a multi-asset broker and social trading company, offered a bullish perspective:\n\n""[Bitcoin\'s] ecosystem is getting stronger,"" he said. ""You now have more places to spend Bitcoin, more evening meetups discussing how to work with Bitcoin and other [cryptocurrency] assets.""', ""Bitcoin [BTC] has jumped to a fresh record high of $3545 this Friday following Thursday’s bullish inside day candle. BTC’s rival Bitcoin Cash [BCC] has tanked as some investors who got access to exchanges have dumped their coins. The sell-off in the newly created clone is a sort of victory for the original crypto currency.\n\nHeightened curiosity feeds into the rally\n\nBTC has been on a tear of late… and that has increased curiosity among investors about the virtual currency, which is being labelled as a 21st century gold. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs are taking more interest in the Bitcoin of late. More and more investors are becoming familiar with the digital currency.\n\nHowever, it is all hype. Comparisons with gold are premature. What made gold a global safe haven asset? - Perception… that gold never loses its value. The perception has been created due to persistent demand over the last few hundred years from the two Asian giants - India and China/South East Asia… If Bitcoin has to rival gold, it has to gain widespread acceptance in India/China and young nations. It’s a long way to go.\n\nFor now, it is the curiosity and the hype that is feeding into the market and pushing the prices to record highs.\n\nBitcoin's behaviour is normal, premature to call it a bubble\n\nSceptics say the Cryptocurrency bubble could the worst in the modern history. They say the current rally in Bitcoin has all the elements of a bubble that has yet to turn into a mania before it bursts… I beg to differ.\n\nThe high volatility, big spikes and sudden price crashes are normal in a nascent market. One cannot expect a toddler to behave like a 50-year old person. On similar lines, Bitcoin rally could be irrational, based on hype, but the market is still in a nascent stage and thus expecting it behave like gold or other matured markets is irrational.\n\nMost experts compare Bitcoin with gold and conclude the virtual currency is a nothing more than an illusion. However, I believe one needs to draw parallels between Bitcoin behaviour today and the price action in gold a thousand years ago [when gold was a toddler]\n\nThe hype led rallies do deflate. It would have happened with gold as well thousand years back. But that was not the end of the world for gold. On similar lines, Bitcoin’s hype-led rally could deflate, but that won’t be an end of the world for cryptos.\n\nThus, it is premature to call it a bubble. If the virtual currency penetrates deep into South East Asia and other young nations, it could easily gain credibility and challenge gold. No one can say for sure whether it will penetrate the key regions. So it is better to avoid taking extreme views - calling it a Holy Grail or once in a lift time bubble.\n\nTechnicals - Volume continues to disappoint\n\nDaily chart\n\nThe chart continues to show a bearish volume divergence. Hence, caution is advised as we may be in for a sudden pull back over the weekend, although the dips below 10-DMA could find takers, given the average is still sloping upwards.\n\nHowever, a pullback triggered by a bearish price RSI divergence on the 4-hour chart could go much deeper… possibly towards $3000 levels.\n\n4-Hour chart - Potential bearish RSI divergence""]"
08/12/2017,"['What a day for Bitcoin.\n\n24 hours ago the cryptocurrency was trading below $3,700. About an hour ago it surged passed $4,000 and has no signs of stopping. It’s now trading around $4,135.00. For reference, a week ago Bitcoin hit an all-time high as it passed $3,000 for the first time.\n\nCheck out the chart below to see what the price has done in the last 24 hours.\n\nSo the million dollar bitcoin question is…why now?\n\nWithout wasting too much of your Saturday night with detailed analysis, here are a few possible reasons you can tell your friends during brunch tomorrow.\n\nTwo weeks ago Bitcoin went through a hard fork, and came out essentially unscathed. Sure, a bitcoin-clone called Bitcoin Cash was created, but it’s gotten a lot less attention than most people expected. A few days later Bitcoin locked in SegWit, a code modification that fixes malleability issues and frees up space in blocks, allowing for more transactions to be stored in each one.\n\nThese two code-related developments have helped boost conference in Bitcoin’s future.\n\nAnother reason – the ICO frenzy. The amount recently raised via initial coin offerings have now (at least temporally) topped amount raised via early stage venture capital. Just last week Filecoin raised $180 million in a few hours. Most investors have to convert fiat currency to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to participate in ICOs, which could be driving up the price (and providing some investors with their first taste of bitcoin).\n\nAnother reason – Wall Street’s new obsession is bitcoin. You can’t watch CNBC for five minutes without seeing a trader or analyst give their opinion – which is usually something insanely bullish like “it’s going to be the best performing investment of the year”. For better or for worse, statements like these are getting non-technically inclined investors interested in bitcoin, some of which are definitely buying coins for the first time.\n\nSo what happens next? No one knows. Bitcoin could crash 50% to $2,000 tomorrow or spike to $5,000 – and I don’t think anyone who truly knows crypto would be surprised at either option. Everyone has a different opinion – some say the bubble is oversized and should have popped months ago – others think that bitcoin is currently just a fraction of what it could eventually trade at.\n\nWhichever camp you fall in, here’s one friendly reminder: don’t invest more than you can afford to lose – because if you ask anyone who’s spent more than a few months in the cryptocurrency world they’ll tell you it’s a roller coaster.\n\nFeatured Image: Russell Werges', 'Bitcoin hit a new all-time high today, soaring past its previous record hitting $3,793.86 before sliding back, as one bitcoin is currently worth $3,744.56, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe cryptocurrency’s new record pushes its market cap to $61.7 billion, with the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem now being worth $132 billion. During the last 24 hours, bitcoin’s value surged by 7.44% as its dominance is now at 46.49%.\n\nBack in July, Goldman Sachs’ chief technical analyst Sheba Jafari accurately predicted that bitcoin’s price would pull back to about $1,850, before setting a new record high. According to his prediction, the cryptocurrency could go as a far as $3,915 before it stops surging.\n\nSome predict that bitcoin might soon hit a new milestone: $4,000. Although it isn’t clear what will happen next, there are some identifiable factors behind bitcoin’s climb.\n\nRising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, some investors are using cryptocurrencies as a safe haven, as the war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea intensifies.\n\nInvestors are turning to cryptocurrencies, as their independence from any central authority is a safeguard against central banks and governments, meaning that if North Korea and the U.S. enter a military conflict, bitcoin won’t suffer from possible outcomes such as high inflation, a weakened currency, or capital controls.\n\nAs InvestFeed Inc’s CEO Ron Chernesky put it:\n\n“We’re seeing investors transferring their funds into cryptocurrencies as they try to diversify their risk in case of a severe downturn in the market”\n\nRecently, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un threatened to fire four intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) to the U.S. island of Guam, in the Western Pacific. As a response, Donald Trump stated that he will “regret it fast” if he further threats the U.S. Various countries, including Canada, asked the two nations to de-escalate the situation.\n\nBitfinex suspends U.S. verification requests\n\nPopular cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex recently announced that it will no longer accept U.S. clients. According to the announcement, the exchange will suspend individual verification requests.\n\nThe exchange added that the move has been considered before, but now that is it having difficulties providing USD deposits and withdrawals for U.S. citizens, it believes the time has come to stop accepting U.S. clients.\n\nIt reads:\n\n“We regret to announce that, effective immediately, we will no longer be accepting verification requests for U.S. individuals. We have for some time considered pulling away from the retail marketplace in the U.S., and now with a current backlog of verification requests and ongoing difficulties in providing USD deposit and withdrawals for U.S. individuals, we feel that the time has come to begin disengaging from U.S. retail customers.”\n\nAmong the factors that led to the decision, Bitfinex revealed that a large portion of its resources go to U.S. customers, while only a small percentage of the revenues come from them.\n\nThe move effectively limits liquidity and creates a sense of scarcity, which further leads to a bullish market.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Fresh off $100 million in new funding, expectations are high that Coinbase – the largest and most visible US cryptocurrency startup – will use its new investment to improve services that have succumbed to the stress of a growing industry.\n\nSo, while praise rolled in quickly for Coinbase in the mainstream press this week, just as quick were the social media criticisms, with users refraining from any reticence in describing their dissatisfaction with certain aspects of its service.\n\nOn Twitter, Coinbase users openly grumbled about the startup\'s struggles with uptime, as well as technology decisions that some felt have left them, unlike the company, short on funds. Not that this should be a surprise on either side – from site outages to shoddy customer support, Coinbase has struggled to keep users happy.\n\nAnd to be fair, the company has been open about where it believes it has fallen short in adjusting to a market that went from cold to hot virtually overnight as the total market capitalization of the asset class exploded at the start of 2017.\n\n""Over the past six months, Coinbase and GDAX have seen unprecedented growth,"" said a Coinbase spokesperson in an email. ""As a result, our systems have been pushed to the limit and [this] has resulted in a negative experience for customers.""\n\nWhile a blog post about the raise suggests Coinbase will be using the money to address some of these concerns, increasing the size of its customer support teams, it\'s yet to be seen how successful it will be in correcting them.\n\nThe spokesperson continued:\n\n""We understand how frustrating this can be, and we are committed to improving the experience for our customers. We haven\'t done enough to keep up with our growth and now we are taking steps to correct it.""\n\nHopeful this proves true, but until then, here are some of the biggest questions the startup will have to answer in the months ahead.\n\n1. Will exchange uptime improve?\n\nPerhaps the most visible problem of late, Coinbase\'s exchange, GDAX, has proven to be problematic at times of high volume, going down when users arguably most need it to function. (A criticism that could just as likely be volleyed at CoinDesk itself).\n\nBut given the influence of Coinbase\'s brand, those outages and slip-ups generally have had a negative impact on cryptocurrency prices, leading users to be denied economic opportunities, such as the ability to capitalize on volatility.\n\nThe latest incident happened in June when a multimillion dollar sale of ether was placed on GDAX, pushing the price down drastically and automatically executing a few hundred margin calls and stop losses. Stop losses allow users to limit their loss on a position by ordering the sale should the price of the asset reach a certain price, but it\'s not typically put in place for exchange slippage.\n\nThat flash crash, when ether prices plunged from more than $300 to $13, resulted in GDAX blocking withdrawals and disabling trading of the ETH/USD pair.\n\nBecause the site was inaccessible, traders that wanted to cancel their stop losses and margin calls were unable to do so. Here on Coinbase\'s community forum, one user talks about losing $5,000 worth of ether after the flash crash.\n\nIn response, Coinbase moved quickly, crediting the accounts of those directly affected, and is now looking to put trading safeguards in place. But for some, the inability to participate in a market movement was painful.\n\nIn an email, a Coinbase spokesperson said the exchange has ""committed to using funds from this round to increase the size of our engineering and support teams to improve customer experience on Coinbase.""\n\n2. Will customer service improve?\n\nAs Coinbase expands into new markets, issues have also arisen in its communication of its coverage area. For instance, the startup has an influx of customer support tickets, even in areas where it doesn\'t operate.\n\nFor instance, CoinDesk has talked to about a dozen people who have been locked out of their Coinbase accounts after accessing their account in Cuba. In July, Coinbase told us it was working through backlogged support tickets, but CoinDesk continues to get messages from users that have yet to hear about their Cuba-related ticket.\n\nAnd their Twitter feed shows an underlying problem with support in general.\n\nIn early June, Coinbase committed to decreasing first response times to less than six hours, and cases concerning large balances in under two hours.\n\nThe spokesperson reiterated this pledge in statements for this article.\n\n3. Will Coinbase list \'forked\' coins?\n\nCoinbase has said it would like to add more assets for users to trade, but just where it draws the line is unclear.\n\nCautious not to upset regulators, Coinbase likely spends a significant amount of time and money integrating a new coin into its exchange. But here, too, this has sometimes rubbed users the wrong way, especially when they could benefit economically from such listings.\n\nMost recently, Coinbase indicated it would not support the new cryptocurrency ""bitcoin cash,"" when it was suddenly created through a fork of the bitcoin network. Holders of bitcoin would automatically receive an equal amount of bitcoin cash as part of the process – if it was held in a wallet or exchange that supported bitcoin cash – but Coinbase told users interested in receiving their new funds to withdraw their coins.\n\nSome, even with Coinbase\'s advanced notice, didn\'t take their bitcoins off the platform and are now upset that they can\'t reap the rewards of bitcoin cash\'s current price of around $330, especially when a quick sale could mean they could invest more in bitcoin.\n\nNot only is this a missed opportunity for users, but Coinbase also stands to lose since it has access to bitcoin cash without having the ability to make money off those reserves through trading.\n\nThe exchange recently followed up on its statement about bitcoin cash support, pledging to enable withdrawals of the new cryptocurrency by January.\n\nThe question then becomes whether stalls in listing the new cryptocurrency are resource constraints that the new raise could help shore up, as the company is looking to fill many open positions.\n\nAnd with another potential fork ahead, it remains to be seen whether the company will, or should, take steps to respond to this complaint.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase office image via Glassdoor\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Cointelegraph reached out to him to discuss his plans for the event and his take on the cryptocurrency market in China.\n\nCointelegraph: So first of all, we are very interested in how you became engaged in Bitcoin? Tell us your story.\n\nCharles Xue: I had very little knowledge of Bitcoin, and I had many friends who had bought it, and I hadn't done anything for a while. My first experience with the cryptocurrency was actually when the company that I was in asked me to help them to promote their course in Thailand about two years ago.\n\nI agreed to be their adviser and I helped them understand their business better - I think it's fascinating. At the time, Bitcoin was three Chinese cents per coin, so I asked people to sell me some. Since then, the price went up a hundred times.\n\nCT: Have you heard about, or participated in any ICOs? You must have had a lot of experience investing in IPOs. What are the key differences between the two concepts, in your opinion?\n\nCX: Yes, I have been paying attention to several ICOs, and there are many many differences. An initial public offering is a stock offering for an organization or company. But an ICO is generally more like a foundation without the fixed legal structure of a registered company. By the same token, you don't have ACC and you don't have anyone monitor you.\n\nCT: From an investor’s standpoint, which is more risky: ICO or IPO?\n\nCX: Certainly ICOs have a lot more risk because, especially nowadays, there are a great many deals. Too many ICOs are popping up on the street, and as far as I know, some of them are done by people who are simply not ready - they don't have a solid CX list, they don't have solid or even basic experience, and they don’t have solid tools. So a lot of them are just counting on hype to carry them.\n\nCT: What do you think will the likely regulatory framework for ICOs be? Will they become completely legal, or are they going to remain in the current gray area?\n\nCX: It's very hard to say. I think the authorities are certainly watching what is happening. Currently, I think that it’s not such a popular thing as to cause widespread tension, but I think eventually the government will do something. But what they will do is hard to say.\n\nCT: Imagine yourself in a government position. What would you do?\n\nCX: What I would suggest is to keep trying, learning and experimenting. I think the government's biggest concern is that some naive people are going to invest a lot of their money in this speculative market and lose. So the qualification for the investor would be always a concern, from a government’s standpoint.\n\nNumber two is how do I make the industry more self-disciplined? Self-discipline needs to be promoted and it needs to be rewarded.\n\nCT: As an investor, how would you choose which ICO to invest in?\n\nCX: I just have to see the team, it's not different from when I invest in a regular company. I'll talk to the owners, I'll talk to the team, I'll have to go through their business plans, I’ll have to ensure that they have their solid pack of knowledge, and I’ll go through a lot of due diligence. Following the due diligence is the key.\n\nCT: So you are coming to the Hypethon in Saint Petersburg on August 16 and 17. What are your plans for the event?\n\nCX: My goal is to get to know the people from around the world and then listen to their perspective. I'll try to meet founders of the ICOs and I'd like to learn from them and their successes and mistakes. I'll try to learn my lessons and bring them back to China.\n\nCT: So about China - what do you think about their perspectives on the Bitcoin market? Will they spearhead its development?\n\nCX: I don't think so. Everything can happen, but I think it might take some time.\n\nCT: But the major shares of mining power and trading volume are located in China. Don’t you think that that will have some impact?\n\nCX: Bitcoin has reached a historical high recently, they have done the fork, and a lot of other events have taken place too. I think that they want to catch more public attention, yet the level of awareness in China is still very, very low. The majority of people - I would say 70 to 80 percent - have never heard of Bitcoin before.\n\nCT: So, China still has a lot of room to grow?\n\nCX: Yeah, absolutely. I think the most optimistic estimate is that there are just 5 mln people who watch and participate in any way in the Bitcoin market.

I can only analyse this from a historical point of view. And history shows that Chinese people are very, very curious about anything that comes from the West. A good deal of learning from the West has resulted in a real economic miracle which is unbelievable from everybody’s point of view. I think the government will try to regulate this to protect small investors, that's their main concern.\n\nCT: Do you invest all over the world? Or do you focus on Chinese companies?\n\nCX: Chinese companies are the vast majority of my investments.\n\nCT: So are you going to invest in any of the ICOs, or maybe you have invested already?\n\nCX: Yes, I have a dozen companies I've invested in the last thirty days.

Cryptocurrencies are our chance, this is our moment.\n\nI’m happy to see that the interest in Vibe tokens exceeded our wildest expectations. The 5th of September is less than a month away and I’m sure that we’ll see thousands of contributors putting their ETH in to buy Vibe tokens.\n\nAs every responsible CEO, I will of course exchange a significant part of my crypto portfolio into Vibes, but I’m biased, because I believe in myself more than I believe in anything else.\n\nSo it’s important that I put myself into the shoes of unknown contributors, who will trust us with their funds. Here are five important factors I would look for when considering about taking part in Viberate’s crowdsale:\n\n1. TEAM\n\nWhen we were raising our seed round everyone told us to emphasize our team in our presentation. So in the end our deck was around 30% about the people, working on the project. One of the investors then told us in the simplest way possible, why they invest into teams and not projects. He said: “I’d rather invest into a great team with an OK idea than into a crappy team with a great idea. You can have the best idea in the world, but can’t execute it with a bad team.”\n\nWe have the best team, everybody agrees ?\n\nNo, really. The founders have worked together for 15 years, we’re not just business partners, we’re friends. Music has been our center focus for the whole period and we know everything there is about the music business. We are experienced managers and skilled team leaders, joined by loyal employees, who follow our vision and share our passion. We worked with big international clients such as Philip Morris, Vodafone, Hewlett-Packard and many others, who trusted us with their event management budgets.\n\nPlus, we’re cool to hang out with.\n\n2. SOLVING OUR OWN PAINS\n\nWe started the project because we were lost in the flood of trends in music. New artists emerge daily and it’s hard to be on top of things, no matter how experienced you are. When you’re solving your own problems, you’ll go extra mile to nail it. We’ve always followed the rule that said: “If we want it to be good enough for clients, it first needs to be good enough for us.” The same goes for Viberate.\n\n3. KEEPING IT REAL\n\nThe ICO boom has seen some insane valuations for projects that were barely existing as an idea, scribbled on a napkin. Vasja already shared our thoughts about uncapped ICOs, but it’s not only about not having a cap, it’s also about where you set it. In order to develop all planned features we need around $6M and then we need all the money we can get to advertise it globally. We could spend hundreds of millions on advertising, but we set our ad cap at another $6M. It’s a lot of money, but global campaigns cost much more than that. Still, it’s enough to kickstart the service and go from there.\n\n4. WE ACTUALLY EXIST\n\nThis isn’t really an argument when you’re raising money from VC funds. But apparently it is when you’re selling tokens. Viberate already exist as an awesome service, where you can explore the world of live music, find new acts or if you’re a musician — open up a profile and use it to monitor the popularity of your career.\n\nBy buying Vibe tokens, you are contributing to a project that already has value and a vibrant community covering our backs. The database you see today was built with the help of over 50 thousand contributors.\n\nWe achieved a lot, but that’s only the tip of an iceberg. Here’s what’s still in front of us.\n\n5. MUSIC ISN’T GOING ANYWHERE\n\nThe guys at Hacked.com said it best: “Live music isn’t going away, and becomes more valuable as recorded music sales continue to decline. The potential to provide disruptive services which actually benefit the industry they target is great, and even a 10% take of the industry leader in ticket sales would equate to almost a billion dollars in annual revenues.”\n\nRecorded music is nowadays mostly a promotional tool to help drive ticket sales. For most of musicians, their primary revenue source are live shows and there’s no sign of changes here. A lot of artists are giving away their music to fans for free and hope that they will show support by attending a live show. That’s why we decided to put our focus entirely to the live music segment, because we’re sure it will only get bigger.\n\nI could easily write ten more reasons about why I think you should sit behind your computer on September 5.\n\nPress Contact Email Address\n\nkristian@umek.si\n\nSupporting Link\n\nhttps://www.viberate.io', 'According to a recently published disposition, a computer systems manager at New York City’s Department of Education (DOE), named Vladimir Ilyayev, was fined after getting caught using the DOE’s computers to mine bitcoin.\n\nAccording to reports, Vladimir Ilyayev has been working at the DOE for over a decade and, after getting caught, wasn’t fired, but got a fine of four vacation days, worth an estimated $611, by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board (COIB).\n\nThe employee installed a bitcoin mining program on the DOE’s computers that ran at night, between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. This went on for an entire month in 2014, before he got caught by the DOE’s Division of Instructional and Information Technology. He stated:\n\n“During that time, I monitored the progress of my bitcoin mining software from my home computer using remote access software.”\n\nHowever, this wasn’t the first time Vladimir Ilyayev attempted to use the DOE’s computer to mine bitcoin. According to the disposition, he made “five or six” attempts to install the bitcoin mining program, and in each one of them he was “thwarted by the DOE security software.” Since he didn’t give up, he eventually managed to bypass security protocols for a month.\n\nIt isn’t clear how the employee managed to bypass security, but his fine was both based on misusing his employer’s computers, and on engaging in a profit-making activity while on the job, which goes against city regulations.\n\nMotherboard points out that while Ilyayev was mining bitcoin using the DOE’s computers, another government employee named Rishard Chapoteau, who also worked at the DOE, attempted to mine bitcoin using a “raspberry Pi computing device”. Chapoteau, however, wasn’t fined as there was no evidence he managed to actually mine any bitcoins and, as such, there’s no evidence he actually made any money.\n\nWhen both government employees attempted to use the DOE’s computers to mine the cryptocurrency, one bitcoin was worth about $633. When Ilyayev got caught, however, one bitcoin was down to $490, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEarlier this year, as reported by CCN, a former employee of the U.S. central banking system, the Federal Reserve, was issued a $5,000 fine and sentence to 12 months’ probation for mining bitcoin on a server owned by the Federal Reserve.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Image: Supplied\n\nYes, this will be old hat to some, but you can definitely do more with cryptocurrency than letting it sit in a digital wallet.

08/13/2017,"[""Bitcoin’s skyrocketing price is showing no signs of slowing. It’s currently trading for over $4,100 a coin, having broken the $4,000 mark in the early hours of Aug. 13. It has traded for as high as $4,225, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. A prediction of $5,000 per bitcoin by years’ end, issued by Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas in July, now doesn’t seem so outlandish.\n\nThe co-author of a forthcoming book on valuing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Chris Burniske, has pointed out that there’s a strong correlation between bitcoin’s price and the performance of the search term “bitcoin” on Google, as calculated by Google Trends.

The US and North Korea are currently engaged in verbal jousting, with both sides issuing threats.\n\nInstitutional investors are lining up to get into the cryptocurrency markets. Forbes counted 15 new hedge funds poised to launch this year. Dozens of hedge funds are in the pipeline, according to trade newsletter Hedge Fund Alert(pdf). One partner at an accounting firm said the interest from clients has been “just crazy.”\n\nBitcoin continues to go mainstream. Earlier this week mutual funds giant Fidelity released a feature that allows its customers to view their bitcoin, ethereum, or litecoin holdings from within their Fidelity account.

He said cryptocurrencies have moved from a niche space to one that is more widely accepted since they are less correlated to other assets.\n\nKoreans Flock To Ethereum\n\nKoreans are seeking refuge in Ethereum, which saw its trading volume jump to $2.6 billion on Wednesday, marking a 60% gain over bitcoin’s. This marks the second time Ethereum’s trading volume has surpassed bitcoin’s, according to The South China Morning Post.\n\nMuch of Ethereum’s gain has been driven by South Korean buying. The Korean won comprises more than 40% of Ethereum trading volume, making it the highest among currency pairs, according to coinmarketcap.com. Ethereum jumped 4% on Thursday to $304, the highest since June.\n\nOther Factors Drive Crypto Leaders\n\nBitcoin, for its part, surpassed the $3,000 mark for the first time this week when it reached $3,486.73, while Ethereum grabbed more than 30% in four days of trading.\n\nBoth of the crypto leaders have been gaining in recent weeks, bitcoin benefiting from the successful bitcoin blockchain split.\n\nInvestors are moving to cryptocurrencies despite the fact bitcoin’s volatility is around 10 times greater than gold’s. Cryptocurrency proponents view their independence from a central authority as protection from meddling from central banks or governments. It also protects savings in countries with high inflation and weak capital controls.\n\nAlso read: Long-term cryptocurrency analysis: bitcoin and Ethereum rally continues amid North Korea fears\n\nEconomic Uncertainty Supports Bitcoin\n\nSince mid-2016, investors and traders in the largest bitcoin exchange markets including the U.S., China and Japan began to perceive bitcoin as a safe haven asset. Since then, bitcoin has been the go-to asset for avoiding economic uncertainty and financial instability.\n\nSome financial observers believe fiat money is approaching its decline and the emergence of a decentralized and market-based currency such as bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies that hold the philosophy of bitcoin could threaten the global financial system.\n\nBitcoin is seen as a practical and viable hedge against debt-based economies because its value solely depends on its market. Since bitcoin is decentralized by nature and has a fixed monetary supply, the value of bitcoin is decided by supply and demand. As long the demand for bitcoin continues to increase, the value of bitcoin will proportionally surge, given that its supply is fixed.\n\nWhether or not investors will at some point find themselves in need of a refuge from cryptocurrencies is still to be determined.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""There are catches.

Nonetheless, Bitcoin has pulled the whole cryptocurrency universe along with it. The total market capitalization of the 843 digital currencies has reached above $132 bln.\n\nSo, can this bullish trend continue or are we looking at another correction in the short-term? Let’s see what the chart patterns tell us. We start with the leader – Bitcoin.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nBitcoin was range bound between $2,999.99 and $1,913.19 for about two and half months. The breakout of the range had a pattern target of $4,086.79, which has been reached. We should see a consolidation or a mild correction of one to three days at the current levels before the uptrend continues.\n\nTherefore, traders who have positions from lower levels might want to book partial profits at the current levels. Avoiding fresh positions seems like a good idea until we see a small dip or a consolidation, which will give a good stop loss point.\n\nHowever, if the momentum continues and Bitcoin breaks out of $4,086.79, it can rally to $4,630.19.\n\nETH/USD\n\nEthereum is presently facing resistance at $323.69 levels, which is just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $420 to $130.26; we are not considering the lows of the flash crash of June 21 for this calculation.\n\nThe current fall can extend to $270, where the currency has dual support – from the trendline and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). We can expect this level to hold. Therefore, a buy closer to the trendline with a stop loss just below it may offer a good entry point with a small risk. The first target will be $323.69, above which a move to $381 is possible.\n\nIf, however, the trendline support breaks, a fall to $215 and $180 is likely.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nA large descending triangle is forming on the daily chart of XRP/USD. The bearish pattern will complete on a fall below $0.135. In the short-term, however, there is support at $0.15460.\n\nNevertheless, as Ripple is quoting below both the critical moving averages that are trending down, traders should avoid taking fresh long positions until price breaks out of the downtrend line at $0.20000 and starts a new uptrend. Until then, it’s better to stick with the other currencies that are following a definite trend.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nAfter the initial few days of volatility, BCH/USD is currently settling down. As the currency has a short history, we shall use the 240-minute time frame on it.\n\nPresently, the price is moving lower towards the support levels of $280 and $265. The trend will change after the price breaks out of the downtrend line at about the $330 levels. Therefore, it is best to wait for lower levels to initiate fresh positions or wait for the breakout above the trendline.\n\nThe analysis is prepared by Rakesh Upadhyay, a professional trader and contributing author for oilprice.com, exchangerates.org.uk and hacked.com.\n\n__________\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

08/14/2017,"['The virtual currency Bitcoin hit a new record over the weekend, surging past the $4,000 mark. As of press time, one Bitcoin is worth $4,250. It\'s an astonishing rally for a currency that was worth $580 a year ago and has risen 300-fold over the last five years.\n\nIt\'s not clear what\'s causing the currency\'s value to rise so rapidly.\n\nOne likely factor: last week, the Bitcoin network officially accepted a long-debated upgrade called segregated witness. The Bitcoin network limits the size of blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, which in turn limits the number of transactions the network can process each hour. For the last year, the network has been bumping up against this limit, leading to congestion on the network and high transaction fees. Segregated witness aims to relax this bottleneck by moving part of each Bitcoin transaction outside the blockchain, allowing more transactions to be squeezed into each block.\n\nAnother possible factor: earlier this month, the Bitcoin network forked, creating a spinoff currency called Bitcoin Cash. Many people expected the schism to undermine confidence in Bitcoin, but that doesn\'t seem to have happened. The spinoff went smoothly, and the mainstream Bitcoin network continued working as well as ever.\n\nThe value of one Bitcoin has risen about 50 percent since the split happened on August 1. Perhaps Bitcoin speculators are simply relieved that a contentious fight is over and nothing catastrophic occurred.\n\nFinally, there\'s an ongoing boom in ""initial coin offerings""—sales of new, Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies for a variety of applications. Last week, for example, a company called Filecoin raised $187 million in a single hour selling a not-yet-created cryptocurrency that will be used to purchase online storage space. Another virtual currency called Tezos raised more than $200 million in July. A third, called Bancor, raised $153 million in June.\n\nThese exotic new currencies are often offered for sale using Bitcoins, since it\'s often easier to exchange one cryptocurrency for another than to directly sell new cryptocurrencies for dollars. So people who want to invest in an ICO often need to get their hands on bitcoins (or ether, the currency of Bitcoin competitor Ethereum) first. With hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into these ICOs, that translates into a lot of demand for the most famous virtual currencies.', ""Altcoins could slide 20 percent if Bitcoin hits $5,000 in the near future, a trader has warned as prices remain firmly above $4,000.\n\nWith Bitcoin squarely outperforming the majority of altcoins Monday, even Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to post meaningful growth.\n\nA push for $5,000 could see temporary heavy losses for alternative cryptoassets, according to Twitter commentator CryptoPhil.\n\nIf bitcoin decides to go to $5000 we will see at least one more day of altcoin blood with over 20% losses across the board — CryptoPhil (@H4ck3rPh1ll) August 14, 2017\n\nA glance at current statistics for the top 10 cryptocurrencies on Coinmarketcap underscores the current lack of correlation between Bitcoin’s solid progress and the uncertainty seen in altcoin markets.\n\nWith the exception of NEO, little movement is underway elsewhere, with Civic’s CVC token calming following its own 300%+ growth spurt last week.\n\nFurther good news for Bitcoin comes in the form of its market cap dominance once again challenging 50 percent of the total held by all cryptoassets. Current readings of 49.9 percent look likely to turn to Bitcoin’s first return to half of the market since May.\n\nOn the horizon, meanwhile, things could become rosier still, precipitating a $5,000 scenario.\n\n“There's a wall of liquidity coming to crypto,” Block Tower Capital CIO Ari Paul forecast in a tweet Sunday.\n\n“Dark pools, growing OTC desks, liquidity aggregators, Bitcoin futures and options.”\n\nPaul added that he expected BTC volumes, already circling their highest on record, to “be double within three months.”"", 'With $3,000 merely a blip in the rearview mirror, and $4,000 now vanquished, some of the bullish predictions out there for bitcoin may no longer be such a far-fetched fantasy.\n\nThe cryptocurrency BTCUSD, +7.48% was trading at about $4,217.80 on Monday, after shooting past the $4K mark a day earlier. Some said the move was due to Asian buyers bulking up on alternative investments amid some jitters over North Korea. Meanwhile, others attributed gains to hopes that transaction volumes for bitcoin will increase.\n\nIn any case, bitcoin seemed to be following in the same vein as last week’s sprint to a record.\n\nIndependent analyst Ronnie Moas, who previously set his 2018 bitcoin price target at $5,000, said Monday he’s upgrading that to $7,500. His 2027 price target of $50,000 remains unchanged, but said there could likely go up in the next two years and even get pushed forward to 2024-2026.\n\nA Netscape moment for bitcoin: Moas said that in order for bitcoin to go from $4,177 (a level he was citing earlier on Monday) to $50,000 in 10 years would require 28% annual compounded growth. “I have gotten three times that in just the last six weeks with the 84% gain,” wrote Moas.\n\n“It looks to me as though we are at the same point in the adoption curve as we were in 1995 when we went from one million internet users to 10 million. The following year the Netscape browser came online and we went from 10 million users to hundreds of millions of users overnight,” said Moas.\n\nMoas, and others who are buying cryptocurrencies, are counting on growing acceptance. For example, in two years time, he expects there will be between 50 million and 100 million cryptocurrency users, versus around 10 million currently.\n\n“We only have 0.15% market penetration right now — if that goes to 2% or 3% we will get to the $50,000 price target that I set at the beginning of July,” he said.\n\nRead: HBO offers ‘Game of Thrones’ hackers $250,000 in bitcoin\n\nMoas wrote a 122-page report on cryptocurrency last month, in which he laid out that initial $5,000 price target for bitcoin, and predicted those digital currencies would steal market share from gold, metals, bonds and other currencies.\n\nAs for Monday’s gains, at CoinDesk there was talk of pent-up demand coming through from investors who had been waiting to see how the so-called fork earlier this month panned out. Bitcoin Cash was the result of that fork, and a demand by bitcoin developers for a version of the crypotcurrency that lets miners process transactions faster.\n\nRead: What is an ICO?', 'Here is a German version of this article.\n\nUntil recently, there was no decision or lack of decision in my life that I regretted afterwards. With the rise of Bitcoin, this changed slightly. I nowadays occasionally catch myself thinking that I missed a big opportunity by not purchasing a few Bitcoins early on, when one BTC only cost a few bucks. I am probably not the only one with that sentiment.\n\nI was actually quite close. In 2011 I mentioned Bitcoin in a blogpost for the first time. So at that point I was aware of the crypto currency. However, it took a few more years until I actually made a purchase – for the sole purpose of a text I was about to write about the purchasing procedure. So I only bought 0,1 BTC, which I paid about 50 Euro for. At that point, one BTC was already valued at around 500 Euro / 600 USD. Today, after an unprecedented increase particularly over the past weeks, the Bitcoin price hovers around 4000 USD.\n\n=======\n\nSign up for the weekly email loaded with great things to read about the digital world. Example. And don’t forget to try out the meshedsociety weekly bot on Messenger.\n\n=======\n\nOf course there is little to be gained from having regrets about the past, especially when the issue is about a missed opportunity, as opposed to a really bad decision. Also I am not a very materialistic person, and “being rich” has never been a life goal of mine. Nevertheless, reading articles about people who made an early call to purchase some coins for essentially nothing and nowadays are pretty well off, is fascinating and offers some, in my eyes valuable, lessons.\n\nHindsight bias, risk aversion and the importance of curiosity\n\nIt’s always tempting to fall for the so called hindsight bias, assuming that one could have seen the future rise of Bitcoin’s value already back in 2009 when the first transaction was made by its mysterious inventor(s) known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. But in reality no one could have predicted this.\n\nHowever, I would have wished that my own approach to a new technological phenomenon such as Bitcoin had been a different one, such as: “I don’t think this will in any way become a thing of significance, but it won’t hurt me right now to buy some Bitcoins for little money, and it will be an educative process as well”. Instead I had the emergence of the crypto currency on my radar, but lacked both curiosity and energy to get involved. Additionally, I was probably also subject to loss aversion, which relates to the phenomenon that people are more negatively affected by losing something than they are positively affected by gaining something, which might lead to short-term actions (or inaction). Shelling out “real” money for some virtual currency would have felt like a “loss” at that point. So the lesson for my future self: Be even more curious and be aware of the effect of loss aversion.\n\nThe rich get richer? Not when it came to Bitcoin\n\nIt’s increasingly harder for people who don’t have a lof wealth to build wealth – that’s what’s often singled out as the big flaw of today’s state of capitalism. But when it came to the early period of Bitcoin, different rules applied: Theoretically every woman and every man had the same opportunity to build unexpected wealth. Unlike in most other forms of investing, the obstacle was not primarily lack of funds. One didn’t need more than 100 Euro/USD, which means that at least in developed countries most people were not excluded by default. The obstacles instead were absence of knowledge, absence of curiosity, absence of the will to experiment and absence of patience (you didn’t gain a lot if you bought Bitcoins at 5 Euro/BTC and sold at 10 Euro/BTC).\n\nMaybe I am exaggerating, but at least during its early days, Bitcoin was an extremely egalitarian technology. Lots of highly intelligent, educated, powerful and wealthy people did not invest in it because they either did not know about it or because they thought it was bullshit. On the other hand, while I am not aware of a reliable statistic about the demographic and social status of the early Bitcoin buyers, it’s highly likely that you had a fair share of people among them who were excluded from traditional means of investing (at least from those which promised substantial returns).\n\nThere is a widespread tendency to blame others or external events for one’s perceived failures or lack of opportunities. For large parts of the population of developed countries, Bitcoin offers a beautiful antithesis: If one didn’t jump on it early, there is only one who carries responsibility for this: oneself.\n\nPlease note that I deliberately don’t make any statement about Bitcoin today or how it will evolve. Anything can happen. My point is that everyone who, like me, feels that they missed out on something need to be aware of why they did miss out, and how they can improve the likelihood of not missing out a “similar” phenomenon in the future. With “similar” I mean another Black Swan – an extremely rare and unpredictable event which offers great opportunities to those few who spot it and who take a small, calculated gamble.\n\n======\n\nIf you like what you read, you can support meshedsociety.com on Patreon!\n\nIllustration: Flickr/Jason Benjamin, CC0 1.0 Universal', 'The bitcoin digital currency has smashed another record, reaching $4,251 on Monday. The market capitalization of the world\'s most popular cryptocurrency has surged $15 billion in the last week.\n\nRead more\n\nInvestors name several reasons for the recent bitcoin rally. The cryptocurrency is up 320 percent in the year to date.\n\nThey point out that 42 percent of bitcoin acquisitions are made through Japanese yen. Tokyo has recognized bitcoin as legal tender, and many major shops are accepting it.\n\nSome analysts say people have started relying on the more decentralized bitcoin rather than traditional banks and currencies.\n\n“Bitcoins have real value. They can\'t be counterfeited, and there is a limited supply. The fact they\'re perfect for moving value around the internet means they compete with other currencies. And as more people switch from banks and fiat money to bitcoin the price will rise, and crucially, banks will fail,” says Max Keiser of RT’s Keiser Report.\n\nAnother reason for the rally is that bitcoin creators have agreed on how they would upgrade the bitcoin network to increase the transaction size on the blockchain technology behind it.\n\nAnd third, as tensions between the United States and North Korea continue, people are seeking a safe haven in bitcoin.\n\n""At Wirex, we have seen a surge of interest from South Korean customers as they seek bitcoin as a safe haven asset as they anticipate the \'Trump effect\' to damage their economy,"" Pavel Matveev, CEO of cryptocurrency personal finance app Wirex, told CNBC.\n\nThe rise of bitcoin has been truly astounding when you consider that $1 worth of bitcoins seven years ago is worth over $1.4 million today. On May 22, 2010, the price of the digital currency stood at just 0.003 cents.\n\nRT asked Max Keiser whether the dramatic rise in the value of cryptocurrencies is a speculative bubble.\n\n""No. The US Dollar, stocks, bonds, and property are all in bubbles. Bitcoin (and Gold) are underpriced versus these other assets that are in bubbles. Bitcoins are very cheap vs. government bonds - that are trading at multi-hundred-year highs - for example,"" he said.', 'Last week Coinbase, the five year-old digital currency startup, announced it had raised $100 million in Series D funding, valuing the company at $1.6 billion. This funding round represents a major milestone not just for Coinbase, but for the digital currency industry as a whole.\n\nCoinbase’s business strategy is to make it easier for people and companies to buy, sell, and transact in digital currencies. It does this though two broad business lines: its digital currency exchange, called GDAX, and software applications that allow businesses and consumers to connect the traditional financial system to the new digital currency world.\n\nGDAX, which makes money by charging a small percentage on each trade, has been experiencing phenomenal growth over the last 12 months, as both trading volume and prices of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether (this digital currency built on the Ethereum blockchain) have soared. The second part of its business has seen more qualified success. While Coinbase was successful in signing up merchants to accept bitcoin on its e-commerce site, the overall transaction flow has been low because most consumers have not yet accepted digital currencies as a payment mechanism.\n\nFor digital currencies to fulfill their promise of an open, decentralized financial system, they need to achieve mainstream acceptance. In his 1991 book Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey Moore describes the adoption cycle of innovative technologies. As a new technology is introduced to the market, it is adopted successively by different types of participants—starting with innovators and early adopters, moving to the early majority, followed by late Majority and laggards. The innovators and early adopters recognize the potential of the technology and are willing to invest, take risks, and accept an inferior user experience and functionality while they wait for the technology to develop. For adoption to “cross the chasm” to early majority (representing meaningful mainstream adoption), it needs to offer some incremental benefit over existing technologies. Those technologies that are unable to do this will eventually fizzle and die.\n\nWhile digital currencies are hitting new highs and grabbing the headlines, overall adoption for payments, remittances, and banking applications remains low. In order for digital currencies to justify their lofty valuations (bitcoin and ether currently have a combined market cap of almost $100 billion), they need to offer a use case other than just speculation. Coinbase recognizes this, which is why they indicated that the new investment will be used to improve customer experience; expand and serve a more institutional client base; and invest in Toshi, a consumer app that makes it easier for people to use digital currencies.\n\nThere have been other significant announcements over the last few weeks that signal growing acceptance of bitcoin, ether, and other digital currencies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approval of LedgerX to operate a derivatives exchange and the announcement that the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has similar plans. However, Coinbase, with its attention to digital currencies as an enabling technology and not just a tradeable asset, will likely have a bigger overall impact on the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nRichard Johnson is vice president of market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates.', 'While many fear BTC-USD is entering bubble territory, others are calling for even higher price targets. Politics aside, there is a clear push for higher BTC-USD prices and it’s creating market uncertainty.\n\n\n\nHere are the facts:\n\n30 days ago, BTC-USD was $1800. Today the price of BTC-USD has risen 130% and has managed to establish an all time high at $4300. In 5 days alone, the price of BTC-USD has increased its market value by 30%.\n\nTaking a look at the macro trend since the rise post-$1800s, we see clear lines of support along the Fibonacci Retracements:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Fib. Lines\n\n\n\nAcross the length of the bullish push from the $2700s (the 61% line) there are signs of sustained momentum in the RSI and MACD. Looking at the volume profile, there is no clear decline in volume and it appears to show market interest in higher values as the volume’s moving average has remained mostly flat. However, since the bullish push from the $3200s (the 38% line) we can see signs of bullish exhaustion in the form MACD and RSI divergence.\n\nZooming in on a smaller timescale, we see evidence of a higher push to new all time highs:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 1-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Potential Bull Pennant Breakout\n\n\n\nAt the top of BTC-USD’s strong run from the $3200s stands a classic bullish continuation pattern called a “Bull Pennant.” The pennant is characterized by price consolidation within a convergent pattern and has decreasing volume throughout the length of the pennant body. To accompany this pattern is a 1-hour RSI and MACD that began to consolidate toward its centerline.\n\nAt the time of this article, BTC-USD appears to have broken out of this pennant with a sharp increase in volume. Currently, based on typical price projections for Bull Pennant breakouts, this pennant breakout has a price target of $5000.\n\nAlthough this is a rather aggressive price target for this bull pennant, there are some considerations on a macro scale that should be addressed and discussed.\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 1 Day Candles, Bitfinex, Bollinger Bands\n\n\n\nFor the fourth day in a row, BTC-USD continues to push outside the Bollinger Bands. Historically, this sort of push has led to market pullback or consolidation. Even on high timescales, the current 3-day candle (not shown above) is fully formed outside the Bollinger Bands and shows, on a macro scale, that the market is overbought. To accompany this push of the Bollinger Bands, a clear decrease in volume is seen on the moving average that shows, since the rise from $1800s, there has been waning bullish sentiment.\n\nWhile there is a lot of hype surrounding BTC’s recent rise, it is paramount to remain objective and skeptical of market activity and to view the market soberly. The price target of $5000, on a micro level seems plausible. However, on a macro level the bullish market appears to have slightly bearish divergence. To remain a reliable price target, the market needs to see a push to newer all time highs accompanied by increase in volume to sustain the next $800 of price movement.\n\nSummary:\n\nBTC-USD has broken out of a bullish continuation pattern called a “Bull Pennant” with a price target of $5,000. On a macro scale, there are signs of bullish momentum loss in the form of bearish divergence and overbought signals on the Bollinger Bands. While the market can remain overbought for days and weeks, it’s important to keep in mind that the higher the market pushes into overbought zones, the more necessary market consolidation becomes in order to prevent a market pullback. So far, there has yet to be any considerable market consolidation during this 130% rise.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

08/15/2017,"[""The price of bitcoin continued its recent bullish surge last night, reaching a new all-time high of over $4,480.\n\nThe news follows days in which the climbing value of the digital asset has seen it repeatedly break new ground.\n\nSince May, bitcoin had been fluctuating in the mid to high $2,000s, then August 4 saw enthusiastic trading that catapulted prices upwards – quickly reaching the $3,000 mark and just nine days later passing $4,000 for the first time ever.\n\nIn a likely surprise for those expecting a sell-off, a fall never came and, yesterday, bitcoin surged on to hit an astonishing $4,483 at around 3:50 a.m. UTC.\n\nReasons for the buoyant market have been put down to growing interest in the cryptocurrency space by institutional investors, alongside the passing of a split of the bitcoin network to form a new cryptocurrency on August 1. When that event – which saw the creation of a rival digital asset called bitcoin cash – passed uneventfully, money seemingly held back by cautious traders poured into the asset.\n\nSince opening today at $4,382, however, prices across global exchanges have fallen somewhat, and at press time were around $4,200 – a drop of 4.15 percent, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nLooking at the industry more widely, the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies today sits at around $138.7 billion – down from $141 billion yesterday, data from CoinMarketCap indicates.

Still, on a 24-hour basis, bitcoin has recorded a 2 percent daily increase.\n\nMany analysts including Standpoint stock researcher Ronnie Moas, who successfully predicted the recent surge of the bitcoin price to $4,000, noted that bitcoin has the potential to surpass the $7,500 mark before the year ends.\n\n“What’s happening is the floodgates are opening. I believe there are hedge funds and very deep-pocketed individuals going into this now, really hundreds of millions of dollars. You can’t look at this as a normal situation. We’re in an industry that will probably go from $140 billion to $2 trillion and the bitcoin price will probably move with that,” said Moas.\n\nSpecifically, Moas emphasized the exponential rise in the involvement of institutional investors within the bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, attributing such abrupt increase in demand as one of the driving factors of bitcoin’s recent rally. As key players in the finance sector including the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the largest options exchange in the US, continue to establish necessary infrastructures for institutional and retail investors, the cryptocurrency market will grow in terms of market cap and daily trading volumes.\n\nIn a note to the clients and portfolio managers of Standpoint, Moas explained:\n\n“I expect that within a couple of years we will have between 50 and 100 million cryptocurrency users — up from approximately ~10 million today. We only have 0.15% market penetration right now — if that goes to 2% or 3% we will get to the $50,000 price target that I set at the beginning of July.”\n\nPreviously, merely 12 months ago, the bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange markets lacked overseas regulations, robust infrastructures and sufficient liquidity for large-scale traders. Today, leading bitcoin service providers including the $1.6 billion bitcoin startup Coinbase and US-based regulated bitcoin exchange Gemini are collaborating with institutions like CBOE to drastically increase liquidity for institutional and retail investors.\n\nAs large sums of investments and capital flow into the bitcoin exchange market in the upcoming months, upon the completion of CBOE’s bitcoin integration and increased adoption from investment banks, the value of bitcoin will likely rise at a substantial rate, as noted by Moas. In consideration of the rapidly rising demand from investors, Moas’ $7,500 price target is a realistic year-end objective for traders.\n\nEarlier this year, respected financial analysts including RT’s Max Keiser and Tone Vays revealed their predictions, stating that bitcoin price will hit $5,000 before 2017 ends. Moas increased his $5,000 price target to $7,500 in consideration of bitcoin’s recent strong rally. The imminence of SegWit activation and the launch of a bitcoin options and futures trading platform by CBOE are two major events which investors and traders should keep an eye on throughout August. CBOE’s integration of bitcoin will significantly increase liquidity for large-scale bitcoin traders, which the Winklevoss twins are aiming for.\n\nTyler Winklevoss, the founder and CEO of Gemini, wrote:\n\n“Gemini’s key concerns in the cryptocurrency ecosystem have always been security, compliance, and regulatory oversight. By working with the team at CBOE, we are helping to make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies increasingly accessible to both retail and institutional investors.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Sounds fantastical?

Now in beta, bitcoin users in Africa, Europe, South America and North America can already use the satellites to download a working bitcoin node capable of storing the network\'s entire transaction history.\n\nBut while complex conceptually, the company believes its end result can solve a real issue facing the $66 billion network – without internet, you can\'t access bitcoin.\n\nAnd this poses a problem for bitcoin proponents who believe the cryptocurrency could be especially beneficial to people without internet, who also generally live in areas with economic instability.\n\nSo, Blockstream decided to set its sights on a solution, and found it in space.\n\nAccording to Blockstream CEO Adam Back, the project is all about putting bitcoin into the hands of those who ""desperately need"" it.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""There is some coincidence between countries with poor internet infrastructure and unstable currencies. The people who are in direct need of bitcoin are those who currently have unstable access to bitcoin. This project will address that problem, and, we hope, will allow many more people to use bitcoin.""\n\nThe vision\n\nWhile running a full node is a cumbersome process, it\'s nonetheless the most secure and trustless way of using the digital currency, and for individuals dealing with political and economic instability, this process could prove crucial.\n\nBut because full nodes require an Internet connection and 160 GB of free space, they are a rarity in some regions of the world. There\'s allegedly only one man running a full node in all of West Africa, for example.\n\nWhile Blockstream is now taking care of a way to download a full node, there are a few other choice technologies those that want to take advantage of the satellite will need.\n\nUsers will need a small satellite dish – if they already have a TV satellite, they could use that – and a USB to connect the satellite to a personal computer or a piece of dedicated computer hardware such as a Raspberry Pi. The rest can be accessed through free, open-source software, such as GNU Radio for establishing a radio connection.\n\n""The cost to entry is extremely low,"" said Blockstream\'s head of satellite, Chris Cook. According to him, the package of equipment costs ""a little under $100.""\n\nThen, once users have those tools, they can pull bitcoin blocks from the satellite, building a bitcoin full node.\n\nCheaper technology\n\nBut while they\'ll now be running a full node, it still takes some sort of Internet connection to make transactions over the network.\n\nWhile many users in the areas Blockstream is targeting won\'t be able to afford mobile data connection plans to initiate transactions, Back argued cheaper communications technologies, such as SMS or bi-directional satellite, could be used instead.\n\nTransactions, he said, take up about 250 bytes, which wouldn\'t cost more than one penny to transfer using such technologies.\n\nIn this way, Back\'s vision of the satellite as bringing bitcoin even to people completely off-the-grid is theoretically possible. He offered the example of a small hut on the side of the road in the Sahara Desert in Africa, adding:\n\n""With a perpetual generator out back with a satellite dish, a Raspberry Pi by the generator, a local wi-fi hot spot, and the necessary software set up, you could be transacting globally with bitcoin.""\n\nSounds like a lot, but Back argued that it would be pretty cheap, especially if costs are pooled between multiple people, like if an entire village shared the costs of setting up the infrastructure that they could then all use.\n\nMonetizing space bitcoin\n\nWhile it\'s ambitious as is, Blockstream is taking that mission even further, adding more satellites as the year goes on, with the hope the most people on earth will be able to access a bitcoin satellite by the end of the year.\n\n""The only people that won\'t be covered are those in Antarctica,"" Back said.\n\nWhile the project is technically feasible, though, is it financially so?\n\nBitcoin is admittedly a different beast, but other Internet space projects don\'t have a great track record so far. Although, Blockstream does have plans to monetize the satellite.\n\nAccording to Back, Blockstream will eventually release an API for developers and companies to send data over the satellite connection for a small bitcoin fee.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""That might allow a smartphone wallet that sends messages to send it via satellite or some application to send messages via satellite. That\'s a way to monetize the infrastructure and to expand to more services on it.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nSatellite image via Blockstream\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Trezor promised to develop BCH integration in its wallet, only to find out that it is not so simple.\n\nThe hard fork of Bitcoin to create Bitcoin Cash on Aug. 1 resulted in a difficult question for Bitcoin service providers, including wallets and exchanges - Should they support Bitcoin Cash integration?\n\nMultiple service providers decided they won't and asked users to withdraw their Bitcoins or transfer their Bitcoins to other wallets, if they wanted to get Bitcoin Cash on Aug. 1.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin Cash was only a split of Bitcoin's Blockchain, and that Bitcoin Cash had replay protection in place, Trezor announced that it would support BCH integration.\n\nUsers who wanted to access their Bitcoin Cash would have been able to do it through a simple interface, accessible from the Trezor wallet. Users were given a guide to claim their Bitcoin Cash from their Trezor wallets.\n\nProblems faced\n\nThe support for BCH was developed in a week's time and Trezor developers have admitted that it was a painful and stressful week. The development of the firmware for BCH integration, with the documented changes, went smoothly.\n\nHowever, the deployment of the BCH implementation of Bitcore (which is a backend for all cryptocurrencies supported by the Trezor wallet) caused several problems.\n\nBitcoin ABC, which is a full node implementation of the BCH standard, had made several changes to the code, including style changes. That made comparing code and implementing Trezor support a time-consuming task.\n\nA particular bug caused transactions to disappear and negative balances in wallet addresses, necessitating code rewriting and taking the backend offline.\n\nUniversal wallet - a utopian dream\n\nThe increasing number of cryptocurrencies has resulted in the need for multiple wallets to be installed on people's computers.\n\nOften, there is fear of malware masquerading as a wallet being installed on a computer. People avoid this by storing their minor cryptocurrencies on exchanges or online wallet providers.\n\nHowever, this strategy exposes users to the risk of the exchange being hacked and the cryptocurrencies being stolen.\n\nAs the difficulties in Bitcoin Cash integration have shown, a universal wallet (hardware or software) capable of storing all cryptocurrencies remains a utopian dream."", 'Bitcoin would already be worth $7,000 if its market dominance returned to pre-2017 levels, calculations suggest.\n\nFindings uploaded to Twitter by investor and entrepreneur Alistair Milne suggest that without “Bitcoin Unlimited” or “forking fears,” Bitcoin would be worth $3,800 more than at present, he says.\n\nIf Bitcoin returned to market dominance of ~84% (where it was before the Bitcoin Unlimited/forking fears), the price would be ~$7000 today — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) August 15, 2017\n\nBTC’s share of the cryptocurrency market had been steadily declining through 2016, while in 2017 the rate picked up dramatically with the rise of Ethereum and other altcoins.\n\nBrief reversals came with further downturns, with BTC currently sitting at 51.2 percent dominance according to Coinmarketcap, itself a multi-month high.\n\nDespite prices also reaching their highest levels in history this week, Milne joins others suggesting there is still room for growth short-term.\n\nChief among them this week are Max Keiser and John McAfee, while within Bitcoin, fellow entrepreneur Tuur Demeester signaled he had repositioned his investments to account for USD profits.\n\nSentiment seems super bullish on Bitcoin. Many alts bleeding. Just took some BTC profits off the table (to USD) in my trading portfolio. — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) August 15, 2017\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported yesterday, Bitcoin’s growth is likely set to punish altcoin prosperity in the short term, with losses of up to 20 percent forecast by community commentators.\n\nResponding to Milne, others considered it entirely possible for similar prices to appear even if Bitcoin’s dominance “doesn’t go above 51 percent.”', ""China’s role in shaping Bitcoin is the focus of a short but star-studded one-day event in Beijing Sept. 10.\n\nHosted by Blockchain data provider and over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform BitKan, ‘Shape the Future’ intends to give attendees a more rounded picture of how China affects the Bitcoin industry.\n\n“Chinese companies - most in hardware manufacture, mining and exchanges - have played a huge role in Bitcoin's growth internationally. Chinese investors and politics have definitely impacted its price,” BitKan comments in a press release about the event today.\n\n“Arguably, Bitcoin could never have achieved its current status and mystique without China.”\n\nSpeakers at Shape the Future include Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, OKCoin’s Star Xu and Leon Li of Huobi.\n\nWell-known faces such as Roger Ver and John McAfee will also be in attendance.\n\nIn addition to talks, the event will host the premiere of a dedicated China-centric Bitcoin documentary that BitKan says “promises to answer questions and even explain some mysteries” as well as offer “never-before-seen insights into the history of the Bitcoin industry in China.”\n\nBitKan is a regular participant and organizer of local Bitcoin meetup events featuring guests such as Wu and Ver, who have spoken extensively on the Bitcoin scaling debate during previous engagements this year.\n\nThe Shape the Future event will take place at the Sofitel Wanda Beijing on Sunday, Sept. 10."", 'John McAfee\'s MGT Capital recently announced it is mining for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are innovations peppered throughout history that have changed human culture beyond recognition. One such innovation was the adoption of agriculture.\n\nPrior to this adoption, the great thinkers within society struggled with how to determine when to break camp and move to more fruitful lands, how to limit the size of a village so that sheer numbers did not quickly deplete the available food in a new area, and how to design lodging so that could be quickly dismantled for a sudden move.\n\nImagine how these great thinkers must have struggled to comprehend a world in which the village never moved; where the size of the village was inconsequential; and where lodging was constructed of immovable stone. There would be nothing in their contextual understanding of their culture that would allow them to comprehend the end product of the emerging new world.\n\nI believe that the blockchain is, even now, ushering in a new economic and social paradigm that will rival, if not exceed, the impact that agriculture had in human society.\n\nThe idea that has clouded the waters for many is the idea of ""decentralization."" There has been much hype for dozens of years about the mind bending potential of decentralization but little if nothing has come of it. The reason is that no-one has been able to solve the problem of distribution required to power these decentralized system.\n\nDistributed, decentralized systems have an inherent power that literally obsoletes centralized systems. this is obvious even to the most casual observer. We have known this for decades. It was not until the arrival of the blockchain, however, that we had a tool capable of melding ""decentralized"" and ""distributed"" into a single unit within which no central authority whatsoever was necessary. The distributed ledger, maintained by no-one, accessible to all and validated by consensus is the tool the world has been waiting for.\n\nThose who understand this tool see immediately the absurdity of words like ""bubble,"" ""investment,"" etc. when applied to cryptocurrencies. These thought leaders use bitcoin to buy and sell and those who use bitcoin exclusively as a currency and use no other currency - and I personally know dozens who do so - could care less about what bitcoin is worth in dollars.\n\nThese people see, and have seen for some time, that the old paradigm constructs are meaningless in this new world.\n\nIt is like the first pueblo cultures being warned by their past sages that they will perish in their stone houses when it is time for the village to move. They understood that the concept of ""moving"" had no meaning in their new world.\n\nLikewise, what people see as a bitcoin ""bubble,"" from the perspective of the new paradigm, is merely the predictable and systematic devaluation of fiat currencies that will continue, with obvious ups and downs, until all fiat currencies reach the zero point.\n\nAs the relative value of bitcoin temporarily drops, they will point to this as proof if their understanding. It won\'t matter. The reality if this new world is what it is. Those who understand will be the leaders of this new world.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', '', 'This story has been updated to correct certain errors and misstatements.\n\nEven though most people don\'t even know what they are, Bitcoins increased in value from about $570 to more than $4,300 — an astounding 750% — in just the last year. Because of this huge return, more people, hoping to make a fast fortune, are becoming interested in possibly owning some Bitcoins. That would be very risky.\n\nWhat are Bitcoins?\n\nBitcoins are a crypto-currency. That means they can be used like a currency, but don\'t physically exist like dollar bills. They are an online currency which can be used to buy things. They are digital cash that exist as bits on people\'s computers. You can\'t put them in a drawer, like dollar bills or gold Krugerrands. Bitcoins are used to complete transactions - just like any currency. Even though they are virtual, rather than physical, they are used like cash when transferred between people through the web.\n\nBeing virtual is not inherently a bad thing. The dollars on our financial institution statement, viewed online, are considered real money, even though those are just digital dollars. The fact that Bitcoins aren\'t available in physical form is not really a downside, any more than the numbers on your financial statement are not available as physical currency either. Just like we use credit cards or debit cards to transfer value, Bitcoins can be spent in many locations, just like dollars.\n\nWhat makes Bitcoins unique, versus other currencies, is that there is no financial system, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, managing their existence and value. Instead Bitcoins are managed by a bunch of users who track them via blockchain technology. And blockchain technology itself is not inherently a problem; there are folks figuring out all kinds of uses, like accounting, using blockchain. It is the fact that no central bank controls Bitcoin production that makes them a unique currency. Independent people watch who buys and sells, and owns, Bitcoins, and in some general fashion make a market in Bitcoins. This makes Bitcoins very different from dollars, euros or rupees. There is no ""good faith and credit"" of the government standing behind the currency.\n\nWhy are currencies different from everything else?\n\nCurrencies are sort of magical things. If we didn\'t have them we would have to do all transactions by barter. Want some gasoline? Without currency you would have to give the seller a chicken or something else the seller wants. That is less than convenient. So currencies were created to represent the value of things. Instead of saying a gallon of gas is worth one chicken, we can say it is worth $2.50. And the chicken can be worth $2.50. So currency represents the value of everything. The dollar, itself, is a small piece of paper that is worth nothing. But it represents buying power. Thus, it is stored value. We hold dollars so we can use the value they represent to obtain the things we want.\n\nCurrencies are not the only form of stored value. People buy gold and lock it in a safe because they believe the demand for gold will rise, increasing its value, and thus the gold is stored value. People buy collectible art or rare coins because they believe that as time passes the demand for such artifacts will increase, and thus their value will increase. The art becomes a stored value. Some people buy real estate not just to live on, but because they think the demand for that real estate will grow, and thus the real estate is stored value.\n\nBut these forms of stored value are risky, because the stored value can disappear. If new mines suddenly produce vast new quantities of gold, its value will decline. If the art is a fake, its value will be lost. If demand for an artist or for ancient coins cools, its value can fall. The stored value is dependent on someone else, beyond the current owner, determining what that person will pay for the item.\n\nAssets held as stored value can crash\n\nIn the 1630s people in Holland thought of tulip bulbs as stored value. Tulips were desired, giving tulip bulbs value. But over time, people acquired tulip bulbs not to plant but rather for the stored value they represented. As more people bought bulbs, and put them in a drawer, the price was driven higher, until one tulip bulb was worth 10 times the typical annual salary of a Dutch worker — and worth more than entire houses. People thought the value of tulip bulbs would go up forever.\n\nBut there were no controls on tulip bulb production. Eventually it became clear that more tulip bulbs were being created, and the value was much, much greater than one could ever get for the tulips once planted and flowered. Even though it took many months for the value of tulip bulbs to become so high, their value crashed in a matter of two months. When tulip bulb holders realized there was nobody guaranteeing the value of their tulip bulbs, everyone wanted to sell them as fast as possible, causing a complete loss of all value. What people thought was stored value evaporated, leaving the tulip bulb holders with worthless bulbs.\n\nWhile a complete collapse is unlikely, people should approach owning Bitcoins with great caution. There are other risks. Someone could hack the exchange you are using to trade or store Bitcoins. Also, cryptocurrencies are subject to wild swings of volatility, so large purchases or sales of Bitcoin can move prices 30% or more in a single day.\n\nBe an investor, not a speculator, and avoid Bitcoins\n\nThere are speculators and traders who make markets in things like Bitcoins. They don\'t care about the underlying value of anything. All they care about is the value right now, and the momentum of the pricing. If something looks like it is going up they buy it, simply on the hope they can sell it for more than they paid and take a profit on the trade. They don\'t see the things they trade as having stored value because they intend to spin the transaction very quickly in order to make a fast buck. Even if value falls they sell, taking a loss. That\'s why they are speculators.\n\nMost of us work hard to put a few dollars, euros, pounds, rupees or other currencies into our bank accounts. Most of those dollars we spend on consumption, buying food, utilities, entertainment and everything else we enjoy. If we have extra money and want the value to grow we invest that money in assets that have an underlying value, like real estate or machinery or companies that put assets to work making things people want. We expect our investment to grow because the assets yield a return. We invest our money for the long-term, hoping to create a nest egg for future consumption.\n\nUnless you are a professional trader, or you simply want to gamble, stay away from Bitcoins. They have no inherent value, because they are a currency which represents value rather than having value themselves. The Bitcoin currency is not managed by any government agency, nor is it backed by any government. Bitcoin values are purely dependent upon holders having faith they will continue to have value. Right now the market looks a lot more like tulip mania than careful investing.\n\nLearn more about trend planning at AdamHartung.com, or connect with me on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nLinks To More Info:\n\n4 myths and 1 truth about investing\n\nWhy FANG investing makes sense\n\nInvesting vs. speculating\n\nHow to avoid short-term thinking when investing', 'Mining\n\nThe Atlantic has reported that Venezuelan bitcoin mining continues despite government efforts to crack down on miners.

08/16/2017,"['Jamie Smyth in Sydney AUGUST 17, 2017 5 Australia plans to strengthen its anti-money laundering laws and regulate digital currencies such as bitcoin in the wake of a financial scandal involving its biggest bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Under reforms published on Thursday, Canberra would bring digital currency exchanges under the remit of Austrac, Australia’s financial crime fighting agency. New legislation would also bolster the investigation and enforcement powers of Austrac, which earlier this month initiated a civil legal action against CBA for alleged breaches of laws on money laundering and the financing of terrorism. “Stopping the movement of money to criminals and terrorists is a vital part of our national security defences and we expect regulated businesses in Australia to comply with our comprehensive regime,” said Michael Keenan, Australia’s justice minister.  He said the reforms were balanced, dealing with the threat of organised crime and the financing of terrorism while ensuring that excessive regulation did not hinder legitimate financial sectors. The proposed regulatory shake-up marks the first stage of a reform process aimed at updating Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing law. It follows a high-profile money laundering scandal involving CBA, which was accused by Austrac this month of more than 50,000 breaches of the existing legislation.  Australia’s move to regulate cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, follows a similar move by Japan. Under new rules introduced by Tokyo this year any bitcoin or “alternative coin” exchange or money transfer business that wants to operate must come under the regulatory supervision of the Japan Financial Services Agency by October 1. Bitcoin’s existential crisis Play video In Japan, which was the first national government to take such action, exchanges may be given annual audits and are subject to “know your customer” anti-money laundering regulations. Tokyo’s decision to regulate bitcoin follows the 2014 bankruptcy of Mt Gox, the world’s largest virtual currency exchange. About 850,000 bitcoins from Mt Gox disappeared before its collapse, worth almost $3.5bn at today’s price of $4,080.  By regulating the currency, Japan has officially recognised bitcoin as a legal method of payment, a move that analysts say has helped the price of bitcoins surge to record highs. The Australian reforms will also increase the search and seizure powers of police and customs officers at the border.  Mr Keenan said they would also provide regulatory relief to industry through the deregulation of low-risk industry sectors.  According to the proposal, “the bill provides net regulatory relief to industry of A$36m (US$28m) annually, with the digital currency exchange sector being regulated for the first time, while deregulating low-risk industries such as cash-in-transit, which is already subject to state and territory licensing requirements”.

This will make the cryptocurrency more accessible to almost anyone, even in places where data costs are high and living standards and incomes are low.\n\nThe Blockstream Satellite network will transmit the cryptocurrency down from space, enabling people in places where few people are supporting a blockchain network with their computers to access bitcoin anyway. And, because Bitcoin is decentralized, it works as users run “full nodes” on their computers all over the world. These nodes contribute to community decisions about the blockchain, keep the network safe, and confirm transactions.\n\nWhile running a full node is easy where the internet is fairly cheap and accessible, it does demand that you have a complete version of the Bitcoin blockchain, with all records of each bitcoin transaction since 2009 on your machine constantly. This task becomes very costly, or even impossible in some areas, either because the internet is too difficult to access, or because the people local to the area do not have 100$ every month so spend on running bitcoin nodes.\n\nAccess For Everyone\n\nWith the help of Blockstream’s satellite network, it is now possible to receive this cryptocurrency directly from space for free, but only after investing in some fairly expensive hardware. The project’s GitHub documentation indicates that to run a bitcoin node, you’ll need a computer, a receiver, a TV satellite dish, and a USB stick that allows your computer to pick up radio frequencies.\n\nAccording to Blockstream, current satellite coverage by the network includes much of the US, Africa, Latin America, and parts of Europe. Blockstream CEO Adam Back told Motherboard Vice that the company plans to extend that coverage to envelope most of the world within a year, although he joked, “I guess there might be some research scientists in Antarctica who won’t be able to use bitcoin.”\n\nSeveral members of the Futurism team are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets. Their personal investment perspectives have no impact on editorial content.', 'Hi everyone, it\'s Yuji from Tokyo. I\'ve been writing about the trials and tribulations of bitcoin for more than a year.\n\nThe recent bitcoin civil war has been an ugly, highly politicized affair, with each side trying to manipulate the media and tilt public opinion in their favor. After almost every one of my articles went out, I was bombarded by opinionated enthusiasts through Twitter, email, and even face-to-face.\n\nThat\'s why the community breathed a sigh of relief last month with a compromise called SegWit2x, an upgrade to bitcoin\'s underlying software. After the agreement, the cryptocurrency has doubled in price, with bulls predicting a new golden age of blockchain innovation and more gains.\n\nThe problem is that SegWit2x is a two-step process, and only the first one is complete. The second step, scheduled for November, is already generating controversy and could halt the rally unless things go smoothly. Given the community\'s stormy history, I would expect anything but. If you own or follow bitcoin, here are three things to watch in the coming months:\n\nThe first step of SegWit2x was SegWit, which has fixed bugs and given developers room to add new blockchain functions. As a result, if we start to actually see new tools being tested or implemented (like Lightning), it would go a long way to proving the bullish thesis that bitcoin can be as innovative as other cryptocurrencies, like ethereum. The second step of SegWit2x aims to double transaction capacity (hence ""2x""). It was included to win support from miners, who earn fees from transactions. The problem is that some developers are now saying SegWit can do the same thing, and are backing away from the scheduled implementation in November. If support for ""2x"" part falls apart, either the miners or developers could walk away from the agreement, rekindling worries of a bigger split that rocked the currency in mid July. SegWit2x didn\'t please everyone, and a minority of miners later broke off to form a new version of bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash. While its market value is currently just a tenth of bitcoin, it has been winning support from key businesses such as Coinbase and BitGo. If this trend accelerates and if Bitcoin Cash\'s price rises, it could create incentives for more miners to abandon the original bitcoin and migrate to the new version, or even create more offshoots.\n\nThe battle has been as much about bitcoin\'s rightful identity as it\'s been about protecting economic interests. Miners want it to function as a nimble payment system similar to Visa, which would let them earn more transaction fees. Their opponents, developers who upkeep bitcoin\'s software, want it to act more as a robust platform that allows them to build new functions on top. Reconciling these two needs is at the core of the ongoing internecine battle, making it even more important for stakeholders to keep an eye on developments through November.\n\nSign up to receive the Fully Charged newsletter in your inbox, and follow Bloomberg Technology on Twitter and Facebook for more.\n\nAnd here’s what you need to know in global technology news\n\nThe Uber investor and boardroom drama continues unabated.

While corporate earnings and stock prices remain strong, are Bitcoin investors seeing something the rest of us aren\'t?\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to go slow on cryptocurrencies, as there are myriad concerns on how the currency trades. According to a recent piece by Bloomberg:\n\n""Even as investors are lured by their price gains and volatility, the biggest institutions are reluctant to get in, raising further concerns about liquidity.\n\nOn June 21, ether crashed to 10 cents from $317.81 in trading on Coinbase. The cause was a single $12.5 million trade -- one of the biggest ever -- that triggered further selling. It all happened in just 45 milliseconds, after which computer algorithms started buying, driving prices back up to $300 within 10 seconds. Some digital coin exchanges have collapsed or customer funds have disappeared. All of which is scaring away the very investors the exchanges need to succeed.""\n\nHere are five questions to ask when investing in cryptocurrencies:\n\n-- What is the price based on? Do you understand the code behind pricing the currency? Few do. That\'s always been a stumbling block for me. I think the investing public needs much more background on how the currencies are valued and the blockchain technology behind them.\n\n-- What benchmarks can it be compared to? With stock prices, we have lots of benchmarks such as the Dow 30 and S&P 500 Index going back decades. That shows us relative levels. Bitcoin only has a short history, so we have few tools to show comparative values.\n\n-- Why do you want to invest in Bitcoin? While I can see the innovative logic in wanting to get away from traditional paper currencies, keep in mind that while actively traded, there\'s almost no regulation of cryptocurrencies. That may change soon, but that\'s on the horizon at the moment.\n\nThey could be manipulated in many ways. And they may or may not be a good way to save for retirement. Since regulation is on the way, that\'s one of the reasons I would wait before I invest.\n\n-- Cryptocurrencies may not be a hedge. Traditionally, precious metals like gold have been a hedge against inflation and the decline of the dollar.\n\nWhen the cost of living goes up, so does the price of gold. But with inflation low and the dollar relatively strong, Bitcoin may not be an effective hedge. It may be more of an anxiety index.\n\n-- Do you know the downside of Bitcoin? Like any other traded entity, it goes up and down in price -- a lot. A few years ago, it lost more than 90% of its value. If you want stability, this is not the kind of thing you want in your portfolio.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you want to invest in a cryptocurrency, don\'t load up on it. It should comprise no more than 10% of you total portfolio. While it will take some time to understand how it performs over time, it\'s best to be cautious.', 'In a rather surprising turn of events, hardware wallet manufacturer has been acquired. The company acquired a software wallet a few years ago. Acquisitions are pretty common in the Bitcoin world these days. With Shapeshift now picking up the company, interesting things are bound to happen. The first priority is enabling real-time trading on KeepKey devices using the ShapeShift API. An interesting concept that makes hardware wallets even more convenient.\n\nIt doesn’t happen often we see a service provider buy a hardware-related company. Then again, ShapeShift has been making a lot of waves in recent months. The company provided instant cryptocurrency exchange services without requiring account registration. Acquiring KeepKey is not something most people would necessarily expect. Then again, it all appears to be part of the company’s expansion plan. Integrating all-time trading on Bitcoin hardware wallets will be an intriguing development, to say the least.\n\nKeepKey Will Remain an Individual Brand\n\nCryptocurrency users often struggle to keep coins safe. Hardware wallets make a lot of sense in this regard. Unfortunately, most altcoins aren’t supported at this time. That will now come to change, assuming they will have a portion of Bitcoin in their KeepKey balance. The money can be exchanged to altcoins on demand. ShapeShift supports a few dozen different currencies, which opens up existing opportunities. A combination of hardware wallet and trustless exchange service will be quite spectacular.\n\nIt is worth mentioning the basics of this integration are already there. KeepKey integrated ShapeShift’s API not too long ago. This means this process could be integrated a lot sooner than people anticipate. KeepKey CTO Ken Hodler is quite excited about this acquisition. It will also guarantee the future of KeepKey as a company, in his opinion. This seems to indicate the company will keep working on its hardware wallet without any issues or hindrances.\n\nSo far, it appears the KeepKey brand will not go anywhere. That is positive news, as the brand is quite popular among cryptocurrency users. Additionally, this acquisition will provide additional capital for security expertise and further wallet development. It will be interesting to see if more cross-brand promotion between both companies occur in the future. A limited edition ShapeShift-themed KeepKey is not entirely out of the question at this stage.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Japan’s Fisco Ltd. is experimenting with selling bonds denominated in bitcoins, figuring that the digital currency will eventually become a legally recognized financial asset in Japan and help boost its business.\n\nA unit of the Tokyo-based financial information provider issued three-year debt worth 200 bitcoins to another firm in the Fisco group on Aug. 10, in what likely is the first such deal in Japan, according to Masayuki Tashiro, the company’s chief product officer. One goal of the sale was to test the bonds’ potential to become a useful fundraising tool, he said. The notes issued were worth about $813,000 as of Wednesday.\n\nThe experiment is another example of how companies and investors worldwide are looking for ways to make money out of bitcoin. Some investors have turned to digital currencies as a haven asset as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea escalate. Japan, where regulators have made more progress than other nations in crafting cryptocurrency laws, is becoming a hub for blockchain experimentation.\n\n“We expect that bitcoin will eventually be recognized as a financial product” under local law governing financial instruments, Tashiro said. If that happens and issuance of cryptocurrency debt takes off, “if we play a role of arranger, we could earn fees,” he said.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government on April 1 legalized cryptocurrencies as a form of payment and placed rules around audits and security. In July, regulators began allowing bitcoin purchases to be exempt from the nation’s 8 percent sales tax, putting them on similar footing with financial products like stocks and bonds.\n\nSee also: firm’s plan to make bitcoin ledger accessible via satellite signal\n\nThe legal clarity has given Japanese companies a green light to experiment with blockchain products. Electronics retailer Bic Camera Inc. now accepts bitcoin as payment at certain stores, while Peach Aviation Ltd. plans to begin accepting it to book flights later this year. In finance, SBI Holdings Inc. last month began using a blockchain for currency remittance, while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. joined a consortium of companies that plan to use the technology for settlements.\n\nBitcoin surged past $4,000 this week on increasing optimism that faster transaction times will hasten the spread of the digital currency. The currency was at $4,362 on Thursday in Asia, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.\n\nFisco designed the bond like a regular corporate note so it could satisfy regulatory requirements, he said. The debt pays a 3 percent coupon and gives the holder 200 bitcoins back when it matures, according to a press release. Fisco may experiment further with such debt, Tashiro said.\n\n— With assistance by Yuji Nakamura', ""An ex-Secret Service agent who stole Bitcoins from the Silk Road dark web drugs bazaar he was supposed to be investigating has admitted stealing even more sacks of the digital currency.\n\nShaun Bridges, who is already serving a six-year sentence for nicking Bitcoins from the underground souk, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to stealing a further 1,600 Bitcoin (worth $359,005 at the time and approximately $6.6m today) during a separate investigation.\n\nAccording to court documents [PDF] Bridges, 35, was probing European Bitcoin trading firm Bitstamp, which led to the US government seizing 1,606.6488 BTC in November 2014. These were transferred into a digital wallet that only Bridges had the access code for.\n\nIn March 2015, while under investigation for the Silk Road thefts, Bridges resigned from the Secret Service and in June pleaded guilty to money laundering and obstruction charges. A month later, while still free and awaiting sentencing, he took the Bitcoins seized from Bitstamp and moved them into an account run by the BTC-E exchange.\n\nOver the next four months Bridges shifted small amounts of Bitcoin into various different digital wallets for his use – prison commissaries can be expensive places.

This buying of bitcoins from both these countries could be a result of the war scare.\n\nExperts also list various other reasons which might have fuelled this sudden spike in price.\n\nCryptoasset expert Chris Burniske, pointed to the increasing trend of Google searches being carried out on bitcoin. ""An increasing price drives interest in bitcoin. That interest further drives the price of $BTC.

08/17/2017,"['Olivia McCoy is an intern in the Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—virtual money—are gaining traction as a source of funding for terrorist groups, such as the self-proclaimed Islamic State. In January 2017, Islamist militants in Indonesia funded for terrorist activities with money received through Bitcoin, which is currently the most popular cryptocurrency. This was not an isolated incident: the Mujahideen Shura Council—active in the Gaza Strip and considered a foreign terrorist organization by the United States since 2014—also launched a Bitcoin campaign last year, inviting supporters to donate money for the purchase of weapons. Terrorists are beginning to explore the use of cryptocurrencies, and counterterrorism policies should respond accordingly.\n\nCryptocurrencies are increasing in popularity because of the anonymity afforded to both sender and recipient. In other words, it is extremely challenging to trace who is sending money to whom and for what purpose. Ironically, there is a completely public ledger, Blockchain, which records every Bitcoin transaction; however, the ledger retains users’ anonymity. Considered by some as “the new frontier in terrorism fundraising,” the use of Bitcoin in particular has grown exponentially over the last eight years, increasing from an average of 100 daily transactions in 2009 to 282,000 in 2017 thus far.\n\nPrior to the invention of cryptocurrencies, there was another method used to transfer money anonymously that remains active today: the hawala network. For the past couple of decades, foreign donations to terrorist organizations have been delivered by way of hawala (Arabic for “transfer”) networks, which provide anonymity for cash transfers and donations. Individuals or groups who want to donate to a terrorist organization pass money through a local hawala broker in their country, who also charges a broker fee. Another broker in the destination country then delivers the money to the intended recipient. In addition to being used for donations, hawala networks allow terrorist groups to transfer their own funds or resources from one location to another.\n\nCryptocurrency and hawala transfers can both be used for legitimate purposes, but their anonymity and decentralized nature make them appealing for financing illicit activities. Long-standing hawala networks are trusted ways to move money, but the convenience, direct transfers, and near instantaneous transactions make Bitcoin far more alluring to nefarious actors.\n\nRecent improvements to Bitcoin’s anonymity may further encourage illicit activity. Some of the original Bitcoin wallets allowed partial anonymity, but transactions could still be traced. In the past few years, companies such as Samurai, BitcoinFog, and DarkWallet have focused on producing a Bitcoin wallet that provides complete anonymity and makes the transactions virtually untraceable. These “dark wallets” could become major resources in terror finance, posing a serious hurdle to governments in stopping terrorists’ cash flows.\n\nBitcoin is becoming more mainstream. For example, companies such as Microsoft, Expedia, and Subway now accept Bitcoin as payment. As cryptocurrency becomes more well-known, it may play a greater role in terror finance—in 2015, the Islamic State allegedly posted its Bitcoin address on the dark web so that individuals could send money, and in June 2015, a Virginia teen was arrested after tweeting instructions on how to donate Bitcoin to the Islamic State.\n\nVice An alleged Islamic State funding page on the dark web featuring a Bitcoin address. LinkedIn Email Share Share\n\nSome argue that, regardless of improved technology, Bitcoin donations will continue to have little impact on terrorists’ revenue because most groups fund their operations primarily through a combination of charities, extortion, taxing the territory they control, or state sponsorship. As groups like the Islamic State lose territory in Iraq and Syria, however, they will be forced to find alternatives and focus on generating more foreign investment from individuals or front charities—payments that cryptocurrencies are well-suited to facilitate.\n\nDeterring terrorism financing continues to be a top counterterrorism priority in the United States. In order to deter terrorists from seeking donations in the form of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, U.S. policymakers should coordinate with companies in charge of Bitcoin wallets as well as Blockchain administrators to track purchases, exchanges of Bitcoin to other currencies, and transfers of substantial funds to a Bitcoin account. U.S. representatives at the Financial Action Task Force—an intergovernmental body that combats money laundering and terrorist financing—would be well-poised to do just that. It would also be prudent to develop the ability to flag suspicious Bitcoin addresses, so that authorities can more easily find and prosecute individuals if they engage in terrorist financing or money laundering.\n\nThe increasing attention in mainstream media to cryptocurrencies as well as the continued improvements towards perfecting transaction anonymity are generating the perfect storm to usher in a new era of terror finance. If the United States is to deter terror funding in the long run, it should take aggressive action to understand the negative potential uses of cryptocurrencies and form regulations to combat their use by illicit actors.', 'The Australian government said the threat of financial crime is constantly evolving as it introduced new measures targeting criminal use of the cryptocurrency and strengthened the Anti-Money Laundering And Counter Terrorism Financing Act.\n\n\n\nUnder the reforms, currency exchange providers of digital money, such as the bitcoin and ethereum, will be brought under the remit of the Australian Transactions and Reporting Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).\n\n\n\nThe investigative and enforcement powers of the financial intelligence agency will also be strengthened as part of the changes.\n\nAustralia\'s Minister for Justice Michael Keenan said: ""Stopping the movement of money to criminals and terrorists is a vital part of our national security defences and we expect regulated businesses in Australia to comply with our comprehensive regime.\n\n\n\n""The threat of serious financial crime is constantly evolving, as new technologies emerge and criminals seek to nefariously exploit them.\n\n\n\n""These measures ensure there is nowhere for criminals to hide.""', 'Defying naysayers, Bitcoin’s price surged above $4,500 for the first time early Thursday to reach a market value of $73.6 billion.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency has since pared some of its gains, falling to $4,453 by midday Thursday, it’s risen by about $1,000 in the past nine days. The currency’s total market value jumped $17 billion in the same period, thanks in part to the optimism traders have around plans to help Bitcoin eventually go mainstream. This includes speedier transactions, starting with its software update—dubbed Segwit2x—earlier this month.\n\n“We can also speculate that it is related to the increased interest from Korean and Japanese exchanges where volumes are also increasing,” William Mougayar, the founder of Startup Management, told Fortune. “Another part of it is driven by the psychology of markets, as $USD 5,000 seems to be within reach, now that the $4,000 level has been easily broken.”\n\nThat said, Bitcoin’s sudden rise is cause for concern for some.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Sheba Jafari wrote in a Sunday note that she expected Bitcoin to potentially hit and peak at $4,827.\n\n“The market should in theory enter a corrective phase. This can last at least one third of the time it took to complete the preceding advance and retrace at least 38.2% of the entire move,” she wrote. “From current levels, that would measure out to around $2,221.”\n\nMeanwhile, plans to scale up Bitcoin haven’t exactly gone smoothly. Miners still appear split about how to implement SegWit2x. The first part of that plan was activated earlier this month, but the second part, an upgrade to Bitcoin’s software by increasing block size to two megabytes in November, has been a point of contention. That upgrade, which was made official this week, will result in a “hard fork.”\n\nMiners already dissatisfied with Segwit2x decided not to make that upgrade earlier this year, forming a new cryptocurrency offshoot dubbed Bitcoin Cash. If more miners shun the November upgrade, it would in theory result in yet another Bitcoin currency.\n\nBitcoin Cash is trading at about $373.80, 47% off its all-time high earlier this month. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading at about $289, 26% off its all-time high earlier this year.', 'Bitcoin is on a tear, but it could easily go higher. Higher? Even after surging 600% in the last year and hitting $4,000?\n\n\n\nThe last time Bitcoin went on such a tear it had a major correction. Will we see a major correction, again? It’s not likely, however, we are due a near-term pullback. But that’s beyond the scope of this piece. Instead, I’m more interested in the long-term viability.\n\n\n\nThe worry is that Bitcoin is very much binary - either in a massive bubble or still in the early stages of a major surge driven by mass adoption. The latter is what I’m betting on. Bitcoin is a scarce commodity and by all accounts will blow through $5,000 by 2018. This comes as there’s plenty of money that can flow into Bitcoin. There’s over $200 trillion in stocks, bonds and gold, just a fraction of that flowing into Bitcoin is a huge catalyst. Bitcoin as a store of value is very interesting.\n\n\n\nWhile the adoption of Bitcoin as a payment form in the U.S. has its hurdles, seeing Bitcoin as a payment system in emerging economies isn’t unreasonable at all. Even Australia is considering making Bitcoin an official currency. But in developed countries, it’s catalyst is with Bitcoin becoming a store of value -- more so, an asset class that banks, investment firms and advisers mainstream Bitcoin and start pushing it to clients.\n\n\n\nThe math.\n\n\n\nWhat’s good for cryptocurrencies is generally good for Bitcoin. Moving from just a $60 billion market cap for Bitcoin to upwards of a trillion seems aggressive. But that assumes that cryptocurrencies tap into less than 5% of the world’s investable assets. Moving from gold to Bitcoin is a key catalyst for the cryptocurrency. The value of gold is that it’s a scarce commodity, as is Bitcoin. And the returns on Bitcoin have been much better -- much much better than gold -- so there’s the continued fear of missing out. But while the baby boomers might be ‘slow’ to shift their gold holdings over to Bitcoin, to the millennial generation, Bitcoin is their gold. So while Wall Street argues over the utility of using it to exchange goods, don’t sleep on the fact that we could see Bitcoin as a gold substitute.\n\nDon’t be intimidated by a $50,000 Bitcoin price target. Or even $100,000 - which means cryptocurrencies capture 10% of currency trading volume. Gold is a near $8 trillion market -- 160 times that of Bitcoin. More investors, including banks buying for customers and investing purposes, is a win-win for cryptocurrency. Then we have emerging markets looking to break away from fiat currencies and looking for alternative asset classes.\n\nAre we looking at next year or next decade?\n\nChange in technology happens fast and I believe we’ll likely see that $100,000 within the next half decade. The fork/split has gone well, and the computing power of Bitcoin means the innovation and use of the blockchain could soar. One big theses is that institutional investors will eventually come to market. That is, while retail investors can use Coinbase and exchanges, there’s no easy way for bigger investors to invest in Bitcoin. The conversation is no longer about the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, but are more about the best way to invest. There are block trades and options coming to the cryptocurrency market, which is a big positive for getting institutional investors into the market. The CBOE plans to offer Bitcoin futures within the next year. This sets Bitcoin up to outperform stocks and bonds for the rest of the year. The fact that stocks are at all-time highs only helps drive more investors to consider Bitcoin. The fact that it’s still an under owned asset will continue to drive demand.\n\nCoinbase, the foremost exchange for trading Bitcoins, has raised $100 million - now valued at $1.6 billion. Its job is to bring Bitcoin to the masses. It’s looking to open the door for even more retail investors to invest in Bitcoin. Coinbase has exchanged more than $15 billion in digital currency so far in 2017, more than it did in all of 2016. Imagine if a brokerage firm buys Coinbase to become the foremost leader in digital currencies. Fidelity has already partnered with Coinbase, and allows its customers to see cryptocurrency balances right from their brokerage homepage.\n\n\n\nThe path is laid out, with the greatest risk being the lack of adoption -- much like the hype we saw with Apple Pay and paying with smartphones, but it just hasn’t panned out, yet.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

This means local retailers cannot accept it as payment but users on an exchange may be left to trade freely, potentially cashing in on its ascent.\n\n“We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations...Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil.\n\nHe said the exchange has picked up about 300 pre-registrations from users ahead of its launch.\n\nThe Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority, the country’s financial markets regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nKhalil and co-founder Omar Abdelrasoul see their platform connecting a community of several thousand bitcoin enthusiasts who will for the first time be able to trade in Egyptian pounds, which have roughly halved in value since November after flotation under an International Monetary Fund loan programme.\n\n“Cryptoassets are happening whether (the Egyptian government) joins in or not. And by not joining they’re missing out on a very big market. Currently bitcoin is about a $70 billion market,” said Khalil.\n\nCryptocurrencies allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions between individual users, without the need for banks or central banks.\n\nBitcoin’s lack of central authority makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls. This has helped it proliferate in China, the world’s most active bitcoin market, but has led some governments to crack down on its use to prevent money laundering.\n\nThose same dynamics could propel bitcoin in Egypt, where a shortage of hard currency after the 2011 uprising sharply restricted bank transfers. Though liquidity at banks has improved and capital controls have been lifted in recent months, businesses still resort to a black market for dollars to obtain currency not available in the formal banking system.\n\n“We’re trying to get people used to the idea of bitcoin, to ready the market so that in a couple of years we will reach a greater number of users. But for now we are trying to let people know what cryptocurrency is,” said Abdelrasoul. (Reporting by Eric Knecht; editing by Mark Heinrich)', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Swiss digital currency exchange ShapeShift AG said on Wednesday it has acquired Seattle-based KeepKey Holder LLC, a maker of devices known as digital wallets, in an all-bitcoin deal.\n\nFinancial terms were undisclosed. KeepKey’s wallet, which sells for about $100, stores digital currencies.\n\nAs bitcoin and other crypto-currencies have gained in popularity, a group of companies such as KeepKey has emerged to serve a growing need to protect these assets from online theft.\n\nShapeShift’s chief executive officer, Erik Voorhees, said in an interview the acquisition allows the company to provide its users a “cohesive experience” in which they can exchange digital assets and store them at the same time.\n\nKeepKey integrated ShapeShift’s application more than a year ago.\n\n“Amid heightened interest in the concept of digital currencies, a simple, user-friendly cold storage wallet” with the ability to facilitate trading or exchanging for another crypto-currency is key to wider adoption, said Voorhees.\n\n“Cold storage” refers to keeping digital assets completely offline, disconnected from the internet and thus minimizing the incidence of hackings. Bitcoin, litecoin, and ether are digital assets and when they are stored in online devices, such as a laptop or smartphone, there is increased risk of theft.\n\nBy using KeepKey together with ShapeShift exchange, chances of a cyber attack are greatly diminished, Voorhees said.\n\n“With ShapeShift, users don’t need to leave funds at an exchange,” he said. “With KeepKey, users don’t need to leave funds on any computer whatsoever. We see a future in which keys are kept on hardware, and noncustodial exchange occurs directly from the hardware.”\n\nThis means users can hold their coins on the hardware device and exchange them on demand within the wallet, without even visiting a website, he said.\n\nShapeShift’s volume has jumped about 1,500 percent over the last year, Voorhees said. Last month, he estimated the company’s volume at about $280 million.\n\n“This is in line with the sharp growth in the digital currency space,” he said.\n\nBitcoin on Tuesday hit a record $4,400 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform.

It’s 400 miles from China’s capital, Beijing, and 35 miles from the the city of Baotou. The mine is just off the highway, near the intersection of Latitutde 3rd Road and Longitude 3rd Road. It sits amidst abandoned, half-built factories—victims of an earlier coal mining boom that fizzled out, leaving Ordos and its outlying areas littered with the shells of unfinished buildings.\n\nThe mine belongs to Bitmain, a Beijing-based company that also makes mining machines that perform billions of calculations per second to try and crack the cryptographic puzzle that yields new bitcoins. Fifty Bitmain staff, many of them local to Ordos, watch over eight buildings crammed with 25,000 machines that are cranking through calculations 24 hours a day. One of the buildings is devoted to mining litecoin, an ascendant cryptocurrency. The staff live on-site in a building with a dormitory, offices, a canteen, and a repair center. For recreation, they play basketball on an unfinished cement court.\n\nBitcoin mining consumes enormous amounts of electricity, which is why miners seek out locations that offer cheap energy. The Ordos mine was set up in 2014, making it China’s oldest large-scale bitcoin mining facility. Bitmain acquired it in 2015. It’s powered by electricity mostly from coal-fired power plants. Its daily electricity bill amounts to $39,000. Bitmain also operates other mines in China’s remote areas, like the mountainous Yunnan province in the south and the autonomous region of Xinjiang in the west.\n\nDespite the costs, bitcoin mining remains a lucrative industry. At the current bitcoin price of about $4,000 per bitcoin, miners compete for over $7 million in new bitcoins a day. The more processing power a mining operation controls, the higher its chances of winning a chunk of those millions. The Ordos mine accounts for over 4% of the processing power on the bitcoin network—a huge amount for a single facility.\n\nQuartz visited the mine in Ordos on Aug. 11.\n\nThe Bitmain mine in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, has eight buildings containing mining machines. One of them is dedicated to litecoin and seven mine bitcoins. An additional building is inactive.

He now tells TechCrunch he’s working on a project with NASA to launch a mini satellite into space with the recordings of regular folks, tech leaders and top artists — including pop idol Taylor Swift.\n\nThe launch is in celebration of the 40th anniversary of Carl Sagan’s Golden Record sent onboard Voyager in 1977. Sagan is a personal hero of Finman’s and he says he wanted to do something akin to the Golden Record to remind us about this time in world history.\n\n“Since almost everyone has a camera and an internet connection, we can now represent the world in a whole new way and showcase how the United States has changed since 40 years ago.” Finman said.\n\nFinman wanted to get involved in space travel ever since he saw Elon Musk launch his reusable rockets. But his interest in the stars goes far back into his family’s history. Finman’s mother was involved in the NASA space program in the 80’s and he says she was set to go as part of the crew on the fated spaceship Challenger. However, she ended up finding out she was pregnant with Finman’s oldest brother and unable to go.\n\nThough Challenger was a serious tragedy, his mother remained involved in the space program for many years. Her love for the stars instilled in him a desire to get involved himself. So, earlier this year, he submitted for and won a NASA grant enabling him to organize the endeavor, called Project DaVinci.\n\nThe government space program will handle the costs of the launch and provide materials for the satellite project. Meanwhile, Finman will gather the materials through a website, launching today, and has already employed a team of high school students from his hometown of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, and engineers in Los Angeles and Scotland to build the mini satellite.\n\nOther artists and tech leaders already onboard include “Vineographer” Logan Paul, XPRIZE’s Peter Diamandis, renowned aerospace engineer Burt Rutan and YouTube personality Casey Neistat.\n\nSwift’s album ‘1989’ will head up into the stars, along with media from the previously listed participants and what he hopes will be something submitted from all 196 countries around the globe.\n\nNASA has not yet set a date for the launch, but it should be sometime in Q1 of 2018, according to Finman. Those interested in submitting something in hopes it goes into space can do so by heading over to Finman’s website and uploading a video, image or sound for free.\n\nFeatured Image: Gary Miller/Getty Images']"

The influx of huge amounts of cash from depressed regions into cryptos may well be the cause of the boom.\n\nWhile tensions in North Korea and Japanese demand have been substantial factors, the coinciding economic collapse in different countries may well play a major role as well.\n\nBitcoin access\n\nAs these countries have faced financial crises, and a need for better store of value is being sought, access to Bitcoin is becoming easier every day.\n\nCompanies like CryptoPay and Coinbase are offering exchanges that allow for fiat to crypto exchanges in these regions.\n\nWhat’s more, the proliferation of Bitcoin ATMs around the world has created a system of access points for Bitcoin that has broadened consumer access.\n\nWhile the massive increase in price may retract over time, the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies will only drive demand further.\n\nViable store of value\n\nWhile these countries are, by and large, smaller world economies, it stands to reason that all fiat currencies act as price drivers for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs currency prices rise and fall around the globe, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies frees them from governmental influence and political gamesmanship, and therefore makes them a safe haven investment for the global marketplace."", 'Bitcoin Cash is the latest major cryptocurrency to surge in value, with prices more than doubling over the past two days.\n\nFollowing Bitcoin’s split on August 1, the alternative Bitcoin Cash traded consistently at around $US300.\n\nDemand then spiked and a short time ago, prices had shot up to more than $US700:\n\nThe price surge means that Bitcoin Cash is now the world’s third biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nPrices for Bitcoin were holding steady this morning at just over $US4,100, but down from their record highs earlier in the week above $US4,400.\n\nAmid the recent surges in both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum prices have remained steady at around $US300.\n\nAccording to data from coinmarketcap.com, over half of Bitcoin Cash’s transaction volume overnight was made on trading exchanges in South Korea.\n\nThe split in the two currencies was driven by disagreements in the Bitcoin developer community over transaction speeds.\n\nProponents of Bitcoin Cash set up the alternative version on a separate blockchain that would allow for increased transaction volume.\n\nAccording to cryptocurrency website coindesk.com, as demand increases and more computing power is devoted to the Bitcoin Cash network, it will become increasingly easier to use and mine new coins.\n\nAs usual in this new space, no one knows what happens next but based on the price action over the last two days it will be worth watching over the weekend.', 'Australia is set to regulate virtual currency exchanges such as Bitcoin and strengthen the powers of its financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC as it cracks down on money laundering and terrorism financing Australia is set to regulate virtual currency exchanges such as Bitcoin and strengthen the powers of its financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC as it cracks down on money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nThe changes came two weeks after AUSTRAC took the country\'s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, to court for alleged ""serious and systemic non-compliance"" of money laundering and terror financing laws.\n\nIt follows similar reforms by Japan to regulate virtual currency, after the country found itself at the epicentre of a multi-million dollar embezzlement scandal following the collapse of the Tokyo-based MtGox Bitcoin exchange.\n\n""Stopping the movement of money to criminals and terrorists is a vital part of our national security defences and we expect regulated businesses in Australia to comply with our comprehensive regime,"" Justice Minister Michael Keenan said Thursday.\n\nHe added that the digital currency exchange sector was being regulated for the first time, while low-risk industries such as cash-in-transit would be subject to fewer regulations.\n\nVirtual currency has grown rapidly since the 2009 launch of Bitcoin, and there are now more than 100 crypto-currency options.\n\nBut the sector has suffered from highly publicised scandals like the 2014 collapse of MtGox.\n\nBackers say virtual currencies offer an efficient and anonymous way to store and transfer funds online.\n\nBut critics argue the lack of a legal framework governing the currency, the opaque way it is traded and its volatility, make it dangerous.\n\nExplore further: Top EU court rules Bitcoin exchange tax-free in Europe', 'Is Bitcoin having an existential crisis? After months of turbulence between the developers and the mining community, Bitcoin split into two different entities, one representing the initial version of the cryptocurrency and another called ""Bitcoin cash,"" as of the beginning of this month. This was due largely to the adoption of the SegWit protocol, which allowed Bitcoin\'s developers to continue the process of scaling the cryptocurrency up in order to accommodate the wealth of new users and the massive increase in transaction volume which has taken place over the past year or so. Now, a report by Axios suggests that the developers of the leading cryptocurrency are adding a third version of the digital token as well.\n\nSecond Version Had Aimed to Speed Up Transaction Time\n\nBitcoin split into two, essentially, because of the network\'s flawed design from the outset, which prevented it from being able to keep up with the recent massive growth in the user base and the number of transactions those users are facilitating. When Bitcoin cash was introduced, developers hoped that this would help the problem. The second iteration of the coin could offer transaction capacities eight times the size of the original network.\n\nNow, another group of Bitcoin developers is pushing for the creation of a third entity, designed to combine the best of the original Bitcoin and the newer Bitcoin cash. This would represent a new Bitcoin blockchain which would essentially operate by its own rule system.\n\nConcerns and Benefits\n\nAn immediate concern is about identity: which Bitcoin would be the ""true"" cryptocurrency? Would one of them end up dying out as a result of lost interest among users? Would a third version truly be able to accommodate the different needs of the growing Bitcoin customer base? Or would it ultimately lead to more trouble than it would be worth?\n\nThere are, of course, many potential benefits of incorporating a third type of the cryptocurrency into the network. The third iteration would allow for a block size increase, which would theoretically speed up transaction speeds, but it would also incorporate the SegWit protocol. Thus, it would combine the block size increase of the second type of Bitcoin with the underlying protocol adopted for the first type of Bitcoin. Bitmain, the largest Bitcoin infrastructure company in existence, partnered with developer Jeff Garzik in May of this year to come up with the so-called ""New York Agreement,"" which ultimately gave rise to the new Bitcoin iteration idea. Together, they decided to call it Segwit2X, and the third type of Bitcoin is expected to launch in November of this year. In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies, however, the time between now and then could bring about all sorts of unexpected twists and turns.', ""Bitcoin, a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, keeps shooting the lights out, but remains a polarizing subject. There are those who absolutely refuse to classify it as a financial asset, and those who are gung-ho about it. For the former, I'd advise reading Sumit Roy’s excellent piece, Why Bitcoin ETFs are Closer to Reality on ETF.com.\n\nRoy reported that LedgerX, granted the go-ahead by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will be offering options on bitcoin to its institutional investors in the fall, creating the first federally regulated bitcoin options exchange and that the CBOE will bring cash-settled bitcoin futures to market soon, assuming it gets the go-ahead from the CFTC. Now consider this: if an entire VIX trading ecosystem can be built on a statistic that serves as a basis for futures and options, then why wouldn’t it be possible for bitcoin?\n\nRemember, the VIX has no economic value and over time tends to mean revert to short- or long-term averages. The VIX is just a measurement of near-term options prices. So options prices can be broken down into components such as time value, distance from strike price, etc. When you factor those out, you have implied volatility, which some deem a fear premium.\n\nSo the idea that bitcoin could never be indexed and packaged and sold, falls apart the moment someone builds a bitcoin derivatives market. And it’s coming.\n\nFundstrat’s Thomas Lee thinks these developments imply a significant rise in institutional holdings of Bitcoin in the next six-to-eight months, and could lead to higher overall transaction volumes. Based on that and an expanded framework for valuing Bitcoin, Lee established a mid-2018 target of $6,000 per unit, implying upside of more than 45%. He still sees it hitting $25,000 by 2022. In a note he published Friday, Lee explained that the price of Bitcoin is 94% correlated to addresses and estimated transactions per user. He wrote:\n\nWe project user accounts to grow 50% to 976,350 and usage per account to rise 30% to $4,050 (it rose 2,000% in past year). These growth rates are a downshift from recent trend and arguably are conservative given accelerating adoption. Based on the respective coefficients, each 10% rise in user accounts adds $222 to the value of bitcoin. Similarly, each 10% rise in user activity per account adds $274 to the value of bitcoin. User accounts are subject to a log function (N^2) so a 50% rise in users is greater than 5X impact.\n\nFundstrat’s technical analyst Robert Sluymer sees short-term resistance at the $4,500-$4,800 level. A longer view suggests a four-year breakout would lead to $6,050."", ""Bitcoin has had its ups and downs since its introduction in 2009, but it's been on a rocket-ship ride of late. On Sunday, it surpassed the $4,000 mark for the first time.\n\nSome investors consider bitcoin a safe haven that's comparable to gold. Like gold, the digital currency isn't tied to one country or central bank. When a particular country experiences a political or economic crisis, its national currency can often take a nosedive; it's global nature and usage make bitcoin more insulated from such problems.\n\nIn fact, the cyber currency, like gold, can benefit from crises and uncertainty. Gold and bitcoin surged 4% and 3%, respectively, after Donald Trump won the election. And some investors are linking the recent spike in bitcoin's value to the escalating war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un over the latter's missiles and nuclear program.\n\nDespite their similarities, there's one key difference: Gold has been much stabler than bitcoin, as we can see in this chart from Statista, which is based on data from Coindesk and onvista. So, for investors looking for a safe bet, the precious metal is still the way to go.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>"", ""A financial data provider and bitcoin exchange operator in Japan is testing a digital bond denominated in the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs reported earlier this week by Bloomberg, Fisco – which launched a bitcoin exchange in September of last year and has invested in other exchanges like TechBureau – issued a test bond worth 200 bitcoins. A bond is a kind of debt issued over a certain period of time, usually paying out some form of interest in addition to the principal amount.\n\nThe three-year bond was exchanged from one company within the Fisco umbrella to another, according to the publication, and is said to provide a 3 percent return over the three-year period.\n\nThat companies in Japan would move in this direction is perhaps unsurprising, given that it only a few months ago, Japan's government passed and signed into law new statutes that recognize bitcoin as a legal payment instrument. At the same time, the new laws brought domestic bitcoin exchanges under the auspices of Japanese financial regulators.\n\nOther firms have looked to the tech as a vehicle for issuing bonds, including European automaker Daimler, which issued a €100 million corporate bond through a private version of the ethereum network.\n\nIn comments to Bloomberg, Masayuki Tashiro, Fisco's chief product officer, suggested that the trial could lead to a new way to generate revenue – provided it receives a blessing from the government.\n\nTashiro suggested that the exchange may move to test other kinds of cryptocurrency-based debt in the future.\n\nCoins cart image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

08/19/2017,"['The price of the digital currency Bitcoin Cash sustained its upward trajectory and surpassed the $700 mark on Aug. 18.\n\nHeading into the weekend trading sessions, the cryptocurrency posted a more than twofold increase in its price and emerged as the third-biggest digital currency in terms of network value.\n\nThe positive developments being seen in the performance of Bitcoin Cash form part of the digital currency’s brief history that started when it split off from the main Bitcoin Blockchain in early August.\n\nBitcoin’s split was realized when a group of miners and developers adopted a software with new network rules that were not compatible with the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Bitcoin continued to experience exceptional performance after the split in which it posted record highs of more than $4,000, Bitcoin Cash remained largely stagnant in its early weeks of existence.\n\nHowever, the latter experienced a sudden surge during mid-August trading to reach about $750 per token.\n\nPossible reasons for the price surge\n\nThere are several possible factors behind the sudden increase in Bitcoin Cash’s price, but it is still uncertain if these drivers will continue propelling the digital currency’s value upwards in the future.\n\nAmong the key drivers behind Bitcoin Cash’s upward trajectory are:', 'During this week, the first cryptocurrency managed to set a new price record, reaching the $4,500 mark.\n\nThroughout the year, we saw a lot of discussions around the network about whether the Bitcoin price for will be $5,000 by the end of the year, as some world-known analysts predicted. However, after this summer events, doubts on this issue have drastically decreased.\n\nFrom mid-July, BTC price stopped its movement in the range of $2,400 to $2,850, where the redistribution of assets took place. After the market participants started actively signaling the support of SegWit and with no acute reaction to the Bitcoin fork, the price resumed its price rally.\n\nAt the beginning of August, there was a stop in the price movement, after the new price high had been reached. As the price did not go down, it can be treated as the presence of buyers on the market who can lead it to new highs in the forefront of the good news.\n\nDespite the backdrop of ongoing updates and a positive reaction, the price continued its active growth along with increasing volumes.\n\nSuch growth indicates the users decided to fix their profits; it also indicates confidence that the price will keep moving up.\n\nDuring this growth, there’s no large price divergence observed. Prices on different exchanges have varied $150 to $200.\n\nThe greatest demand was seen on the Asian markets. In the Japanese market, the peak price, in US dollars, was $4,279; the Chinese market had $4,498 price the biggest.

This might mean that some market participants were taking profits.\n\nToday, it is in the range of $4,100 to $4,500. If from this level there will be no sales on large volumes, the price will probably continue its upward movement.\n\nIn the future, the market can be expected to continue the growth trend, with price adjustments to the range of about $3,000.

He commented:\n\n“While one may say this is preposterous to say central banks would own Bitcoin - we believe that central banks would view cryptocurrencies differently if Bitcoin's aggregate value exceeded $500 bln.“\n\nSome consolidation\n\nLee warned short term traders, however, that the volatility may well cause some price consolidation from the highs of last week.\n\nThe analyst stated that the August run had been overbought, and would see some backtracking to support levels, before moving forward again toward his predicted price point."", 'Bitcoin price failed to move above the $4475 level against the US Dollar, and BTC/USD is now trading near a major support area.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price was under some pressure due to solid rise of BCH against the US Dollar above $800.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair is currently trading above a bullish trend line positioned at $4000 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nAs long as the price is above the $4000 level, it may recover in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price failed to move above the $4475 level against the US Dollar, and BTC/USD is now trading near a major support area.\n\nBitcoin Price Support\n\nBitcoin price made a good ground this past week above $4000 against the US Dollar. However, the price failed to break the $4500 level and started a downside move. The decline was also due to an increase of buying interest in BCH, which traded above the $800 level. There was a decline in BTC price below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $3232.76 low to $4475.37 high. The price was also able to move below a crucial bullish trend line at $4180 on the 4-hours chart.\n\nThe downside move was prevented by another bullish trend line positioned at $4000 on the same chart. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $3232.76 low to $4475.37 high acted as a support. The pair is holding the bullish trend line well and currently trading above $4000. It has to stay above $4000 if buyers have to take the price back towards $4400.\n\nA break and close below $4000 could take the price towards the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $3232.76 low to $4475.37 high.

It\'s economics. Inventing your own word is just an excuse to ignore well-understood concepts.""\n\nThe term ""cryptoeconomics"" causes a lot of confusion and people are often unclear on what it is supposed to mean. The word itself can be misleading, as it suggests that there is a parallel ""crypto"" version of the whole of economics. This is wrong, and Parker is right to mock such a generalization.\n\nIn simple terms, cryptoeconomics is the use of incentives and cryptography to design new kinds of systems, applications, and networks. Cryptoeconomics is specifically about building things, and has most in common with mechanism design – an area of mathematics and economic theory.\n\nCryptoeconomics is not a subfield of economics, but rather an area of applied cryptography that takes economic incentives and economic theory into account. Bitcoin, ethereum, zcash and all other public blockchains are products of cryptoeconomics.\n\nCryptoeconomics is what makes blockchains interesting, what makes them different from other technologies. As a result of Satoshi\'s white paper, we have learned that through the clever combination of cryptography, networking theory, computer science and economic incentives that we can build new kinds of technologies. These new cryptoeconomic systems can accomplish things that these disciplines could not achieve on their own. Blockchains are just one product of this new practical science.\n\nThis article aims to explain cryptoeconomics in clear, simple terms. First, we examine bitcoin as an example of cryptoeconomic design. Second, we consider how cryptoeconomics relates to economic theory in general. Third, we look at three different areas of cryptoeconomic design and research that are active today.\n\n1. What is cryptoeconomics? Bitcoin as a case study\n\nBitcoin is a product of cryptoeconomics.\n\nBitcoin\'s innovation is that it allows many entities who do not know one another to reliably reach consensus about the state of the bitcoin blockchain. This is achieved using a combination of economic incentives and basic cryptographic tools.\n\nBitcoin\'s design relies on economic incentives and penalties. Economic rewards are used to enlist miners to support the network. Miners contribute their hardware and electricity because if they produce new blocks, they are rewarded with amounts of bitcoin.\n\nSecond, economic costs or penalties are part of bitcoin’s security model. The most obvious way to attack the bitcoin blockchain would be to gain control of a majority of the network\'s hashing power – a so-called 51 percent attack – which would let an attacker reliably censor transactions and even change the past state of the blockchain.\n\nBut gaining control of hashing power costs money, in the form of hardware and electricity. Bitcoin’s protocol intentionally makes mining difficult, meaning that gaining control of a majority of the network is extremely expensive – enough that it would be hard to profit from the attack. As of August 16, 2017, the cost of a 51 percent attack on bitcoin would be around $1.88 billion in hardware and $3.4 million in electricity every day.\n\nWithout these carefully calibrated economic incentives, bitcoin wouldn’t work. If mining did not come with a high cost, it would be easy to launch a 51 percent attack. If there were no mining reward, there would be no industry of people who buy hardware and pay for electricity to contribute to the network.\n\nBitcoin also relies on cryptographic protocols. Public-private key cryptography is used to give individuals safe, exclusive control of their bitcoin. Hash functions are used to ""link"" each block in the bitcoin blockchain, proving an order of events and the integrity of past data.\n\nCryptographic protocols like these give us the basic tools necessary to build reliable, secure systems like Bitcoin. Without something like public-private key infrastructure, we could not guarantee to a user that they have exclusive control over their bitcoin. Without something like hashing functions, nodes would not be able to guarantee the integrity of the history of bitcoin transactions contained in Bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nWithout the hardness of cryptographic protocols like hashing functions or public-private key cryptography, we would have no secure unit of account with which to reward miners - no confidence that our record of past accounts was authentic and exclusively controlled by a rightful owner. Without a carefully calibrated set of incentives to reward an industry of miners, that unit of account could have no market value because there would be no confidence that the system could persist into the future.\n\nIn this way, bitcoin\'s design requires an understanding of both cryptography and how incentives affect the security properties and functionality of systems built with cryptography. Cryptoeconomics is strange and counterintuitive. Most of us are not used to thinking of money as a design or engineering problem, nor are we used to economic incentive design being an essential component of a new technology. Cryptoeconomics requires us to think about information security problems in economic terms.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes in this industry is made by those who view blockchains only through a lens of computer science or applied cryptography. We have a strong tendency to prioritize the things we are most comfortable with, and see things outside of our domain of expertise as less important.\n\nIn blockchain technology, this leads many people to assume or abstract away the crucial role of economic incentives. This is one reason we see meaningless phrases like ""blockchains are trustless,"" ""bitcoin is backed only by math"" or ""blockchains are immutable."" These are all wrong in their own way, but all have the effect of obfuscating the essential role of a large network of people whose necessary participation in the network is maintained through economic incentives.\n\nCryptoeconomic systems like bitcoin feel like magic to someone who views them only as a product of computer science, because bitcoin can do things that computer-science alone could never accomplish. Cryptoeconomics isn’t magic – it’s just interdisciplinary.\n\n2. How does it relate to economics more generally?\n\nThe term cryptoeconomics can be misleading because it suggests a comparison to economics as a whole. This is part of what leads people like Parker to dismiss the term. Economics is the study of choice: how people and groups of people respond to incentives. The invention of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology does not require a new theory of human choice – the humans haven’t changed. Cryptoeconomics is not the application of macroeconomic and microeconomic theory to cryptocurrency or token markets.\n\nCryptoeconomics has most in common with mechanism design, a field related to game theory. In game theory, we look at a given strategic interaction (a ""game"") and then try to understand the best strategies for each player, and the likely outcome if both players follow those strategies. For instance, we might use game theory to look at a negotiation between two firms, relations between countries or even evolutionary biology.\n\nMechanism design is often referred to as reverse game theory because we start with a desired outcome and then work backwards to design a game that, if players pursue their own self interest, will produce the outcome we want. For instance, imagine we are responsible for designing the rules of an auction. We have an objective that we want bidders to actually bid the real value they place on an item. To achieve this, we apply economic theory to design the auction as a game where the dominant strategy for any player is to always bid their true value. One solution to this problem is called a Vickrey auction, where bids are secret and the winner of the auction (defined as the player with the highest bid) only pays the second highest amount that was bid.\n\nCryptoeconomics, like mechanism design, focuses on designing and creating systems. Like in our auction example, we use economic theory to design ""rules"" or mechanisms that produce a certain equilibrium outcome. But in cryptoeconomics, the mechanisms used to create economic incentives are built using cryptography and software and the systems we are designing are almost always distributed or decentralized.\n\nBitcoin is a product of this approach. Satoshi wanted bitcoin to have certain properties – for instance, that it be able to reach consensus about its internal state and that it be censorship-resistant. Then, Satoshi set out to design a system that would achieve those properties, assuming people responded in rational ways to economic incentives.\n\nMost often, cryptoeconomics is used to provide a security guarantee about a distributed system. For instance, we have a cryptoeconomic security guarantee that the bitcoin blockchain is secure against a 51 percent attack unless someone is willing to spend a few billion dollars. Or, in a state channel – a topic we discuss later – we can have a cryptoeconomic security guarantee that an off-chain process is nearly as secure and final as an on-chain transaction.\n\nIt is worth noting that mechanism design is not a panacea. There is a limit to how much we can rely on incentives to predictably shape future behaviour. As Nick Szabo rightly points out, ultimately we are speculating about people\'s future mental states and making assumptions about how they react to certain incentives. A cryptoeconomic system\'s security guarantee depends in part on the strength of its assumptions about how people react to economic incentives.\n\nThree examples of cryptoeconomics\n\nThere are at least three different kinds of systems being designed today that could be called “cryptoeconomic”.\n\nExample 1: Consensus protocols\n\nBlockchains are able to reach reliable consensus without having to rely on a central trusted party – a product of cryptoeconomic design. Bitcoin\'s solution, which we surveyed above, is called ""proof-of-work"" consensus because miners must commit work – in the form of hardware and electricity – in order to be participate in the network and receive mining rewards.\n\nImproving proof-of-work systems and designing alternatives to them is one active area of cryptoeconomic research and design. Ethereum’s current proof-of-work consensus mechanism includes many variations and improvements on the original design, enabling faster block times and being more resistant to the mining centralization that can result from ASICs.\n\nIn the near future, ethereum plans to migrate to a ""proof-of-stake"" consensus protocol called Casper. This is an alternative to proof-of-work that does not require ""mining"" in the usual sense: there is no need for specialized mining hardware or huge expenditures of electricity.\n\nRemember that the whole point of requiring miners to buy hardware and spend electricity is to impose a cost on miners, as a way of raising the cumulative cost of attempting a 51 percent attack sufficiently high that it becomes too expensive. The idea behind proof-of-stake systems is to use deposits of cryptocurrency to create the same disincentive, rather than real-world investments like hardware and electricity.\n\nIn order to mine in a proof-of-stake system, you must commit a certain amount of ether into a smart contract ""bond."" Just like in proof-of-work, this raises the cost of a 51 percent attack – an attacker would have to commit a very large amount of ether to successfully attack the network, which they would then lose forever.\n\nCasper is being designed by Vlad Zamfir, Vitalik Buterin, and others at the Ethereum Foundation. You can read more about the history of Casper\'s design in this series of posts by Zamfir or hear him talk about it on a recent podcast. Buterin wrote a long post about Casper\'s design philosophy here, and there is a useful FAQ on the ethereum GitHub wiki here.\n\nExample 2: Cryptoeconomic application design\n\nOnce we have solved the fundamental problem of blockchain consensus, we are able to build applications that sit ""on top"" of a blockchain like ethereum. The underlying blockchain gives us (1) a unit of value that can be used to create incentives and penalties, and (2) a toolkit with which we can design conditional logic in the form of ""smart contract code."" The applications we build with these tools can also be a product of cryptoeconomic design.\n\nFor instance, the prediction market Augur requires cryptoeconomic mechanisms in order to function. Using its native token REP, Augur creates a system of incentives that rewards users for reporting the ""truth"" to the application, which is then used to settle bets in the prediction market. This is the innovation that makes a decentralized prediction market possible. Another prediction market, Gnosis, uses a similar method, though also lets users specify other mechanisms for determining true outcomes (commonly called ""oracles"").\n\nCryptoeconomics is also applied to design token sales or ICOs. Gnosis, for instance, used a ""Dutch auction"" as a model for its token auction, on the theory that this would result in a more fair distribution (an experiment that had mixed results). We mentioned earlier that one area where mechanism design has been applied is in the design of auctions, and token sales gives us a new opportunity to apply some of that theory.\n\nThese are a different kind of problem than building the underlying consensus protocols, but they share enough similarities that both can be fairly seen as cryptoeconomic. Building these applications requires an understanding of how incentives shape users\' behaviour and careful design of economic mechanisms that can reliably produce a certain result. They also require an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the underlying blockchain on which the application is built.\n\nMany blockchain applications are not products of cryptoeconomics; for instance, applications like Status and Metamask – wallets or platforms that let users interact with the ethereum blockchain. These do not involve any additional cryptoeconomic mechanisms beyond those that are already part of the underlying blockchain.\n\nExample 3: State channels\n\nCryptoeconomics also includes the practice of designing much smaller sets of interactions between individuals. The most notable of these are state channels. State channels are not an application but a valuable technique that can be used by most blockchain applications to become more efficient.\n\nA fundamental limitation of blockchain applications is that blockchains are expensive. Sending transactions requires fees, and using ethereum to run smart-contract code is comparatively costly to other kinds of computation. The idea behind state channels is that we can make blockchains more efficient by moving many processes off-chain, while still retaining a blockchain\'s characteristic trustworthiness, through the use of cryptoeconomic design.\n\nImagine Alice and Bob want to exchange a large number of small payments of cryptocurrency. The normal way for them to do this would be to send transactions to the blockchain. This is inefficient – it requires paying transaction fees and waiting for the confirmation of new blocks.\n\nInstead, imagine that Alice and Bob sign transactions that could be submitted to the blockchain, but are not. They pass these back and forth between one another, as fast as they want – there are no fees, because nothing is actually hitting the blockchain yet. Each update ""trumps"" the last one, updating the balance between the parties.\n\nWhen Alice and Bob have finished exchanging small payments, they ""close out"" the channel by submitting the final state (i.e. the most recent signed transaction) to the blockchain, paying only a single transaction fee for an unlimited number of transactions between themselves. They can trust this process because both Alice and Bob know that each update passed between them could be sent to the blockchain. If the channel is properly designed, there is no way to cheat – say, by trying to submit a previous update as though it were the most recent – since recourse to the blockchain is always available.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, you can think of this as similar to how we interact with other trusted sources, like a legal system. When two parties sign a contract, most of the time they never need to take that contract to court and ask a judge to interpret and enforce it. If the contract is properly designed, both parties simply do what they promised to do, and never interact with the courts at all. The fact that either party could go to the court and have the contract enforced is enough to make the contract useful.\n\nThis technique is not just useful for payments, but for any update to the state of an ethereum program – hence the more general term ""state channel"" rather than the narrow ""payment channel."" Instead of sending payments back and forth, we can send updates to a smart contract back and forth. We can even send entire ethereum smart contracts that, if needed, will be sent to the blockchain and executed. These programs never have to be executed to be useful. All that is needed is a sufficiently high guarantee that they could be executed if necessary.\n\nIn the future, most blockchain applications will use state channels in some form. It is almost always a strict improvement to require less on-chain operation, and many things done on-chain today can be moved into state channels while still preserving a sufficiently high guarantee to be useful.\n\nThe description above skips over many important details and nuances of how state channels work. For a more detailed description, Ledger Labs built a toy implementation last summer that demonstrates the basic concept.\n\nConclusion\n\nThinking about the blockchain space through the lens of cryptoeconomics is helpful. Once you understand the idea, it helps to clarify many of the controversies and debates in our industry.\n\nFor instance, ""permissioned"" blockchains that are centrally managed and do not use proof-of-work have been a source of constant controversy since they were first proposed. This area of work is often referred to as ""distributed ledger technology"" and is focused on financial and enterprise use cases. Many partisans of blockchain technology dislike them – they may be blockchains in the literal sense, but there is something about them that feels wrong. They seem to reject the thing that many people see as the whole point of blockchain technology: being able to produce consensus without relying on a central party or traditional financial systems.\n\nA cleaner way to make this distinction is between blockchains that are products of cryptoeconomics and blockchains that are not. Blockchains that are simply distributed ledgers and do not rely on cryptoeconomic design to produce consensus or align incentives might be useful for some applications. But they are distinct from blockchains whose whole purpose is to use cryptography and economic incentives to produce consensus that could not exist before, like bitcoin and ethereum. These are two different technologies, and the clearest way of distinguishing between them is whether or not they are products of cryptoeconomics.\n\nSecondly, we should expect that there will be cryptoeconomic consensus protocols that do not rely on a literal chain of blocks. Obviously, such a technology would have something in common with blockchain technology as we call it today, but labelling them blockchains would be inaccurate. Again, the relevant organizing concept is whether such a protocol is the product of cryptoeconomics, not whether it is a blockchain.\n\nThe ICO craze has also focused attention on this distinction, though few have articulated it clearly. Many people independently identified that one of the strongest signs of a token\'s value is whether it forms a necessary component of the application to which it is connected. To put this in clearer terms, the question should be: is the token part of a necessary cryptoeconomic mechanism in the application? Understanding the mechanism design of a project holding an ICO is an essential tool in determining that token\'s utility and likely value.\n\nIn the past years, we\'ve moved from thinking about this new field solely through the lens of one application (bitcoin), to thinking about it in terms of one underlying technology (blockchains). What needs to happen now is to step back once again and view this industry in terms of a unifying approach to solving problems: cryptoeconomics.\n\nThanks to Jeff Coleman, Ethan Wilding, and Vlad Zamfir for their comments on an earlier draft of this article.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, developer of zcash.\n\nUnderstanding economics image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The blockchain-based platform aims to disrupt the $33 billion ticketing market by overcoming the pervasive challenges of traditional systems worldwide while creating a more efficient marketplace for both buyers and sellers.\n\nCurrent platforms for purchasing sports, concert and theater tickets are rife with issues of fraud, lack of scalability, limited seating options and high costs. Resellers use sophisticated bots to make bulk-ticket purchases, which in turn blocks the average consumer from the market.

The map indicated that the coming release would contain some major upgrades for the platform.\n\nThe announcement earlier in the year indicated a three to six-month window for release, and late September is right on the cusp of a full six months.\n\nWhile the timing is later than many had hoped, the news is a welcome encouragement for those seeking Ethereum upgrades.\n\nAnticipated upgrades\n\nThe new hard fork should enable some significant upgrades.\n\nFirst, increasing anonymity will come with new ‘zk-SNARKs,’ or Zero-knowledge proofs. Users will be able to perform anonymous transactions at higher levels than in the past.\n\nSecond, programming and smart contracts will be made far easier with the new upgrade, relieving some of the pressure on current programmers. Gas will also be adjusted for bill settling.\n\nThird, masking for security enthusiasts will allow users to determine the address for which they have a private key. This will increase security on the network, even against quantum computer hacking.\n\nFinally, the upgrade includes a ‘Difficulty-Bomb’ intended to make mining exponentially more difficult.\n\nThe bomb is designed to be an intermediate step in the transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) on the network. This has often been referred to as the ‘Ethereum Ice Age.’\n\nPrice response?\n\nIt remains unclear whether the upgrade will cause prices to increase or decrease. As mining slows, the price may fall.\n\nHowever, the upgrades should increase the amount of users on the system overall, causing the price to rise.\n\nRegardless, Metropolis is the penultimate stop on the road map - Serenity, the next upgrade, should produce an increase in stability, causing greater investment and price support.', 'The CEO and founder of Gatecoin, the Bitcoin and Ethereum token exchange, was interviewed on Bloomberg Daybreak Asia regarding Bitcoin price and the cause of the recent price increase.\n\nFactors for Bitcoin price increase\n\nAurélien Menant stated that he sees Bitcoin price reaching new highs at $5,000 this year.\n\nThe causes include lack of stability in other markets, institutional investors like hedge funds, as well as the ‘safe haven’ nature of Bitcoin as an investment.\n\nMenant said:\n\n“Uncertainties in other markets are driving more and more interest in Bitcoin. Another factor that is very important is the arrival of more and more institutional investors.”\n\nMenant went on to share how the nature of Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven’ investment equivalent to gold is driving greater levels of investment in the cryptocurrency.\n\nRegulations in China\n\nMenant also said that he does expect greater levels of regulation from world governments, as Bitcoin comes more and more into the mainstream.\n\nHe said:\n\n“China is catching up with Japan and the US who have already regulated Bitcoin, and as a transactional value it is becoming more and more important, currently with a $70 bln market cap, so obviously you need to have some rules in place to prevent money laundering. So to me, it’s a natural and rather good thing.”\n\nCash crises and access play a key role\n\nAurélien also commented that the current state of unrest with many other currencies is driving the public into cryptocurrencies. The very nature of Bitcoin being privately held creates a system where Bitcoin cannot be seized.\n\nUnlike other currencies (Bolivars for example), Bitcoin is not controlled by central banks, and cannot, therefore, be manipulated by governments. Menant concluded by agreeing that the ‘safe haven’ nature of Bitcoin is further fueling the price growth.\n\nThe full interview can be accessed here.', 'Of all the tips Bitcoin, Powerball and other quick millionaires can get from experts, one stands out: don’t treat lucky money differently than hard earned money, because you run the risk of losing part or all of it.\n\nThe tip comes from behavioral economists who argue that holding onto lucky money is often more difficult than acquiring it.\n\nThere is a good reason for this: “mental accounting.”\n\nUnlike conventional accounting, which treats all dollars alike, irrespective of how they are amassed, mental accounting treats lucky dollars differently than dollars earned the hard way—through long hours of work or through the successful launching of a business venture.\n\nHow differently?\n\nBy taking on higher risks with lucky dollars, as is the case with money won in a casino. ""You can see mental accounting in a casino,” say behavioral economists Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein in Nudge. “Watch a gambler who is lucky enough to win some money early in the evening. You might see him take the money he has won and put it in one pocket and put the money he brought with him to gamble that evening (yet another mental account) into a different pocket. Gamblers even have a term for this. The money that recently has been won is called ‘house money’ because in gambling parlance the casino is referred to as the house.”\n\nThis same mentality affects people who never gamble. When making money quickly by buying the winning ticket in a Powerball jackpot or by placing the right bet in a hot investment like Bitcoin, people are willing to take big chances with their ""winnings,"" and big risks of losing their fortunes.\n\nThe bottom line: Fortunes amassed with lucky bets shouldn’t be treated as ""House Money"" to be tossed onto a casino table, because they will be lost on the first unlucky bet.']"

Each coin is now worth more than $4,300, up from less than $1,000 each as recently as March.\n\nWhile there will be some ""ups and downs"" to bitcoin in the near future, Finman expects that it could go up ""much, much, much more"" — possibly to as high as $10,000 per coin.\n\nThe alternatives\n\nFinman doesn\'t pay much mind to cyber currency alternatives like bitcoin cash, a currency that spun off from bitcoin following a schism within the bitcoin community. Finman sees it as an ""alt-coin;"" an offshoot that\'s more of a minor experiment than a true successor to bitcoin itself.\n\nFinman\'s also skeptical of Ethereum, which has been getting a lot of traction in Silicon Valley. Each ether — Ethereum\'s name for its digital coins — is now worth $300, and proponents see unlimited upside.\n\nBut Finman believes that growth in Ethereum is being driven largely by speculators who are creating a bubble that could burst one day. In the bitcoin community, Ethereum is sometimes known as ""Ponzi-coin,"" he said, a characterization that he ""might agree with.""\n\nThere\'s ""a lot of money short-term"" to be made with Ethereum, he said, but he\'s unconvinced of its long-term viability as a true digital currency.\n\nHe feels similarly about initial coin offerings, or ICOs, where companies are launching new currencies or digital tokens by exchanging them for bitcoin or ether. He thinks ICOs are ""cool and innovative"" in theory, but describes much of the execution as ""Gordon Gekko-esque"" — referencing the unethically greedy antihero from the ""Wall Street"" movies — insofar as they\'re largely unregulated and highly risky for investors.', ""In this San Francisco 'castle', over half a dozen residents have become millionaires investing in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nDubbed the Crypto Castle, the three-story house in San Francisco's Protrero Hill neighborhood houses a revolving cast of young entrepreneurs united by their passion for bitcoin.\n\nAs the price of bitcoin has shot up nearly 600 percent of the last 12 months, to more than $4,000, many of them have minted big bucks.\n\nThe modest exterior of the Crypto Castle belies the gaggle of young millionaires who live there\n\nThe three-story house is in Protrero Hill south of downtown San Francisco.

The protocol aims is to make it impossible to infer which inputs and outputs belong to each other.\n\nOf 130 online merchants that accept Bitcoin, the researchers say, 53 leak payment information to 40 third parties, “most frequently from shopping cart pages,” and most of these on purpose (for advertising, analytics and the like).\n\nWorse, “many merchant websites have far more serious (and likely unintentional) information leaks that directly reveal the exact transaction on the blockchain to dozens of trackers”.\n\nOf the 130 sites the researchers checked:\n\nIn total, 107 sites leaked some kind of transaction information;\n\n31 allowed third-party scripts to access users' Bitcoin addresses;\n\n104 shared the non-BTC denominated price of a transaction; and\n\n30 shared the transaction price in Bitcoin.\n\nIt doesn't help that even for someone running tracking protection, a substantial amount of personal information was passed around by the sites examined in the study.\n\nInformation type Without tracking protection With protection E-mail 32 25 First name 27 20 Last name 25 19 User ID 15 12 Address 13 9 Full name 11 4 Phone 10 4 Company 5 4\n\nA total of 49 merchants shared users' identifying information, and 38 shared that even if the user tries to stop them with tracking protection.\n\nUsers have very little protection against all this, the paper says: the danger is created by pervasive tracking, and it's down to merchants to give users better privacy.\n\nSince, as they write, “most of the privacy-breaching data flows we identify are intentional”, that seems a forlorn hope. ®"", 'This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material.

The initiative plans to develop a freely available suite of tools that can assist authorities in tracking and identifying individuals working in the underground sex industry.\n\nAlso Read: The Backpage Effect: Why the Sex Industry Thrives on Bitcoin\n\nThe Project Will Analyze Online Ads and the Bitcoin Blockchain to Identify Participants in Illegal Sex Trade\n\nResearchers from the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the University of California in Berkley, and the University of California in San Diego have teamed up to develop software designed to combat the sex trade through examining the bitcoin blockchain. The project seeks to develop machine-learning algorithms that can scan and identify patterns in sex ads, including the identification of illegal prostitution rings by identifying cryptocurrency wallets that are associated with multiple ads.\n\nUC Berkeley doctoral candidate, Rebecca Portnoff, has had significant involvement in the bitcoin blockchain analysis project.” Portnoff stated that “the technology we’ve built finds connections between ads. Is the pimp behind that post for Backpage also behind this post in Craigslist? Is he the same man who keeps receiving Bitcoin for trafficked girls? Questions like these are answerable only through more sophisticated technological tools – exactly what we’ve built in this work – that link ads together using payment mechanisms and the language in the ads themselves. Portnoff also stated “where previously you might have five different phone numbers that you had no idea were connected, when you can see that they all came from the same wallets, that the same person paid for them, that’s a concrete sign that these five phone numbers are all related to each other.”\n\nThe Projects Hopes to Deliver “A Big Boost for Those Working to Curb Exploitation”\n\nThe project will predominantly target ads hosted on websites such as Backpage and Craiglist, where human traffickers are known to operate. Until now, law enforcement have struggled to identify the ring leaders of illegal prostitution rings operating online due to the pseudonymous nature of online ads, culprits’ use of multiple phone numbers, email accounts and aliases, and the challenge of ascertaining whether or not an ad has been posted by a victim of the sex trade or a willing sex worker.\n\nDamon McCoy, an NYU assistant professor of computer science and co-author of the research believes that the project will have a significant impact on the illegal sex industry, stating that “There are hundreds of thousands of these ads placed every year, and any technique that can surface commonalities between ads and potentially shed light on the owners is a big boost for those working to curb exploitation.”\n\nThe development of the online ad and bitcoin blockchain analysis algorithms has been funded with assistance from the Amazon Web Services Cloud Credits for Research Program, the technology and security firm Giant Oak, Google, the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education. UC Berkeley has stated that the project’s findings will be published by Association for Computing Machinery’s Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.\n\nDo you think that the joint university project will be able to identify underground prostitution rings through bitcoin blockchain and online ad analysis?

While Bitcoin is now incredibly difficult to mine, it’s relatively easy to buy Bitcoins with traditional currency. For anyone wanting to begin their foray into this form of peer-to-peer transaction, which offers anonymity while simultaneously cutting out banks and other traditional third party financial entities, the first step is getting a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nBitcoins are stored in a digital wallet, stored in the cloud or on your personal computer, which act like a bank account, letting you pay or exchange Bitcoins. Imagine a virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive Bitcoin, or pay for goods from merchants that accept Bitcoin.\n\nBelow are eight great options for Bitcoin Wallets, along with two additional helpful apps to get you started, and you can download any of them here on Softonic.\n\n1. Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet\n\nMycellium is one of the best Bitcoin wallets out there. With this app you can easily send and receive Bitcoins using your mobile device. It allows for cold-storage integrations with hardware Bitcoin wallets like Trezor or KeepKey, and has a unique feature to help manage your private keys as well as a secret number that allows Bitcoins to be spent.\n\n2. Copay\n\nEver got confused about private keys? That’s where Copay comes in. This open source, multi-signature wallet from BitPay can help you have greater control over your private keys. This multi-signature technology allows Bitcoin wallets to be controlled by multiple private keys and users. Authorization for each transaction can require one, some, or all of these private keys.\n\n3. Coinbase\n\nBy far, Coinbase is one of the most popular Bitcoin exchange services used globally. Merchants and consumers can transact with a variety of digital currencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.\n\n4. BreadWallet\n\nBreadwallet is another open source and user-friendly wallet, perfect for beginners. Their core design principle is easy and intuitive software, so it’s a great option for those just starting out with Bitcoin.\n\n5. Airbitz\n\nIf you’re looking for something that will guarantee a little more privacy then have a look at Airbitz. The unique feature about Airbitz is that it is a completely decentralized wallet. What this means is that neither the company behind it nor any third-party can access your money or data. For those looking for best option in security and anonymity, this may be the wallet for you.\n\n6. Bitcoin Wallet\n\nBitcoin Wallet is the first mobile Bitcoin app. Designed to make Bitcoin easy to use at a time when these types of apps were limited, it’s a simple design without all the bells and whistles of newer apps. You can quickly pay by scanning the QR code, which is a big plus.\n\n7. GreenBits\n\nGreenBits has a little bit of everything for everyone. It’s a fast and easy to use wallet with multi-signature features and has strong security and privacy features as well.\n\n8. Samourai Wallet\n\nThe new kid on the block, Samourai Wallet claims to be the most private and anonymous wallet available, featuring military grade encryption. It is currently available through an alpha release on Android.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen a wallet, it’s time to buy, convert, and spend your Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is now accepted by over 100,000 merchants worldwide, it still takes some maneuvering to use. In addition, Bitcoin values are extremely volatile and fluctuate daily, so it’s a good idea to keep an eye on how much your Bitcoin is worth on the open market before you buy, sell, or convert them.\n\n9. Bitpay\n\nBitpay helps users accept Bitcoins for their business, store them, or convert and spend them as dollars using the BitPay card feature. It’s an easy way to manage your Bitcoin finances and transactions, much like a regular checking account would.\n\n10. Bitcoin Checker', ""Following the all-time highs set over the last week, bitcoin has been trading sideways for the last 48 hours, and prices are fluctuating in the $4,050 to $4,200 range.\n\nPrices for the asset across global exchanges averaged $4,109 at press time, having opened the session at $4,206 and achieved a high of $4,208 at roughly 8:00 UTC, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nThe question everyone will be wondering now is, will the price go up or down when the next big movement kicks off? For that we'll just have to wait and see, but a Goldman Sachs analyst said, on August 14, that bitcoin could rise as high as $4,800 in the current bull market.\n\nElsewhere, the new bitcoin alternative, bitcoin cash, shocked observers briefly yesterday by setting its own all-time high of around $1,091, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nSince being created in a fork of the bitcoin blockchain on August 1, prices had been for the greater part steady around $300. However, a breakout on August 17 saw enthusiastic trading – at South Korea exchanges, in particular – that took the digital asset to its previously unseen heights.\n\nIn the hours since, bitcoin cash prices have dropped somewhat and now hover close to the $800 mark.\n\nOverall, the market is still trending up, with the market capitalization across all cryptocurrencies currently at $146 billion – down slightly from a record high of $147.2 billion set at around 8:00 UTC this morning.\n\nTrading chart image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'Two years ago, a Chinese chip-design expert named Micree Zhan was reading China’s seminal science-fiction novel, The Three-Body Problem, by Liu Cixin, while wrestling with how to create a new processor. He had already designed custom chips for the company he co-founded, Bitmain, that had made it into the world’s leading bitcoin miner, allowing it to dominate the new, hyper-competitive industry of unearthing bitcoins. Now he needed a chip that could launch Bitmain onto a new trajectory, one that would help it master a world-altering technology called deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile performing his nightly meditation, a practice he has kept up for nearly a decade, it suddenly came to Zhan. “It was late at night, and something inspired me—Sophon!” he recalls. A sophon is a fictional proton-sized supercomputer from The Three-Body Problem that is sent by an alien civilization to halt scientific progress on Earth. It’s capable of causing strange phenomena—such as inscribing flashing words on the retinas of elite scientists. The aliens use it to take over Earth when their own planet is destroyed by the chaotic gravitational forces of its three suns.\n\nBitmain’s newest product, the Sophon, may or may not take over deep learning. But by giving it such a name Zhan and his Bitmain co-founder, Jihan Wu, have signaled to the world their intentions. The Sophon unit will include Bitmain’s first piece of bespoke silicon for a revolutionary AI technology. If things go to plan, thousands of Bitmain Sophon units soon could be training neural networks in vast data centers around the world.\n\nBitmain could pull it off, says Michael Bedford Taylor, a professor at the University of Washington who has studied the bitcoin mining industry and its specialized chips. Taylor says these types of chips, called application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, that are designed to perform a single function extremely efficiently could create the next wave of distributed computing (pdf). “This will invigorate the hardware field,” he says. “We are about to see the emergence of all kinds of ASICs clouds, and the bitcoin hardware community has demonstrated that under the right conditions this can happen rapidly as a grassroots effort.”\n\nChina’s shadowy colossus\n\nTo grasp how a Beijing startup is poised to challenge the likes of Google, Nvidia, and AMD in the deep learning arms race, it’s essential to understand Bitmain’s pivotal role in the $70 billion bitcoin economy. Incorporated in Hong Kong as Bitmain Technologies Ltd, Bitmain’s controlling shareholder is a trust registered in the Cayman islands.\n\nBitmain co-founder Micree Zhan explaining the significance of the word “Sophon.” (Quartz/Zheping Huang)\n\nThe company is a marvel of vertical integration. Bitmain designs the silicon that goes into its bitcoin mining rigs, assembles the machines, then sells them to customers around the world. It also operates the machines for its own account, runs vast bitcoin mines that it rents out on contract to others, and, finally, manages several of the world’s largest mining “pools”—agglomerations of processing power so huge that they greatly improve the odds of successfully mining a bitcoin block.\n\nBitmain may now be the most influential company in the bitcoin economy by virtue of the sheer amount of processing power, or hash rate, that it controls. Its mining pools, Antpool and BTC.com, account for 28.9% of all the processing power on the global bitcoin network.\n\nHash rate is critical because bitcoin is in the midst of a messy “civil war.” Controlling chunks of hash rate provides miners with a public vote on the bewildering array of technical proposals dictating bitcoin’s future. At the crux of the technical debate: How to increase the number of transactions the bitcoin network can handle at any given time. The recent split of bitcoin into bitcoin and bitcoin-cash illustrated one way to do this.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of checking and adding new transactions to bitcoin’s immutable ledger—its blockchain. Miners must compete with one another to be the first to find a new block. In return for performing this work, which requires massive processing power and incurs hefty electricity costs, miners are rewarded with a certain number of bitcoins for each block they add to the blockchain. Currently, that’s 12.5 bitcoins per block, and a new block is found roughly every 10 minutes. At the current bitcoin price of about $4,000, that’s $50,000 up for grabs every 10 minutes, or $7.2 million a day.\n\nControversy and criticism over blockchain\n\nWu, the business brains behind Bitmain, is a polarizing figure in the bitcoin world. He has been a vocal and vociferous proponent of one particular technical approach to increase bitcoin’s transaction capacity, one that would increase the size of bitcoin’s blocks by eliminating the 1 megabyte limit imposed by the bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitmain is among the signatories of the so-called “New York Agreement,” which calls for doubling the block size under the Segwit2x proposal. Some see this as technically risky, and philosophically fraught because it concentrates power in the hands of miners—like Bitmain. “In France, nobody likes him at all. He is despised,” said Sosthène, the pseudonym of a Parisian bitcoiner I met in Beijing.\n\nBitmain co-founder Jihan Wu in the lobby of his headquarters in Beijing. (Quartz/Zheping Huang)\n\nCritics of Bitmain suspect that Wu was behind the recent, somewhat related split of bitcoin called the bitcoin-cash hard fork. That split was supported by a miner in Shenzhen named ViaBTC—which happened to be a company that Bitmain has invested in. Wu denies he was behind the split and Bitmain has publicly said it’s neutral on the matter. “If we had such an influence,” he laughs, an earlier scaling proposal called Bitcoin Unlimited, which he and other prominent figures had backed, “would have already been activated.”\n\nJack Liao, who runs a Shenzhen-based mining firm called Lightning ASIC, has clashed with Bitmain. He says Wu is trying to dominate the bitcoin economy and shape it for his own ends. “He wants to control the code, he wants to control the environment,” Liao says. “Then he can design the entire bitcoin ecosystem.” Liao has clashed with Wu on social media in China, claiming that he’s prepared to take legal action against Wu for bad-mouthing his company, Lightning Asic.\n\nWu, 31 years old, spars with his critics on Twitter, where he says he is inundated by professional trolls. He famously published an expletive-laden tweet in 2016 in response to users who he believed were trolling him during one debate about bitcoin’s future. It was promptly turned into memes and held up as evidence that Wu was unqualified to lead the conversation about influencing the future of a protocol worth $70 billion.\n\nfuck your mother if you want fuck. — Jihan Wu (@JihanWu) May 15, 2016\n\nWu says he regrets that particular Twitter outburst. “If I had a time machine I would not have posted that,” he says. Fixing his image problem is partly why we’ve been invited to Beijing to meet him—he rarely grants interviews—and why we were invited to visit his firm’s bitcoin mine in Inner Mongolia the day following our meeting.\n\nAnother split for bitcoin is looming in November, when the community must again decide if it will raise the block size limit. Wu, who favors the new split, says such schisms shouldn’t be avoided. “The core developers don’t own bitcoin as a whole,” he says. “Maybe they own the bitcoin-core software project, but bitcoin is not software, it is a kind of social agreement that is implemented by software. And if people do not agree with each other, a fork will be inevitable. It is only a matter of time.”\n\nA chance encounter with a chip designer\n\nBitmain and Wu’s power would never have come about had it not been for a chance encounter on a Beijing street. Zhan, the Sophon chip designer and the technical brains behind Bitmain, was running a startup called DivaIP in 2010 that made a set-top box that allowed a user to stream a television show to a computer screen. One of Zhan’s staff was canvassing for customers when Wu walked by.\n\nEmployees at Bitmain’s Beijing headquarters. (Quartz/Zheping Huang)\n\nWu was then in private equity, armed with a degree in economics and psychology from Peking University, China’s most august institution. Zhan, a graduate of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, famed for its technical degrees, was trying to raise funding for DivaIP, so he asked Wu for advice. Ultimately Wu couldn’t help, but three years later it would be Wu who needed Zhan.\n\nWu had discovered bitcoin in 2011 in a blog post, and one line stuck in his head. “They described it as the most dangerous open-source project ever,” he says. Bitcoin was envisioned as a form of stateless money that could be owned by anyone but controlled by no one—with no central bank, and no government in charge. “Such a monetary system is possible. It doesn’t have to be government-backed. It doesn’t even have to be gold-backed,” he says.\n\nIn short order, Wu emptied his bank account to buy bitcoin, then just a fringe idea. One bitcoin could be purchased for under a dollar in early 2011. “I spent all my life savings to buy bitcoin in 2011,” he said. “Most people thought it was risky or a scam.” Two years later, bitcoin exploded, soaring from about $20 at the start of 2013 to $900 by the end of the year and, in the process, it captured mainstream attention. Wu realized that he could make money not just by trading bitcoin, but by creating it. At the time, a miner could earn 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes.\n\nWu had capital from his 2011 bitcoin investments. But he needed a chip designer. Remembering Zhan, Wu set out everything he understood about bitcoin in an e-mail to him. “I spent two hours reading up on bitcoin on Wikipedia,” Zhan said. “I knew it was a good thing. I decided to do this business immediately.”\n\nBespoke silicon for bitcoin\n\nZhan’s first task was designing an ASIC that would run SHA-256, the cryptographic calculation used in bitcoin, at maximum efficiency. The development of bitcoin mining ASICs escalated the race to devote greater amounts of processing power to bitcoin mining.\n\nWhere bitcoins are unearthed. (Aurelien Foucault for Quartz)\n\n“In the beginning it was very tough for Micree [Zhan],” Wu says. “He complained it was impossible,” to create an ASIC for bitcoin. But Zhan, 38, got the job done, and at record speed, taking just six months from idea to finished product. Time was critical, because bitcoin prices fluctuated wildly, meaning Bitmain could miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime chance to profit from the ongoing rally. Other players were already on the scene; early ASIC makers like ASICMiner and Butterfly Labs crowdfunded their projects in 2012 to create the first generation of bitcoin ASICs.\n\nIn November 2013, Zhan’s first mining rig, the Antminer S1, was ready, and Bitmain opened for business. Sales took off. “We had very good sales during the whole of 2014,” Wu says. Indeed, bitcoin hit a historic high of nearly $1,200 in November 2013—only to crash months later after fraud was discovered at Japan’s Mt. Gox, then the largest exchange in the world.\n\nBy the end of 2014, the Mt. Gox-spurred crash put Bitmain in dire straits. Nobody wanted to be paying expensive electricity bills to mine a digital currency that was falling in value. “The price fell too low, and the whole business plan was made when the bitcoin price was high!” Wu laughs. “So when the price fell there was not much demand for our bitcoin mining rigs. Our toughest time was at the end of 2014.”\n\nSurviving the bitcoin crash\n\nWu and Zhan clung on. “It was very tough,” says Zhan. “I thought if the price continues to drop maybe Bitmain will break down.” But by 2015, the cryptocurrency appeared to have bottomed out. There was increasing interest in the technical idea behind it—the immutable ledger known as the blockchain—from some of the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions.\n\nAt the same time, Zhan began working on the Antminer S5, the fifth iteration of Bitmain’s mining rig, which slashed power consumption by about a third compared to the S1. As bitcoin’s price crept up, miners returned to the scene, seizing on the Antminer S5 as their equipment of choice. “That chip was amazing,” says Wu. “It helped our company a lot.” Bitmain had a 50% profit margin on the product, according to Zhan.\n\nThe Antminer S5, which contained the BM1384 chip, turned around Bitmain’s fortunes. Wu won’t disclose the company’s revenue and earnings, except to say that it is in “a very good financial position.” He claims it is cash-flow positive, and that it has over 70% of the market for bitcoin mining rigs—effectively providing 70% of all the processing power on the network.\n\nThe firm sells hundreds of thousands of Antminers each year, according to Wang Jun, who leads work on the algorithms in Bitmain’s new deep-learning chips, and the bitcoin mining rigs are the firm’s major source of income. Wu told Bloomberg (video) that the mine in Ordos generates about $250,000 in revenue daily, and that he is planning to invest up to $200 million building new mines in the US.\n\nBitmain has few competitors for the Antminer. Because chip manufacturers must depend on a rising bitcoin price to sell their wares, many were unable to stay afloat when prices dropped in 2014 and 2015. Today, Bitmain’s chief competitor is San Francisco-headquartered Bitfury, which makes its own chips, sells them, and maintains mines in Georgia, in eastern Europe. It has about 6% of the global bitcoin hash rate.\n\nBitmain now employs 600 people headquartered in a four-story building in a high-tech park of the sort favored by tech companies in Beijing. It’s renovating the building next door because it’s running out of space. Inside, barely anyone looks older than 25, as circuit boards jostle for space with company-provided cans of Coke and other soft drinks. The majority of employees don’t have a personal interest in bitcoin, says Nishant Sharma, Bitmain’s communications manager, doing their jobs without being invested in the debates, squabbles, and philosophizing of the cryptocurrency world.\n\nASIC clouds: The future of deep learning?\n\nAs the price of bitcoin skyrockets, Bitmain’s future in the cryptocurrency markets seems assured. But in the artificial intelligence race, it’s a minnow in a field dominated by giants. Why should a Beijing bitcoin startup be able to compete with Google, Nvidia, and AMD?\n\nRacks of Bitcoin mining machines inside Bitmain’s Ordos mine. (Aurelien Foucault for Quartz)\n\nWang Jun, who heads the AI program under Zhan, has spent two years working on Bitmain’s deep learning chip. The idea is to etch in silicon some of the most common deep learning algorithms, thus greatly boosting efficiency. Users will be able to apply their own datasets and build their own models on these ASICs, allowing the resulting neural networks to generate results and learn from those results at a far quicker pace. This is a technique that Google’s DeepMind unit, based in London, used to train its AlphaGo artificial intelligence, using its own Tensor Processing Unit chips.\n\nBitmain plans to sell these chips to any corporation that wants to train its own neural nets—which means a vast swathe of the economy. Wang says tech firms like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are among his target customers. Bitmain may eventually build its own data centers containing thousands of deep learning rigs and rent out that computation power to clients, just as it does with its bitcoin mines.\n\nWang, a veteran of Baidu and Google, argues that Bitmain has an edge in the deep-learning race because its mining technology evolved from individuals using desktop computers, to graphics cards, to custom silicon. The deep learning industry is simply going through the same evolution that bitcoin miners already experienced. So what’s next? “ASICs,” Wang says. “In the bitcoin ASIC area, who’s the best in the world? Bitmain.”\n\nA nimble, highly focused, effort could take on the best efforts from the field’s giants, says Taylor, the professor. Bitcoin mining, with its focus on razor-thin margins and cost calculations, could have spawned a formidable competitor to the Googles and Nvidias of the world. “The companies that excelled in bitcoin mining have developed the skills to survive in an ultra-competitive, highly commoditized industry; have superior system-level design expertise and know how to keep data center costs down,” Taylor says. “The victors in the bitcoin [chip] design competition handily defeated US-based efforts.”\n\nMoney is just a story we tell each other\n\nZhan may have solved the problem of naming Bitmain’s deep learning ASIC, but he still has plenty on his mind. He’s months away from launching Sophon, which is due on the market before year’s end. Even after surviving the bitcoin crash of 2014, he says he still feels beset by crises and business challenges.\n\nHe turns to philosophy for guidance. Around the same time he read The Three-Body Problem, he read Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, by Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari. In it, Harari argues that storytelling is the human attribute that allows groups, society, and civilization to form. “If we believe in the same story we can work together,” Zhan says.\n\nI ask Zhan if he remembers that Harari argues that money is among the most powerful stories humans have told each other for centuries.\n\n“Yes—money, countries, democracy, even companies—all of these things are just virtual,” Zhan says. “After reading that book, I thought, yes, he is right. It impressed me so much. It’s a very good book.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said Micree Zhan graduated from Tsinghua; he completed work on his thesis at Tsinghua, but graduated from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nRead this next: Take a 360 walk around one of the world’s biggest bitcoin mines\n\nRead this next: The lives of bitcoin miners digging for digital gold in Inner Mongolia.', '', 'By Parke Shall\n\nThe time for gold and Bitcoin is right now, despite both of these ""safe haven"" assets already moving to recent highs over the last couple of weeks. We believe both assets will continue to move higher and that this is the time to have exposure to both of them.\n\n\n\nThe market experienced more jitters this week, just days after we wrote an article suggesting that it could be on a hairpin trigger to the downside. Volatility continued this week, first on a rumor that Gary Cohn was resigning. Even though this rumor was proven to be false, according to official statements released by the White House, the market was unable to bid back all of the ground it had lost when the rumor first hit. This inability to take back the ground it had lost after the rumor was proven to be false shows us that the market may have a little more of a bias to the downside at this point.\n\n\n\nAlso, on Friday, it was announced that Steve Bannon had either resigned from the White House or was fired by President Trump, depending on what news article you read. Regardless, this was seen as a positive for the market when the news was announced, but the market wound up giving back all of these gains as well late in the day on Friday.\n\nNot only do we believe that this sequence of events shows that the market is cautious, but we also don\'t believe that the volatility is over. The fact that the market has moved lower in situations where ""bad"" rumors were refuted or ""good news"" hit the tape may indicate that overall sentiment is changing from bullish to somewhat less bullish, or perhaps even neutral or bearish.\n\n\n\nJust hours before the Cohn rumor made its way onto the wires, a strategist on CNBC had predicted that his resignation or removal could cost the market. The report stated,\n\nThe markets would crash if top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn resigns, Yale School of Management\'s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld told CNBC on Thursday. ""I don\'t want to be an alarmist, but there is a lot of faith that he is going to help carry through the tax reform that people are looking for,"" Sonnenfeld said on ""Squawk Box."" ""I think if he steps away, it would crash the markets,"" he said.\n\nThe market seemed to agree with the way that it reacted to the rumor late last week. However it doesn\'t appear as though the market is completely convinced that this isn\'t a possibility based on its reaction to the official White House response. And we also don\'t think assuming that any member of the Trump cabinet is locked into their jobs right now is a safe assumption. When we look back on the amount of individuals that have come and gone in just the first half year of this presidency, we don\'t think it is ridiculous to assume that additional departures could happen, especially when articles like this one from Newsweek are being tossed around talking about how the Senate only needs six votes to impeach the president:\n\nFollowing impeachment in the House, a trial takes place in the Senate. Conviction requires two-thirds of the Senate and by my count there are already twelve senators who have shown a willingness to take on the president when they believe he is in the wrong. If you add that to the forty-eight Democrats in the Senate (who have shown no inclination to work with this President), Donald Trump could be six votes away from conviction in the Senate.\n\nRegardless of whether not you would see this as a good or a bad thing, if it occurred, volatility would likely go through the roof. The markets like stability and predictability and throwing this type of wrench into the gears has not only already slowed down the bull market here of late, but also seems to be possibly shifting overall sentiment.\n\n\n\nWe have a long argued that we are on the back end of this bull market. Every time we bring up problems like student debt, subprime auto loans or consumer credit, the market somehow finds a way to grind higher. We think the geopolitical and domestic political situation has changed things in a profound way. We are not only dealing with uncertainty with our own administration; we also continue to deal with issues like North Korea and a newly revitalized potential trade war with China, as documented by USA Today on Friday:\n\nChina’s government on Thursday warned “there is no winner in a trade war” after an aide to President Donald Trump called in published comments for a tougher stance toward Beijing. A foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, appealed for dialogue to preserve stable relations when asked about the comments by Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon. In comments to The American Prospect posted online, Bannon said the United States is in an “economic war” with China. He recommended pursuing a trade investigation of Beijing’s technology policies and anti-dumping action over Chinese exports of steel and aluminum.\n\nWe continue to believe that this new potential volatility profile for the markets means that investors should increase their exposure to asset classes that may be considered safe havens in the event of increased volatility. We are continuing to reduce our exposure to equities and bonds while at the same time increasing our exposure to emerging markets, international currencies, precious metals, and we even have a small allocation to Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWe have been spot on with Bitcoin, calling it a buy the entire way up to where it stands now. We also have advocated for owning gold in many of our past articles, a position that has borne less fruit then Bitcoin, but which certainly has still panned out.\n\n\n\nOur thinking on owning both Bitcoin and gold as safe havens is as follows. Gold is the traditional tangible safe haven. It is a physical asset that investors can own and actually hold on to in times of volatility and crisis. As the dollar\'s purchasing power continues to weaken over the course of time, gold will continue to catch a bid over the course of the longer term. However, we believe gold may also find a bid on its own as volatility ramps up. We can easily see gold going to $2000 an ounce within the next couple of years especially if global uncertainty begins to creep higher. We already believe that it will catch a bid just due to the natural course of the economic cycle putting the United States back into recession eventually as well.\n\n\n\nFor Bitcoin, the reason to own it is similar to that for gold in the sense that there is only a limited supply and that it is a hedge globally against all currencies and the central banking system. While gold is somewhat of a pain to store and transact in person, Bitcoin fills in that gap, making peer to peer transactions that are decentralized extremely easy and available to its owners. However, in the event of any type of catastrophe where infrastructure is compromised, Bitcoin could then see itself become unavailable to its owners, as it requires access to the web to transact.\n\nWe think that the benefits and cons of both of these old-school and new-school hedges against the system make for a nice yin and yang combination and we would be inclined to own both gold, as an old-school hedge and Bitcoin as a new-school hedge heading into the future. We believe both will continue to appreciate meaningfully in price over the course of the longer term.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GOLD, GDX, BITCOIN, GBTC.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

08/21/2017,"['Since 2012, Bitcoin price has demonstrated an exponential increase in value amidst a rapid rise in global adoption, growing demand from institutional investors, and significant maturation of international markets.\n\nA well-performing asset\n\nA well-known cryptocurrency researcher known as “Jack Sparrow” recently released his findings on how long it took Bitcoin to reach certain price benchmarks.\n\nAs can be seen from the table above, Bitcoin started at nearly $0 and rallied the $2,000 level in a matter of 1,789 days, which is the equivalent of seven years.\n\nHowever, the same level of increases, from $2,000 to $4,000, only took 85 days.\n\nOptimism from the large institutions\n\nWhile Bitcoin was marginalized and more-than-often associated with black markets and illegal trade, it entered a new era in 2017 that saw many of the largest multi-billion dollar financial institutions including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Fidelity Investments express their optimism towards the king of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIndeed, Goldman Sachs has encouraged its portfolio managers to invest in Bitcoin, and Fidelity has been exploring cryptocurrencies through mining equipment.\n\nThe $140 bln market is now too big to be ignored by these large institutions.\n\nStill considered a bubble\n\nOn the other hand, the historic run for cryptocurrency has prompted observers both in the tech world and Wall Street to talk about the cryptocurrency being a ""bubble."" Its abrupt increase in price may have exceeded its intrinsic value, as in the view of traditional investor Peter Schiff.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has been able to demonstrate an exponential increase in value by being the most accepted cryptocurrency and by creating global acceptance as a safe asset and long-term investment.\n\nExtensive media coverage\n\nThis confidence has led mainstream media such as Bloomberg and CNBC to cover Bitcoin extensively.\n\nDuring its extraordinary rally, the currency also established an international user base and significantly improved its global adoption.\n\nKay Van-Petersen, Saxo Bank analyst, believes:\n\n“This is not a fad, cryptocurrencies are here to stay. There will emerge two to three main ones. Bitcoin will be one of those. And the reason is the first-mover advantage, the scale and the pioneering.”\n\nBitcoin may only just be having its greatest increase yet.', 'The price of bitcoin is back below $4,000.\n\nFollowing a period of record highs, average prices across global exchanges declined at the start of trading on August 22, having already dipped more than $150 already from the day\'s open. At press time, bitcoin was trading at $3,894, its lowest total observed since April 15, when the price hit a low of $3,892.\n\nHowever, despite the continued show of strength from the market, some traders indicated a belief that bitcoin\'s rally – which has catapulted the digital asset to 350 percent gains this year – might be reaching its peak.\n\nBTC VIX, organizer of the cryptocurrency trading group Whale Club, remarked that he is losing confidence in the rally. In particular, he cited the fact that bitcoin prices have dipped below $4,000 four times since first surpassing the milestone, a sign he thinks the market isn\'t keen to push the price higher in the short term.\n\n""The bulls are tired,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nElsewhere, market observers predicted that bitcoin might stabilize around the $4,000 mark.\n\nSuch a view was put forth by Mike Kayamori, CEO of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Quoine, who saw the dip below $4,000 as a sign of consolidation, if not a cause for alarm.\n\nLike many analysts, he appears to believe bitcoin is likely to trade in range ahead of possible changes to its underlying technology, though these won\'t come for some time.\n\n""[The market] could go lower, but the next big date will be the Segwit2x in November,"" he concluded.\n\nBarometer image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Blockchain was one of the technologies which I predicted back in January to break through in 2017.\n\nThe distributed, consensus-dependent ledger technology is really just a new form of database – but due to its trustless and encrypted nature, one which could potentially revolutionize many aspects of finance and business.\n\nVirtual currency Bitcoin is undoubtedly the most visible implementation of the technology right now – its rapid growth in value has made it attractive to speculative investors but businesses are increasingly accepting it for goods and services.\n\nRecent developments in the bitcoin economy – an economy currently valued at close to $70 billion – have demonstrated some of the fundamental characteristics of blockchain-based applications. And although it is still early days, they appear to go some way towards validating the claims of blockchain evangelists that the platform represents a robust and truly decentralized medium for logging data transactions.\n\n(For those who are completely new to this, my Complete Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin provides an overview of the important ideas)\n\nBlockchain split – what is it all about?\n\nBlockchain apps and Blockchain-based currency such as Bitcoin in their purest form are decentralized and governed by consensus – there is no controlling authority (such as a bank or government) which can interfere with supply or disrupt Bitcoin-driven commerce (except, in the case of governments, by legislating).\n\nOne way to think of it is that Bitcoin is entirely deterministic – it is governed by mathematics and encryption and adjudicated by the consensus of its users. These “rules” were put into place when the cryptocurrency was unleashed on the world in 2011. Crucially, however, built into the model is the ability for it to adapt and evolve to changing circumstances.\n\nOne such changing circumstance is the vast increase in the amount of users, and therefore the amount of transactions being written to the blockchain itself. Transactions are approved by “miners” – individuals and groups providing the processing grunt to cryptographical algorithms which securely record the movement of coins between wallets.\n\nInevitably this led to a slowdown – with increasing numbers of transactions being written, transactions had begun to take longer to be recorded (sometimes days) and the fees – fractional values of Bitcoin which are shaved off transactions and passed to miners as “payment” for their processing services – creeping up.\n\nBasically, because what happened next is a great example of why blockchain-based applications are so revolutionary. Because the software used to operate Bitcoin wallets and nodes is open source, anyone can “fork” it – producing a parallel blockchain operating independently of the original. This is what happened at the start of this month, bringing into existence a new version of the currency known as “Bitcoin Cash” (with the original increasingly being referred to as Bitcoin Core to avoid confusion.)\n\nWhether the new currency – allowing larger size blocks of data to be written to the new chain, therefore speeding up transactions – goes on to enjoy the success of its older brother will depend entirely on consensus – how well-used it becomes. This means the whole issue of the split is resolved in a democratic process. Of course, unlike with, say, elections, no human counting, verification or oversight is necessary (or possible) – meaning there can be no corruption. The entire process is managed and governed by the original “trustless” cryptographical framework created for Bitcoin.', 'The publicly traded bitcoin miner BTCS is moving toward a new merger, public records reveal.\n\nNew filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that BTCS has signed a non-binding letter of intent with Blockchain Global Limited. Blockchain Global, according to the filings, operates a bitcoin mine out of China and also runs an Australian bitcoin exchange called AXC.io.\n\nThe firm also invests in other companies in the bitcoin and blockchain space, perhaps most notably the publicly-traded DigitalX. Earlier this year, Blockchain Global notably invested in DigitalX through a convertible loan denominated in bitcoin.\n\nThe merger effort is the second for BTCS, which moved to merge with bitcoin miner Spondoolies-Tech back in 2015. Yet despite being cleared by a key regulator in Israel, where Spondoolies was based, the deal ultimately fell apart after an Israeli court dissolved the firm amid financial problems.\n\nIt also comes as BTCS looks to shore up its financial position, having raised $1 million earlier this year in a bid to stem the tide of losses. Issues aside, representatives for both BTCS and Blockchain Global struck positive notes in statements announcing the deal.\n\n""The blockchain space continues to suffer from a talent void. Together with BCG, and their track record of success, we’re positioning ourselves to fill this talent void, ultimately capitalizing on the immense opportunity in blockchain technologies and leveraging our early-mover advantage,"" Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, said of the planned merger.\n\nPuzzle piece image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

How high? Pantera Capital Management’s Paul Veradittakit, Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors and John Spallanzani at GFI Group Inc. see it going to $6,000 by year-end, while Ronnie Moas at Standpoint Research says it will keep rising to $7,500 in 2018.\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear this year, more than tripling in value as it crossed the $4,000 mark and touched a record $4,477 last week. It’s since retreated about 7 percent from the high as investors took profit and assessed whether the rally had gone too far. Growing adoption and institutional investor interest, agreement on a mechanism to speed up transactions and regulatory steps that will help the asset broaden its reach are some of the reasons that explain the gains.\n\n“We’re in a very healthy position right now,” said Veradittakit, vice president of Pantera Capital, which has invested in bitcoin since 2014. “There’s a lot of interest from traders and mainstream finance on the rise of all these new crytpo currencies, but when they first get exposure into the space, they’ll go into bitcoin. It has the most liquidity and biggest brand name.”\n\nVeradittakit said bitcoin will hover around current levels and rally further once the underlying technology is upgraded in November, when the block size in the bitcoin blockchain is set to double to two megabytes, increasing transaction speed. He’s also encouraged by reports from the local exchanges Pantera invests in that cross-border transactions are increasing.\n\nRead more about the bitcoin development dispute\n\nBut the road ahead might get rocky. Goldman Sachs technical analyst Sheba Jafari wrote in a note to clients Aug. 13 that bitcoin could erase around 40 percent of its value after reaching $4,827. On a separate note, Goldman Sachs analysts said the space is getting big enough at over $100 billion in market capitalization that it warrants watching.\n\nSpallanzani, chief macro strategist at GFI Group, also predicts a sizeable fall to as low as $3,000 unless it manages to break the $4,500 level it tested last week. But then it should rebound and climb to as high as $10,000 in 2018, he said.\n\n“It will have to retrace a bit more before we have enough power to break through,” Spallanzani said. He recommends buying bitcoin when it’s above $3,800 and selling when its below that level.\n\nNot everyone is so bullish. Roy Sebag, who said he first invested in bitcoin in 2011, said he sold most of his 17,000 bitcoin between May and June because he believes the long-term value will be zero.\n\n“It’s completely devolved from the original promise,” said Sebag, founder and chief executive officer of Goldmoney Inc., which oversees about $2 billion of assets. “Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are exhibiting a mania, fueled by speculative fervor.”\n\nAmid the frenzy, some analysts have steered clear of making price predictions, while still dipping their toes in bitcoin waters.\n\nRead more on how to get exposure to bitcoin without owning it\n\nTom Price, a Morgan Stanley equity strategist, said bitcoin compares to gold in that both offer similar benefits as a store of value, such as being fungible, durable, portable, divisible and scarce. Still, a lot of time and trust-building will be needed before it becomes clear whether bitcoin will also undermine demand for the metal, he said.\n\nCryptocurrencies including bitcoin are still very volatile and thus not particularly safe, but that could change as their value rises and liquidity increases, wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists Martin Mauro, Cheryl Rowan and Matthew Trapp earlier this month. They score well when it comes to diversification, as their correlation to equities, bonds, commodities, currencies or selected measures of risk is near zero, the strategists said.\n\nMore longer term, bitcoin will climb to $25,000 by 2022, Fundstrat’s Lee said, as recent regulatory approval for options trading and settlement implies a “significant rise in institutional holdings” of bitcoin, while he estimates user accounts are likely to rise 50 percent and usage per account to climb 30 percent.\n\nMoas of Standpoint Research said in an Aug. 14 report that bitcoin could rise to $50,000 by 2027 as he expects cryptocurrency users will grow to as high as 100 million users from 10 million today in the next couple of years.\n\n“It looks to me as though we are at the same point in the adoption curve as we were in 1995” with the Internet, Moas wrote. “Cryptocurrency is becoming more widely accepted by the day.”', 'Bitcoin broke into public consciousness during the early part of the decade. Now that bitcoin is trading at more than $4,000, it can be hard to imagine why it\'s not getting more attention.\n\nWhile bitcoin has been the talk of the town of late, adoption of cryptocurrencies and crypto services are still limited. We have yet to see ordinary consumers use bitcoin to pay for day-to-day transactions over cash and cards. In addition, banks and bitcoin still appear to be at odds with each other.\n\nFinancial institutions have not been oblivious to blockchain, the technology that powers bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. Financial organizations appear best fit to use blockchain for the speedy and immutable distributed ledger technology that it is. The financial services industry has essentially acknowledged the technology\'s capabilities by embarking on its own blockchain projects. An IBM study revealed that 33 percent of organizations are actively exploring blockchain. Recently, IBM was also reported to be working with seven of Europe\'s biggest banks to develop blockchain technology.\n\nBitcoin appears to be a different. Financial institutions have approached bitcoin with a lot more caution, citing volatility and regulation as main roadblocks for bitcoin acceptance. However, it\'s the acceptance of these financial institutions that should give bitcoin the legitimacy it needs. Bitcoin is crypto\'s poster child. Acceptance by traditional institutions would encourage average consumers to take bitcoin and crypto services seriously and eventually use these products and services.\n\nDespite its meteoric rise this year, bitcoin continues to be volatile. Its price is less stable compared to other assets like fiat currencies and precious metals. Bitcoin\'s volatility is measured at 4.6 percent at the time of writing. Major fiat currencies have a volatility of below 1 percent. In addition, most governments have yet to issue regulations regarding its use for financial transactions. Banking and finance are highly regulated sectors and without the rules, banks have little choice but to hedge on supporting bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Only a select number of banks, such as digital bank WB21 and Swiss boutique bank Falcon Private Bank, allow depositors to buy and hold bitcoin.\n\nAccording to George Basiladze, the CEO of Bitcoin wallet Cryptopay, ""Without a clear regulatory framework many investors and businesses are still nervous to be associated or involved with crypto related activities. But as the ecosystem grows, so will the options to increase consumer adoption.""\x9d\n\nIn contrast, bitcoin has gained adoption in tech and ecommerce particularly as a payment method. Companies such as WordPress, Microsoft, and Intuit have accepted bitcoin for purchases and subscriptions. Support is there within the tech community. Fortunately for crypto services, Japan\'s move to declare it as legal payment method also accelerated its use beyond digital and to be used for brick and mortar retail.\n\nDespite these developments, traditional institutions have a large role in truly bringing bitcoin and crypto-related activities to the mainstream. Banks are and will continue to be integral parts of the financial ecosystem. What crypto needs is to find a spot within this system. Bitcoin isn\'t a threat to banks. Rather, a report by Citi commented that bitcoin services are a potential complement to existing services.\n\nUK-based Cryptopay – currently running an ICO – has made strides in making the bitcoin experience more in line with the average consumer\'s lifestyle. Aside from offering hosted wallet and trading services for bitcoin, Cryptopay offers a debit card that allows its users to draw from their bitcoin wallets. By providing a ""\x9dlegacy""\x9d mechanism through the physical card, it is involving merchants in bitcoin without forcing them to adopt new services to process payments. As such, the experience could be a good fit for existing ecosystem involving card companies, merchants, and their banks.\n\n""Finding the right banking relationship no matter the industry has always been a challenge. When looking at the emerging blockchain ecosystem, you see a lot of banks, including financial services businesses, taking a much more risk-adverse approach. On one hand, the banks have very high overheads and processes to adhere to, which make it difficult for startups and SMEs to secure banking partnerships. With that said though, we are beginning to witness banks beginning to open up to banking crypto business and providing services,"" said Basiladze.\n\nPartnerships are also happening in other markets. Falcon Private Bank\'s bitcoin service is powered by Bitcoin Suisse to even expand its support for other cryptocurrencies including ether, litecoin, and bitcoin cash. San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Coinbase has been partners with Japan\'s BTMU since 2014, which allowed Coinbase to secure a foothold in Japan just as the market became favorable to bitcoin. African banks have also found positive alliances with blockchain services beyond cryptocurrency. For instance, Barclays worked with Consent to use blockchain for know-your-customer (KYC) and identity verification.\n\nSuch partnerships could improve the public\'s perception of bitcoin and blockchain services. Even if banks continue to hedge on embracing bitcoin as a supported currency due to regulatory limitations, collaborating with these new ventures would lend crypto services the credibility it needs for wider adoption. Still, bitcoin\'s acceptance would truly be the major catalyst for crypto activities to become norm.\n\nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?', 'Mining\n\nThis week Bloomberg published a video of a reporter, Tom Mackenzie, getting a tour of one of the largest bitcoin mines in the world operated by Bitmain Technologies in a remote region in Mongolia.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Could Tap into $40 Trillion Japanese FX Margin Trading Market This Year\n\nA Glimpse Inside Bitmain’s Mongolian Data Center\n\nBitcoin mining is a very competitive industry and China’s biggest data centers are leading the way. Most mining centers around the world keep operations private and are usually found in very remote regions. Reporters were allowed to record and photograph the Bitmain mine in the SanShangLiang industrial park located in the heart of Inner Mongolia. Both Bloomberg journalist Tom Mackenzie and Quartz photographer Aurelien Foucault were granted access to Bitmain’s mine filled with 25,000 machines humming away processing millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.\n\nThis particular Bitmain mine employs about fifty people and generates about a quarter of a million dollars a day worth of bitcoin. Most of the employees are local residents of the region called, Ordos, which used to be a coal mining town located just outside the Yellow River of Hukou Falls. Most of the staff live in a dormitory located in one of the warehouses, because machines are operating 24-7 and need constant monitoring and maintenance. Further, as well as mining bitcoin, one of the warehouses at Bitmain’s site is filled with mining rigs dedicated solely to mining litecoin. According to Bitmain, the mine spends about $39,000 daily on electrical costs and mining revenue brings in roughly $250,000 worth of bitcoins a day.\n\nWhile walking around the Bitmain warehouse, Mackenzie says many of the fresh new bitcoins derived from the mine ends up being traded on one of China’s cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitmain tells Bloomberg it has over 20,000 customers. The company’s valuation is in the billions and the company is preparing for a possible IPO. The company explains it’s also spending over 200 million to expand operations in the U.S. Creating a mine in China is relatively inexpensive Bitmain’s CEO Jihan Wu tells Mackenzie.\n\n“In China, the cost to build a mining farm is very low, so when people make the decision to build a farm they can do so very fast, and at a very low cost,” explains Jihan Wu.\n\nFurther, the cost of electricity is far cheaper in China than any other nation, making bitcoin mines in the region very profitable. In the city of Ordos, many of the residents refer to it as “Ghost City, ” and the area has been well-known for many government projects located in the region. Jihan Wu seemed excited about the U.S. expansion and believes setting up shop overseas may be lucrative in the future. The Bitmain founder is very optimistic on where the price of bitcoin is headed and tells Mackenzie where he sees the value in a few years stating;\n\nBitcoin’s price will go up to $100,000 in about five years\n\nWhat do you think about Bitmain’s bitcoin mines? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImage sources: Shutterstock, the Beijing-based photographer Aurelien Foucault, Quartz, and Bitmain Technologies.', 'Sensitive matters, such as the popularity of ICOs, as well as the recent Bitcoin split, appear to have influenced the decision-making process of Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA).\n\nThe split of Bitcoin into Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash earlier this month did not lead to any catastrophic consequences for the cryptocurrency world, as most businesses have gradually adapted to the new situation. However, the fork seems to have influenced the decision-making process of Japanese regulators.\n\nAccording to a report by the Japan Times, the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow but companies seeking to obtain licenses from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) are faced with long waiting periods. Mike Kayamori, head of Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Quoine, said his company had filed its application for registration but the assessment process seemed to be taking longer than expected.\n\nMr Kayamori blamed the delay on recent developments, including bitcoin’s split in early August.\n\nGiven the split, the FSA is probably cautious about approving exchange operators, Mr Kayamori was quoted as having said. Another factor weighing on the FSA decision-making is the recent boom in initial coin offerings (ICOs), which most likely represents another sensitive issue to the FSA, he said.\n\nOverall, the latest legislative changes affecting the cryptocurrency segment in Japan are seen as a positive factor for the adoption of Bitcoin and its likes and the launch of businesses in this sector. And yet, there are some hurdles for the wide Bitcoin adoption. According to the report, these include the increased transaction fees and slower processing of cryptocurrency transactions due to higher trading volumes.\n\nAustralia is now on its way to adopt a law that will require the registration of digital currency exchange operators with AUSTRAC. The bill, moved by Australia’s justice minister Michael Keenan, proposes changes to the current AML/CTF law by modernizing it to take into account digital currencies like Bitcoin. Businesses that trade digital currencies for money, and vice versa, will also be required to implement AML/CTF programs, and to report threshold transactions and suspicious matters to AUSTRAC. The maximum penalty for failing to comply with registration requirements is 7 years of imprisonment and/or a fine of 2,000 penalty units.', 'Although the premium is very high there are reasons that GBTC might be a logical investment for a set of investors.\n\nThe current premium of GBTC over Bitcoin is even higher right now at about 85%.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust has indicated that the normal premium over investing directly in Bitcoin is 42%.\n\nI\'ve written three articles about the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX:GBTC)\n\nAs a result, I\'ve been asked several times why anyone would invest in GBTC. In case you didn\'t know, the average premium over buying Bitcoin directly versus buying GBTC has been about 42%. And the premium right now?\n\nWell, let\'s do the math:\n\nFor every share of GBTC you get 0.09258535 Bitcoin. One share of GBTC today would cost you $703.50 The market value of 0.09258535 Bitcoin is $380.90 today Therefore, the premium is about 84-85% above the underlying Bitcoin\n\nObviously this will fluctuate over time as Bitcoin rises and falls but also because GBTC doesn\'t perfectly track with the Bitcoin it holds. In fact, that appears to be the insanity.\n\nWhy would anyone pay an 85% premium over Bitcoin? You can just buy Bitcoin directly by joining Coinbase (COIN) for example.\n\nAgain, you are reading all of this correctly.\n\nYou can buy Bitcoin directly if you want to own Bitcoin. There\'s no requirement that you have to invest in GBTC in order to enjoy the surge in Bitcoin.\n\nAs I\'ve already explained, the average premium according Grayscale is 42% but right now it\'s about 85% over Bitcoin.\n\nDoes It Ever Make Sense to Invest in GBTC?\n\nThe answer is ""Yes!"" it can definitely make sense. I will explain that now.\n\nFirst, I\'ll give you five quick reasons that Grayscale provides:\n\nTitled, auditable ownership through a traditional investment vehicle - The Bitcoin Investment Trust is a traditional investment vehicle with shares titled in the investors name, providing a familiar structure for financial and tax advisors and easy transferability to beneficiaries under estate laws. Eligible for tax-advantaged accounts - Shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust are eligible to be held in certain IRA, Roth IRA, and other brokerage and investor accounts. Publicly Quoted - Shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust are eligible to be held in certain IRA, Roth IRA, and other brokerage and investor accounts. Supported by a network of trusted service providers - Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP serves as legal counsel to the Sponsor of the Bitcoin Investment Trust. Financial statements for the Bitcoin Investment Trust are audited annually by Friedman LLP. Robust security and storage - The Bitcoin Investment Trust’s assets are stored with Xapo, Inc., as Custodian, in deep cold storage vaults. Bitcoin stored in the Xapo Vaults reside on multisignature addresses, the private keys for which are protected by intense cryptographic, physical and process security.\n\nBoiling all this down the main reason is that investing in GBTC is investing in something that feels familiar. That also means you can buy it easily through the normal channels and you can put it in the normal places. It takes away the fear, uncertainty and doubt of Bitcoin very rapidly. It seems less mysterious, less dirty. And yet? You still get to play the Bitcoin ""investing"" game.\n\nI am not saying this is bad, or inappropriate, or silly. In fact, quite the opposite. If someone is trying to ride the Bitcoin trend, I can see how it could make sense to go with a low-resistance option. In this case, consider how much easier it would be to talk to your accountant about gains and losses of GBTC vs. Bitcoin. Although I have no interest in GBTC it wouldn\'t be completely illogical or irrational for some people to invest for this reason.\n\nWhat About the ""Insane Premium"" Right Now?\n\nThe GBTC premium is rich. The average is over 40% and right now the premium is over 80%. That\'s not a theoretical premium but instead a very real premium of GBTC over Bitcoin.\n\nAre there other reasons that make sense? One possible answer is that the premium would be washed away over time, much like a growth stock can overcome a high P/E ratio through growth.\n\nHere\'s how Pascucci said it:\n\n""I\'ve decided to go with GBTC as a way of safely getting exposure to Bitcoin via my brokerage account, because I\'m VERY long on it, and I can easily liquidate high dollar amounts (over $10K) at any time I want. And it\'s all on the up-and-up, easily trackable for tax purposes, which I care about. My thesis is that the current premium is less important to me than the exposure because it\'s 41% (or whatever the current percentage is) of a small fraction of what the ultimate price of bitcoin will be 10 years from now. It\'s not perfect, I acknowledge that, but it strikes me as my best option, especially if I\'m viewing this as one of my high-risk, high-reward investments.""\n\nThe argument is that in 10 years, the GBTC premium will be irrelevant. Of course, this leaves out he problem of P/E compression, or the potential catastrophic failure of Bitcoin in general. But, this line of thinking is congruent with the thinking of a Bitcoin bull. This isn\'t ""blind"" investing or totally ignorant. I can respect part of this.\n\nI also suggest that you look at these three long comments from Ethereum Girl:\n\nI can summarize by saying that buying Bitcoin directly isn\'t easy or instant. There is some time and effort, there might be blood, sweat and tears. However, with GBTC it can be very fast. And to emphasize:\n\n""In a matter of a few seconds or minutes you own a Bitcoin derivative, right or wrong. You can hold it in any type of securities account (regular, Roth, IRA) with varying tax implications.""\n\nI would like to add that the premium between GBTC and Bitcoin will almost certainly collapse once easier Bitcoin investing is in place. In a word, it will collapse with competition. I don\'t know by how much, or how far. I have no crystal ball. But, GBTC is really the only game in town. Indeed, as I\'ve said before in a previous article, GBTC is the...\n\n...only publicly-quoted investment vehicle that seeks to provide passive exposure to bitcoin.\n\nConclusion: On the surface it\'s insanity due to the enormous premium of GBTC to Bitcoin. However there are real, true, logical reasons to invest. Every investor is different. Every investor has different goals. Every investor has a different risk tolerance and risk profile. Although I have absolutely no plans to invest in GBTC, it might be right for you. If you do invest, just keep your eyes open for the risks discussed above such as GBTC\'s competition or perhaps the known risk of Bitcoin regulation, Bitcoin collapse, and so on. In other words, if when you see risks with Bitcoin, those risks often apply to GBTC as well.\n\nWrap Up: If you enjoyed this, I only ask that you click the ""Follow"" button.

And based on well-known Bitcoin address clustering techniques, it can be linked to their other Bitcoin transactions,” they noted.\n\nAdd to this the fact that many merchants additionally leak users’ PII such as name or email address to trackers, and if becomes obvious that trackers can easily link the transaction to a user’s web profile and identity.\n\nBut, until know, it was possible to believe that using mixing technique such as the aforementioned CoinJoin or other types of coin mixing would prevent the linkage of Bitcoin addresses to user’s identity. Unfortunately, that’s not true.\n\n“We show that a small amount of additional information, namely that two (or more) transactions were made by the same entity, is sufficient to undo the effect of mixing. While such auxiliary information is available to many potential entities — merchants, other counterparties such as websites that accept donations, intermediaries such as payment processors, and potentially network eavesdroppers — web trackers are in the ideal position to carry out this attack,” they pointed out.\n\nThe researchers also analyzed the Web sites of 130 online merchants that accept Bitcoin as payment, and found that:\n\n53 of the 130 leak payment information to third parties (mostly intentionally, for advertising and analytics purposes)\n\n17 of the 130 send the receiving Bitcoin address or BTC- denominated price to a third party\n\n43 of the 130 send some form of non-BTC-denominated cart price data to third parties\n\n28 of the 130 shared add-to-cart events with third parties\n\n49 of the 130 leak some form of PII to a total of 137 third parties, and 21 of those third parties also receive transaction-relevant information.\n\nHow can users protect themselves?\n\nUsing browser extensions such as uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus, or Ghostery to block trackers does not provide fullproof protection, particularly if the adversary is a network eavesdropper or the payment processor. And using improved mixing techniques, such as multi-round mixing, is only partially effective.\n\nFor now, the researchers believe that switching to using another cryptocurrency is a better option.\n\n“Unlike the Bitcoin approach of anonymity as an overlay, other cryptocurrencies bake privacy into the protocol, and promise untraceability of transactions,” they noted.\n\n“The most well known of these are Zcash, based on the Zerocash protocol, and Monero, based on the Cryptonote protocol. Zcash is more computationally expensive but comes with more rigorous security properties. Of the two, Monero has more vendor support at the time of writing, but still far less than Bitcoin or even Litecoin, and primarily on hidden-service sites merchandising illicit goods. While some anonymity weaknesses have recently been revealed in Monero, we believe that it is not susceptible to the cluster intersection attack.”']"

But that was not the case with Jeremy Gardner, a 25-year old entrepreneur from San Francisco. Today, he is one of the cryptocurrency millionaires who made their money by taking a chance investing in Bitcoin.\n\nHow did he do it?\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider, Jeremy Gardner revealed that it all started in 2013 when a friend offered him Bitcoin in exchange for cash. Since he was curious about the controversy surrounding the Silk Road marketplace, he bought Bitcoin.\n\nBefore long, Gardner realized that Bitcoin had real potential, and he converted his life savings into Bitcoin. Now, he calls himself a ""Bitcoin booster"" with almost all of his savings net worth in Bitcoin.\n\nGardner further explains:\n\n""There was this realization that I could — with just an internet connection— exchange value with anyone in the world who also has an internet connection... No longer did I have to rely on a centralized intermediary, a troll under the bridge, such as a bank or a government.""\n\nGood fortune, amplified\n\nGardner didn’t merely sit back and watch his investments grow.

His company raised $5.3 million.\n\nHe also started the Blockchain Education Network in 2014. This network is a platform where people in universities across the globe can explore the Bitcoin Blockchain with others.\n\nToday, Gardner\'s net worth continues to increase rapidly. Even so, the volatility sometimes scares him:', 'Mark Cuban wants in on the cryptocurrency boom even if it turns out he’s right that bitcoin is in a bubble.\n\nCuban is investing in 1confirmation, a fund that plans to raise $20 million to invest in blockchain-based companies, the tech billionaire said in an interview. Venture capital firm Runa Capital is among other investors, and its technical advisors include Andreessen Horowitz board partner Balaji S. Srinivasan and programming language JavaScript founder Brendan Eich.\n\n“I have always looked at blockchain as a foundation platform from which great applications can be built,” Cuban said in an Aug. 19 email response to questions. “Hopefully we can find a few.”\n\nRuna Capital principal Nick Tomaino was an early employee at digital currency exchange Coinbase Inc. and runs the cryptocurrency-focused blog The Control. They plan to differentiate 1confirmation from the slew of digital currency hedge funds that have sprung up recently by taking a page from the venture-capital play book.\n\nRather than investing in digital tokens through initial coin offerings or in the secondary market, 1confirmation plans to invest from $100,000 to $500,000 in early stage companies before their ICO, and help those companies develop their product. Once the startup is ready to issue an ICO, the fund hopes to negotiate a discounted price.\n\nIt’s a more cautious approach to the frenzy that has consumed the space this year, with startups raising hundreds of millions of dollars in days, or even minutes, with little real business applications besides a white paper and a website. Startups had raised $1.8 billion in ICOs as of last week, according to Coindesk.\n\nThe fund will focus investments in projects that help developers build decentralized applications, rather than those aimed at end users, on the belief that the sector isn’t mature enough for blockchain applications to be adopted on a mass scale.\n\nA number of funds focused on blockchain companies and their tokens have opened in the past year as bitcoin’s price more than tripled and cryptocurrencies’ market capitalization surpassed $100 billion. Polychain Capital, founded by another Coinbase alum, Blockchain Capital and Pantera Capital are some examples.\n\nCuban, who is a majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and star of startup investing theme show ‘Shark Tank,’ tweeted in June that bitcoin was in a bubble, causing the cryptocurrency to drop in price. Cuban says that’s beside the point given the developing underlying technology.\n\n1Confirmation would be Cuban’s second foray into cryptocurrencies as he also plans to invest in tokens sold by his portfolio company Unikrn. Cuban says he plans to invest on a third crypto-related project in the future, as well as potentially buying crypto currencies, which he doesn’t currently own.\n\n“It’s hard to establish any intrinsic value for bitcoin or any of the the cryptocurrencies. If everyone continues to tell their grandparents, cousins and co-workers to buy, the price can go a lot higher as there is a definable, finite amount, but if the number of buyers dry up or there are a few massive sellers we could see under $1,000 again,” Cuban said. “None of this has anything to do with the applications that can be built with blockchain. The question is whether great companies can be financed and built and I think the answer is yes.”', 'Sean Everett wasn’t sure how his bullish bet on cryptocurrency would turn out. But he definitely didn’t expect it to be over so soon.\n\nIn March, he sold all his stocks, including Apple and Amazon, and used a chunk of the proceeds to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum on a site called Coinbase. The decision made Everett, the CEO of artificial intelligence startup Prome, almost instantly richer, as the blockchain-based currencies’ value rocketed up exponentially over the next several weeks. But then, while he was out walking the dog after 10 p.m. on Wednesday, May 17, Everett got the call. It was T-Mobile, ringing him to confirm that it was switching his phone number to a different device.\n\nIt was a suspicious move that Everett had most certainly not requested. But even as he pleaded with the agent to block the switch, it was too late. Less than five minutes later, Everett’s cell service abruptly shut off, and as he rushed to his computer, he saw himself being robbed in real time. A raft of email notifications confirmed that someone had taken control of his main Gmail account, then broken into his Coinbase “wallet.” They’d gotten in with the help of his switched-over phone number: Everett’s account required him to log in with a two-factor authentication code sent by text message, as a second safeguard—and now the text had gone straight to the thief.\n\nIt took only two minutes for the attacker to clean Everett out of what was then a few thousand dollars’ worth of digital coins. From Everett’s perspective, the even more painful heist was what came next: Ethereum’s price quadrupled over the next three weeks. It had reached its all-time high of $400 just hours before I met Everett in a New York coffee shop on a humid June afternoon. Bitcoin, meanwhile, had broken $3,000 for the first time a day earlier, and Everett was pining for his missing digital coins. “I’m not only still out my money, I also didn’t get the rise in price,” he lamented.\n\nThen again, the biggest surprise for Everett—and, it would turn out, for many other Bitcoin enthusiasts—was that the theft happened on Coinbase at all. San Francisco’s Coinbase, the world’s largest exchange for trading cryptocurrency, is one of very few such companies whose own coffers have never been hacked, a distinction that carries extra weight in the realm of blockchain, where several costly breaches have made global headlines. Almost any early investor you talk to lost money in Mt. Gox, an exchange that collapsed in 2014 after hackers pillaged nearly $500 million in Bitcoin. Last summer, thieves grabbed $72 million from Hong Kong cryptoexchange Bitfinex in one fell swoop.\n\nPopularizer: Brian Armstrong founded Coinbase to make cryptocurrency accessible to the masses; he calls the online exchange “Gmail for digital currency.” Photograph by Winni Wintermeyer for Fortune\n\nBut hackers have never breached Coinbase’s own virtual fortress, and that impenetrability has earned it a reputation as the safest place to buy Bitcoin, helping it attract more than 9 million customers who store at least $3 billion in crypto\xadcurrency there, and who have traded $25 billion to date on its retail brokerage as well as its institutional exchange, GDAX. The five-year-old Coinbase just raised $100 million in new funding, valuing the company at $1.6 billion—making it the blockchain industry’s first “unicorn.” “If you look at what they are world-class at, it’s security, trust, safety … all these things that, frankly, banks are good at,” Fred Wilson, the venture capitalist and one of Coinbase’s earliest and largest backers, said at a conference in March. “They’re like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs for blockchain.”\n\nBut Coinbase’s individual customers do get burglarized—with surprising and unsettling frequency. Even Wilson himself was in for a rude awakening: While vacationing in Europe in early June, the VC woke up to the same telltale emails that Everett saw, signaling that an intruder was trying to get inside his Coinbase account. Wilson managed to lock it down before anything was stolen, but in a rare public chastising of a company in his own portfolio, he wrote in a blog post: “I am still a bit shaken up from the experience and a fair bit more paranoid from it.”\n\nSince then, Fortune has spoken with more than a dozen victims, including tech CEOs and well-known blockchain proponents, whose Coinbase accounts have been targeted and hacked in almost exactly the same fashion; still more have been attacked on other exchanges. The day after Everett’s robbery, Los Angeles entrepreneur Adam Dachis’s account was wiped out of what was then $10,000. On July 7, thieves emptied $18,000 from the Coinbase wallet of blockchain adviser Mike Costache, during the four hours he slept one night while traveling overseas. Since Christmas, there have been months when Coinbase users have been robbed as often as 30 times—a rate of one robbery every single day.\n\nIn each case, the same blindsiding realization arrives, bringing the inherent paradox of blockchain into focus. The quintessential strength that sets cryptocurrency apart from traditional money—that transactions are instant and irreversible—is also its fatal flaw. “One of [Bitcoin’s] reasons for existence is that it’s censorship-resistant,” says Tom Robinson, cofounder and chief data officer of Elliptic, a London-based blockchain intelligence firm. That means no one, not even a government or central bank, can stop a digital currency transaction from happening. And therefore the fraud protections traditional bank depositors rely on are mostly unavailable. “Any kind of charge-back and reversibility would be the antithesis of what Bitcoin was created to achieve,” says Robinson.\n\nThat’s one reason that, when criminals want to pull a heist, they’re increasingly choosing cryptocurrency over real dollars. In 2016, $28 million in losses from crimes involving virtual currency were reported to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, more than triple the 2015 total. And that figure is based heavily on voluntary reports by individual victims. It doesn’t include large-scale thefts from exchanges like the Bitfinex hack, so it likely underestimates the true damages by many orders of magnitude.\n\nIllustration by Steven Wilson\n\nCybercrime is rising at traditional financial institutions too: For example, thefts through so-called account takeovers, a crime analogous to the Coinbase hacks, rose 61% last year to $2.3 billion, according to Javelin Strategy & Research. But hacking losses are a blip relative to the trillions of dollars kept in banks. Hackers are stealing a much larger proportion of the crypto\xadcurrency pie, whose total market value is only about $135 billion. In the past 12 months, for example, criminals have absconded with 1% of Ethereum’s total market value, or $225 million, according to cybersecurity firm Chainalysis; the Bitcoin toll is estimated to be even higher.\n\nBrick and mortar bank robbers have “two problems: stealing the money and hiding the evidence,” explains Moran Cerf, a professor of business and neuroscience at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management and a former corporate hacker. “Bitcoin solves the second one for you because everyone there is anonymous.” Bitcoin diehards seem resigned to the reality of irreversible transactions—and its drawbacks. “I think of that as a feature and not a bug,” says Chris Burniske, a blockchain investor and author of forthcoming book Cryptoassets—even though his own accounts were looted in December for digital coins that would now be worth over $100,000.\n\nBut when victims watch their money up and leave into the digital wallet of a nameless stranger, it becomes more than just a problem for Coinbase: It’s a threat to the promise of Bitcoin itself. As the value of cryptocurrency soars, more investors are grappling not just with how to profit from it, but how to hold on to it at all. “Coinbase looks like a bank, talks like a bank, and takes millions of dollars in cash like a bank, but, in practice, it functions like a dimly lit underground casino,” says Cody Brown, whose account was hacked for $8,000 in the span of just 15 minutes in May. “You don’t realize that the balanced fonts, smooth blue gradients, and endless copy about trust mean absolutely nothing—until you are robbed blind.”\n\nSee also: Blockchain Mania: Why Big Business Is Racing to Build Blockchains\n\nCoinbase, for its part, won’t discuss specific cases except to say that it investigates all account takeovers. But Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s 34-year-old CEO and founder, says Brown’s and Wilson’s experiences were “helpful” in teaching the company how to improve. Its security measures already match or exceed those at banks—from using machine learning to detect dubious activity, to mandating dual-factor authentication. Yet Armstrong recognizes that Coinbase is also a juicier target: “We need to be held to a higher standard,” he tells Fortune, “because digital currency is so new and interesting and powerful that it is attractive to a lot of people out there to try to steal it.”\n\nIf Bitcoin were a religion, its equivalent of “What would Jesus do?” would be “BYOB: Be your own bank,” an unofficial slogan widely embraced in the industry. The original blockchain was launched in 2009, by the mysterious founder (or founders) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, as a utopian form of electronic cash that could change hands, as Nakamoto wrote in a legendary white paper, “without going through a financial institution.”\n\nBut that ideal also attracted a subversive element, repelling many potential adopters. That’s where Armstrong saw an opportunity to bring polish to an industry run by “hackers and crypto\xadanarchists” at the time, he says: “If this was going to go mainstream, it needed something that had a more trusted brand around it.”\n\nAn early engineer at Airbnb, Armstrong quit in 2012 to create the “Gmail for digital currency.” His strategy: making it easier and safer to store, and then buy and sell, cryptocurrency. While early Bitcoin wallet companies made people keep track of their own private keys—the secret 64-character passwords that alone provide access to one’s cryptocurrency—Coinbase’s pioneering innovation was its offer to store keys on customers’ behalf. That also came with risk, as customers wouldn’t need to know their actual key, but rather just a password, to get to their Bitcoins—and neither would a hacker. “That’s a big responsibility to take on,” the fresh-faced CEO admits. “But I also think it’s necessary to help the industry scale and make digital currency accessible to the next 100 million or billion people.”\n\nCoinbase has demonstrated a unique ability to bring the new asset class to the masses. Its base of customers, most of whom are in the U.S., has grown 50% just in the past five months, with as many as 50,000 signing up in one day; trade volume in July alone was twice as much as all last year. Coinbase, which makes money by charging transaction fees, is said to be nearing profitability, and Armstrong ranks No. 10 on this year’s Fortune 40 Under 40 list. But he is pretty clear about his company’s limits. “The average person may at a high level think of us as a digital currency bank, but we’re not a bank,” he says. Coinbase doesn’t lend money, as banks do. And critically: Coinbase, which is regulated as a money transmitter like PayPal or Western Union, isn’t covered by the FDIC or bound by all the consumer protection laws that govern banks.\n\nUntouchable: A digital-coin vault maintained by the firm Xapo, 200 meters belowground in Switzerland. Cryptocurrency ""keys"" are kept there on servers that have never touched the Internet. Photo: Simon Tanner—NZZ\n\nArmstrong has long taken 100% of his salary in Bitcoin; he now cashes out enough into dollars each month to cover his rent. Many of his employees do the same. They understand the security issues better than just about anyone, yet protecting customers is proving to be a gnarly challenge: Technically, because hackers are breaching accounts from the consumer end, exploiting weaknesses at companies like Verizon and Sprint, the hacks aren’t directly Coinbase’s fault. “Within the realm of reason, it’s very difficult for us to prevent their account from being drained,” says one executive.\n\nStill, Coinbase can’t afford to ignore the problem—literally. Even though it is not a bank, Coinbase still bears the cost of banking-system protocols, when traditional financial institutions yank back fraudulent payments induced by hackers. For example, when Dachis was robbed, a Coinbase customer support rep complained right back to him by email that “Coinbase has suffered a $1,657.41 USD loss due to bank reversals” of transactions subsequently reported as fraud. “Coinbase is left holding the bag,” Soups Ranjan, the company’s head of data science, said at a recent industry event. Problems like this—along with unauthorized credit card purchases of cryptocurrency—cost Coinbase a stunning 10% of all revenue it collects, a fraud-loss rate 20 times as high as PayPal’s. “I firmly believe,” Ranjan added, “we have the hardest payment fraud and user security problem in the world right now.”\n\nTo combat that, Coinbase has been using analytics to predict which customers have the highest risk of fraud and charge-backs, and preemptively limiting their purchasing power or locking their accounts. But that method comes with a downside of its own in the form of frustrated customers—and a backlog of help-desk requests that has stretched into the tens of thousands. With about 180 employees, the company hasn’t been able to hire fast enough to keep up with demand and is now looking to fill another 100 positions. Coinbase doesn’t even have a phone number for customer support, though it plans to add one in September.\n\nAt the same time, Coinbase finds itself slamming headfirst into the expectations that come with being the closest thing cryptocurrency has to Goldman Sachs. The IRS has gone to court seeking Coinbase user records, after only 802 U.S. taxpayers reported Bitcoin profits on their tax returns in 2015. In June, Coinbase had its first “flash crash,” with Ethereum’s price collapsing to 10¢ for a brief, panicky stretch; the company said that all trades “were executed properly” but eventually agreed, as a courtesy, to reimburse traders who had lost money owing to margin calls. And in early August, when a “hard fork” of the Bitcoin blockchain created another currency called Bitcoin Cash, Coinbase initially said it wouldn’t support it. Hours later, a denial-of-service cyberattack—which some perceived as retaliation—knocked the exchange completely offline, and customers began threatening to sue. Coinbase gave in: Account holders will be able to withdraw their Bitcoin Cash by 2018. “We’re in a period of hypergrowth, and it’s superexciting and a little chaotic,” Armstrong says.\n\nFor many blockchain enthusiasts, the Coinbase hacks have been a reminder of the danger of letting anyone else store your cryptocurrency. “If you don’t own the private keys, you don’t own the coin,” says Jonathan Smith, the chief technology officer of Civic, a company that uses blockchain tech for identity verification. Then again, Bitcoin has a dirty little secret: For an asset that epitomizes the future, managing your coin yourself can feel like a journey into the troglodytic past.\n\nBecause of the vulnerability of phone numbers, Coinbase is considering arming its customers with YubiKeys, physical authentication devices (shown above) that would function as a second layer of account protection in lieu of text-messaged codes. Photo: Courtesy of Yubikey\n\nSmart-money investors who store their own keys often resort to the most rudimentary of tactics to protect them. They’re the Bitcoin equivalent of stuffing cash under the mattress: a private key printed out on a sheet of paper, cut into pieces, and distributed among family members who don’t know how to put it back together; an encrypted file loaded on a USB stick and buried in the backyard; a password committed only to memory. These jury-rigged methods come with their own pitfalls, and stories of self-inflicted losses are legion: The New York man who reformatted a hard drive and erased the key to $25,000 in Bitcoin. Dominic Fogarty, a hedge fund research analyst who left his phone, storing his cryptocurrency, in a taxi after a bachelor party—then schlepped all over the Adirondacks to retrieve it. (“Yes, we missed our train, but more importantly I didn’t lose my Bitcoins!” he tells Fortune.)\n\nThe ultimate irony is that the gold standard in security, storing private keys in what’s known as “cold storage,” without connection to the Internet, often means putting them in the very places blockchain advocates hoped to avoid: banks. One cryptocurrency hedge fund manager once went to check on his safe-deposit box at Wells Fargo, which stored the key to $5 million, only to find the drawer empty. (A few weeks later, the correct box was found one slot below where it was supposed to be.) Even Coinbase itself relies on banks for some of its cold storage, where 98% of customer funds are kept. “It does seem a little old-fashioned, I suppose,” Armstrong acknowledges. And yet, it may also be the future, as more mainstream investors want in on cryptocurrency but without the worries of BYOB.\n\nFor some crypto devotees, this is nothing less than heresy. Says Michael Krieger, a former Lehman Brothers analyst who abandoned Wall Street for cryptocurrency after becoming disillusioned by the financial crisis, “I wouldn’t trust my crypto private keys to a safety-deposit box at a bank. That’s just me.” But already, the walls between finance’s old guard and blockchain’s renegades are beginning to crumble, and a day may come where the systems meld together almost seamlessly. “It’s almost ironic and funny that some of the rules and procedures we want to get rid of are almost exactly the rules we want in place to [protect] a major client,” says Hu Liang, a former State Street exec who left in August to start a cryptocurrency trading platform for institutional investors. Even as they dream of supplanting the conventions that have defined banking for centuries, blockchain disciples are realizing that you can never quite escape them.\n\nJonathan Levin is still catching his breath from a six-mile bike commute as he welcomes me into his office, on the second floor of a Manhattan coworking space, early one August morning. Wearing a gray cotton T-shirt that reads “Bitcoin, est. 2009,” the 27-year-old British expat exclaims cheekily, “So this is what fighting cybercrime looks like!”\n\nLevin is the cofounder of Chainalysis, a startup that tracks virtual currency movement and investigates illicit use. Chainalysis’s software assisted law enforcement with the takedowns and criminal indictments of both “dark net” marketplace AlphaBay and notorious digital currency exchange BTC-e during the span of a week in July, according to people familiar with the investigations. Previously, the company was able to locate where the stolen money from Mt. Gox and Bitfinex ended up: Bitcoin keeps an immutable record of all transactions—a literal money trail—so anyone can see the addresses of the digital wallets where funds are sent. Chainalysis’s artificial intelligence “clustering” techniques mapped the funds to particular exchanges. But progress seems to have hit a dead end when it comes to determining who controls those wallets. “How many people have been caught for stealing money from major Bitcoin exchanges?” Levin asks rhetorically. “The answer is zero.”\n\nThat’s not entirely true, says Kathryn Haun, a former federal prosecutor who led the crackdown on virtual-currency crime and joined Coinbase’s board in May. While no one yet has gone to jail for hacking into an exchange or electronically pilfering cryptocurrency, she says, the AlphaBay and BTC-e probes are the first of a wave of cases that have yet to be completed or unsealed. Because wallet addresses are pseudon\xadymous, it can take years for investigators to link them to a person—gathering data gleaned from exchanges like Coinbase and more obscure corners of the Internet. “I liken it to more traditional crimes, like bank robberies,” Haun says. “If he’s wearing a disguise and has a wig and gloves, it makes it that much harder to capture the criminal. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible.”\n\nIndividual thefts may be too small on their own to merit a federal case, but as more victims report crimes to the FBI and other government agencies, there’s more cause for hope. Chainalysis, for its part, opened a special investigations unit in July to take on personal cases after fielding pleas for help from hack victims. And experts believe the criminals who commit the robberies belong to sophisticated organizations with the technology and manpower to trawl social networks for mentions of cryptocurrency accounts—the kinds of resources that let them, say, call Ver\xadizon 28 times in 24 hours until they succeed in porting a phone number, as they did in the case of Adam Pokornicky, managing partner at hedge fund Cryptochain Capital. Efforts that ambitious inevitably leave traces, and from such clues a pattern can emerge. “Phone porting cases and schemes like it have captured the attention of law enforcement, so I would say, stay tuned,” Haun says.\n\nThat said, even if the blockchain world’s combined forces succeed in capturing cybercriminals, there’s no guarantee that victims will get their money back. Some of the legal precedent for charging cryptocurrency hackers is still untested, and there are questions as to whether intangible assets can even be seized. For one, accessing the booty would require knowing the private key: “They could get the criminal, but the government can’t force them to say where the gold is,” says Jeffrey Berns, whose California law firm specializes in digital currency. In a system that prizes decentralization above all else, the creature comforts of banking may never exist. Adds Berns, “There is no consumer protection, and I’m not sure it can be built in.”\n\nDeep inside a mountain in Switzerland, down a 200-meter cave, a World War II military bunker now stores what is believed to be the largest repository of Bitcoins on the planet. In the wake of the Mt. Gox hack in 2014, Wences Casares, an Argentinean tech entrepreneur, thought there was one solution to storing digital coins: Go underground.\n\nHis company Xapo now operates heavily guarded vaults, on five continents, some as far as a kilometer down into the earth. Each contains so-called air-gapped servers on which the encrypted private keys are stored. To ensure hackers cannot rob its clients, who range from $5 account holders in emerging markets to the world’s largest hedge funds and institutions, agents of Palo Alto–based Xapo personally witness the manufacturing of the servers before they even come off the assembly line and escort them to the hermetic vaults, guaranteeing they never touch the Internet. “It’s somewhat ridiculous,” says Casares, who also sits on the board of PayPal, “the extent to which we have to go to make sure that the keys are protected.”\n\nBut even that safeguard has its limits. When customers move funds into a “hot wallet” on Xapo for transaction purposes (itself a 48-hour process), the money could be vulnerable to the same hacks that Coinbase accounts are. In other words, your cryptowealth is as safe as can be—until you want to actually use it.\n\nAnatomy of a Cryptoheist\n\nCoinbase account holders lose up to $5 million annually to theft by hacking, according to a person close to the company. Here’s how the hacks happen, and why the culprits are so hard to catch.\n\nThe Stakeout\n\nA scammer scouts a target by searching for people who work in the blockchain industry—or by combing social media for mentions of Bitcoin and Coinbase. The attacker finds the target’s email address and phone number through online postings or previous\n\ndata leaks.\n\nThe Switcheroo\n\nThe scammer contacts the victim’s mobile provider and “ports” the phone number to a device under the scammer’s control.\n\nThe Disguise\n\nBecause Gmail \xadaccounts often link phone numbers as a backup access method, the scammer can now log in and reset the target’s email password, then do the same at Coinbase.\n\n“I’m In!”\n\nCoinbase requires two-factor authentication (“2FA”) in addition to a password. That 2FA now gets texted to the thief, who logs in.\n\nThe Getaway\n\nThe scammer moves the money into digital “wallets” under his control. Law enforcement can easily track the movements of the stolen currency recorded on the blockchain, but they can’t block transactions, and figuring out who controls the wallets is difficult.\n\nThe Laundering\n\nTo try to cover his trail, the scammer can move the currency to foreign “cryptoexchanges,” or convert it to other kinds of digital currency that are harder to track. Eventually, he can convert it to cash or other assets.\n\nBuilding a Better Vault\n\nFor better security:\n\nPut a “do not port” order on your phone number.\n\nDon’t use text-message 2FA; instead, use an app like Google Authenticator.\n\nUse a unique password, one you don’t use for other accounts or social media.\n\nThis is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance.

The latest targets are people who have touted their ownership of BitCoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe vulnerability is through their cell phones. Hackers are finding out the telephone numbers of virtual currency owners then calling up mobile providers and changing their numbers to a new device. Once they have control of the phone number, they use it to reset control of passwords, get access to BitCoin accounts/wallets and drain the contents.\n\n""Everybody I know in the cryptocurrency space has gotten their phone number stolen,"" Joby Weeks, a Bitcoin entrepreneur, told the New York Times.\n\nIt\'s a known problem, so much so that Coinbase has encouraged customers to disconnect their mobile phone numbers from their accounts.\n\n""Coinbase looks like a bank, stores millions of dollars like a bank, but you don\'t realize how weak its default protections are until you are robbed of thousands of dollars in minutes,"" Cody Brown, a virtual reality developer who was hacked in May, told the NYT.\n\nUltimately, the vulnerability of many cryptocurrencies is anonymity.

America\'s cannabis market is predicted to reach a valuation of up to $50 billion by 2026[1], and the value of bitcoin reached record highs in August, surpassing $4,000 per coin and remaining above that mark as of August 19[2]. Both unquestionably hot market segments right now, cannabis and bitcoin are now being linked thanks to the enterprising efforts of companies like SinglePoint, Inc. (OTC: SING) (SING Profile), which aims to utilize bitcoin in addressing a problem currently faced by legal cannabis businesses in the U.S.: a lack of banking options due to federal restrictions. The activities of companies like Bitcoin Services, Inc. (OTC: BTSC), Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) attest to the red-hot market status that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are enjoying right now. As a solution for currently \'unbankable\' legal marijuana businesses, cryptocurrency seems like a perfect fit.\n\n\n\nThe new bitcoin exchange being pioneered by SinglePoint (OTC: SING) aims to provide cannabis merchants with a means of processing debit and credit card transactions independent of banks and the FDIC (http://nnw.fm/Ln5ot). This will not only allow marijuana businesses to begin conducting non-cash transactions (cash currently being the only option for most), but it will also allow customers to purchase cannabis products with their debit and credit cards, just as they would purchase any other type of merchandise at any other type of store.\n\n\n\nSinglePoint is developing an in-house solution that would allow cannabis consumers to obtain bitcoin at any point of sale and instantly make bitcoin-powered purchases using their debit and credit cards. Users will be able to sign up prior to visiting a vendor or sign up quickly right at the point of sale. A beta version of SinglePoint\'s bitcoin solution is set to debut in November at the Las Vegas Marijuana Business MJBIZCON event.\n\n\n\nWhile similar solutions exist internationally, SinglePoint is an early mover in bringing this technology to the U.S. The solution will be KYC-AML compliant, and it will be applicable outside of the cannabis market and could be utilized by any kind of business desiring to offer an option for bitcoin transactions.\n\n\n\nThough the beta launch is still a few months away, potential patrons are already signing up through SinglePoint\'s website.\n\n\n\nA cannabis-specific cryptocurrency known as $Weed was recently purchased (http://nnw.fm/M9vYG) by SinglePoint from First Bitcoin Capital Corp (BITCF) and will also be incorporated into SinglePoint\'s cryptocurrency solution, enabling marijuana dispensaries and customers to complete transactions using either bitcoin or $Weed. A recent initial coin offering (ICO) for $Weed resulted in an impressive yet illiquid market cap of nearly $60 million.\n\n\n\nWhile cryptocurrency wallets can be obtained at the point of sale through SinglePoint\'s solution, SinglePoint and BITCF intend to implement a consumer-first approach and invest heavily in enticing customers to sign up for their cryptocurrency wallets ahead of time. This will ensure consumers can make their onsite cannabis product purchases without delay, and it also lets vendors deploy loyalty programs, special offers and more and to access consumer data regarding products.\n\n\n\nFor additional information about SinglePoint\'s operations, view the company\'s IR Kit here: http://www.networknewswire.info/sing/ir/.\n\n\n\nConsidered the most valuable of the cryptocurrencies, bitcoin has exploded in value and popularity, with many companies and businesses jumping on the bandwagon to either offer bitcoin-related services or accept bitcoin as a currency. Other entities are busily developing and offering their own \'bitcoin-esque\' cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nA company primarily engaged in mining bitcoin and developing and selling blockchain software, Bitcoin Services, Inc. (OTC: BTSC), began mining its own cryptocurrency, known as Dash, in the first quarter of 2017. The company also recently created a new subsidiary, Crypto Capital Corp., to develop a cryptocurrency wallet that will allow users to securely store multiple digital currencies, all in one wallet.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC), stands out as the first publicly quoted bitcoin investment vehicle, enabling investors to invest in digital currency without actually buying bitcoins. A U.S.-based, open-ended grantor trust sponsored by Grayscale Investments, Bitcoin Investment Trust is exclusively invested in bitcoin. Its shares are the very first publicly quoted securities to be exclusively invested in and derive value from the price of bitcoin. Through Bitcoin Investment Trust, investors are able to gain exposure to bitcoin\'s price movement through a traditional investment vehicle, free of the challenges associated with buying, storing and safeguarding bitcoins. For 2017, Bitcoin Investment Trust was named one of OTC Market Group\'s \'OTCQX Best 50\'.\n\n\n\nRival companies Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) have each cashed in big during 2017 with their respective offerings of powerful graphic cards, which miners of bitcoin and ether (a cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum blockchain) have been using to mine new coins. The recent cryptocurrency mining boom is being credited with driving up sales of the graphic processor units (GPUs) offered by these companies as cryptocurrency miners attempt to generate as much currency as they possibly can.\n\n\n\nThere probably isn\'t a better time than now for a cannabis cryptocurrency solution to hit market. Both the legal cannabis and cryptocurrency markets are currently on fire and merging these two hot markets can only equal success right now for the companies that accomplish it.\n\n\n\nEditorial Sources:\n\n(1) Bloomberg.com: http://nnw.fm/JSGp1\n\n(2) Bitcoin.com: http://nnw.fm/zo7JB\n\nFor more information on SinglePoint please visit: Singlepoint (SING) or http://www.SinglePoint.com\n\n\n\nAbout NetworkNewsWire\n\n\n\nNetworkNewsWire (NNW) is an information service that provides (1) access to our news aggregation and syndication servers, (2) NetworkNewsBreaks that summarize corporate news and information, (3) enhanced press release services, (4) social media distribution and optimization services, and (5) a full array of corporate communication solutions.

In an interview with RT, McAfee defended Bitcoin from people saying it is a Bubble stating that it is not and it will continue to grow.\n\nKnown for his bold predictions that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 within three years, he’s confident that Bitcoin cannot be considered a bubble.\n\nBitcoin is not a fiat currency\n\nAsked why the word “bubble” cannot be applied to Bitcoin, McAfee explained that Bitcoin is not a fiat currency.\n\nJohn McAfee, Founder of McAfee Inc. says:\n\n“Bitcoin is not a fiat currency. It costs over a thousand dollars to create a Bitcoin today in electricity and computing cost.”\n\nHe also added that the value of Bitcoin is directly correlated to its number of users and the equivalent number of transactions.\n\nJohn McAfee adds:\n\n“The value of Bitcoin is linked to the number of users and the number of transactions.”\n\nTo further explain why Bitcoin cannot and should not be considered a bubble, he continues to describe how Bitcoin grows.\n\nHe said that while people use it for speculative purpose, it is not and cannot be tagged as a speculative investment. He said that the value of Bitcoin grows, as the Bitcoin network grows.\n\nJohn McAfee explains:\n\n“It is not a speculative investment even though it is being used as such by other people.

08/23/2017,"['If you\'ve been following the price of Bitcoin, you\'re accustomed to volatility. Since the beginning of 2017, the price has quadrupled, but a few sharp drops meant that investors could\'ve easily lost money as well.\n\nBut the recent price drop—from an all-time high of around $4,500 to $3,500, and then back to $4,200 again—is different.\n\nThis volatility comes shortly after the introduction of Bitcoin\'s recently forged brother, Bitcoin Cash. This other cryptocoin was created on August 1 by a group that wasn\'t happy with the direction Bitcoin was heading.\n\nIt\'s currently the third largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of more than $11 billion, and its price has recently tripled—from around $300 to $900—before falling back to around $660. This price rise of Bitcoin Cash has coincided with the price drop of Bitcoin, so what\'s happening?\n\nAll you need to know is in this chart, which show the wild swing of how profitable it is to mine Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nAt one point it became a lot more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash than Bitcoin. Image: fork.lol\n\nBoth Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) protocols employ something called difficulty adjustment, which makes sure that miners (people who employ their computing power to create new bitcoins and power the Bitcoin network in the process) always mine an optimal number of bitcoins in a certain amount of time. When there\'s too much mining power, difficulty goes up to make sure new bitcoins don\'t flood the market too fast.\n\nBut when the mining power is lacking, difficulty goes down, and it went down sharply for Bitcoin Cash. Suddenly, a computer that could mine one BCH (Bitcoin Cash) per day could mine several times as many, making a lot more profit. And since Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are very similar, it\'s easy for miners to jump ship—and a lot of them did.\n\nThe chart above shows how profitable it is for miners to mine BTC as opposed to BCH. On August 18, it became more profitable to mine BCH, and since miners nearly always follow profitability, they simply switched to mining BCH instead of BTC. Then, on August 22, it became more profitable to mine BTC again, so miners are returning (see chart below).\n\nThe mining power is returning to Bitcoin. Image: fork.lol\n\nThere was also a side effect to this: As mining power (also called hash power or hashrate) went away from BTC to BCH, Bitcoin transactions became slower and more expensive; now that it\'s coming back, the reverse is happening.\n\nAll of this is the most likely reason why the price of Bitcoin is currently recovering while the price of Bitcoin Cash is falling (though admittedly not very fast). But this short-lived reversal shows how fragile Bitcoin really is.\n\nThe politics of Bitcoin is messy and about to get messier\n\nThat little graph above will become very important again in November, when Bitcoin will once again fork (split into two) to adopt a proposal caused SegWit2x.\n\nThis proposal was rejected by Bitcoin\'s core development team, and even though the majority of Bitcoin miners and exchanges have pledged to upgrade, it might cause a lot of trouble for Bitcoin. Ideally (at least for SegWit2x proponents) after the fork, pretty much everyone should switch to the new version of Bitcoin, leaving the old one to die. But there\'s always a possibility that some group will decide to upgrade the legacy chain in a different way and push that version as the ""true"" Bitcoin. If such a plan gains traction, miners will have three different ""Bitcoins"" to choose from, and that could cause chaos.\n\nAll of these forks are mostly revolving around one issue: The block size in Bitcoin\'s blockchain. If you think of a blockchain as a big notebook with records of all transactions on the Bitcoin network, then one block would be one page in the notebook. Currently, at 1MB, that block is too small, and Bitcoin can only process a low number of transactions per day. Bitcoin Cash, SegWit, SegWit2x—all of these are different proposals to solve this problem.\n\nWhy is there so much squabbling over what seems to be a simple upgrade of the Bitcoin\'s software? First, it\'s not that simple. Bitcoin has become a huge network, and even the slightest change in code can have unwarranted consequences. Second, a lot of people have a lot of money in Bitcoin, and they\'re looking to protect their interests. Third, Bitcoin Core—a group of developers that have guided Bitcoin\'s development since its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, had disappeared in 2010—has been extremely reluctant to accept third-party proposals. As a result, they\'re losing their influence over the network, and since miners can choose which proposal to support, if the majority starts to mine, say, Bitcoin Cash, the original Bitcoin might become abandoned.\n\nOn one hand, this is democracy at work. It\'s good, in a way, that Bitcoin cannot be easily altered; if it could, then it would not truly be decentralized. But just like in political democracy, the masses could be manipulated to vote the wrong way. Go to any Bitcoin-related forum and you\'ll see an immense amount of deception, half-truths, and good old muddying of the water, making it very hard to make an informed decision of any kind.\n\nWith Bitcoin\'s price and cryptocurrency buzz being near their all-time highs, things don\'t exactly look scary for the future of crypto. But scratch a little bit beneath the surface, and you\'ll see that the power struggle within Bitcoin, possibly the biggest in its history, is about to reach a climax soon.\n\nThe author of this text would like to thank Luka Zubovi? for his suggestions and corrections.\n\nDisclosure: The author of this text owns, or has recently owned, a number of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH.', 'If you\'re not buying Bitcoin, you\'re not keeping up with the Joneses.\n\nThe American middle class is falling in love with the unregulated cryptocurrency\'s skyrocketing value, which hit a record-breaking $4,400 in August, a 600 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nThere are now more Google searches for Bitcoin than for Beyoncé.

He transferred a portion of them to his ""BitPay"" card, a debit card designed to make it easier to spend Bitcoins at brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nThen he went to Walmart, found a 15x36 above-ground ""Summer Waves"" pool for $150 and swiped his BitPay card at the cash register.\n\nThe pool was the hit of the the Fourth of July party in the backyard of his two-story house in suburban Delaware. As the kids splashed around, his guests asked him how he afforded it.\n\nThe price of a single Bitcoin has risen 600 percent in the past year, while the S&P 500 index is up 12 percent. Google\n\n""Bitcoin paid for it,"" said Williams.\n\nNow his brothers and mom, who work in nursing, are investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocoins too.\n\n""I do think we\'re seeing more \'normal people\' invest in crypto assets,"" said Olaf Carlson Wee, the founder of Polychain capital, a digital asset hedge fund.\n\nOne of the larger Bitcoin wallet sites, Blockchain, now boasts over 15 million accounts as interest has grown.\n\nThese armchair speculators aren\'t necessarily interested in how ""cryptocurrencies"" allow users to conduct virtually anonymous financial transactions. Or how they use a ""blockchain"" to post everything on a ""public ledger"" to verify transactions without a bank. Or how it could subvert traditional global power structures to have a popular kind of currency backed not by gold or an army, but bits of ones and zeroes. (And if you need to know more about how it all works, this is a great explainer).\n\nThey just want a piece of the action.\n\n""It\'s like being in Apple at 10 cents,"" said Greg Salerno, a 39-year-old ironworker from Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nHe put $1,600 in Bitcoin.

Some claim to be faster or safer, or just have a funny name. They can be worth anything from less than a penny to several thousand dollars.\n\nWhile the potential profits are eye-popping, so too are the risks.\n\nChen Wu is an associate professor of finance at the University of Texas at Tyler who published a paper in the Journal of Financial Planning on how big a part of your investment portfolio should be devoted to Bitcoin.\n\nHe thinks their volatility and lack of consumer protections make them ""highly unsuitable for mom and pop"" investors.""\n\n""Bitcoin (and vast majority of other cryptocurrencies) are inappropriate investments for small investors with limited means and appetite for risk. They have been piling into them because of the spectacular returns bitcoin in particular has achieved in the past years,"" Wu wrote in an email to NBC News.\n\nExperts caution that cryptocurrencies generate no cash flows and have no value other than supply and demand. Because of this they should be viewed as speculative vehicle and not investments.\n\nAnd if you still want to play in their markets, it can be helpful to remember the ""5 percent"" rule of thumb that says you shouldn\'t put more than five percent in any one asset in case it goes bust.\n\n""While the verdict is still out and it may prove to be a revolutionary advance, investors may still end up doing poorly or even losing their entire investment,"" wrote Larry Luxenberg, a New York-based certified financial planner.\n\nThe big bucks have also drawn hucksters looking to exploit the naive and greedy.\n\nInterest in Bitcoin has been rising over the past year relative to other Google searches, like Beyonce. Google\n\nLast year, $50 million in cryptocurrency was stolen from one project by a hacker and later recovered. Phishing scam messages appear on popular crypto message boards. Recently, thieves have been draining individual user wallets by stealing their phone number and resetting passwords on their accounts.\n\nPrices in the small-cap crypto markets can swing wildly in a matter of hours, an ulcer-inducing ride for investors used to getting excited over stocks going up or down a few dollars.\n\n""It could be up or down 40 percent and I still get the same rush,"" said one investor who requested anonymity to avoid being targeted by hackers. ""There\'s an addiction. I check the price constantly.""\n\nAnd with no central governing authority for the open source software, disagreements within the community can lead to overnight changes. In recent weeks, a breakaway group formed ""Bitcoin Cash"" off the back of the Bitcoin network, creating both anxiety, confusion, and over $11 million in value virtually from thin air. Some predicted the price would crash to nearly worthless. Instead, it gyrated to a high of $1,000.\n\n""Always keep grinding. It\'s about having those extra funds on the side,"" said Williams. His previous ""side hustles"" include running a foreclosed home cleanout service and writing ebooks. Michael Rubenstein / for NBC News\n\n""I would say 90 percent of the value of any ""coin"" is speculative,"" said Joseph Lubin, a Brooklyn-based entrepreneur who co-founded Ethereum. ""It\'s the notion that the technology it represents is promising.""\n\nIt can all seem a little unreal. A common piece of advice crpytoinvestors share is ""don\'t invest more than you can afford to lose."" But some have found if they play their cards right, they can make real money on these virtual currencies.\n\nFor his part, Williams is planning to keep driving a school bus while keeping his ""side hustle"" going.\n\n""Always keep grinding. It\'s about having those extra funds on the side,"" he said.\n\nWith middle class wages stagnating over the past decade, that kind of disposable income has been harder to come by.\n\nBut for now, Williams has Bitcoin. He\'s up by so much that even if the price drops by half, he can still use it to afford family vacations and date nights.\n\n""My wife doesn\'t fully understand it,"" said Williams. ""But she does enjoy that we go out to dinner and I say, \'I got it.\'""', 'Block 481,824.\n\nThat\'s when Segregated Witness (SegWit) will activate on bitcoin late today or tomorrow morning, bringing the years-long debate over the contentious code upgrade to an official close. At that time, users will finally be able to take advantage of the long-promised technology.\n\nLooking back, it\'s important to note how long the change – perhaps the biggest ever made to the bitcoin software – has taken. To start, the community has been embroiled in politics since SegWit was first proposed in 2015 by Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille as a possible ""compromise"" to the scaling debate.\n\nSince then, there\'s been no shortage of drama – mining firm Bitmain was accused of blocking SegWit in order to boost its revenue; major bitcoin companies and mining pools united behind their own scaling plan; and finally, unhappy with the plan, users equipped with GIFs and branded hats responded with a kind of revolt.\n\nAnd that\'s not even the half of it.\n\nBut with SegWit soon to be guaranteed, today marks the first day it will be usable on bitcoin. Here are the key things that SegWit enables:\n\nIt rearranges how data is stored in bitcoin blocks.\n\nIt boosts capacity while remaining compatible with past versions of the software.\n\nIt removes transaction malleability, a bug that\'s been the primary roadblock for many bitcoin projects.\n\nEliminating the roadblock\n\nThe final point is what might have the most lasting impact.\n\nIndeed, many developers believe SegWit will boost the development of more forward-looking technologies necessary for bitcoin\'s mainstream use.\n\nThe best known is the Lightning Network, first proposed in a 2015 white paper by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja. The idea is payment channels that move transactions off the blockchain could boost bitcoin\'s capacity to millions of transactions per second.\n\nBut the project has grown in scope considerably since its 2015 ideation.\n\nWorking under the assumption that SegWit would eventually activate on bitcoin, a handful of developers have built active Lightning Network implementations, and they\'re now working to ensure that all of them work with one another.\n\nAnd, since the Lightning Network is now possible on two major cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and litecoin – developers are also planning on using the network to create a new type of trustless trading between the two. It\'s also possible that these tools could potentially eradicate the need for cryptocurrency exchanges, which have been under scrutiny recently for messing up at the expense of cryptocurrency users.\n\nAnd other projects that need, or at the least, work better with SegWit capability are well underway, too.\n\nDevelopers preparing for SegWit activation have been working on MAST (which enables more complex bitcoin smart contracts), schnorr signatures (which would enable another transaction capacity boost) and TumbleBit (an anonymous top-layer network).\n\nContinuing politics\n\nAnd while SegWit looks to enable a bright future for bitcoin, it doesn\'t exactly bring an end to the debate and politics that have mired the community for years.\n\nSome bitcoin users still believe SegWit is the wrong choice, and they\'re so adamant about this that they forked the bitcoin blockchain (creating a new version entirely). Called bitcoin cash, the blockchain eliminates SegWit in favor of other scaling tech.\n\nNow, bitcoin and bitcoin cash are competing, putting two ideologies to the test – with real money on the line.\n\nThe questions being asked now are: Which cryptocurrency has the best technical roadmap? Which will attract the most users and attention? And which will remain the most decentralized? Or, do both of them have merit?\n\nWhile answers to those questions are uncertain, one thing is for sure. With SegWit activating today, the community is one step closer to determining whether it\'s scaling capabilities are all they were touted as.\n\nFinish line image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The funding, according to statements, will be used to expand MGT\'s bitcoin mining operations in the northwest US, where plentiful hydropower has attracted more than a few miners.\n\nBitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, with new coins being created as a reward for the miner that creates the next transaction block.

The code specifies that if not enough blocks are found in a certain period of time, a difficulty adjustment will occur.\n\nAs a result of this 60% reduction in difficulty, the cryptocurrency temporarily became more profitable than Bitcoin to mine. Bitcoin Cash, for a time, attracted nearly 40% of Bitcoin’s miners.\n\nBecause of the huge surge in hash power and the low difficulty, Bitcoin Cash’s network produced the requisite 2016 blocks very quickly, and now another difficulty adjustment has occurred. Bitcoin Cash is now much harder to mine and is less profitable than mining Bitcoin. Miners have now abandoned Bitcoin Cash in droves, causing block times on the network to exceed six hours.\n\nBitcoin Cash, was created in early August by developers who were unhappy with Bitcoin’s adoption of SegWit and its shunning of larger block sizes. Since both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin use the same proof-of-work to safeguard their transaction histories, both networks are now effectively competing for hash power as miners continue to mine the more profitable chain.\n\nBigger question looming\n\nIn November, the Bitcoin network is set to once again decide on an upgrade. At that time, the 2 MB blocksize of the SegWit2x agreement will be implemented. While the vast majority of miners and exchanges are apparently supporters of this, Bitcoin’s core development team is strongly opposed.\n\nSince the 2 MB blocksize increase will be a hard fork, there’s a chance that Bitcoin’s core team and their supporters will continue mining the legacy chain after the upgrade occurs. That could result in two different networks competing for the “Bitcoin” name.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Cash’s price has dropped to slightly below $600 from a high of $1,000. The price of Bitcoin, has maintained stability in the $4,000 to $4,500 range for several days.', ""The Baltic country of Estonia is reportedly considering starting its own virtual currency to raise funds. If implemented, it would be the world’s first government-backed initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nThe step comes as a part of an “e-residency” program launched by the country in late 2014. The government-backed project lets anyone in the world become an Estonian digital resident.\n\nRead more\n\nPeople across the globe may sign up for Estonian e-Residency, receive a government-issued smart ID card and even open a business in Estonia.\n\nThe program lets e-residents digitally sign important documents, access secure services and make secure transactions from around the world.\n\nIssuing a national cryptocurrency is seen as the next step in advancing the country's economy and expanding its global presence.\n\n“An ICO within the e-Residency ecosystem would create a strong incentive alignment between e-residents and this fund, and beyond the economic aspect makes the e-residents feel like more of a community since there are more things they can do together,” said a co-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin.\n\n“Additionally if these ESTcoins are issued on top of a blockchain (they could possibly be issued in multiple formats at the same time, nothing wrong with this) then it would become easy and convenient to use them inside of smart contracts and other applications,” added Buterin.\n\nA government-backed ICO would give people a larger stake in the future of the country and will help to boost the economy, says Kaspar Korjus, the managing director of e-residency for Estonia.\n\nThe measure may potentially expand Estonia's 1.3 million population by 10 million digital residents."", 'While sources differ on the number of millionaires in the world, Credit Suisse estimates the number at about 35 million. This figure accounts for all “financial and nonfinancial wealth,” including assets, collectibles, and homes.\n\nThis is a remarkable number when compared to the total number of Bitcoins that will ever exist. While there are roughly 35 million millionaires in the world, there will only ever be a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins. That’s right--there will never be enough Bitcoins in existence for every millionaire in the world to own even a single one.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin valuable?\n\nWhile you let that thought sink in, let’s consider what gives Bitcoin its value. Granted that there are numerous features we could cite, including a global network, an immutable Blockchain and a means to transfer wealth from one person to another without ever involving a middleman.\n\nThese are all fine features, to be sure. But what really makes Bitcoin valuable are two properties: scarcity and authenticity.\n\nDigital scarcity\n\nBitcoin has value for the same reason gold has value: people want it and there isn’t enough to go around. New gold can’t merely be created; one has to find a gold mine and go through the difficult, capital-intensive and expensive process of mining and refining the gold. Because neither governments nor factories can create more of it, gold is scarce. This scarcity imparts value.\n\nMany unusual items have been used as currencies or stores of value in earlier societies. One of the more famous is wampum, a necklace made from a certain kind of seashell that was rare in the Americas. A currency doesn’t necessarily have to be inherently useful in order to function, but it absolutely must be scarce.\n\nThis requirement for scarcity is the reason counterfeiting has such severe penalties. In fact, in earlier times, counterfeiting was punishable by death. Counterfeiters undermined confidence in a currency by making it less scarce. Doing so, at scale, could wreck an entire economy.\n\nAuthenticity\n\nGold has another feature that’s extremely important for any store of value or currency: authenticity. For millennia, gold has been used as both a currency and as a store of value. It has been prized throughout its history because of its scarcity. Gold has been used in money, in jewelry, in crowns and in palaces. Gold is universally associated with wealth.\n\nSince Bitcoin lacks the thousands of years of history, culture and tradition that impart so much value and mystique to gold, it\'s easy to write the currency off as inauthentic.\n\nBut in a world that\'s rapidly moving from analog to digital, even a ""new"" technology like Bitcoin can be authentic. When it comes to digital money, Bitcoin certainly fits the bill. Of the thousands of different tokens that label themselves “digital currency,” Bitcoin is the very first. That grants it an important claim to the property of authenticity.\n\nThere are many great altcoins, but none of them were first. None of them can reasonably claim to be the best. None have a higher market capitalization. Bitcoin is the first, has the largest network effect, is the most universally recognized and is authentic.\n\nAsset or currency?\n\nAs Bitcoin inches toward mainstream adoption, economists and finance experts debate whether it’s an asset or a currency. In terms of valuing Bitcoin, that argument couldn’t be more irrelevant. It doesn’t matter how people use Bitcoin; what matters is why people choose to own it.\n\nBitcoin’s future\n\nThe future of Bitcoin is almost certainly a bright one. Various analysts and traders have tried to guess the value of Bitcoin in the future, with some saying it might even reach $15,000 in the near term.\n\nBut forget about the near term. If Bitcoin is digital gold, then its long term value is what really matters. Bitcoin is rare. Bitcoin is scarce. The vast majority of people don’t own even a fraction of one.\n\nWhat’s Bitcoin’s long-term potential? Bitcoin could easily become so valuable that even millionaires can’t afford an entire coin.', 'Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor who a few weeks back said bitcoin was in a bubble, is getting used to the new world of cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a news report in CNBC, Cuban is backing a venture capital fund focused on cryptocurrency investments. The fund, called 1confirmation, was started by Nick Tomaino, former business development manager at Coinbase, reported CNBC.\n\nThe fund is aiming to land $20 million, CNBC noted, citing a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “It’s an interesting space that I [want] to get involved with and learn more” about, Mark Cuban said in an email to CNBC Tuesday (Aug.22). Cuban would not say how much he is investing in Nick Tomaino’s 1confirmation VC fund.\n\nThe stance on the part of the investor has changed a lot since his tweet in June, when he said bitcoin was in a bubble. On Aug. 14, the outspoken Dallas Mavericks owner said he may purchase some bitcoin. He did note in another tweet on the same day that: “bias should be up because of finite supply. Until crypto or US politics intrude, and they will.”\n\nThe price of bitcoin has quadrupled so far in 2017, reaching a record $4,522.13 last week. It now has a market capitalization of about $74 billion, reported CNBC, citing CoinDesk. Meanwhile, initial coin offerings (ICO) have amassed $1.37 billion in 2017.\n\nCryptocurrencies are experiencing a bit of an identity crisis right now. While there are many parties involved that are deeply invested, others are skeptical about its true value. In this year alone, we’ve seen bitcoin valued at just under $1,000 in January to over $3,000 in May and soaring over $4,000 in August. One of the major factors impacting the most recent leap in bitcoin value is the recent hard fork to develop a new cryptocurrency, dubbed Bitcoin Cash.', 'Wallet and statistics provider Blockchain (also known as Blockchain.info) has announced its users will automatically receive Bitcoin Cash (BCH) after all.\n\nIn a blog post Tuesday, Blockchain, which at the time of the Bitcoin hard fork on Aug. 1 did not duplicate user balances on the new chain, said it would offer “limited support” for BCH.\n\n“We’ve been closely monitoring Bitcoin Cash (BCH) since the hard fork,” the company writes.\n\n“Within the next eight weeks, we’ll be rolling out limited support for BCH via the settings panel in your Blockchain Wallet. Users with balances of Bitcoin in their Blockchain Wallet on Aug. 1 will be able to access an equal balance, as of Aug. 1, of Bitcoin Cash.”\n\nUsers unaware of the impact their chosen storage location would have on their holdings at the time of the fork, have since been attempting to unlock their BCH stash.\n\nA network snapshot was created in August, showing which coins were present on which addresses at a certain block.\n\nSome wallets immediately chose to credit users with the BCH equivalent, while others such as Blockchain adopted a hands-off approach.\n\nLast week, Blockchain also added support for Ethereum (ETH), allowing users to exchange as well as send and receive transactions from within their wallet.', 'The IRS is actively seeking out tax evaders using Bitcoin, employing tools like Chainalysis to unmask them.\n\nMany people believe that Bitcoin is anonymous, but it is in fact pseudonymous. All transactions linked to a particular address are visible on the Blockchain, which is public and transparent.\n\nHowever, it is not possible to link a particular wallet address to the real world identity of a person/company without any additional information.\n\nWhile good privacy practices can prevent leakage of information, there is always a point where Bitcoin transactions touch the traditional monetary system (when you use it in a store or when you sell it at an exchange) and proof of identity can become necessary.\n\nWorking backwards, it is possible to unravel the chain of Bitcoin transactions to some extent.\n\nIRS and Chainalysis\n\nThe IRS has been trying hard to obtain details about Bitcoin transactions and detect cases of tax evasion.\n\nThe IRS had previously requested Coinbase to give it details about its users for the period 2013-15. As per a document referenced by Daily Beast, the IRS has also awarded a contract to Chainalysis to analyse transactions and unmask users.\n\nChainalysis uses data scraped from public forums, leaked data sources including dark web, exchange deposits and withdrawals to tag and identify transactions.\n\nThe IRS expects to use this data to catch tax cheats as well as criminals who sell drugs and other illegal goods and services for Bitcoin.\n\nDoes Chainalysis work?\n\nThere have been Bitcoin mixing services which specialized in obfuscating the source of Bitcoins. Bitmixer.io was the leader amongst mixing services, before it announced its decision to mysteriously shut down.\n\nCoinjoin transactions also make it difficult to trivially link Bitcoin transactions. Services like Joinmixer help like-minded individuals combine transactions to enhance privacy.\n\nMoreover, while Chainalysis claims that it has information on a high percentage of Bitcoin addresses (25 percent), it is possible that these could be addresses with poor privacy practices.\n\nChainalysis may not be able to unmask transactions where users have intentionally tried to obfuscate the transaction trail.\n\nWhat about altcoins?\n\nWhile the IRS may be breaking its head in trying to unmask those behind Bitcoin transactions, its efforts will be futile if extended to the wider cryptocurrency space.\n\nCertain currencies like Dash, Monero and ZCash have inbuilt privacy features, which makes it difficult to track transactions.\n\nIf people shift from Bitcoin to secondary currencies like these, the IRS would have its hands full when trying to detect specific cases of tax evasion.\n\nMoreover, the resources that it would take to investigate these currencies would make the whole exercise infeasible.\n\nIt is possible that a simple and clear tax regime with respect to cryptocurrencies may be what is required to gain higher compliance with respect to tax in cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies are currently in a gray area and this may prevent people from fully disclosing their cryptocurrency holdings to tax authorities.']"

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\nBTC/USD 24.08.2017\n\nThe BTC/USD pair has seen an increase in volatility over the last several days. One could also witness a false hit, which happened on Aug. 22. Closure of marginal market positions led to such a rapid movement. However, the recovery was fast, which once again has proved the strength of the $3,900 zone.\n\nTechnically, the situation is as follows:\n\nThe $4,400 resistance zone has proven strong. In case of $4,400 hit and confident settling, a new rally is likely to happen.\n\nSupport zone of the $3,900 zone. Despite the false hit, the support zone is still around $3,900. But one should be careful since volatility is strong and short-term stop order moves might not be the best decision right now.\n\nFalse hit. Study this movement carefully, it shows how the market works and why BTC price moves up or down.\n\nThe $3,900-$4,400 channel is likely to keep on in the coming weeks, along with buys from lower borders of the channel and sells from the upper borders. It’s a possible scenario, but on the current market, opening short positions might not be a good idea. An important factor to consider here is trading volume.\n\nBTC-related news has been positive. The SegWit activation and fight for mining powers with BCH have led to an increasing news flow and growing popularity of Bitcoin.\n\nETH/USD 24.08.2017\n\nEthereum is one of the strongest projects on the cryptomarket. Technological solutions that ETH offers are in high demand there. The rising number of transactions in the network only proves the point.\n\nYet, ETH has its problems. Slow network during major ICOs has not left a very good impression. And the market tends to react instantly to any problem. But most importantly, one should not forget that Ethereum has a very strong team of developers. They all do understand the problems and are working on their solutions. And this is what makes Ethereum one of the best assets for investors on a fundamental level.\n\nTechnically, the situation is as follows:\n\nStrong ETH uptrend continues\n\n$280 remains to be a resistance zone\n\n$320 resistance zone has been hit, but the retest has failed. There has been a return to the $280-$320 channel.\n\nRight now the price trades around the $320 resistance zone. For further growth, the trading volumes and general market dynamics are very important factors.\n\nVolatility remains high.\n\nNews about the nearest hard fork has generated heat around ETH. One should pay special attention to the Difficulty Bomb. This will influence ETH price very positively. This is one more step from PoW to PoS.\n\nInfluence of fundamental factors makes the technical analysis just a support instrument. The Metropolis release has been the spotlight of the Ethereum network. News about its activation will heat up the interest to the project.\n\nOptions with correction to the $280 support zone are also possible, but only if the whole market falls.\n\nLTC/USD 24.08.2017\n\nWe finally saw some movement with LTC. It was caused by news from developers on tests and activation of Lightning Network. Judging by Charlie Li’s Twitter account, the white paper and the results of LN tests will be published very soon. We’ve already seen the first reaction, a second wave can follow after a full-blown announcement.\n\nTechnical analysis:\n\nThe last peak has been tested.\n\nTriangle formation is possible. Therefore, buys from support zones, probably, will not be possible.\n\nVery positive news; the LN tests.\n\nBids on LTC have also gone up.\n\nA usual LTC bid is one to two percent a year. Right now, one can loan LTC at 11.95 percent a year. This is also an important trigger during growth; one can consider when building a strategy.\n\nIn this case, the same as with Ethereum, news will play an important role. Potential Lightning Network activation will impact the price a lot, and can even make Litecoin a leader in growth on the whole digital currency market. A very strong rally may still be possible, and strong movement that took place during SegWit activation can take place once again.', 'Bitcoin rose modestly on Thursday as the most prominent digital currency recovers from recent sharp declines that briefly put it into correction territory.\n\nMoves for the cyber monetary unit come as Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily suspended trading in the shares of First Bitcoin Capital Corp.

Traditional bitcoin participants agreed on a new protocol known as Segregated Witness, or SegWit., which they believe solves bitcoin’s scaling issue.\n\nThe adoption of SegWit hasn’t been smooth, with a minority of users rejecting it, leading to the split of bitcoin that created Bitcoin Cash.\n\nOn Thursday, the price of Bitcoin Cash fell 1.6% to 649.32, bringing its market cap to $10.7 billion.\n\nEther tokens, the chief rival to bitcoin, which runs on the Ethereum network, was little changed on Thursday at $323.74. Ether on Wednesday rose 0.4% to $325, its highest level since June 23. While it remains below an all-time intraday high above $400 hit on June 12, it has more than doubled from a recent intraday low hit in mid-July. For 2017, it is up about 4,000%, bringing its market cap to $30.6 billion.\n\nRead: This bitcoin $25,000 call is more proof of the cybercurrency bubble\n\nThe recent advances in bitcoin, along with the recovery in Ether, brought the total market capitalization of all cryprtocurrencies above $150 billion. The basket of cybercurrencies tracked by Coinmarketcap.com first broke above $100 billion in early June, meaning the space has risen by half in a little more than two months.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Firtst Bitcoin Capital Corp traded at $1.79 before its halt. The stock traded at $0.05 at the start of the year and gained more than 6,000% year to date.\n\nFirst Bitcoin Capital Corp. is a Canadian corporation that invests in companies that mine bitcoin and operates exchanges and digital wallets, according to their website. The suspension was effective Thursday 9:30 Eastern Tim until noon Sept. 7.\n\nIn other news, A regulatory arm of Canada on Thursday signaled a warning about so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, which have spiked in popularity. The Canadian Securities Administrator, although acknowledging the benefits of raising funds by digital tokens, it said there are big risks.\n\n“However, they can also raise investor protection concerns, due to issues around volatility, transparency, valuation, custody and liquidity, as well as the use of unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges.Also, investors may be harmed by unethical practices or illegal schemes, and may not understand the properties of the investment products that they are purchasing,” the CSA said, adding that it was monitoring developments in ICOs.', 'Hyperinflation has been one of the products of a political crisis in Venezuela that has led to people searching for alternative means to buy necessities.

Still, it is because of a heavily subsidised electricity market that regular citizens are putting time and effort into mining Bitcoin.\n\nThe current President, Nicolás Maduro, has made electricity so cheap that it is essentially free, thus the usual cost of running mining equipment is negated and it has become far more profitable for citizens in the crisis.\n\nWith about $500 profit available with this subsidised electricity, it is considered a small fortune for the crisis-riddled country.\n\nThe citizens mining Bitcoin have found it feasible enough to run a number of machines at once through the month to reach such targets.\n\nCrypto crackdown\n\nHowever, this is still a risky operation for citizens as there has been a cracking down on such activity - digital currencies are unregulated and operating in a grey area.\n\nThere are no laws on Bitcoin, either promoting or banning it, but it’s clear that legislature and the police force are not too keen on crypto activities.\n\nReports suggest that miners are being arrested on spurious charges, and as such, it is causing more of an underground market to bloom as they hide out, as well as try to mine currencies like Ethereum for greater reward with higher risk.', 'Now that’s a pretty penny-stock.\n\nUS regulators on Thursday halted trading in a Canadian bitcoin company that had surged more than 6,000 percent this year.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said it has concerns that the company, First Bitcoin Capital, wasn’t telling the whole truth about what it owns and how it’s structured.\n\nFirst Bitcoin, run by Simon Rubin, a secretive digital currency entrepreneur, was halted by the SEC before it opened for trading.\n\nThe SEC froze trading on the stock at $1.79. It was trading for less than 3 cents on Dec. 31.\n\n“The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of BITCF because of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly available information about the company, including, among other things, the value of BITCF’s assets and its capital structure,” the regulator said in a statement.\n\nIt’s unclear what accounted for the recent surge in the company’s price, which reached a high of $2.70 on Aug. 14.\n\nThe company had no income as of the third quarter of 2016, according to an unaudited financial report at the time — the last one available.\n\nNot much is known about First Bitcoin. Rubin, the CEO and chairman, is described in a bare-bones company bio as “a serial entrepreneur with a background in programming and web design.”\n\nRubin is the only officer listed without a photo.\n\nThe company, in a statement, said the SEC action was likely the case of a “misunderstanding” or a needed clarification.\n\n“[I]t would have been better for the SEC to ask us for [some] information before taking such drastic action,” it said.', 'MGT Capital, a tech company that engages in hydro-powered bitcoin mining has raised $2.4 million in a new round of financing.\n\nIn an announcement, the firm said the round of financing will help to “materially ramp up its bitcoin mining operations”. The financing comes following a 10% convertible note issued to UAHC Ventures, an investing firm. The note is self-amortizing with a ceiling repayment of $160,000 per month.\n\nThe new financing comes at a time when the company is constructing its third mining location in Washington state, with plans to deploy new mining rigs in the facility by early October 2017. A resource-hungry process reliant on large amounts of electric power, bitcoin mining results in new transactions added to the bitcoin blockchain. Currently, bitcoin miners are rewarded 12 bitcoins ($50,000) for creating the next transaction block in the chain.\n\nAs reported earlier, MGT capital secured a location in central Washington with low-cost hydro power resources in the vicinity to launch its mining operation in July 2016. Come September, the company announced it had completed its first phase of operations at a time when it was mining 90 bitcoins a month. With ‘phase two’ of its operation, the company ramped up its processing power from 2 PetaHash at launch to upwards of 5 PetaHash by the end of the year.\n\nLast week, MGT announced the deployment of 650 new bitcoin mining rigs. The Bitmain 29 units will be installed at “a new multi MegaWatt facility” in central Washington, with production expected to reach maximum capacity by the end of the month.\n\n“With the recent highs of $4,500 per bitcoin, the business of mining is as profitable as ever,” stated newly appointed president of MGT Crypto-Capital Stephen Schaeffer.\n\nEarlier in June, John McAfee, CEO of MGT Capital, announced the company’s decision to mine Ethereum alongside bitcoin.\n\n“We will definitely be profitable before the end of the year,” revealed McAfee in an interview to Bloomberg. “From bitcoin mining, we will get the experience and expertise to apply the blockchain to our security products.” One of those security products being developed includes a smartphone titled the ‘Privacy Phone’.\n\nMcAfee also dismissed recent chatter of bitcoin prices being in the midst of a bubble period, calling such talk ‘absurd’. In keeping with his bullish tone, McAfee sees bitcoin prices reaching $500,000 by 2020.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The growth of online banking and digital currencies haver been cited as the main causes of a massive rise in organised crime in Australia\'s financial sector according to the country\'s criminal intelligence agency.\n\nA report issued by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) this week estimated that money laundering and other financial crimes perpetrated by large criminal gangs are costing the country more than $28.43bn a year.\n\nThe Australian authorities are especially concerned that e-commerce businesses and bitcoin exchanges are helping to facilitate organised crime due to the lack of transparency around the transactions and the use of encryption, potentially enabling criminal activity and tax evasion.\n\n""Bitcoin, which can be traded anonymously and is as good as cash, is traded now on most significant international exchanges,"" said Justice Minister Michael Keenan.\n\nThe report follows the introduction earlier this month of new legislation designed to bring digital currency exchanges under the same disclosure regime as banks and traditional exchanges.\n\nIt also follows the charges levelled against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia of widespread breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.\n\nThe report also highlighted the increase in money laundering through online betting sites, many of which are owned by international crime syndicates.

Since the year began, bitcoin has risen by more than 300%, while digital currency Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has vaulted higher by almost 3,900%! No, that's not a misprint -- that's a 3,900% return on your investment in less than eight full months.\n\nSince the year began, bitcoin has risen by more than 300%, while digital currency Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has vaulted higher by almost 3,900%! No, that's not a misprint -- that's a 3,900% return on your investment in less than eight full months.\n\nBitcoin and bitcoin cash split in two\n\nOf course, the ride has been anything but smooth. Bitcoin wound up plunging by more than $1,000 per coin a little over a month ago when it became apparent that software engineers and the bitcoin community may not come to a consensus about the future of its blockchain. Blockchain is the decentralized digital ledger than underlies bitcoin and logs all transactions.\n\nEssentially, upgrades were needed to make transaction times on bitcoin's network faster. A majority of its members wanted to go the route of BIP 91, which introduced an update known as SegWit2X. This update moved some of the data out of bitcoin's blockchain network, speeding up transaction times, lowering transaction fees, and most importantly, increasing capacity to potentially go after merchants and enterprise customers.\n\nA minority of the community, but enough of a minority that the required 80% consensus couldn't be reached, wanted to keep bitcoin as a libertarian's dream currency. Instead of implementing SegWit2X, this group of engineers and community members wanted to work with larger blockchains within the bitcoin network.\n\nThe result? On Aug. 1, 2017, the world awoke to a currency that had split in two: bitcoin and bitcoin cash. The latter represents the minority of its members and the former received the SegWith2X upgrade. Since the split, bitcoin has been off to the races, nearly hitting $4,500 per coin last week after briefly dipping below $1,900 more than a month ago.\n\nBitcoin cash just soared more than 200% in two days\n\nNow here's the really interesting and slightly dumbfounding aspect: Bitcoin cash has been off to the races, too. In just a two-day period last week between Aug. 17 and Aug. 19, bitcoin cash rose from about $300 per coin to $913 per coin, a greater than 200% return in about a 51-hour period. That's insane! What's even crazier, no one's exactly sure why bitcoin cash tripled in price, albeit there are numerous postulations.\n\nIn particular, CoinDesk has suggested that bitcoin cash is arguably more profitable to mine than bitcoin. Mining in this sense is the process of using high-powered computers and servers to solve complex math equations to unlock bitcoin or bitcoin cash, which allows miners to be paid. CoinDesk has suggested that a difficulty adjustment in mining bitcoin cash has made it easier, and thusly more profitable, to mine than original bitcoin. This could certainly explain some of the surge in bitcoin cash, along with sheer momentum and emotions taking over.\n\nBitcoin-cash gains make little sense\n\nHowever, bitcoin cash could also be dangerous for investors' wealth in a number of respects. For example, the basis of its split from bitcoin is that a minority within the community didn't want bitcoin to become a mainstream currency, or to be used by enterprises. This should, in theory, limit the usefulness of bitcoin cash's blockchain. What's more, it may not be supported by a number of popular cryptocurrency exchanges, which doesn't help in any way legitimize bitcoin cash.\n\nAnother issue to consider is that larger blockchains within bitcoin cash may not resolve lengthy transaction times or high transaction fees. For miners, at least, it takes twice as long to receive a reward from bitcoin cash (about 34 hours) than it does from bitcoin (17 hours), which could disincentivize miners from considering bitcoin cash. This is already an issue since there were fewer bitcoin cash miners in place, post split, which could adversely impact liquidity and increase volatility.\n\nLastly, it remains to be seen what can be done with bitcoin cash. While there are some brand-name businesses that currently accept bitcoin, there are no guarantees that any businesses will accept the smaller bitcoin cash. That lack of legitimacy could come back to haunt those holding onto bitcoin cash.\n\nFor now, it doesn't make much sense to be invested in any cryptocurrencies, least of all bitcoin cash, given how little enterprises are involved. This isn't to say that businesses aren't interested in blockchain technology, so much as to suggest that the foundation for these cryptocurrencies is still virtually nonexistent. Until we see a more defined pathway forward for these digital currencies and their underlying technology, they're simply not worth the risk.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\n\nRead the original article on The Motley Fool.

In IRS Notice 2014-21, the IRS announced that bitcoin and other digital currency is actually property for tax purposes, not currency. That in itself has some big tax consequences. For example:\n\nWages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable, must be reported on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes. If you pay someone in property, how do you withhold taxes? You have to send the IRS money from something else. You either pay the employee some cash and some bitcoin and withhold plenty on the cash. Or you sell some of the bitcoin to get dollars to pay the IRS.\n\nPayments using virtual currency made to independent contractors are taxable and payers must issue Form 1099. You can’t enter “1,000 bitcoin” on the 1099. You must value it in dollars as of the time of payment. Valuation swings can be brutal.\n\nGain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in your hands. This can be a huge issue, and is not an easy subject to summarize.\n\nA payment made using virtual currency is subject to Form 1099 reporting just like any other payment made in property. Yes, this bears repeating. How much compliance there is in the real word remains to be seen.\n\nIt takes time for people to adapt, and that is one reason compliance may be poor so far. But part of the lack of compliance may also be the nature of digital currency. It is meant to be anonymous, and attracts some users for that reason. They may be less inclined to, for example, start handing out IRS Forms 1099. Recipients of those forms may go somewhere else.\n\nAll of this leaves the IRS wondering how to get a piece of the action. That’s where enforcement comes in. Last year, the IRS started fighting to obtain vast amounts of data on Bitcoin and other digital currency transactions. In late 2016, a federal court authorized the IRS to serve a John Doe Summons on Coinbase, Inc., the digital currency transaction hub. The IRS wants information on the site’s users and their transactions.\n\nSome Coinbase users, led by Mr. Jeffrey K. Berns, moved to intervene in the IRS’s case. They argued that the IRS request was not properly calibrated and threatened their privacy. In turn, the IRS argued that Mr. Berns already identified himself as a Coinbase user, so could not say his privacy was threatened. It is worth remembering that the IRS used a John Doe Summons to get names of Swiss bank account holders from UBS. After that, offshore banking changed forever, with all other Swiss (and other) banks eventually coming clean. The IRS ended up collecting over $10 billion.\n\nThe IRS pursued Coinbase in the same way. Small fries may be OK, though. The IRS agreed to limit its request for customer records from Coinbase to accounts with transactions over $20,000. Beyond that, the IRS will clearly do more data mining for digital currency users. Reports about compliance suggest the IRS may need to. Reports underscore IRS claims that only 802 people declared a capital gain or loss related to bitcoin in 2015. With millions of transactions, 802?\n\nThis suggests that the bulk—the vast bulk—of bitcoin transaction are simply not reported. With millions of transactions and the meteoric rise of bitcoin from under $100 to over $4,000 in just a few years, the IRS seems to be missing out. That is where IRS tech comes in. Well, private tech then. It has been widely reported that the IRS is using software to find bitcoin users who have failed to report profits. The Daily Beast revealed the Chainalysis contract that is at the root of this new IRS enforcement effort.\n\nIf Chainalysis identifies owners of digital wallets, the IRS can take over. Matching up transactions and tax returns is not that hard. Taxpayers who have hidden income could face taxes, and potentially big civil penalties. Some cases could even end up as criminal tax cases. The IRS is generally more forgiving if a taxpayer makes corrective filings before being caught or audited. Those who do not make filings until they are caught could face harsher treatment. Remember, the IRS treats Bitcoin and other digital currencies as property. That means sales could give rise to capital gain or loss, rather than ordinary income. Be careful out there.', 'Billionaire investor Mark Cuban is investing in cryptocurrency hedge fund 1confirmation, which aims to raise $20 mln to be used in funding Blockchain technology-based companies. Cuban had previously announced that the digital currency Bitcoin was already in a “bubble.”\n\nCuban said that he considers Blockchain as a foundation platform for the creation of great applications.\n\n“I have always looked at Blockchain as a foundation platform from which great applications can be built.

Once a startup company where the hedge fund has invested is ready to issue an ICO, the fund hopes to negotiate a discounted price.\n\nThe fund will also invest in projects that support developers in building decentralized applications. Cuban prefers to invest this way, since he does not believe that projects aimed at end users are ready for adoption on a mass scale.\n\nCuban’s entry into the digital currency market\n\nCuban’s investment in 1Confirmation will be his second in the virtual currency market. He had previously invested in digital currency tokens being sold by his portfolio company Unikrn. He also announced that he intends to buy cryptocurrencies directly and to invest in a third digital currency-related project in the near future.\n\nCuban is the majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team and star of the investing-themed reality television show ""Shark Tank.""', ""There are many reasons to get excited about LND and similar projects. It is by far one of the biggest developments taking place in cryptocurrency right now.\n\nIt is certainly true the cryptocurrency ecosystem can use some major improvements. Especially where exchanges are concerned, as they are a bottleneck more often than not. With the new LND client, centralized services may soon become obsolete. The new client includes a Litecoin Operation Mode. It can switch back and forth between Litecoin and Bitcoin chains and wallet backends accordingly. We are one step closer to atomic swaps between these two popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nLND can prove to be a very valuable tool in the hands of the right people. Having a semi-convenient option to perform cross-chain atomic swaps is quite intriguing. Especially when this functionality is provided between Bitcoin and Litecoin. Although this will not replace centralized exchanges overnight, it brings us one step closer to decentralized trading. In the latest version of LND, the Litecoin Operating Mode has been added. With support for both BTC and LTC in place, the future looks pretty bright for atomic swaps.\n\nNew LND Update Makes Litecoin More Appealing\n\nUsers of the client can switch between both chains with a toggle. It also lays the groundwork for a multi-chain operating mode in the future. Right now, the LND team is working on this implementation, but there is no official ETA at this time. Multi-chain support allows the management of payment channels on both Bitcoin and Litecoin at the same time. Once that is achieved, people can start experimenting with cross-chain atomic swaps between both cryptocurrencies. It is a very interesting development to look forward to, to say the least.\n\nThis development has Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin excited as well. Bringing more functionality to Litecoin remains one of his main priorities. Being the first to perform atomic swaps with Bitcoin will certainly give LTC a market advantage. Although it remains to be seen if there is any real demand for this service, one shouldn’t dismiss the possibilities either. Lee also mentioned how he will be testing the Lightning Network on the LTC main net. Good things are happening behind the scenes of Litecoin, to say the least.\n\nI'm working with @MLPFrank and @TheRealXinxi today to test out Lightning on Litecoin mainnet. Any real litecoins lost will be worth it! ? — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) August 23, 2017\n\nAssuming all of these tests will be successful, the cryptocurrency world will be shaken up considerably. Instant payments and more privacy are just two of the potential outcomes for Litecoin. Cross-chain atomic swaps with Bitcoin are only the first step as well. In the future, it should become possible to perform similar swaps with any other block chain-based currency or token in the world. There are many reasons to get excited about LND and similar projects. It is by far one of the biggest developments taking place in cryptocurrency right now.""]"
08/25/2017,"['Uncle Sam has Bitcoin traders on the radar these days, as the cryptocurrency passes $4,300 in late August trading.\n\nWith more assets pouring into digital currencies, the federal government, via the Internal Revenue Service, is looking to get its fair share from Bitcoin -- a cut that the IRS doesn\'t believe it\'s been getting until now.\n\nThat could change, and fast, as the IRS is using a software program that monitors Bitcoin-based digital addresses, in a campaign to identify potential tax evaders.\n\nUsing a customized software program from Chainalysis, a blockchain data analysis firm in New York City, the IRS expects to extract more intelligence -- and potentially more fraud -- from virtual currency movements through the blockchain and centralized currency exchanges. Chainalysis says it\'s able to track approximately 50% of all Bitcoin activity, and 4 million additional Bitcoin addresses, more than enough to get an accurate gauge on who\'s hiding cash from the IRS.\n\nAre you investing in cryptocurrency? Don\'t miss TheStreet\'s coverage:\n\n""The IRS is under pressure to increase compliance in digital coin tax reporting based on an audit done by the US inspector general, and has taken other steps to identify unreported digital currency transactions such as a John Doe request of Coinbase and a survey of filed returns,"" explains Randy Tarpey, a digital currency tax specialist at Sickler Tarpey & Associates, in Tyrone, Pa.\n\nWith no third-party tax reporting to the IRS currently available, the agency has no automatic way to enforce or encourage tax reporting compliance other than 1099-K reporting which only covers a few taxpayers, Tarpey says. ""While taxpayers can initially avoid reporting digital coin transactions the blockchain is public, and once enforcement begins, transactions are easily obtained,"" he notes.\n\nThe nature of Bitcoin makes it difficult to track in some respects, says Dean Anastos, CEO at Blockchain Developers in New York City.\n\nBitcoin.\n\n""Bitcoin itself is based on technology that makes its ledger public,"" Anastos says. ""Essentially all the transactions taking place within its infrastructure is viewable by anyone analyzing the blockchain.""\n\nBut what\'s not so easily identifiable is the user themselves, he says.\n\n""However, the IRS would always have the capability to track the transactions to a possible point of sale where the delivery of a product or service has taken place for the particular Bitcoin user being scrutinized,"" Anastos explains. ""But this particular strategy doesn\'t work well with Bitcoin users who are able to make use of something called tumblers - blockchain services that obfuscate the source of transactions by mixing them up with other transactions, making it difficult to trace transactions.""\n\n""The promise of cryptocurrency was a paperless, transparent, but anonymous way of conducting financial transactions,"" states Norm Pattis, a best-selling legal author and a cryptocurrency specialist. ""Needless to say, taxing authorities find that threatening, and the regulatory net is tightening.""\n\nBitcoin is regarded as property and not a currency by the IRS, Pattis explains. ""As property, it is taxable as a capital gain when converted into cash or a cash equivalent,"" he says. ""Given Bitcoin\'s volatility, determining the tax basis will be a headache for those who dip in and out of the Bitcoin market.""\n\nAs Bitcoin becomes more popular and is trusted as a medium of exchange, the federal government will no doubt come to regard it as income, Pattis adds. ""Nothing of value lies beyond the grip of the taxman for long,"" he says. ""The whining you hear coming from your computer is Bitcoin gasping for breath as the taxman squeezes.""\n\nThere are ways to avoid the taxman, Pattis says. ""While tracing IP addresses will snare the causal user of Bitcoin, those determined to cover their tracks can use scrambling devices and the dark net to evade detection,"" he says.\n\nThe Bitcoin exchanges can provide more transparency to thwart fraudulent activity, Tarpey says, and help keep the Bitcoin market clear of tax cheats.\n\n""Bitcoin is typically taxed as property and reported annually on Schedule D as capital gain or loss when Bitcoin is cashed in,"" he states. ""Bitcoin that is not cashed is not taxed until the gain or loss is realized. Miner Bitcoins are taxed as business revenue when transferred to the miner.""\n\nBut exchanges could and should report gains or losses on IRS Form 1099-B, just like stocks and bonds. ""This small change would assist taxpayers to comply with tax law they may be unintentional overlooking,"" Tarpey adds.\n\n""Digital currency is growing rapidly and has many valid uses and avid supporters. Tax filing for digital currency needs to be improved for everyone\'s benefit,"" Tarpey says.\n\nDon\'t miss these top stories on TheStreet:', 'Bitcoin (BTC) transaction delays and fees are increasingly thought to be the result of Antpool mining empty blocks.\n\nMultiple reports surfacing on social media pin the blame for the slow rate of approvals on miners deliberately not including SegWit transactions.\n\nSo #Bitcoin Mempool is 27 MB deep w/ 44,000 transaction backlog but here is the BIG BLOCK cheerleader @BITMAINtech mining EMPTY BLOCKS pic.twitter.com/qSPyeWy4I0 — Tone Vays [#NO2X] (@ToneVays) August 24, 2017\n\nThe practice would cut capacity, increasing waiting times and driving up fees.\n\nData from Blockchain.info on blocks found post-SegWit activation suggests Antpool, the largest Bitcoin mining pool, is circumventing SegWit transactions despite losing revenue.\n\n“Normally miners will confirm as many transactions as they can, because when they confirm one they earn the transaction fees from that transaction,” one explanation reads.\n\n“Antpool has given up $100,000+ in transaction fees in the last 24 hours alone by not confirming as many transactions as they can.”\n\nThe figure calculated by one Reddit user suggests Antpool missed out on $102,400 in fees in the past 24 hours alone.\n\nThe motivation behind boycotting SegWit transactions lies in suspected use of ASICBOOST by miners, a function which manufacturer Bitmain had previously denounced.\n\n“[Using ASICBOOST], however profitable, is not something we would do for the greater good of Bitcoin,” the company wrote in a blog post in April.', ""Bitcoin's pricehas remained largely around the $4,000 mark over the last three weeks, but experts remain divided about the price hitting $5,000.\n\nIt soared to a record high of $4,500 on August 18, with prices jumping 40 per cent in this month alone, a positive response to cryptocurrency splitting into two different currencies.\n\nAn offshoot called Bitcoin Cash was created following a split between bitcoin backers on how to take the currency forward, in an event known as hard fork.\n\nThe real impact of the split on prices will be seen in November, when a fundamental change to operating the cryptocurrency will take place."", 'Following shipment and setup, MGT\'s Bitcoin mining operations are expected to generate $1.1 million in monthly revenue, assuming current pricing and difficulty rates.

Still, they also cautioned that, while SegWit lays the foundation for Lightning, standards are needed to connect work that\'s already been done.\n\n""The specification is mostly complete, with minor amendments and inconsistencies that we are figuring out,"" said Blockstream engineer Christian Decker, co-author of an early Lightning research paper at ETH Zurich.\n\nPut another way, if each Lightning implementation used different technologies, then the networks wouldn\'t be able to ""talk"" with one another, and thus wouldn\'t be useful for sending payments across the network.

These tasks are to be completed by June and September of 2019, respectively.\n\nThe plan is a fulfillment of a 2016 report that the nation was considering taking a more open stance to cryptocurrency and other disruptive financial technologies.\n\nThe move toward legalizing bitcoin represents a change of heart from the Vietnamese government. As early as 2014, the State Bank of Vietnam had stated the cryptocurrency was not a valid form of payment or settlement within the nation. The government issued repeated warnings about bitcoin in the years that followed, although it did not prohibit its citizens from using cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, however, the State Bank created a FinTech steering committee to promote the development of Vietnamese financial technology startups.\n\nMany people anticipate bitcoin will flourish in Vietnam. As one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, many of its citizens now have access to smartphones but have never utilized traditional banks.\n\nVietnam joins several other nations in the Eastern Hemisphere who have recently begun considering bitcoin legalization. Earlier this month, the National Bank of Ukraine announced it would develop a legal framework for bitcoin regulation, while the Philippines just approved the registration of two bitcoin exchanges. India, however, continues to dissuade its citizens from using cryptocurrency, even as local exchanges have seen demand surge in 2017.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The crypto-currency boom is in full swing. The explosion in price and quantity of new digital tokens is so bonkers even its evangelists are calling the market a ticking time-bomb.\n\nBitcoin\'s gain 1,323%\n\nIt\'s also tempting the establishment to get in on the act. For the Republic of Estonia, it\'s being touted as a way to raise a sovereign wealth fund -- an imaginative leap for a country with a population one-sixth the size of New York City\'s and one of the highest levels of mobile broadband penetration in the world.\n\nA Bitcoin-Ready Nation? Wireless mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, Q2 2016 Source: OECD\n\nA proposal by Estonia\'s agency in charge of ""e-residency"" applications (more on this later) has suggested raising money by selling ""estcoins"" to the public.\n\nThe wealth could then be managed via a public-private partnership; a chunk might be poured into venture capital to support domestic start-ups. Holders of estcoins would have a stake in the fund and a say in how it is run. The tokens might then become a viable currency, so the thinking goes, paying for goods and services in a euro-zone country.\n\nThis seems like a bid to add financial firepower to a tiny economy whose capital markets are under-developed and eclipsed by loans from foreign banks. More than 90% of the Estonian market is controlled by foreign firms like Swedbank, SEB and Nordea, according to investment bank Redgate Capital.\n\nA Gap To Fill Estonia\'s banking market is highly concentrated and dwarfs under-developed capital markets Source: Redgate Capital\n\nEstonia lacks the natural resources of Norway or Qatar, but has reinvented itself as digitally savvy economy that\'s open for business: corporate and income tax rates are less than the OECD average, it ranks twelfth globally in terms of ease of doing business and allows anyone in the world to become an ""e-resident"" and start a company. With Estonia\'s e-population apparently growing faster than the domestic birth rate, tapping this group for funds must be a temptation.\n\nHot Market, Burnt Fingers Bitcoin trackers reflect the crypto-currency boom, where daily price swings can be huge Source: Bloomberg\n\nBut there are huge risks here. The price of crypto-currencies is incredibly volatile: Bitcoin has jumped 340 percent year-to-date, and in 2013 it once fell 50 percent overnight.\n\nIn theory, an estcoin would be backed by hard assets like infrastructure projects or cash flows from investments, so might be easier to value.\n\nIn practice, there\'s no telling how these coins would trade and how they might destabilize Estonia\'s economy and politics. Would this new coin create two classes of citizens, depending on whether their savings were in euros or estcoins? Would Estonia repay debts in either currency, or both? Any outsized influence of foreigners who are also e-residents might lead to extra friction -- imagine a deep-pocketed overseas investor owning more than half of the republic\'s flag-waving token.\n\nA sovereign crypto-currency backed by people whose personal details are stored online would also surely be a juicy magnet for hackers and criminals.\n\nThe estcoin proposal seems to be leaning towards Ethereum as technology of choice and has received feedback from its founder, Vitalik Buterin -- who has also been in contact with Vladimir Putin about Russia\'s own crypto ambitions.\n\nEthereum has a choppy history of community-managed investment funds: One such experiment, the DAO, was hacked in a $55 million digital heist. Estonia also has a history of being targeted by cyber-attacks. In 2007, banks, media outlets and government bodies were forced offline. Estonia blamed Russia, which denied involvement. People might also target estcoins to bypass the regulated banking system.\n\nA $120 Billion Market Market capitalization of the top five crypto-currencies Source: Coincap\n\nThis is a proposal that\'s still at the conceptual stage, and the agency involved acknowledges there are risks that need to be addressed before taking any step forward. There\'s little doubt that in the current mood of crypto-enthusiasm, where millions are being thrown at dubious business propositions, an estcoin would succeed in raising money.

08/26/2017,"['The rising tide for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple have lately shaken the investing world. Among the lot, bitcoin has been firing on all cylinders since the beginning of 2017, having hit a series record highs. In three months, the price of the digital currency has surged about 94%.\n\nInvestors should note that bitcoins are ‘mined’ by using a greater amount of computer processing power. However, since there is a fixed amount of bitcoins, as the limit is reached, it becomes hard to ‘mine’ for the coins. The best part of this system is that it is beyond the reach of central banks (read: Explaining Bitcoin and Crypto Currency).\n\nThe currency is in the limelight probably because of the fact that “bitcoin isn’t regulated by any government and has been used by consumers worldwide to shelter assets from inflation or political upheavals in their home countries.” As per an article published on CNBC, bitcoin is emerging as a safe haven asset like gold.\n\nsource: coindesk.com\n\nNeedless to say, amid a sky-high price rise, the digital currency is gaining favor from ETF issuers, though the SEC is no quite happy with the concept. After rejecting the filing for an ETF on this cryptocurrency by Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, the SEC is reviewing its decision once again.\n\nThe SEC is seemingly looking for more proof of safety in this trade. Meanwhile, some more ETF issuers have lined up to seek regulatory approval with their bitcoin-related products (read: Will We Finally See a Bitcoin ETF?).\n\nInside New Filings\n\nInvestment firm VanEck filed for an exchange-traded fund to invest in bitcoin derivatives in mid-August. Though VanEck acknowledged the riskiness of the product and believes that this digital currency is no match to gold as far as safe-haven status is concerned, the issuer could not overlook bitcoin’s monumental craze (read: Bitcoin Skyrockets, Race to First Cryptocurrency ETF Heats Up).\n\nVanEck noted that the digital currency cannot even replace the necessity of the dollar, rather it is likely to end up in carving a place for itself as a niche product. VanEck’s proposed product will invest in certain Bitcoin Instruments through the Subsidiary and the investment in that subsidiary is likely to be limited to 25% of the portfolio, thus meaningfully lowering the risks.\n\nAfter VanEck, ETF Firm REX also planned a new fund that will invest in bitcoin-based derivatives. There are two products filed by REX, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. The ticker codes and expense ratios of those funds are yet to be disclosed.\n\nAs per the filing, the long fund “seeks to achieve its investment objective, under normal circumstances, by obtaining investment exposure to an actively managed portfolio of financial instruments providing long exposure to movements in the value of bitcoin, together with an actively managed portfolio of fixed income instruments” while the short fund is intended to offer the negative exposure of the same asset.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nThe tussle between the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and Winklevoss over the launch has been going on for about three years. In fact, the issuer has restructured the proposal for the Bitcoin ETF multiple times.\n\nHowever, it looks like that the SEC may approve a fund in the coming days given rising pressure from issuers. Plus, the Russian government is also expected to make cryptocurrencies legal financial instruments in 2018, as per the source. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari pointed to the strength of the blockchain technology supporting bitcoin.', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\nJackson Hole Symposium is starting today. Though the equity markets are calm heading into the meeting of the central bankers, analysts will closely watch every statement of the US Fed chair Janet Yellen and the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.\n\nIt will be interesting to note whether the cryptocurrencies also respond to their speeches. Let’s see what the important levels to watch are in case of a rally or a fall following the central banker’s rhetoric.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nBitcoin is close to retesting the lifetime high at $4469. A breakout and close above this level will signal strength, and a rally towards the upper end of the channel at about $4630 levels is likely.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency breaks out of the channel, chances are that price will rise vertically, but the rally is unlikely to be sustained. Therefore, in case of a breakout above $4630, traders should trail their stops closely. The next target should be reaching the psychologically important level of $5000, which should act as a strong resistance.\n\nTraders who are long from lower levels should book partial profits and continue to hold their remaining positions with close stop losses, because there is always resistance at the previous lifetime highs.\n\nWe don’t recommend initiating new positions at the current levels because the risk-reward is not attractive, as the logical stop loss is way deeper at about $3900 levels. Until the digital currency breaks down and closes below the channel, it remains in an uptrend.\n\nETH/USD\n\nWe had advised a stop loss of $280 to our readers who had gone long on our recommendation at $330 levels. As the price has moved above our buy levels, we want to further reduce our risk. We, now, recommend a stop loss of $290, below which the digital currency is likely to fall to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $247.\n\nThe cryptocurrency will pick up momentum once it breaks out of $345 levels. Its first target objective is $381, above which a move to $400 is also possible.\n\nHowever, traders are requested to raise their stops to $310 levels as soon as Ethereum breaks out of $345, and thereafter trail stops higher to protect their profits.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nWe were correct to avoid chasing the price higher. According to our expectation, Bitcoin Cash has remained range bound. Though it doesn’t have a long history, after a sharp upmove from the lows of $190.1 on Aug. 06 to the intraday highs of $387.2 on Aug. 8, the cryptocurrency went into a correction/consolidation for the next eight days, before breaking out on Aug. 17.\n\nThe current leg of the correction is in its sixth day. We may see another two days of range bound action before the next move up or down.\n\nWe don’t see any reliable buy setups on Bitcoin Cash, therefore, we are not recommending any new positions. However, aggressive traders can buy a successful retest of $550 levels or a breakout above $736 with close stop losses.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nRipple scaled our first target objective and came close to our second target; however, it could not reach it. Therefore, traders should always trail their stops higher.\n\nWhat can the traders expect now?\n\nIn the present correction, the digital currency has found support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rise from $0.14749 to the highs of $0.29800. If it reverses direction and moves above $0.24000 levels, a rally to $0.28000 levels is likely.\n\nTherefore, aggressive traders can enter on a breakout above $0.24000 and keep a stop loss below $0.20100, because a breakdown below $0.20166 will be negative and the fall can extend to $0.17970.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency is volatile, please keep the allocation size small.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nWe had recommended a trade on a breakout above $50, as we were expecting a move to $65, however, Litecoin is currently facing resistance near the earlier highs. Traders who have initiated long positions on our advice should keep a stop loss of $46. We don’t want to hold the digital currency if it again falls back below $50 levels.\n\nNevertheless, as long as LTC sustains above the $50 levels, it signals strength and a move to $65 is likely.', ""About The Author\n\nDariusz is a Digital Anthropologist who has been closely following the world of cryptocurrencies since 2014. He has been somewhat of a crypto-evangelist, trying to educate more people on the exciting realm of cryptocurrency. During his time at University College London, his Master's dissertation focused on how communities inhabit, modify, and create virtual places via social media."", 'Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has reportedly authorized a plan that could lead to the official recognition of digital currencies like Bitcoin as a form of payment in the country by 2018.\n\nBased on a report by regional news services VNA, the prime minister has ordered the country’s central bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Public Safety to study and draft a legal framework to regulate virtual currencies.\n\nThe assessment process is due for completion in August 2018. The preparation of legal documents needed for the recognition of cryptocurrencies under a regulatory framework should also be finalized by the end of the year.\n\nEmbracing digital currencies\n\nSimultaneously, Vietnamese officials are mandated to work on a taxation system for digital currencies. The system, which will determine how virtual currency users in the country will be taxed, is due for implementation in June 2019.\n\nMoreover, proposals on how to prevent and handle violations concerning the use of cryptocurrencies should be submitted for approval by September of the same year.\n\nThe plan also calls for the amendment of the 2015 Civil Code’s property rights provisions to include rules aimed at safeguarding Vietnam’s property rights. The amendment is expected to improve the protection of the rights and interests of both domestic and foreign investors.\n\nComplete turnaround\n\nThe latest moves by the Vietnamese government to embrace digital currencies are a complete turnaround from the cautious viewpoint it expressed in 2014.\n\nDuring that time, the country’s central bank has strongly warned consumers against the use of the cryptocurrencies. It reiterated that users would have no protection if they suffer investment losses. The bank has also prohibited credit institutions from offering any services related to virtual currencies.', 'The bitcoin price slipped 2% on Saturday, falling below $4,300 after briefly testing its all-time high. The ethereum price was stable at about $335, while bitcoin cash dipped 3% to $626. Ordinarily, this would have led to a minor market contraction, but strong showings from the Monero and Dash prices provided it with the support it needed to maintain its record level.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fluctuated throughout the day, but the altcoin markets ultimately gave it a 24-hour boost of $400 million. At present, the total value of all cryptocurrencies is $155 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Slips Below $4,300\n\nThe bitcoin price had risen 4% on Friday, giving investors hope that it would cross $4,500 for the for the first time. That appeared possible early in the day, as the bitcoin price rose past $4,450 heading into the evening. Unfortunately, the bitcoin price began to dip at about 20:00 UTC, and it continued its gradual decline on Saturday. At present, the bitcoin price is $4,284, which translates into a $70.8 billion market cap.\n\nNevertheless, many analysts anticipate the bitcoin price rally will continue in the coming months. Gatecoin CEO Aurelien Menant forecasts that bitcoin will reach $5,000 by the end of the year, while Wall Street strategist Tom Lee predicts it will cross $6,000 by mid-2018.\n\nDash Price Roars to $400\n\nThe total crypto market cap owes its stability to the Monero and Dash prices, which have both experienced record-setting rallies in August. Last month, the Dash price was $200. It gradually increased throughout the weeks that followed, eventually punching through $300 on August 20. It hovered around the $300 level for most of the week, but a surge in trading on Bithumb thrust Dash above $400 to set a new all-time high of $409 on Saturday morning. The Dash price has pulled back a bit since then and currently sits at $387. This gives Dash a market cap of $2.9 billion, planting it firmly in 5th place on the market cap charts.\n\nOne factor influencing Dash’s rapid ascent is a potential television sponsorship proposed by RT host Max Keiser. Keiser, a long-time cryptocurrency proponent, offered Dash a full sponsorship for his new show, The Great American Pilgrimage, in exchange for 2,000 Dash ($775,000 at time of writing).\n\nMonero Price Climbs Another 45%\n\nDash was not the only privacy-centric altcoin to soar to climb the charts this week. The Monero price has nearly tripled since Bithumb–the world’s highest-volume cryptocurrency exchange–announced it would add XMR trading pairs.\n\nOn Friday, the Monero price surpassed $100 for the first time, but its rally did not stop there. This morning, the Monero price climbed another 45%, lifting it to a record $146. At present, the Monero price is $140, resulting in a market cap of $2.1 billion. There are now nine cryptocurrencies with market caps exceeding $2 billion.\n\nBitcoin Market Share Tapers to 46%\n\nYesterday, bitcoin’s share of the total market cap had climbed back to 47% after an early week decline. However, Dash and Monero each took a small bite out of bitcoin’s share, reducing it to 46% on Saturday.\n\nEthereum continues to account for about 20% of the market, while Ripple’s share has tapered to 5.3% after soaring earlier in the week. Dash’s market share is quickly approaching 2%, while Monero’s has risen to 1.4%.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BitPay, the automated payment processing system for Bitcoin which enables online merchants to accept bitcoins, has just announced its support for SegWit2x via the company blog.\n\nThe statement indicated that the BitPay platform would remain in sync with the majority chain of Bitcoin. Based on the miner signals for SegWit2x, BitPay is assuming that the block size increase will occur, and must therefore be prepared. Founder Stephen Pair said:\n\n“We need one Blockchain to serve as a backbone. That Blockchain must be secure and its asset must be liquid. The backbone network must also be highly available. This high-availability requirement means that we must remain in sync with the hash-rate majority chain. Block production on a minority fork of Bitcoin would be inconsistent, and it may cease to operate without emergency measures. Such a service interruption is unacceptable for us and for our users.”\n\nThe announcement also acknowledged that the Bitcoin Core platform does not accept SegWit2x.\n\nCore vs. miners?\n\nThe internal debate between Bitcoin Core and miners has grown to a fever pitch, with wallets like Bitwala now refusing to support the New York Agreement (NYA) for SegWit2x.\n\nHowever, other wallets like Breadwallet have indicated their intention to follow the majority chain like BitPay.\n\nShould SegWit2x activate and increase block size, per the NYA, the implications for Bitcoin are still to be determined. Whether it ends with a ‘three Bitcoin’ solution or is accepted remains a point of risk and will continue to hamper price increases and stability.', 'First Bitcoin Capital (BITCF), a publicly-traded bitcoin firm headquartered in Vancouver, has issued a statement responding to its SEC suspension. In the note, they attribute the suspension to a “misunderstanding” that should be resolved quickly.\n\nSEC Suspends Publicly-Traded First Bitcoin Capital\n\nYesterday, CCN reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had temporarily suspended trading of BITCF, effective August 24 at 9:30 am EDT until at least 11:59 am on September 7. BITCF–which is traded over-the counter–has soared more than 6,000% in 2017 and was priced at $1.79 at the time of the suspension.\n\nThe suspension was pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the SEC referenced concerns about the “lack of publicly available information about the company, including…the value of BITCF’s assets and its capital structure.”\n\nShortly after the suspension began, corporate litigation boutique Bronstein, Gerwitz & Grossman announced they are investigating potential claims on behalf of BITCF shareholders.\n\nFirst Bitcoin Capital Responds to SEC Suspension\n\nNow, First Bitcoin Capital has issued a letter to shareholders commenting on the temporary SEC suspension.\n\nIn the letter, they state that they believe the matter is a misunderstanding and that they have retained counsel to work with the SEC and had previously begun working to move toward a fully-reporting, audited status.\n\nWe believe that there is likely a misunderstanding or a simple clarification necessary and that it would have been better for the SEC to ask us for this information before taking such drastic action. In fact, the SEC was so hurried in stopping trading that they inadvertently left in the symbol of another company (CIAU) as if our symbol which has nothing to do with BITCF.\n\nThey further stated that, despite the suspension, their “internal growth will continue unabated” because the company “has not accessed the capital markets from the day we began developing cryptocurrencies until this day.”\n\nBITCF is extremely rare in this regard for an OTC company as most are dilution machines designed either to grow their company or unjustly enrich management and promoters. Our management has never sold one share of our stock in spite of the meteoric rise in price per share.\n\nFinally, they dismissed law firm investigations into BITCF as stunts intended for “publicity and finding new clients.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The withdrawal of funds from stocks and precious metals has coincided with the massive price increase of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It seems that investors have realized that Bitcoin is a more stable ‘store of value’ investment than gold.\n\nCNBC has reported that the stock market has seen the largest withdrawal rate since 2004, with more than $30 bln being taken out of the markets over the past 10 weeks. The major withdrawal also included a huge abandoning of precious metals.\n\nPrecious metals at loss\n\nPrivate client allocation to precious metals has seen a massive reduction, with portfolios holding 10 percent in 2013 being reduced to below two percent in recent weeks.\n\n(source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, EPFR Global)\n\nThe precious metals investment decline has coincided with a removal of funds from the stock market overall, with investors choosing to pull back from the market, though the market continues to post gains. Concerns about current market levels and monetization policies may be fueling to flight.\n\nCrypto-investment opportunities\n\nBlockchain technology is producing new investment opportunities. Companies like LAToken and MyBit have developed methods for tokenizing investments, making it possible for large-scale investments to be purchased by smaller scale investors.\n\nThe decentralized platform of these companies makes it possible for investors to participate without the higher fees associated with traditional markets. LAToken has even produced a system where shares of Apple, Amazon and other blue chip stocks can be ‘tokenized’ and purchased in part by investors. CEO of LA Token Valentin Preobrazhenskiy says:\n\n“We build a NASDAQ on Blockchain with a wider range of tradable assets, blurring the boundaries between crypto- and real economies, and offering our clients a dramatic reduction of listing costs, settlement time, and transaction costs.”\n\nWhether the tokenized asset market is viable or not remains to be seen, but the flight of investors from stocks and precious metals has pressed the need for new and innovative vehicles for investors.', 'Chinese electrical appliances manufacturer, the Midea Group, has filed a patent for a technique for mining Bitcoin using household products. The patent application was published earlier in 2017 by the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of the People’s Republic of China.\n\nBased on the patent application, Midea plans to embed specialized mining chips inside its appliance products like air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and TV for the purpose of digital currency mining.

They were vocal on social media about investing in bitcoin. They got hacked—and their bitcoins disappeared. In some cases, seven figures’ worth.\n\nThat seems less secure than having gold or cash in your safe at home, buried in your backyard, or in a safe deposit box. It seems less secure than buying an expensive watch and insuring it.\n\nI thought the whole point of bitcoin was security, right?\n\nThere are a lot of facets to bitcoin.\n\nCapital Controls\n\nI tweeted out The New York Times article, and then somebody quote-tweeted me:\n\nYes, if you are living in Venezuela and you have all your money in bolivars, you are pretty unhappy. And if you were living in Cyprus and had your money in banks during the bail-in, you are pretty unhappy.\n\nWould bitcoin have solved your problems? Possibly.\n\nCertainly in Cyprus’ case, other things would have solved your problems, too—like gold!\n\nAdmittedly, gold may be no help in Venezuela because the rule of law has broken down and there is no way to defend it. So yes, in Venezuela, bitcoin may have helped.\n\nYou know what else would have helped? Getting out of the country! If you are sitting in Venezuela with all your bitcoin, you are still pretty unhappy. It sucks there.\n\nPeople spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to protect their wealth from inflation, expropriation, and so on. There are a million ways to skin this cat… piles of cash, gold, diamonds, jewelry, other hard assets, and now bitcoin.\n\nEach of these ways has advantages and disadvantages. (But never tell a bitcoin promoter that bitcoin has disadvantages.)\n\nThe main advantage of bitcoin is that you can easily move money across national borders. Try doing that with cash. Bitcoin just sits in your digital wallet, and when you settle in your new country, you sell it and convert it into currency. Theoretically, you could move your entire liquid net worth in this fashion.\n\nIt’s an open secret that Chinese people have been busy smurfing as much wealth as they can out of the country with bitcoin. I bet that if China could figure out a way to stop it, they would.\n\nBut let’s talk about the disadvantages.\n\nUber Shady\n\nI am not a technophobe, but I am not a technophile, either. Bitcoin seems hard. I certainly don’t claim to know enough about technology to guarantee the security of my bitcoin.\n\nSo far in bitcoin’s short history, we’ve had an exchange get hacked, and widespread hacking of digital wallets. You could protect your bitcoin by having a “hardware wallet,” an external hard drive that’s not connected to the web, but that kind of defeats the purpose. You’re then no better off than you were with gold.\n\nNot to mention the fact that bitcoin is used for a lot of shady stuff, like trafficking of all manner of contraband on the dark web. Hey, I’m all for personal liberty and anonymous financial transactions, but as my grandmother used to say, “you lay down with dogs, you get fleas.”\n\nYou might remember discussions from a year or two ago about how Larry Summers (and others) want to eliminate cash, because cash facilitates criminal activity. Yes, it does—but nowhere near to the extent of bitcoin!\n\nIf I were to guess, I’d say that the volume of criminal activity facilitated by bitcoin could be orders of magnitude bigger than the criminal activity facilitated by cash.\n\nWhich is why, one day, bitcoin will be made illegal.\n\nA bitcoin enthusiast will say making it illegal doesn’t really do anything. The government can’t stop bitcoin.\n\nThis is true with lots of things, like drugs. Drugs are everywhere, but they are still illegal. Once you make something illegal, you drive it underground, and you delegitimize it.\n\nSo while it would be exceedingly rare for anyone to be caught and prosecuted for using illegal bitcoin, dreams of it becoming an “alternate currency” would be shattered. Then it really would only be for criminals.\n\nNone of this sounds like anything I want to be a part of. The government can ban gold, but I can’t see the federal government going door-to-door and searching for gold like they did in the 1930s.\n\nAnd besides… before it even got to that point, you should have left the country!\n\nRun!\n\nThe foolproof way to protect your wealth is to leave for a jurisdiction that will treat it with more respect. There were reports that the number of people renouncing their citizenship increased under Obama. It will be interesting to see what happens under Trump.\n\nThe point is to get out before the walls go up. That’s unlikely to happen in the United States, with its stable democracy and strong institutions. But it never hurts to be a little paranoid—Venezuela only took a couple of decades to go from stable democracy to communist basket case.\n\nIt’s good to have a plan. It’s no fun coming up with a plan when everyone else is trying to come up with a plan at the same time.\n\nBack in the 2000s, I had a thing for Greece. I watched The Bourne Identity, and at the end of the movie, Matt Damon finds Franka Potente renting bicycles on some remote Greek island, completely off the grid.\n\nThat sounded pretty attractive to me. I even remember looking up some Greek real estate at my desk at Lehman Brothers. It was 2003. Bear markets make you think of some crazy stuff.']"
08/27/2017,"['The price of a Bitcoin broke $4,000 this month. It’s up 400% in 2017, and only two years ago it stood at around $230. With 16.5 million Bitcoins in “circulation,” and the potential for 4.5 million more, the market value of Bitcoin is now a whopping $72 billion. Sister currency Ethereum is worth another $32 billion.\n\nEarly Snapchat investor Jeremy Liew thinks Bitcoin will reach $500,000 by 2030. Tech eccentric John McAfee believes it’ll take only three years. That’s $1 trillion of digital coins. Now companies with an idea...', ""Bitcoin Cash (Bcash or BCH) has been more profitable to mine than Bitcoin (BTC) on multiple occasions over the past week or two. This is creating a new dynamic within Bitcoin’s ecosystem — one which is not really beneficial for either coin.\n\n\n\nIn Bitcoin Magazine's previous article on this topic, we explained why Bcash mining should normally not affect Bitcoin too much, aside from the incidental higher fees and slower confirmations. We also explained why this dynamic could, in the meantime, ruin Bcash, as it should freeze that blockchain in its tracks.\n\nWe also noted that Bcash has a built-in emergency solution to mitigate the risk, which could get its blockchain moving again. But this solution does assume either that some miners are choosing to act against their own short-term interest at certain times for the benefit of all miners — or that miners are coordinating for their mutual benefit, on some level.\n\nNow, several days later, it appears that this is what’s happening. Some miners are either acting against their short-term interests for specific periods of time — or they are coordinating to trigger the emergency solution.\n\n\n\nThe good news for Bcash is that this means its blockchain is still in motion for now, at least on most days. But at the same time, the dynamic generated by the emergency solution is benefiting its miners overall, more than anyone else — and it’s even calling into question the long-term viability of Bitcoin Cash itself.\n\nThe Emergency Difficulty Adjustment\n\nFirst, a brief recap of Bitcoin mining and Bcash’s built-in emergency solution.\n\nMining profitability is determined by the value of the block reward (newly mined coins plus transaction fees) and the “difficulty” to mine a block. If the value of the block rewards are higher and the difficulty is lower, miners make more money.\n\nThe difficulty on both Bitcoin and Bcash self-adjusts each time 2016 blocks are mined. If it takes longer than two weeks to mine these 2016 blocks, difficulty adjusts downward so it becomes easier to mine. If it takes less than two weeks, the difficulty adjusts upward so it becomes harder.\n\nBcash really needs its difficulty to be low enough to match the value of its block rewards in relation to Bitcoin. So, if Bcash's block reward is worth 15 percent of Bitcoin’s block reward, Bcash’s difficulty must also be 15 percent of Bitcoin’s difficulty, or lower. Otherwise, Bitcoin will be more profitable to mine, and miners will really have no reason ever to return to Bcash, leaving the Bcash blockchain frozen in its tracks.\n\nThe big problem is that, as long as Bcash’s block rewards do not exceed Bitcoin’s block rewards, this is bound to happen sooner or later. At some point, Bcash difficulty will exceed what its block reward will be worth, at which point all miners should leave.\n\nTo mitigate this problem, Bcash implemented a feature called the “emergency difficulty adjustment” (EDA). If in a space of at least twelve hours, fewer than six blocks are mined, the difficulty adjusts downwards by 20 percent for the next block. If miners coordinate or time this well, this can bring difficulty down by about 75 percent within a day.\n\nThe Problems\n\nWhile triggering the EDA is preferable over a blockchain frozen in its tracks forever, it does present new problems.\n\nOnce difficulty is low enough, profit-maximizing miners are incentivized to jump on Bcash mining, producing an enormous number of blocks before difficulty adjusts within a day or two. Then, once the difficulty adjusts upward by a lot, and all these miners will switch back to Bitcoin — until some miners trigger Bcash’s EDA again, potentially after 12 hours or so, and all miners hop back on Bcash, creating a sort of stop-and-go cycle, on repeat.\n\nIn our previous article, we noted that this stop-and-go cycle is not ideal for users. But we didn’t go into specifics about what problems those would be, exactly. And there are a number of them…\n\nFirst of all, this stop-and-go cycle actually causes a disturbance for Bitcoin users as well. Each time miners hop on Bcash, hash power leaves the Bitcoin network, which means that Bitcoin blocks are mined more slowly. As a result, Bitcoin’s transaction fees and confirmation times go up. And the fact that miners are intentionally gaming the system like this, suggests that the situation could drag on for a while: potentially weeks or months, and maybe even longer depending on how Bcash develops.\n\nMeanwhile, this cycle makes Bitcoin Cash confirmation times very unreliable. On some days, transactions confirm very quickly, as blocks are found about every minute. On other days, there are (almost) no new blocks at all for at least 12 hours, and transactions take incredibly long to confirm, by comparison.\n\nArguably, an even bigger problem is that because of this dynamic, Bcash mining rewards — new coins — enter the system much more quickly: currently about four times faster than they are supposed to. As a result, Bcash’s inflation rate is relatively high. While Bitcoin’s current yearly inflation rate sits at about 4 percent, Bcash’s yearly inflation rate is on pace to be closer to 16 percent. This favors miners who earn these coins — at the cost of coin-holders.\n\nWhat’s more, because of this same dynamic, Bcash’s next block halving will arrive much faster as well, possibly around mid 2018 instead of mid 2020. And if nothing changes, there could even be another halving by early 2019: the block reward could fall to 3.125 BCH in just a little over a year from now.\n\nThese halvings is where Bcash’s real problems could begin.\n\nAs perhaps its central value proposition compared to Bitcoin, Bcash wants to keep its transaction fees extremely low; even as low as zero. Therefore, it is not clear that fees will make up for the loss in rewards; it seems especially unlikely that these losses will be made up within a year, if ever. So unless the market price of BCH, compared to BTC, increases by a lot, and fast, the value of Bcash’s block reward could dwindle significantly.\n\nNow, keep in mind that for miners to mine Bcash at all, its difficulty must be even lower than its block reward, compared to Bitcoin, and that if that is the case, all profit-maximizing miners are expected to pile on.\n\nThat means that all these miners will be able to mine the 2016 blocks even faster when they do all pile on Bcash. Instead of two days, it could take them even one day. Or less. Which would, of course, mean that the next block halving will be reached even faster. This would in turn means that the block rewards would be even less valuable, difficulty would needs to be even lower for miners to hop on, and miners would be able to mine the 2016 blocks even faster next time. Maybe even in half a day.\n\nBcash’s EDA could lead to vicious downward spiral, which would significantly decrease Bcash’s security against 51% attacks. It would also make it easier for miners hostile to Bcash to frustrate the system in other ways; for example, they could prevent emergency adjustments from kicking in. Moreover, Bcash could reach the point where its block rewards aren’t even worth the time and effort for miners to switch between chains, and Bcash freezes in its tracks, after all.\n\nBitcoin Cash will need to fix this problem somehow, and by now developers are indeed discussing the issue. Either that, or the coin must become more valuable than Bitcoin to mitigate the problem altogether — fast.\n\nThanks to Johnathan Corgan for feedback."", ""Blockchain analysis has been used by a UC Berkeley PhD candidate to identify sex trafficking rings, through the linking of Bitcoin payments made for online adult advertisements.\n\nCould automation and Blockchain analysis help law enforcers crack down on human traffickers?\n\nStylometry and Blockchain analysis\n\nHuman traffickers often reach their customers through advertisements in sources like Craigslist and Backpage.com.\n\nThe research uses two tools - analyzing the writing style (stylometry) and Blockchain analysis to try and identify human trafficking rings. Machine learning is used to identify adult ads with similar writing styles, which could indicate that they are likely to come from a single source - a trafficking ring.\n\nAmerican Express stopped processing payment for Backpage in 2014, while other credit card processors like Visa and Mastercard stopped in 2015, leaving Bitcoin as the only viable source of payment.\n\nBlockchain analysis is used to link payments made for various ads, again indicating a single source. Demasking these Bitcoin addresses would, however, require enforcement officials taking up additional investigation.\n\nNot foolproof\n\nThe problem with the above method is that it is useful only as long as the traffickers pay from the same wallet and do not attempt to cover their tracks.\n\nBitcoin mixers can easily obfuscate the Blockchain train and prevent linking of transactions. We can expect traffickers to be extra careful and take additional precautions, now that this research has been published.\n\nMoreover, the possibility of false positives is also high. Bitcoins sourced from a particular vendor and then used at Backpage could lead to false suspicions about a trafficking ring.\n\nLinkage of Bitcoin transactions only increases the likelihood of a trafficking ring being present and is not conclusive evidence.\n\nSilk Road experience\n\nWhile human trafficking is a worldwide issue which is always on the radar of law enforcers, drugs are a bigger problem.\n\nWhen Silk Road, the darknet marketplace for drugs was flourishing, it primarily used Bitcoin as a medium of payment.\n\nHowever, the Blockchain trail did not help law enforcers track drug peddlers and shut down the website. Silk Road had its own tumbler which was used to mix Bitcoins.\n\nLaw enforcers could still theoretically find out who bought Bitcoins from exchanges (primarily Mt. Gox at that time) and sent it to Silk Road, but that wouldn't help catch the drug peddlers.\n\nSo the utility of Blockchain analysis in the Silk Road case was limited.\n\nAltcoins\n\nThe increased focus on using the Bitcoin Blockchain to unmask users, for activities ranging from tax evasion to sex trafficking, raises concerns about the privacy of ordinary users.\n\nAltcoins like Monero and Dash with a focus on protecting privacy of users could gain prominence in this scenario.\n\nApart from mixers and CoinJoin transactions in Bitcoin, these altcoins provide cryptocurrency users an easy way to improve privacy."", 'Finance\n\nTwo more bitcoin ETFs have been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “Rex Bitcoin Strategy ETF” and “Rex Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF” are not expected to invest directly in bitcoin. Their investments will include US-listed bitcoin derivatives as well as “an actively managed portfolio of fixed income instruments.”\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin ETF Filed with SEC by Leading Gold Fund Manager Vaneck\n\nBitcoin ETFs Without Bitcoin\n\nTwo bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were filed with the SEC on August 23; Rex Bitcoin Strategy ETF and Rex Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. The former seeks to provide investors with “long exposure” to the price movements of bitcoin, whereas the latter with “short exposure.” The ticker symbols and expense ratios were not disclosed. According to the filing:\n\nThe funds are actively managed and are not expected to invest directly in bitcoin. As such, the funds can be expected to perform differently from the performance of the bitcoin.\n\nFounded in 2014, Rex Shares LLC is the sponsor of the funds. Prior to the filing, the company announced the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary called Rex Capital Management LLC on August 21. Its focus is to develop investment products and strategies related to bitcoin and other digital assets. Rex Capital Management will act as the advisor to the funds.\n\n‘Long’ and ‘Short’ Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe Rex Bitcoin Strategy ETF’s specific SEC filing states that “the fund does not expect to invest directly in bitcoin.” Instead, the fund will invest in “financial instruments that provide exposure to the price movements of bitcoin, including futures contracts linked to the price of bitcoin or an index thereof and that are traded and/or listed in the United States (‘Bitcoin Futures’).” In addition:\n\nThe fund seeks to achieve its investment objective, under normal circumstances, by investing directly and indirectly in an actively managed portfolio of financial instruments providing long exposure to movements in the value of bitcoin, together with an actively managed portfolio of fixed income instruments.\n\nIt will gain significant exposure to bitcoin instruments, the filing claims, by investing up to 25% of its total assets in a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary. The subsidiary will invest in long positions in Bitcoin Futures and will periodically sell them to unwind a portion of its positions. In addition, “the fund expects the notional value of its exposure to bitcoin to be equal to approximately 100% of fund assets at the close of each trading day.”\n\nMeanwhile, the short bitcoin ETF seeks to achieve its investment objective by “providing short exposure to movements in the value of bitcoin,” in a similar manner to its long counterpart.\n\nFund Managers Increasingly File for Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe Rex Bitcoin ETF filings follow the Vaneck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which was filed with the SEC by investment management firm Vaneck last week. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on the filing. Expected to list on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Vaneck’s bitcoin ETF also does not hold any actual bitcoin, but will invest up to 25% of its value in U.S. exchange-traded bitcoin derivative instruments.\n\nThe SEC is also currently considering Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust and Coin ETF. The former is set to be decided on by October 7. The latter is under review after Bats BZX Exchange filed a petition to reverse the Commission’s decision to reject it in March.\n\nWhat do you think of these fund managers launching bitcoin ETFs but not investing in bitcoin?

Even though the roughly one dozen largest marijuana stocks have averaged a greater than 100% return over the trailing 12 months, it\'s cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum that have left weed stocks in the dust.\n\nBitcoin is perhaps the best-known digital currency, and it\'s also the largest by market cap. After ending 2016 at $966.60 per coin, bitcoin has seen its value soar to $4,000 per coin as of Aug. 21, 2017. That\'s better than a 300% return in less than eight months. In fact, it was even greater the previous week when bitcoin hit an all-time intraday high of $4,489.10 per coin. Since its lows in 2015, bitcoin has rallied by more than 1,600%, and in the process, the total market cap of bitcoin has soared. With 16,519,100 coins having been mined to date, bitcoin\'s market cap stands at more than $66 billion. That makes bitcoin larger than six very well-known companies.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nNothing says auto manufacturing quite like Detroit\'s finest, but kingpin General Motors (NYSE:GM), with a $51 billion market cap, now takes a back seat in market cap to bitcoin. Mind you, bitcoin isn\'t backed by any governments, while at the other end of the spectrum, General Motors has generated $9.8 billion in profits over the trailing-12-month period as it looks to retain domestic market share and claim additional share in China\'s burgeoning auto market with its quick-growing Cadillac brand. Yes, it\'s comparing an apple and an orange in a sense, but the stark contrast is eye-opening.\n\nLowe\'s\n\nDo-it-yourself home-improvement giant Lowe\'s (NYSE:LOW), with its nearly $63 billion market cap, is another mammoth business that now looks up to bitcoin. Lowe\'s is a cyclical company, like most retailers, but it\'s been able to hedge its business toward the retail consumer and remodels during periods of slower economic growth and recessions. This ability to switch between commercial and residential sales channels, and its 54 consecutive years of increasing its dividend (only around a dozen publicly traded companies have a longer active streak), make Lowe\'s a popular investment.\n\nTesla\n\nMotoring back to the auto industry, hot electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has itself seen its share price increase by more than 1,000% over the trailing-five-year period, also trails bitcoin with a market cap of $56 billion. Admittedly, Tesla\'s market cap already contains a lot of premium, much like bitcoin. Expectations are high that Tesla\'s new Gigafactory and continued investment in EVs will allow it to increase production of its newly introduced, and considerably more affordable, Model 3 (relative to the Model S and Model X list prices) from 1,500 units in September to 20,000 a month by December.\n\nT-Mobile\n\nPerhaps known best as the ""Un-carrier"" for its no-contract wireless plans, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and its $52 billion market cap also fall well short of bitcoin. Of course, this hasn\'t stopped T-Mobile from making waves as it continues its customer-friendly transformation. It\'s added more than 1 million subscribers in each of the past 17 quarters (that more than four years), and it recently posted a record-low churn rate of 1.10% in the second quarter. In other words, more people are making the switch to T-Mobile, and those that have chosen T-Mobile as their wireless service provider are sticking around. Yet T-Mobile\'s nearly 70 million customers are still not enough to eclipse bitcoin.\n\nFedEx\n\nLogistics giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and its $55 billion market cap aren\'t enough to surpass bitcoin, either. Mind you, this is a company that generated more than $60 billion in sales in fiscal 2017 and $3.33 billion in adjusted net income over that same timeframe, and that ships more than 13 million packages per business day. Expecting this latter figure to increase in the years that lie ahead, FedEx has been a big investor in automation, including autonomous delivery trucks and the possible use of delivery robots. It\'s also been investing in optimized software solutions that guide drivers to the most efficient delivery routes so as to reduce fuel consumption and save money.\n\nSony\n\nLast, but not least, tech-based entertainment giant Sony (NYSE:SNE), with its $48 billion market cap, takes a clear back seat to bitcoin. Sony develops and manufactures everything from televisions and mobile phones to movies and video gaming systems that your teens probably have difficulty prying themselves from. Chances are that Sony\'s financial results for this fiscal year could be better than expected, with Spider-Man: Homecoming netting an estimated $725 million worldwide through Aug. 20, and a release of the hit still upcoming in China this September. These figures weren\'t factored into its most recent quarterly results.\n\nThe big question many investors are asking is: Can bitcoin continue its nearly exponential run higher and maintain its lofty market cap? While there are a number of catalysts behind the rally, including a weaker U.S. dollar and the highly coveted blockchain technology underlying bitcoin that securely digitally logs transactions, there are also no true fundamentals for investors to pore over to get a feel for what bitcoin is really worth. Worse yet, with no government backing, bitcoin could see a possible collapse in value that\'s just as rapid as its ascent.\n\nWhile bitcoin has been one heck of a story in 2017, I would suggest investors avoid digital currencies for the time being.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

08/28/2017,"['""There is a perception among many people that this is the wild west and the tax authority hasn\'t kept up with the technology,"" said Clyde Tinnen, a partner at Withers Bergman LLP law firm.\n\nStill, the IRS rules around Bitcoin are murky at best, leaving many cryptocurrency investors confused.\n\nIt recently asked Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges for buying and selling Bitcoins, for its customer list of investors and traders involved in transactions valued at $20,000 or more.\n\nSurging prices have pushed Bitcoin\'s market cap to more than $71 billion, while the value of all crytocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Etherium, Litecoin, and others, is $155 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com - and growing each day. The potential tax windfall for the IRS is huge, and the agency is now aggressively taking steps to track and crack down on Bitcoin tax cheaters.\n\nFor now, the IRS relies primarily on the ""honor system"" for people to report their gains. For those who don\'t pay Uncle Sam, they could be slapped with a 20% negligence penalty or as much as a 40% penalty if the person understated their income by 10% or more, said Green.\n\nPrechter doesn\'t think Bitcoin tax dodgers are a big problem - at least not yet. ""Even if hardly anyone is paying capital gains, it\'s probably because most are still holding their coins and haven\'t sold them,"" he said.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin has turned so many people into millionaires that traders have dubbed the coin ""lambo,"" which refers to the amount of time it will take before they can cash out with enough to buy a Lamborghini, said Elliott Prechter, president of Qualitative Analytics, a tech-powered financial forecasting firm. Prechter has been tracking and writing about Bitcoin since September 2010 when it was trading a 6 cents a pop.\n\n""The IRS figures hundreds of thousands of American residents did not report income from sales or exchanges of cryptocurrency and they might be able to collect several billion dollars in back taxes, penalties and interest,"" said Robert A. Green, a CPA, founder of Green & Co. Inc. and founder of Green, Neuschwander & Manning LLC tax and accounting firm.\n\nOnly 802 individuals reported gains from Bitcoin-related transactions (shown on Form 8949) on their tax returns in 2015, according to an affidavit from IRS agent David Utzke, filed in U.S. District Court earlier this year. This is a tiny fraction of the 150.7 million individuals who filed returns that year.\n\nBut despite the colossal gains and surge in new-fangled Bitcoin millionaires, few investors seem to be reporting their cryptocurrency windfalls on their U.S. tax returns. And experts warn this could mean huge penalties down the line.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues its humongous run, soaring to new highs again this month, more and more investors are flocking to the cryptocurrency. Get-rich-quick artists and even mainstream investors are riveted by Bitcoin\'s 353% year-to-date return and the countless stories of early investors strutting around as newly-minted millionaires.\n\nSome investors wrongly think cyber currencies, like Bitcoin, are tax-free vehicles since cyber coin owners don\'t receive 1099-K or 8949 forms. ""Anytime people don\'t get a form, their first inclination is to find some high-flying reason why they may not have to report,"" said Green.\n\nOthers look at the unregulated and somewhat anonymous nature of Bitcoins, and wonder how the IRS would ever know if they failed to report gains. After all, if the FBI and international cybersecurity experts are having a tough time tracking down the cybercriminals behind the huge ransomware attacks, where scammers received millions of dollars in Bitcoins to unlock computers from malicious malware, then how would the IRS ever track down small investors playing with five or 10 bitcoins?\n\n""Keep in mind that technically, Bitcoin is not anonymous - it is pseudonymous,"" cautioned David Andolfatto, an economist and senior vice president for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who has written blog posts and made presentations about the cryptocurrency market. ""The blockchain itself - which is the record of how money moves across accounts - is visible, and the IRS and FBI have teams that can do the forensics necessary to track down identities.""\n\nBitcoin\'s surge could help this area.\n\nStill, there are potential legal loopholes and rule interpretations that might be used to help Bitcoin owners avoid - or at least defer - paying taxes.\n\nThe IRS views virtual currency as ""property,"" not securities or currency. Beyond this though, the IRS has provided little guidance. It would appear Bitcoin investors would not have to worry about ""wash sale rules,"" as stock buyers do. Under a wash sale, someone taking a loss on a stock is not permitted to purchase the same stock 30 days before or after a sale. In theory, Bitcoin owners could buy and sell anytime without restrictions and still apply Bitcoin losses against income.\n\nThen there\'s the 1031-exchange rule, where the IRS allows someone to defer paying capital gains taxes after selling a property if the person reinvests the proceeds into a ""like-kind"" property within 180 days. The program has been big in the real estate world. But the rule applies to other areas that the IRS considers as ""property,"" such as gold, which can be exchanged for gold coins without paying capital gains taxes. As a result, some experts speculate the rule might extend to Bitcoins, where Bitcoins could be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, without paying taxes.\n\nBut Green isn\'t so sure. He noted that while gold can be traded for gold coins, it can\'t be traded for silver coins under the 1031 rule. ""With a lack of IRS guidance, using section 1031 for cryptocurrency trades is uncertain, and I suggest wrong,"" he said.\n\nAn IRS spokesman, Dean Patterson, declined to offer clarification on how these tax rules apply - or don\'t apply - to cryptocurrencies. He said the agency hasn\'t made any formal comments on the issue since its 2014 Virtual Currency Guidance statement.\n\nAnd that leaves Bitcoin owners with a dilemma. Do they interpret the rules themselves and hope for the best? Or pay up and not take the chance of facing potentially monstrous penalties a few years down the line when the IRS catches up to them?\n\n""Pay your taxes - it\'s not worth it,"" said Prechter. ""It\'s silly to save some money and risk going to prison.""\n\nAs cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, experts say it\'s not a question of ""if"" the IRS will bring the hammer down on tax evaders in this space, but ""when.""\n\nSure, there are ways to stay anonymous. Investors could set up digital wallets at sites on the Dark Web that don\'t require identification, although their coins may not be as secure. They could also purchase Bitcoins anonymously through Bitcoin meet-up parties and through special ATM machines, such as Bitcoin Depot, although the fees are high - sometimes in excess of 20%.\n\nThey could also use ""tumblers,"" which mixes a transaction with others, making it tough to trace a transaction back to the original source. Or they could purchase certain altcoins, such as ZCash and Monero, which are designed to be untraceable.\n\nAt the end of the day, gains from Bitcoins and cryptocurrency are income and need to be reported as such, said Green. ""Don\'t be greedy: Pay your capital gains taxes on windfall income and amend tax returns to report capital gains before the IRS catches up with you,"" he said.\n\nTinnen concurred. ""Regulators are watching, and whenever the IRS and Department of Justice are collaborating, things will happen,"" said Tinnen. ""And today\'s lay of the land may not be tomorrow\'s.""\n\nMore of What\'s Trending on TheStreet:', 'The rising tide for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple have lately shaken the investing world. Among the lot, bitcoin has been firing on all cylinders since the beginning of 2017, having hit a series record highs. In three months, the price of the digital currency has surged about 94%.\n\nInvestors should note that cryptocurrency and bitcoins are ‘mined’ by using a greater amount of computer processing power. However, since there is a fixed amount of bitcoins, as the limit is reached, it becomes hard to ‘mine’ for the coins. The best part of this system is that it is beyond the reach of central banks.\n\nThe currency is in the limelight probably because of the fact that “bitcoin isn’t regulated by any government and has been used by consumers worldwide to shelter assets from inflation or political upheavals in their home countries.” As per an article published on CNBC, bitcoin is emerging as a safe haven asset like gold.\n\nNeedless to say, amid a sky-high price rise, the digital currency is gaining favor from ETF issuers, though the SEC is no quite happy with the concept. After rejecting the filing for an ETF on this cryptocurrency by Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, the SEC is reviewing its decision once again.\n\nThe SEC is seemingly looking for more proof of safety in this trade. Meanwhile, some more ETF issuers have lined up to seek regulatory approval with their bitcoin-related products.\n\nInside New Filings\n\nInvestment firm VanEck filed for an exchange-traded fund to invest in bitcoin derivatives in mid-August. Though VanEck acknowledged the riskiness of the product and believes that this digital currency is no match to gold as far as safe-haven status is concerned, the issuer could not overlook bitcoin’s monumental craze.\n\nVanEck noted that the digital currency cannot even replace the necessity of the dollar, rather it is likely to end up in carving a place for itself as a niche product. VanEck’s proposed product will invest in certain Bitcoin Instruments through the Subsidiary and the investment in that subsidiary is likely to be limited to 25% of the portfolio, thus meaningfully lowering the risks.\n\nAfter VanEck, ETF Firm REX also planned a new fund that will invest in bitcoin-based derivatives. There are two products filed by REX, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. The ticker codes and expense ratios of those funds are yet to be disclosed.\n\nAs per the filing, the long fund “seeks to achieve its investment objective, under normal circumstances, by obtaining investment exposure to an actively managed portfolio of financial instruments providing long exposure to movements in the value of bitcoin, together with an actively managed portfolio of fixed income instruments” while the short fund is intended to offer the negative exposure of the same asset.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nThe tussle between the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and Winklevoss over the launch has been going on for about three years. In fact, the issuer has restructured the proposal for the Bitcoin ETF multiple times.\n\nHowever, it looks like that the SEC may approve a fund in the coming days given rising pressure from issuers. Plus, the Russian government is also expected to make cryptocurrencies legal financial instruments in 2018, as per the source. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari pointed to the strength of the blockchain technology supporting bitcoin.\n\nAmong other interested candidates, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has teamed up with Gemini, the bitcoin exchange backed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, in order to launch cryptocurrency derivatives trading.\n\nBitcoin’s Impact on the ETF World?\n\nWhile it is still unclear if we will get a bitcoin ETF soon, the sheer success of the cryptocurrencies should benefit semiconductor ETFs like iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX ) and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (MUTF: SMH ). This is because mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. A hardware known as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is designed explicitly for mining bitcoin.\n\nAs per Bloomberg, there was a 10-fold rise from April to June in the Ethereum market which helped shares of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) substantially.\n\nOn the other hand, since some view the currency as “digital gold,” bitcoin trading may snatch some buyers from SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA: GLD ). Bitcoin’s un-correlated nature to the other asset classes and strong momentum may hurt GLD in the current scenario.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>', 'Lightning Network developer Rusty Russell has described a lack of consensus in Bitcoin as the “best failure mode a store-of-value system can have.”\n\nRussell made the comments concluding a blog post about how a consensus-based route to a Bitcoin hard fork would work in practice.\n\nHis balanced view contrasts with current fears over the effect of November’s SegWit2x hard fork on the Bitcoin network, which is already experiencing operational changes as a result of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in July.\n\n“[A] lack of consensus doesn’t destroy Bitcoin, it just keeps it to its current state, which is truly the best failure mode a store-of-value system can have!” the blog post states.\n\n“I’d personally and loudly oppose a proposal I agreed with, unless I was convinced it had consensus.”\n\nAchieving a truly transparent hard fork consensus requires “a lot of work,” Russell added, having previously confirmed his support of a UASF and even taken responsibility for the delay to a Bitcoin scaling solution.\n\nA successful method would include tools to minimize the chance of participants “gaming” the system to skew the outcome, he added.\n\nEarlier this month, Russell warned Bitcoin’s fees would “only rise” from then on, a phenomenon which has broadly come true as mining habits dictate the limited availability of confirmation capacity for BTC versus Bitcoin Cash.', 'Russia’s deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev has said it is “hard to argue cryptocurrency is not a pyramid scheme” amid sudden plans to ban sales.\n\nSpeaking in an interview on local television channel Rossiya 24, Moiseev said the government wanted only to allow “those who are qualified investors” and who have a “reason” for buying cryptoassets to have the option to do so.\n\n“I said qualified investors and not private ones,” he reiterated about the alleged “pyramid scheme.”\n\n“For ordinary people, there’s no way because these are very dangerous investments that could lead to loss of money.”\n\nContradictory statements\n\nHis statements come just weeks after the announcement of a state-sponsored Bitcoin mining company, which aims to raise $100 mln to take market share away from China.\n\nThe new plans for regulation of cryptocurrency would mean the Moscow Stock Exchange would constitute the sole platform through which investors could gain exposure to Bitcoin and others.\n\nPrevious comments from regulators suggested that Russia’s so-called BitRuble, currently under development by the central bank, would enjoy considerably more market freedom than ‘traditional’ cryptocurrencies.\n\n“We’re not offering to call [cryptocurrency] currency, or regulate it like currency,” Moiseev added.\n\nThe brief nature of the news did not include how authorities plan to prevent citizens purchasing cryptocurrencies. Future steps could potentially include blocking of exchange websites in line with similar habits by regulators in previous years.', 'Canadian securities regulators are taking a closer look at technology companies that offer digital currencies such as bitcoin to raise funds, to make sure they abide by the right set of rules.\n\nSimilar to an initial public offering, or IPO, of a stock, a flurry of Canadian technology companies have recently raised money via ICO — initial coin offerings — in which digital tokens or coins are given to early investors in exchange for money, which the tech companies use to create their product.\n\n\'We are open to innovation but we need to ensure that investor protection will be there.\' - Louis Morisset , Canadian Securities Administrators\n\n""The coins/tokens can be similar to traditional shares of a company because their value may increase or decrease depending on how successfully the business executes its business plan using the capital raised,"" the Canadian Securities Administrators said in a news release last week.\n\nCompanies raising money via an IPO process have to adhere to all sorts of rules surrounding disclosure, and making sure investors have enough information to make an informed decision and weigh the risks. That isn\'t always the case with ICOs because they are sometimes treated as a currency.\n\nBut while the digital coins being exchanged are often established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum, sometimes they are something else entirely, which is why regulators are looking to clarify the rules to determine whether such fundraising deals should be treated similarly to equity investments, or more like conventional money — on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe CSA published a paper last week attempting to outline which securities laws need to be applied, depending on the nature of the investment.\n\n""We are open to innovation but we need to ensure that investor protection will be there,"" the regulator\'s chair, Louis Morisset, said in an interview with CBC News Network\'s On The Money.\n\nCryptocurrency craze5:50\n\nRegulators in the U.S. are going through a similar process. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently ruled that a major cryptocurrency offering known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, which raised $150 million US last year, was in fact a securities offering, and as such breached the rules it should have been bound to.\n\nThere\'s hundreds of millions of dollars at stake. The largest ICO thus far recently raised more than $200 million US for a new blockchain called Tezos.\n\nWhile broadly receptive to more clarity on the rules, many in the cryptocurrency world are wary of an over-reach by regulators that would see them treat all such fundraising plans as securities offerings when, in fact, they should be treated the same way other private currencies are.\n\n""A network access token is a lot more like a private currency,"" said Chris Horlacher, CEO of software company Equibit Group, in a recent On The Money interview.\n\nGrowing popularity4:29\n\nInstead of being treated like stocks, the mast majority of such ICOs are more akin to things like Canadian Tire dollars or Air Miles points, Horlacher said. ""They have been around for decades,"" he said, ""and none of these have ever been deemed a security.""\n\nWhile Horlacher concedes that some ICOs — most notably the DAO — are, in fact, little more than marketing investment funds that should be treated like equity investments, he says it\'s unfair to paint all ICOs with the same brush.\n\n""There\'s a lot of concern that regulators are going to consider them all as securities,"" he said. ""That would be very bad for the industry.""\n\nThe CSA paper falls well short of a crackdown on ICOs overall. The agency just wants to make sure that any Canadian financial firms coming to market with ICOs in the future know and abide by the rules.\n\n""There\'s no guarantees on these investments, but at least investors will have the full package of information that will allow them to make an informed decision,"" Morisset said.', '', 'Bitcoin price surged last week to record a week high of $4,470, after testing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, as we expected during last week’s bitcoin price analysis. After dropping down to $3,607, the downtrend was reversed and bitcoin price started rising, recording the week’s high last Friday, which is $30 short of $4,500 which has been a major resistance preventing further price advancement , since the beginning of August.\n\nSo, where would bitcoin price be heading during the upcoming week?\n\nCompleting a 5 Wave Elliott Formation On the 4 Hour BTCUSD Chart:\n\nLet’s examine the 4 hour BTCUSD chart from Bitfinex, while keeping the Fibonacci retracement we plotted during last week’s analysis and plotting the Bollinger bands, Willams Alligator and MACD indicator (look at the below chart). We can note the following:\n\nLast week’s downtrend was reversed after overshooting below the 23.6% Fib retracement level, recording a low of $3,607. Even though bitcoin price dropped for around $263 below this crucial support level, price rose above it during the next trading session and a “bullish engulfing” pattern was formed signaling reversal of the downtrend. Also, the long downwards shadow of the candlestick near this level (look at the 2 candlesticks highlighted by an ellipse on the above chart) denotes the strong support around this level.\n\nA 5 wave Elliott formation has been forming on the 4 hour BTCUSD chart since the latter half of July, as shown on the above chart. Reversal of the downtrend last week signaled the start of the 5th wave, which is expected to take bitcoin price to record a high higher than the high recorded at the climax of the 3rd wave, so we expect to see bitcoin price exceed $4,500 within the next 1-2 weeks.\n\nThe candlesticks are now moving close to the middle Bollinger Band, so bitcoin is not overbought yet, so chances are good that we can see it head North towards the $5000 price mark within a month or so. This is also supported by Williams Alligator SMAs, as they have just realigned themselves to exhibit a bullish signal. Also, the MACD indicator is in the positive territory, yet the negative red trend line is on top of the positive blue trend line. This alignment has to reverse before we can see an intense bullish wave.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBitcoin price recorded a high of $4,470 last week, before the market’s bears took the upper hand pullng price down to $4,335. A 5 Elliott wave formation can be spotted forming on the 4 hour BTCUSD chart, and as the 5th wave has just began to form, we expect bitcoin price to exceed $4,500 during the upcoming 1-2 weeks.\n\nChart from Bitfinex, hosted on Tradingview.com', 'A new bitcoin investment fund launched last week in the US is part of a wider strategy that includes a planned effort to offer institutional investors a way to short the market.\n\nLast week, CoinDesk reported that REX ETF, an investment firm based in Connecticut, had launched a fund that plans to invest primarily in bitcoin futures and other derivatives without actually buying direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. In announcing the move, REX indicated that it would seek to launch multiple investment products built around the tech.\n\nAdditional public filings reveal that at least one of those products is already in the pipeline.\n\nAccording to a filing from last week, the ""REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF"" will be similar in scope – relying on financial derivatives of bitcoin and not the cryptocurrency itself – but with the aim of shorting the market.\n\nWhen short selling, investors typically borrow an asset or security and sell it in anticipation of a lower buy-in price later, making a profit on the difference.\n\nHere\'s how the REX ETF filing explains the investment fund\'s plan:\n\n""...the Fund will obtain short investment exposure to the price movements of bitcoin through financial instruments that provide short exposure to the price movements of bitcoin, including short positions in and short exposure to futures contracts linked to the price of bitcoin or an index thereof and that are traded or listed in the U.S. (""Bitcoin Futures""). The Fund will be actively managed with respect to the instruments held by the Fund, and the notional value of the Fund\'s short exposure to bitcoin may vary on each trading day.""\n\nAs previously reported, the launch comes amid growing interest in the launch of such products – as well as the hope to capture some of the demand coming from institutional investors.\n\nOptions exchanges in the US like CBOE are moving to launch derivatives trades – and others are eyeing the intellectual property that could underlie future offerings as well.\n\nBear and bull image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The bank just added exchange-traded notes for bitcoin.\n\nAlso read: Crypto Media Group Strategy: Recruit Celebrities to Promote ICOs\n\nSaxo bank mentioned that fascination with bitcoin has dramatically increased in 2017. This is primarily because the Asian market, especially China and Japan, has opened up. This means these countries have generated a lot of bitcoin trades.\n\nThis also implies investors and speculators want a new way to trade bitcoin without having to directly work with the asset. The fact bitcoin is also seeing higher usage in places like Latin America, Greece, Africa, and elsewhere, may also be spurring various markets into action.\n\nSaxo Makes a Move into Bitcoin ETNs\n\nAs a result of all the market activity and bitcoin excitement, Saxo decided to offer exchange traded notes. This fund will provide investors with indirect exposure to bitcoin’s price. A Financefeeds article elaborated:\n\nIn response to this growing interest, Saxo has added two new Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) to its offering. Saxo clients can now get exposure to Bitcoin through these two new ETNs designed to track the movement of Bitcoin against the US Dollar (BTC/USD).\n\nOne note is referred to as “Bitcoin Tracker One” and is traded in Swedish Krona, and the other note is the “Bitcoin Tracker Euro.” It is traded in Euro. The site details both notes are issued by XBT provider AB, and traded on Nasdaq OMX.\n\nPopularity of Bitcoin is Increasing Demand for ETN’s\n\nThe Finanicalfeeds website also suggested that growing demand for bitcoin speculation has caused more trading companies to get involved in the space. The site said, “Lately, a growing number of online trading companies have sought to satisfy the demand for virtual currency products. In July this year, Swissquote, the leading online bank in Switzerland, launched Bitcoin trading on its trading platform.”\n\nThe Swissquote platform work similarly to foreign exchange markets. Users simply place their Euro and US dollar into an account and tie it up with Bitcoin. However, investors will not have access to leverage when working with bitcoin notes. Bitcoin.com covered Swissquotes entrance into the crypto ecosystem.\n\nSwitzerland’s leading provider of online financial and trading services, Swissquote Bank, has partnered with bitcoin exchange Bitstamp to offer bitcoin trading on its platform, available to 200,000+ private and institutional investors.\n\nLastly, the Financialfeeds site mentioned that a trading market called IG group also expanded into cryptocurrencies. They focus on Ether trading. Their clients can take a position on the future gains or declines of ether.\n\nDo you think that more investment banks will start to offer exchange traded notes?

They trade frictionlessly around the globe, and, whether you live in America or Armenia, Canada or Cameroon, the process of buying, selling and trading cryptocurrencies is essentially identical.\n\nAnd yet the exchanges most investors use for cryptocurrency trading are bound by the regulations of the country in which they're domiciled. Moreover, if trade volume in a single country is high enough, it's likely that the market structure of that country's exchanges, and, by extension, that country's regulatory regime, could have a price impact on cryptocurrencies.\n\nKorea rising\n\nLooking back on last week's market action, there's perhaps no better country that illustrates this truth than South Korea, where lawmakers are close to following Japan in becoming the latest to formally carve out rules for bitcoin in national law.\n\nPerhaps in response, Korea's markets are waking up – big time.\n\nRipple\n\nLast week, investors in Ripple's native XRP token saw their positions nearly double when the price exploded, flirting with a $0.30 price level, a jump in price of roughly 90 percent from the previous week's low.\n\nWhile the price of XRP was taking off, more than 70 percent of its trade volume was being transacted on South Korean exchanges. In fact, three of the top four exchanges by trade volume were located in South Korea, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nTo put that massive South Korean volume share in perspective, on Friday about 7 percent of bitcoin volume was executed on South Korean exchanges, with only one South Korean exchange, Bithumb, ranking in the top 10 for bitcoin volume.\n\nAnother way to understand the significance is to compare South Korea's share of the Ripple trade volume to the prior week's aggregate numbers.\n\nDuring the week of Monday, August 14, as XRP's price remained range-bound between $0.15 and $0.17, its trade volume remained flat, peaking just above $200 million.\n\nBut last week, as Ripple was near its high of almost $0.30, the dollar volume shot up to $2.25 billion – more than 10 times the high volume mark of the previous week, and more than 40 times the prior week's low.\n\nBitcoin cash\n\nTwo weeks ago, a similar trend was observed with bitcoin cash, as a significant rise in its price was correlated with a spike in South Korean trade volume.\n\nOn August 18, as bitcoin cash flirted with its all-time high, the trade volume was especially dramatic in South Korean won-denominated trading.\n\nOn that afternoon, about $1.2 billion of the $2 billion in total bitcoin cash volume, around 56 percent, appeared to be transacted on just three South Korean exchanges – Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe following day, August 19, bitcoin cash hit a new all-time high of $1,091.97.\n\nIn contrast, the same three exchanges, reflected only 6 percent of the total volume in bitcoin during a similar time frame. Using the comparison between the two cryptocurrencies as a baseline, bitcoin cash trading in South Korean won appears over 900 percent higher by volume.\n\nMonero\n\nBut if this cause-and-effect relationship wasn't clear yet, just this weekend, the process would again repeat with another cryptocurrency called monero.\n\nNot only did the price of monero set new all-time highs when Korean trading went live, it also saw a massive spike on the announcement that trading would be offered by a local exchange. In fact, it almost doubled overnight on the news Korea's traders would now have an opportunity to buy.\n\nOverall, the value of XMR has tripled since the market first came online, rising to a new high above $140 on Sunday. Given the staggering results, it seems crypto traders would be wise to pay attention to won markets (and regulatory fluctuations) for some time.\n\nClassifications in Canada\n\nBut whereas South Korea's trading volume was evidence of growth in its cryptocurrency markets, a news release from Canada's securities regulators provided an example of how they can still shrug off legal guidance.\n\nThe release seemed to affirm Canada will take a similar approach to the U.S. by establishing a distinction between so-called 'securities tokens' and 'utility tokens,' as it seeks to determine how to capture the sale of such tools for blockchain project fundraising.\n\nFor those who may not have closely followed the SEC report, released late last month, the main takeaway was this: If a cryptocurrency token meets the criteria set forth in U.S. law for what a security is, the SEC will regulate that token like a security.\n\nThe impact on the blockchain asset market, in both cases, however, was minimal.\n\nA week from Canada's announcement, the market for blockchain-based assets used in fundraising was nearly $10 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nPossible conclusions include the fact such a decision may have already been priced in by traders, or the belief that, given the variety of global jurisdictions available, regulatory arbitrage will continue to propel it no matter what happens within one set of borders.\n\nHowever, it may also be a sign of a lack of maturity in Canada's markets.\n\nDespite having, at one point, as many as three different exchanges set up to serve domestic customers, none of the top 10 exchanges currently offer CAD trading pairs.\n\nFurther, its largest exchange, QuadrigaCX ranks 50th in terms of total volume, trading just $2.4 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nKorean won coin image via Shutterstock; charts via CoinMarketCap\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

08/29/2017,"['Prices of bitcoin soared further into record territory Tuesday, briefly trading above $4,700, as demand for the cryptocurrency, perceived by investors as a safer assets than fiat currencies, jumped following North Korea’s missile test over Japan.\n\nOne bitcoin BTCUSD, +7.40% was up 4.3% to $4,628, bringing its market capitalization to $76.4 billion. Since the start of the month, bitcoin has gained more than 60% and it is up about 360% so far this year, according to Coindesk.com.\n\nPrices of Ether, the blockchain currency trading on Ethereum platform, also rose sharply, up nearly 5% at $364.85. Its total value is at about $34.4 billion. Despite recent rally, Ether is still below its all-time high $383.58, reached in June. Year to date, Ether is up more than 4,000% thus far in 2017.\n\nThe total value of the digital-currency universe tracked by data research site Coinmarketcap.com, including those linked to the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple blockchain networks, reached a fresh record at about $164 billion.\n\nBitcoin’s run-up is unlike any other asset, according to analyst at Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nIn the attached chart, Bespoke analysts compared the price of Bitcoin from 2015, with other assets that enjoyed parabolic, or bubblelike, rises since 1990.\n\nClimbing prices of cryptocurrencies have been in part fueled by interest from ordinary people as well as major Wall Street investors, who are attracted to cybercurrencies running on decentralized blockchain platforms.\n\nThe blockchain is the digital ledger that tracks each bitcoin transaction and underpins the currency.\n\nRead: Opinion: Stay away from bitcoin and Ethereum—they are complete garbage\n\nDespite surging prices of bitcoin and other digital currencies, complaints against abuses are soaring as well.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received 277 complaints about virtual currencies through August. In 2016, there were only seven, according to student loan marketplace LendEDU.\n\nIn the past, the regulator warned consumers that there may be potential issues with virtual currencies such as unclear costs, volatile exchange rates, the threat of hacking and scams.', 'In a further twist to Russia’s complex approach to cryptocurrency, power plants have begun selling excess capacity to Bitcoin miners.\n\nAs local news outlet Daily Storm reports Monday, the country’s largest energy providers Gazprom and EuroSibEnergo are currently “in talks” with “tens” of miners looking to take advantage of cheap electricity prices.\n\n“No contracts have been finalized so far, but the company (EuroSibEnergo) is not declining partnership opportunities,” reports state.\n\nAn interactive map shows around 70 “potential” locations miners could use to benefit from spare capacity.\n\nThe developments run in contrast with cryptocurrency’s plight at regulatory level in Russia this week.\n\nCointelegraph reported Monday that senior finance officials plan to ban sales of cryptoassets such as Bitcoin to private individuals.\n\nContradictions\n\nOnly “qualified investors” should have access to such assets, deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev told TV channel Rossiya 24, adding he thought it was “hard to argue against” cryptocurrency being a “pyramid scheme.”\n\nAt the same time, a new business co-owned by the Kremlin’s Internet ombudsman is seeking to raise around $100 mln to corner the Bitcoin mining market and challenge Chinese dominance.\n\nLike the miners looking to Gazprom and EuroSibEnergo, state participants want to use Russia’s cheaper energy rates to give China large-scale competition.', 'An in-progress blockchain project could one day help users trade bitcoin for zcash without a trusted third party.\n\nCreated by zcash developers Jay Graber and Ariel Gabizon, ZBXCAT is a new command-line tool that developers can use to exchange the two cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith today\'s bitcoin exchanges having a history of being vulnerable to hacks (leading to millions of dollars in customer losses), ZBXCAT uses a concept called ""atomic swaps"" to avoid the need to hold users\' funds.\n\nSay Alice has bitcoin and Bob has zcash, and they want to trade the two. Rather than temporarily entrusting their cryptocurrency to a centralized exchange, atomic swaps would let them trade directly across blockchains. To ensure there is no cheating, both users would need to send the cryptocurrencies to each other by a certain time or the trade will fail.\n\nGabizon told CoinDesk:\n\n""Basically, it seems a useful thing to me: To be able to exchange bitcoin and zcash directly with someone I don\'t know without having to trust them. Especially, given recent technical problems some exchanges are having.""\n\nIn its current state, ZBXCAT users need to download bitcoin and zcash full nodes (with their full transaction histories), and use the command line to instruct the network to make a trade.\n\nHowever, with the tool still not finalized, ZBXCAT\'s developers advise using ""test"" coins rather than the real thing for the time being.\n\nThe project is the latest in a line of similar ideas for experimental exchange-free trading.\n\nCharlie Lee, the founder of litecoin, has previously said he is committed to atomic swaps, once the Lightning Network is activated on the cryptocurrency\'s network. The MimbleWimble project also plans to usher in cross-chain atomic swaps, as well as other features.\n\n""I can\'t predict how it will be used exactly, I hope it will be integrated in other services in interesting and unexpected ways,"" Gabizon concluded.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, developer of zcash.\n\nWelding image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While staggering, lesser-known competitors have seen even bigger gains, such as the more than 4,000 percent increase for ethereum.\n\nBespoke Investment Group contrasted the rise in bitcoin with infamous bubbles such as the tech market in the late nineties. There’s almost no comparison. Tech stocks rose just over 1,000 percent over the entire course of their bubble, and bitcoin is already up more than twice that. Take a look.', 'The boom in cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology is becoming too big for central banks, long the guardian of official money, to ignore.\n\nUntil recently, officials at major central banks were happy to watch as pioneers in the field progressed by trial and error, safe in the knowledge that it was dwarfed by roughly $5 trillion circulating daily in conventional currency markets. But now as officials turn an eye toward the increasingly pervasive technology, the risk is that they’re reacting too late to both the pitfalls and the opportunities presented by digital coinage.\n\n""Central banks cannot afford to treat cyber currencies as toys to play with in a sand box,"" said Andrew Sheng, chief adviser to the China Banking Regulatory Commission and Distinguished Fellow of the Asia Global Institute, University of Hong Kong. ""It is time to realize that they are the real barbarians at the gate.""\n\nBitcoin -- the largest and best-known digital currency -- and its peers pose a threat to the established money system by effectively circumventing it. Money as we know it depends on the authority of the state for credibility, with central banks typically managing its price and/or quantity. Cryptocurrencies skirt all that and instead rely on their supposedly unhackable technology to guarantee value.\n\nChina’s Lead\n\nIf they don’t get a handle on bitcoin and their ilk, and more people adopt them, central banks could see an erosion of their control over the money supply. The solution may be in the old adage, if you can’t beat them, join them.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China has done trial runs of its prototype cryptocurrency, taking it a step closer to being the first major central bank to issue digital money. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have launched a joint research project which studies the possible use of distributed ledger -- the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies -- for market infrastructure.\n\nRead more about China’s digital currency efforts.\n\nThe Dutch central bank has created its own cryptocurrency -- for internal circulation only -- to better understand how it works. And Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve who has said digital currencies show ""long term promise,"" will be the keynote speaker at a blockchain and banking conference in October hosted by Ripple, the startup behind the fourth largest digital currency.\n\nRussia, too, has shown interest in ethereum, the second-largest digital currency, with the central bank deploying a blockchain pilot program.\n\nIn the U.S., both banks and regulators are studying distributed ledger technology and Fed officials have made a couple of formal speeches on the topic in the past 12 months, but have voiced reservations about digital currencies themselves.\n\nPolicy Issues\n\nFed Governor Jerome Powell said in March there were “significant policy issues” concerning them that needed further study, including vulnerability to cyber-attack, privacy and counterfeiting. He also cautioned that a central bank digital currency could stifle innovations to improve the existing payments system.\n\nAt the same time, central bankers are obviously wary of the risks posed by alternative currencies -- including financial instability and fraud. One example: The Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange collapsed spectacularly in 2014 after disclosing that it lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.\n\nBut for all their theoretical tinkering, official-money guardians have largely stood by as digital currencies have taken off. The explosion in initial coin offerings, or ICOs, is evidence. Investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the digital currency market this year alone.\n\nThe dollar value of the 20 biggest cryptocurrencies is around $150 billion, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin itself has soared more than 380 percent this year and hit a record -- but it’s also prone to wild swings, like a 50 percent slump at the end of 2013.\n\n""At a global level, there is an urgent need for regulatory clarity given the growth of the market,"" said Daniel Heller, Visiting Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and previously head of financial stability at the Swiss National Bank.\n\nSelf Interest\n\nRather than trying to regulate the world of virtual currencies, central banks are mainly warning of risks and attempting to garner some advantage from distributed-ledger technology for their own purposes, like upgrading payments systems.\n\nCarl-Ludwig Thiele, a board member of Germany’s Bundesbank, has described bitcoin as a “ niche phenomenon” but blockchain as far more interesting, if it can be adapted for central-bank use. In July, Austria’s Ewald Nowotny said the he’s open to new technologies but doesn’t believe that will lead to a new currency, and that dealing in bitcoin is effectively “ gambling.”\n\nThere could also be a monetary policy aspect to consider. ECB Governing Council member Jan Smets said in December that a central-bank digital currency could give policy makers more leeway when interest rates are negative. Policy makers have long been concerned that if they cut rates too low, people will simply hoard cash. The ECB’s deposit rate is currently minus 0.4 percent.\n\nOther central banks see the uses of distributed ledger technology, but worry about the abuses virtual money can be put to outside the official system -- like criminal money laundering and the sale of illegal goods. That’s not to mention the risk that virtual currencies could pose to the rest of the financial system if the bubble were to pop.\n\n‘Great Promise’\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney -- who has said blockchain shows “ great promise” -- also warned regulators this year to keep on top of developments in financial technology if they want to avoid a 2008-style crisis.\n\nWhile Mt. Gox cast a shadow over bitcoin in Japan, it now has many supporters in the world’s third-biggest economy. Parliament passed a law in April this year making it a legal method of payment. Japan’s largest banks have invested in bitcoin exchanges and small-cap stocks linked to the cryptocurrency or its underlying technology have rallied this year as it begins to win favor with some retailers.\n\nWith the nation’s Financial Services Agency responsible for bitcoin’s regulation, the BOJ remains focused on studying its distributed ledger technology.\n\nNot Ready Yet\n\n""Central banks are not yet ready for regulating digital currencies,"" said Xiao Geng, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. ""But they have to in the future since unregulated digital currencies are prone to crime and Ponzi-type speculation.""\n\nTo be sure, the attraction of virtual currencies for many remains speculation, rather than for households or companies buying and selling goods.\n\n""It is a fad that will die down and it will be used by less than 1 percent of consumers and accepted by even fewer merchants,"" said Sumit Agarwal of Georgetown University, who was previously a senior financial economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. ""Even if we can make the digital currency safe it has many hurdles.""\n\n— With assistance by Brett Miller, Lucy Meakin, Carolynn Look, and Justina Lee', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nContinued Gains\n\nThe price of bitcoin surged to this all-new high after breaking through $4,000 for the first time earlier this month and then trading range-bound for a few weeks.\n\nAfter reaching this latest all-time high, bitcoin prices, which have been enjoying a very strong rally, have risen close to 400% this year, according to additional BPI data.\n\nSustained Inflows\n\nWhile this might seem impressive, the total market capitalization (market cap) of the crypto market has climbed more than twice as much, pushing higher as investors continue to pour money into the broader asset class.\n\nThe market cap of these innovative assets has surged more than 800% this year, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nGoing Forward\n\nAs cryptocurrencies gain more widespread adoption, the investor inflows that caused these values to rise may only grow stronger.\n\nThis continued interest could cause Bitcoin prices to appreciate far more going forward, rising to $10,000, as some have predicted, or even higher.\n\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.', 'Image copyright TED Image caption Bitcoin Foundation\'s Llew Claasen sees huge potential for crypto-currency in Africa\n\nThe head of the Bitcoin Foundation, Llew Claasen, has urged people to invest ""no more than they can afford"" in the crypto-currency.\n\nHe was speaking at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania about the potential for Bitcoin in Africa.\n\nBillions lack access to formal banking, but the uptake of mobile money means many are willing to embrace alternatives.\n\nBitcoin had been adopted in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, he said.\n\nThe digital currency had particular resonance in countries with volatile economies, he said.\n\n""It offers people a chance to protect their savings from government abuse of monetary policy.\n\n""A lot of people in Zimbabwe are interested in it as an alternative financial system, but that is not an easy thing to do formally as we don\'t want to be perceived as wanting to disrupt economies,"" he told the BBC.\n\nSmall businesses\n\nThe Washington-based Bitcoin Foundation is a non-profit organisation that promotes the use of Bitcoin around the world.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bitcoin reached a peak price against the US dollar in late August\n\nLike other crypto-currencies, it relies on a digital technology called the blockchain - a decentralised digital ledger that records every transaction.\n\nThe tokenisation of crypto-currency - in which the rights to an asset are converted into a digital token on a blockchain - could also have a big impact on Africa, Mr Claasen said.\n\n""It means a small business owner can tokenise shares in his business so investors do not have to go through a central intermediary or register their shares.""\n\nThat would make it easier for investors to both put money in and take it out of businesses, he added.\n\nMr Claasen admitted that, in its current form, Bitcoin was not great as an alternative to cash.\n\nBut, he said, a forthcoming network upgrade would make low-cost transactions on the mobile network easier.\n\n""Currently the network has a transactional input of three to four transactions per second, which isn\'t great if you want to use it as cash.\n\n""But once the upgrade goes live, effectively there will be no limit to the transactions the network can handle.""\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Efforts are being made to allow more Bitcoin transactions to be processed at once\n\nThat upgrade is due in the next six to 12 months.\n\nBitcoin recently hit an all-time high, with the value of one bitcoin soaring to about $4,500 (£3,470).\n\nBut Mr Claasen sounded a note of caution, urging people not to invest ""more than they can afford"".\n\n""To be honest Bitcoin is not a great form of cash right now. Don\'t think of it as cash, think of it as a digital form of gold that enables you to save outside of the current financial climate,"" he said.\n\nHe blamed the currency\'s recent volatility of the currency on ""unsophisticated investors"".\n\n""They read an article about it which may or may not be true and make decisions about its long-term future, and that is why we have extreme swings,"" he said.\n\nBut in a decade\'s time, he said, everyone would have ""two wallets"", one reflecting local currency and one with a variety of crypto-currencies.\n\nHe dismissed worries that the currency, because of its anonymous nature, could be used for tax evasion and money-laundering.\n\nHe pointed to a European Union report this summer that suggested that its potential for criminal activity had been overblown.\n\n""It found that there was not a lot of large-scale criminal behaviour,"" he said.\n\n""Bitcoin is not completely anonymous and it is fairly easy for someone, say a revenue officer, to work backwards to find who was responsible for a transaction.""', 'Bitcoin price is exhibiting more bullish momentum but could use a quick pullback before going on another leg higher.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price recently surged to new all-time highs after a brief period of consolidation at the top of its range resistance.\n\nPrice is stalling around $4600 so bulls might need more energy before resuming the climb.\n\nA pullback to the rising trend line and nearby area of interest could be enough to draw more buyers to the game.\n\nBitcoin price is exhibiting more bullish momentum but could use a quick pullback before going on another leg higher.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside, which means that the rally is more likely to resume than to reverse. The short-term moving average is in line with the ascending trend line connecting the latest lows of bitcoin price action.\n\nThis also coincides with the area of interest or former resistance at the $4400 area. A larger pullback could last until the 200 SMA dynamic support near $4200, but a break below this area could spur more declines.\n\nStochastic is turning down from the overbought area so bitcoin price might follow suit as this indicates a pickup in selling pressure. A bit of bearish divergence can be seen since the oscillator made lower highs while price had higher highs. RSI is also on the move down to show the presence of bearish pressure.\n\nA move below the rising trend line support could put bitcoin price on track towards testing the longer-term range support at $3800-4000. On the other hand, a break past the recent highs could trigger a climb to the $5000 major psychological barrier.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nThe rise in geopolitical tension between the US and North Korea has led to a boost in bitcoin price as cryptocurrencies are usually in demand in these scenarios. Traders typically move their funds out of traditional markets like stocks and commodities while seeking higher returns in alternative assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar is also under pressure on weak NFP expectations as this could completely douse hopes of another Fed interest rate hike later this year. On the other hand, an upbeat reading could boost dollar demand against bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

A safe haven is a precautionary trade which investors trade under heightened uncertainty. The ultimate safe haven trade for investors has been the yellow shining metal, however, a new popular derivative which is behaving like a safe haven is cryptocurrency. Bitcoin stands tall in that basket because as of today the collective market cap of all the cryptocurrencies has reached a $161 billion for the first time. The acceptance of Bitcoin has been phenomenal especially this year (it has been highly volatile as well).\n\nHeightened Geopolitics Moving Gold & Bitcoin\n\nInvestors have panicked after the North Korean missiles have flown over Japan and the president of Japan has called the action reckless. The Asian markets have felt the pain of this event (the Nikkei and HSI indices dropped -0.45% and -0.35% respectively) and the situation is equally intense for the European and U.S. markets. I would expect this pain to become more stark as the counter-reaction from the US would make investors only more nervous. Statements such as ""all options are on the table"" are the most worrying.\n\nThe price of gold and Bitcoin are showing solid gains and this is nothing more than a risk off trade. The question is, which one is more reliable? Of course, gold has a massive history to back this thesis because Bitcoin is relatively new. However, this is not to say that Bitcoin cannot be considered as a safe haven trade. In the beginning of August, gold price bounced by $31 (from the lows of $1258.80 an ounce) due to the heightened tensions between the US and North Korea. Similarly, Bitcoin price was trading somewhere near $1985 per coin in the middle of July and as the hostilities between the two nations heightened, the price skyrocketed to $3000. Thus, it is evidently clear that investors have used Bitcoin as another tool to hedge their risk. Simply put, they are considering Bitcoin as a safe haven currency.

08/30/2017,"['Litecoin, based on the same technology, but faster and cheaper can emerge as the more usable, and thus more valuable, currency.\n\nBitcoin remains king of this space, but as adoption comes it has some shortcomings that might hold it back.\n\nThe crypto world continues to grow. The total market cap of crypto currencies now stands above $160 billion, up from near $90 billion at the start of August and up from $66 billion in mid-July during investor anxiety about the Bitcoin hard fork and/or a correction from the enormous rise in early 2017.\n\nAt the head of the growth is Bitcoin, the original currency, and still the predominant one - holding a near 47% share of the total market cap, despite there being over 800 currencies now listed as open for trading on a variety of exchanges.\n\nBitcoin itself has surpassed $4600 this month, double where it was trading at during the mid-July lull described above. Bull analysts see it hitting $5000 in the near future, while others are calling for $7500 or even $10,000 by year’s end.\n\nThere are a few items that could hold Bitcoin from hitting that price point, including regulatory affairs from the SEC and other governing bodies. However, I don’t see that as the main threat to Bitcoin’s adoption curve. Instead, that issue is its speed, cost, and anonymity. In analyzing these, and especially in the first two items, it becomes apparent that Litecoin - often called the “silver” to Bitcoin’s gold - is a potent adversary to Bitcoin and one that could be poised for global domination.\n\nFirst, a few fundamentals. Litecoin currently trades around $62, with a market cap above $3 billion. As such, it’s the 5th largest coin in the crypto world. There are 52 million Litecoins available on the market, with a max supply of 84 million. Bitcoin has a max supply of 21 million, exactly one fourth of Litecoin, which is no accident.\n\nMost importantly, however, is that Litecoin is up an extraordinary 1300% from the beginning of the year. Since Bitcoin was already a formidable currency, its rise hasn’t been that dramatic.\n\nLastly, Litecoin has become quite popular among traders in Asian markets (who have generally driven trends in the larger crypto market). On certain Asian markets, the volume of trading on exchanges has exploded.\n\nAs the article states:\n\nLitecoin’s rise has been accompanied by an eruption of volume on Asian cryptocurrency exchanges. At present, Litecoin’s single greatest trading pair is LTC/KRW on Bithumb, which accounts for $181 million in daily volume. LTC/CNY pairs on OKCoin and Huobi account for a combined volume of $250 million, while BTC and USD pairs do not appear until 4th and 5th.\n\nSo there’s some huge interest for Litecoin among these markets, and it’s not a coin that’s traded for (or to) Bitcoin. It’s clearly a stand-alone investment at this point.\n\nBut what is Litecoin and why does that matter for Bitcoin investors?\n\nLitecoin is a coin meant to mirror Bitcoin. It’s built on the same protocol and technology as Bitcoin. This is vital because Litecoin can leverage Bitcoin’s engineering community, either to mirror updates, or to improve itself should it take over dominance from Bitcoin one day.\n\nLitecoin is meant to be “light” as the name implies and move both faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. It does this by creating a block in 1/4th the time it takes Bitcoin to do so.\n\nBitcoin, which was meant to empower people to send money through a de-centralized system quickly, might not be able to pull that off when the amount of transactions scales enormously. But, Litecoin can.\n\nIn fact, now that the “segwit” update has been implemented into both technologies (remember Litecoin uses the same as Bitcoin), there will be a larger block size and some fun and a new technology called Lightning Network. This will allow Litecoin and Bitcoin to be traded timelessly and almost costless. Moreover, something called “atomic swaps” are in the pipeline to allow for more seamless trading among different coins.\n\nAll of this is good, and if Bitcoin can keep speed, it marks an improvement for that coin, but it doesn’t look like it’s trending in that direction.\n\nThe second consideration is on fees. Currently, Bitcoin users on certain exchanges are looking at (sometimes set) fees of nearly $7 to send or move Bitcoin. This may be great for miners, but is terrible for consumers, as well as the outlook for Bitcoin’s move to prominence.\n\nThat kind of fee just simply isn’t going to turn the tide on the modern banking system, itself accused of having frustratingly high fees to move capital.\n\nBitcoin’s August 1st hard fork was supposed to solve for this and indeed Bitcoin Cash might be the answer. Yet, Bitcoin Cash has been the most volatile investment in the top 10 cryptocurrencies, and its hard fork away from Bitcoin means that its users might continue to stray away from its original place and technology. Litecoin should emerge as the alternative to Bitcoin, not Cash.\n\nCrypto investor, Tuur Demeester, predicted a bull run by Litecoin with BitCoinCash hitting its high on August 19th, a sell off was imminent:\n\nDue to its similarities to bitcoin in terms of structure, monetary policy and philosophy, Litecoin has been considered as a hedge investment tool against Bitcoin’s volatility for awhile.\n\nThere’s good reason to think that Bitcoin will continue to see its price rise as more people and money are brought into this new industry. But as adoption comes, it might not serve as the best use case currency. Litecoin has the opportunity to emerge as that option, and Bitcoin and crypto investors at large need to take notice.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long LITECOIN.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.', 'Burger King, which belongs to Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE: QSR ), is introducing its own take on Bitcoin in Russia and its name is “WhopperCoin.”\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe WhopperCoin will be available to customers in Russia that sign up for a new rewards program. This program will give customers one of the digital coins for each ruble that they spend at the restaurant.\n\nCustomers that collect enough of the WhopperCoins can trade them in for food. Burger King will require 1,700 coins of the virtual currency to be traded in for a Whopper. The company will be creating a total of 1 billion of the digital coins to reward customers with.\n\nBurger King says that it is also planning to introduce a new mobile app that will allow customers to track their Whoppercoins. The app is ready yet, but should be out in the near future. It will be available for devices running Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Google Android operating systems, reports Coindesk.\n\n“We are pleased that Burger King Russia has chosen Waves as a platform for launching its loyalty program and the emission of WhopperCoin,” Maxim Pertsovsky, Business Development Director of Waves Platform, said in a statement. “We are confident that this decision will promote the popularization of blockade technology in Russia, and will also bring its benefits and opportunities to a wide audience.”\n\nWhile WhopperCoin is the first, it likely won’t be the last cryptocurrency made by a company. Dr Garrick Hileman, of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, says that he expects other companies to create their own virtual currencies for use in rewards programs.\n\nAs of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.', 'The most popular online exchange for trading digital currencies is generating a surge in customer complaints this year even as investors are lured by a dramatic rise in prices.\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has received at least 293 complaints about Coinbase Inc., according to data reviewed by Bloomberg. That compares with about six complaints for all of 2016, and makes Coinbase the biggest recipient of CFPB virtual currency complaints this year. The website has struggled to keep up with spiking volume and longer transaction processing times as the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soared to record highs.\n\nMore than a third of the grievances came from individuals who said they were unable to access their money when promised. Many people also complained about other transaction or service problems. Accusations of fraud represented less than 15 percent of the complaints.\n\n""The funds were supposed to be transferred to my checking account within three-to-five business days,"" one customer complained to the CFPB in May. ""I need the money.""\n\nMegan Hernbroth, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Coinbase, declined to comment on the CFPB complaints.\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, the CFPB has received more than 250 complaints under the ""virtual currency"" category. About 60 percent of those were directed at Coinbase, while many of the others were aimed at PayPal Holdings Inc. and large banks.\n\nCoinbase, which was founded in 2012, said in June that it’s working to improve customer support. The exchange has grappled with a slew of performance issues, including outages, slow load times and a flash crash in ether, the second most valuable virtual coin.\n\n""Over the past few months, we’ve seen an unprecedented increase in the number of customers signing up to use Coinbase,"" wrote the company’s co-founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong, in a June 6 blog post. ""As a result, our systems have been pushed to the limit. This has caused many customers to have a negative experience.""\n\nOn its support page, Coinbase says transaction timing can vary depending on a customer’s location and payment method, and U.S. bank transfers can take up to five business days.\n\nLendEDU, a New Jersey-based student loan marketplace, pointed out the increase in virtual currency complaints this year, in a report earlier this week.\n\nCryptocurrency startups have been overwhelmed with unusually high volume as the price of bitcoin has skyrocketed almost fivefold this year. This month, the debate over how to speed up transactions became so contentious that bitcoin split in two.\n\nThe CFPB, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, started accepting complaints about virtual currencies in 2014, warning consumers about unclear costs, scams and lost funds. Three years later, the Securities and Exchange Commission said that cryptocurrency exchanges and companies that raise money through the sale of digital assets must adhere to federal securities laws, signaling a clampdown on the recent surge in virtual coin offerings.', 'Since its first big spike in growth and subsequent plummet with the Mt. Gox hack, Bitcoin has been labeled a bubble waiting to burst. People have likened its growth to many different bubbles, most notably the dotcom boom in the 1990s.\n\nHowever, the truth of the matter is that Bitcoin keeps breaking barriers as it reached another all time high this week. In fact, a closer inspection of the growth, and the eventual burst of the associated bubbles shows that Bitcoin is so far off the charts that it looks like an absolute outlier.\n\nAn age of digital currencies\n\nThis year alone, Bitcoin has surged over 350 percent as it reached $4,650 coin. However, it is not the only one driving the market for digital currencies.\n\n""The entire market cap for digital currencies is up near 800 percent this year as other cryptocurrencies experience huge gains, some even more than Bitcoin.""\n\nRipple showed at the halfway stage of the year that it was the best performer as it experienced growth of 4,000 percent at the end of the second quarter this year.\n\nNo comparison\n\nWith so many investors, such as billionaire investor and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Group, Howard Marks, the man who predicted the dotcom bubble, calling this another fad or bubble, their analysis is lacking somewhat.\n\nLooking at a chart of the growth of sectors that experienced bubbles since 1990, there is a familiar pattern. However, Bitcoin skyrockets off and away from that chart, showing no correlation with the tech bubble, the homebuilders bubble or the biotech bubble.\n\nMaturity rather than a bubble\n\nWhile the dotcom bubble had similarities to the way in which Bitcoin was attracting money, as people simply tried to align themselves to any sort of Internet company regardless of its profitability, there are those who think Bitcoin is actually maturing.\n\nRather than attracting any kind of interest or investment, Bitcoin has started enticing traditional investors.\n\nBelievers in the digital coin, such as Octagon Strategy’s Dave Chapman, say this is actually just the tipping point and that Bitcoin can grow to reach $10,000 very soon.', 'The Week of the Altcoins\n\nThis graph show how prices have changed since the midnight December 7th with prices at that point being rebased to 100\n\nPrices as of 11:59 PM UTC 13/12/17 (Source: coinmarketcap)\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen another week of volatility. Litecoin’s market cap has increased by over 200% as it becomes a popular alternative to bitcoin, as the latter has faced fears of increased regulation. XRP has also been riding the wave, seeing a 50% price hike from last week.\n\n1. Bitcoin Futures Live on Cboe\n\nThe Story\n\nPlans to launch bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange have gone ahead as contracts began trading at 23:00 GMT on Sunday. The contracts will allow investors to bet on the future value of bitcoin. On the news bitcoin’s price rose significantly.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThe contract allows individuals to bet on bitcoin’s price at a specified time in the future. Given bitcoin’s rise of over 1,000% this year, many investors are keen to get in on the action; CBOE’s Bitcoin futures contract will enable investors to do so without actually owning the cryptocurrency. Additionally, it will be possible to short sell the digital asset for the first time, allowing investors to profit from price falls.\n\nThe move suggests the cryptocurrency is now becoming a mainstream investment, however, Bitcoin remains to be traded on unregulated markets. Consequently, its price is likely to remain volatile.\n\nHigh Volatility\n\nIn an effort to ease volatility, the CBOE decided it would suspend trading for two minutes for price fluctuations of more than 10% and five minutes for more than 20%. In the contract’s first session, trading was stopped twice: once for two minutes and once for five minutes. While bitcoin remains traded on largely unregulated markets, it is questionable whether this policy will have any effect on the underlying cryptocurrency’s volatility.\n\nThe Future\n\nBloomberg’s Adam Haigh said the futures contracts was “an incremental step that allows Wall Street and indeed the professional finance community to make a bet either way on bitcoin.” The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is expected to list a similar contract next week, and Nasdaq has announced plans to host such trading too.\n\nLast week Revolut’s decision to facilitate the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could increase demand for the underlying asset.\n\nAllegations that 1,000 people own 40% of all bitcoins in circulation suggest its price could be manipulated by a relatively small number of individuals.\n\n2. 1,000 People Apparently Own 40% of Bitcoin\n\nThe Winklevoss twins invest $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. (Attribution: By cellanr [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Story\n\nRoughly 40% of the cryptocurrency is owned by 1,000 people, claims Aaron Brown, head of financial markets research at AQR Capital Management. In such an unregulated market, Brown said large holders of bitcoin could potentially be working together to orchestrate price changes. Given bitcoin’s recent spike, now could be a great opportunity for these users to part with a portion of their bitcoins, locking in the near 1600% price increase since the start of the year.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nBitcoin appears to be making its way into mainstream investing. Last Friday the US regulator gave the CME group and CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch bitcoin futures. Just yesterday, London-based digital banking company Revolut launched Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether trading for their users.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency becomes a more mainstream investment and demand for it rises, these bitcoin ‘whales’ will be able to part with their bitcoins for a hefty profit. This could leave new investors with an asset in the midst of a bubble.\n\nRoger Ver, a well known early adopter of bitcoin said, regarding ‘whales’ working together, “I suspect that is likely true, and people should be able to do whatever they want with their own money.”\n\nWhile the question of whether Brown’s allegation is true must be approached with scepticism, there is evidence of some very large investors in the space. Bloomberg recently reported that on November 12th, “someone moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, worth about $159 million at the time, to an online exchange.” Bitcoin’s market cap is roughly $270bn at the time of writing, but if this investor was to sell on a single exchange, it could potentially crash the market.\n\nLarge Bitcoin Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who gained fame for attempting to take control of Facebook, invested $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. This amount has many times over.\n\nTim Draper, a billionaire venture capitalist best known for his investment in Skype – during the companies early days – bought 30,000 bitcoins back in 2014. He has since invested in Tezos’ ICO.\n\nBarry Silbert, the founder of the Digital Currency Group, picked up 48,000 bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was worth $350 a piece.\n\n3. Ethereum Wallet Scam Closed Down\n\nThe Story\n\nDigital wallet provider myetherwallet.com announced yesterday that it had no affiliation with an iOS-based cryptocurrency wallet app using its name. The app, which became the third most popular on the finance section of the App Store, allows users to import and open a digital wallet to store ether. Fake digital wallets could lose investors their cryptocurrencies permanently, so it is important investors (and app stores) keep an eye out for scams.\n\nSecurity and Ethereum\n\nIn July, a developer error on the ethereum network meant a hacker pocket $31m worth of ether. While the technology is still in its infancy mistakes are bound to be made. However, several digital wallet hacks have emerged since cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and users need to take security seriously while safeguards are not in place.\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies security, the owness is with the users. Sending ether from a digital wallet means I am responsible for my transfers. If I make a mistake when typing in the amount, or address of the receiver, I cannot call my bank and ask them to void the transaction. Consequently, user’s wallets are being targeted by scammers.\n\nSo far there have been no reports that the fake wallet stole from anyone. The company may have simply used the name for its familiarity in the ethereum community.\n\nMyetherwallet.com have since announced the removal of the app from the iOS store.\n\n4. San Francisco ICO Closed Down by SEC\n\nThe Story\n\nSan Francisco-based restaurant reviewing app Munchee has been forced to stop its initial coin offering (ICO) and reimburse investors after regulators raised concerns over the company’s tokens not meeting securities regulations. Munchee was looking to obtain $15m to “improve an existing iPhone app centred on restaurant meal reviews and create an “ecosystem” in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens,” according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHowever, “in the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasized that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens,” they added. The regulator felt investors were led to believe they would gain a return on their tokens, however, the tokens did not meet the authority’s standards. The company was not fined due to its quick response to the SEC’s requests.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nLast week PlexCoin’s founders were charged with defrauding investors. This was the first time the SEC’s newly established Cyber Unit filed charges. The regulator issued a statement back in July saying ICOs will be subject to US security laws.\n\nBoth cases suggest a serious commitment to ensuring investors are not mis-sold securities, particularly in the ICO space.\n\n5. Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Not A Substitute for Gold\n\nSource: Tradingeconomics.com\n\nThe Story\n\nThe simultaneous rise of bitcoin and relatively poor performance of gold has provoked many to ask whether the two assets are in competition. The short answer is no, they are not.\n\n“Bitcoin has real potential, if it were to become digital gold it might have tremendous space to grow,” said Gabor Gurbacs, Vaneck Securities Director of Digital Asset Strategy. It is this sentiment which has put the two in contest. However, the investor pool for each is “vastly different”, according to Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.\n\nGold based exchange-traded funds are currently at close to their highest since May 2013, suggesting the metal remains part of investor’s portfolios, and not that investors have not cashed out and moved over to bitcoin. The reason this is not the case lies in comparing the function each asset serves and the investors it attracts.\n\nComparing Bitcoin and Gold\n\nBitcoin attracts more speculative investors looking for quick returns, while gold is often held as a portion of investment portfolios to spread risk. In times of economic downturn gold tends to go up in price, balancing any losses from stocks and bonds. The two assets currently serve distinct purposes. Consequently, bitcoin’s price rise is unlikely to have turned investors away from gold.\n\n6. Jamie Dimon Eases Hostility Towards Bitcoin After Futures Contracts Go Live\n\nSource: By Steve Jurvetson (Flickr: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Story\n\nSource: CNBC\n\n“I remain highly skeptical of it,” said JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon, when recently asked about bitcoin. “I’m open-minded to uses of cryptocurrency if properly controlled and regulated,” Dimon added. The executive, who famously called bitcoin a “fraud” appears to have softened his opinion just days after the bitcoin-based futures derivative began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThis is the first time Dimon has spoken about bitcoin for two months. The timing of Dimon’s comments might suggest JPMorgan will offer the bitcoin derivative to its clients. The contract would allow clients to take long or short positions on bitcoin’s price.\n\nSimilar contracts will trade on the CME and Nasdaq exchanges in the near future.\n\n7. Cryptocurrency as Collateral for Loans\n\nThe Story\n\nA growing number of early cryptocurrency adopters, who have seen astronomical gains, will now be able to use their cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans. London-based Nebeus is helping third-party lenders create loans guaranteed by cryptocurrency collateral. The company created 100 of these loans on its first day and has made 1,000 more since says Nebeus’ Managing Director Konstantin Zaripov.\n\nGiven bitcoin’s market cap of almost $300bn, and a total cryptocurrency market cap of over $500bn, the market for these loans could be colossal. However, some worry that these assets are in a bubble, and their collapse makes these loans hugely risky for lenders.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nAround 40% of all bitcoins are held by 1,000 people, Bloomberg reported last week. Prior to this innovation, these users would only be able to cash in on their gains by selling their cryptocurrencies. “I can see a lending industry in the tens of billions of dollars,” said Aaron Brown, former managing director at AQR Capital Management.\n\nThe loans could attract attention from cryptocurrency miners, who earn tokens for processing blockchain network transactions. This group are typically ideologically attached to the idea of decentralised currencies, and such loans could allow them to hold on to their cryptocurrencies while they cover their overheads.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s 1700% rise since the start of the year has caused many to stay clear. A collapse of these digital assets would leave lenders in a tough position.\n\nMust Read Articles\n\nBitcoin, Ripple and Cryptocurrencies: Here to Stay and Prosper\n\nIt is nigh on impossible to observe financial news without hearing about the rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which recently surpassed the $15,000 mark and is continuously setting new all-time highs. ..

Alan Patricof, the founder and managing director of Greycroft, announced on Wednesday a $2 million investment into BitPesa, a startup that uses blockchain to speed up business payments across Africa and Asia.\n\nWhile the size of the investment is modest, the involvement of Patricof, one of the country’s first venture capitalists, is significant. While his firm has invested in various fintech companies—most notably Venmo, Acorns, and Braintree—Patricof and Greycroft have so far shied away from the crypto-currency space.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Patricof said his decision to back BitPesa is based on his confidence in the company’s young founder and CEO, Elizabeth Rossiello.\n\nRossiello stands out in the digital currency world not only because she’s a woman, but because of her educational background. She studied at Columbia University’s School for International and Public Affairs, which is known as a hothouse of UN-types and lefty activists—but also snuck away to take corporate finance classes at the business school.\n\nAfter a stint at Goldman Sachs, Rossiello worked in Africa where she discovered how people relied on SIM cards and national phone carriers to do their banking. This experience helped her see the potential for different payment platforms—including bitcoin wallets, which let people conduct transactions without intermediary actors that siphoned off high fees.\n\nThis led Rossiello to launch BitPesa as a cheap and efficient way to make business payments in places like Kenya, Nairobi, and Uganda. Increasingly, BitPesa is helping companies with more global transactions; she cited the example of an East African firm using BitPesa to purchase a fleet of cars from a Japanese exporter.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nBitPesa, which also provides remittance services, deploys APIs to work a network of banks and mobile payments. This means that some customers may not even be aware that BitPesa is relying on the bitcoin network to conduct and record the transaction.\n\nIn its latest funding round, BitPesa raised a total of $3 million from Greycroft and Plug and Play. This brings total investment in the company to over $10 million, following a $2.5 million Series A in January (which included a few very small contribution from Greycroft), and earlier investments from angels and seed investors.\n\nAs for bitcoin’s volatility and relatively slow transaction speed (it takes ten minutes or more for a payment to register on the blockchain), Rossiello countered that bitcoin is infinitely superior to wire transfers, which can take days and provide unreliable records. She also noted that many African currencies are actually more volatile than bitcoin.\n\nBitPesa, however, doesn’t hold onto bitcoin to store or trade, but instead relies on third parties like bitcoin-giant Circle to provide the liquidity it needs. Patricof said he likes this attribute about the company, saying it means BitPesa is not a speculative enterprise and isn’t exposed to the price swings that regularly jolt crypto-currency markets.\n\nPatricof added that, unlike many New York venture capitalists, he does not hold any bitcoin for himself. That’s not the case, though, with Rossiello.\n\n“Of course I do,” she said. “I use it because I want to do what the experience is like for my partners. It’s as if I built a highway—I would drive a truck on it to make sure it went smoothly.”', 'When the cryptocurrency Exio Coin starts a round of fundraising on Sept. 7, its founders say the unit will come with a unique distinction: the first to be endorsed by a sovereign nation.The identity of the government backer won’t be revealed until October, and Bloomberg News has no way of verifying the claim of support. According to co-founder Sunny Johnson though, the supporter is one of ""the world’s richest countries"" on a per capita basis.The claim of official approval highlights how the boom in cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology is becoming too big for central banks, long the guardian of official money, to ignore. From speculative betting to trading solar power, digital money is proliferating.Until recently, officials at major central banks were happy to watch as pioneers in the field progressed by trial and error, safe in the knowledge that it was dwarfed by roughly $5 trillion circulating daily in conventional currency markets . But now as officials turn an eye toward the increasingly pervasive technology, the risk is that they’re reacting too late to both the pitfalls and the opportunities presented by digital coinage.""Central banks cannot afford to treat cyber currencies as toys to play with in a sand box,"" said Andrew Sheng, chief adviser to the China Banking Regulatory Commission and Distinguished Fellow of the Asia Global Institute, University of Hong Kong. ""It is time to realize that they are the real barbarians at the gate."" Bitcoin -- the largest and best-known digital currency -- and its peers pose a threat to the established money system by effectively circumventing it. Money as we know it depends on the authority of the state for credibility, with central banks typically managing its price and/or quantity. Cryptocurrencies skirt all that and instead rely on their supposedly unhackable technology to guarantee value.If they don’t get a handle on bitcoin and their ilk, and more people adopt them, central banks could see an erosion of their control over the money supply. The solution may be in the old adage, if you can’t beat them, join them.The People’s Bank of China has done trial runs of its prototype cryptocurrency, taking it a step closer to being the first major central bank to issue digital money. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have launched a joint research project which studies the possible use of distributed ledger -- the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies -- for market infrastructure.The Dutch central bank has created its own cryptocurrency -- for internal circulation only -- to better understand how it works. And Ben Bernanke , the former chairman of the Federal Reserve who has said digital currencies show ""long term promise,"" will be the keynote speaker at a blockchain and banking conference in October hosted by Ripple, the startup behind the fourth largest digital currency.Russia, too, has shown interest in ethereum, the second-largest digital currency, with the central bank deploying a blockchain pilot program.In the U.S., both banks and regulators are studying distributed ledger technology and Fed officials have made a couple of formal speeches on the topic in the past 12 months, but have voiced reservations about digital currencies themselves.Fed Governor Jerome Powell said in March there were “significant policy issues” concerning them that needed further study, including vulnerability to cyber-attack, privacy and counterfeiting. He also cautioned that a central bank digital currency could stifle innovations to improve the existing payments system.At the same time, central bankers are obviously wary of the risks posed by alternative currencies -- including financial instability and fraud. One example: The Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange collapsed spectacularly in 2014 after disclosing that it lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.But for all their theoretical tinkering, official-money guardians have largely stood by as digital currencies have taken off. The explosion in initial coin offerings, or ICOs, is evidence. Investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the digital currency market this year alone.The dollar value of the 20 biggest cryptocurrencies is around $150 billion, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin itself has soared more than 380 percent this year and hit a record -- but it’s also prone to wild swings, like a 50 percent slump at the end of 2013.""At a global level, there is an urgent need for regulatory clarity given the growth of the market,"" said Daniel Heller, Visiting Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and previously head of financial stability at the Swiss National Bank.Rather than trying to regulate the world of virtual currencies, central banks are mainly warning of risks and attempting to garner some advantage from distributed-ledger technology for their own purposes, like upgrading payments systems.Carl-Ludwig Thiele, a board member of Germany’s Bundesbank, has described bitcoin as a “niche phenomenon” but blockchain as far more interesting, if it can be adapted for central-bank use. In July, Austria’s Ewald Nowotny said the he’s open to new technologies but doesn’t believe that will lead to a new currency, and that dealing in bitcoin is effectively “ gambling.”There could also be a monetary policy aspect to consider. ECB Governing Council member Jan Smets said in December that a central-bank digital currency could give policy makers more leeway when interest rates are negative. Policy makers have long been concerned that if they cut rates too low, people will simply hoard cash. The ECB’s deposit rate is currently minus 0.4 percent.Other central banks see the uses of distributed ledger technology, but worry about the abuses virtual money can be put to outside the official system -- like criminal money laundering and the sale of illegal goods. That’s not to mention the risk that virtual currencies could pose to the rest of the financial system if the bubble were to pop.Bank of England Governor Mark Carney -- who has said blockchain shows “ great promise” -- also warned regulators this year to keep on top of developments in financial technology if they want to avoid a 2008-style crisis.While Mt. Gox cast a shadow over bitcoin in Japan, it now has many supporters in the world’s third-biggest economy. Parliament passed a law in April this year making it a legal method of payment. Japan’s largest banks have invested in bitcoin exchanges and small-cap stocks linked to the cryptocurrency or its underlying technology have rallied this year as it begins to win favor with some retailers.With the nation’s Financial Services Agency responsible for bitcoin’s regulation, the BOJ remains focused on studying its distributed ledger technology.""Central banks are not yet ready for regulating digital currencies,"" said Xiao Geng, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. ""But they have to in the future since unregulated digital currencies are prone to crime and Ponzi-type speculation.""To be sure, the attraction of virtual currencies for many remains speculation, rather than for households or companies buying and selling goods.""It is a fad that will die down and it will be used by less than 1 percent of consumers and accepted by even fewer merchants,"" said Sumit Agarwal of Georgetown University, who was previously a senior financial economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. ""Even if we can make the digital currency safe it has many hurdles.""The founders of Exio Coin argue they have developed a middle way with principles of governance that will set the trend for the blockchain industry. While some regulation is inevitable, cryptocurrencies are intended to be a global form of currency and not subject to the rules and regulations of one jurisdiction, said Johnson.With all the misgivings about cryptocurrencies, having a sovereign endorser -- rather than an issuer -- may be a pragmatic way of offering the benefits of digital money with less of the worry.""With no one central bank maintaining control Exio Coin will retain its decentralized characteristics,"" Johnson said. ""The sovereign endorser shares our vision for the future.""', 'Llew Claasen, Executive Director of The Bitcoin Foundation, has announced that the organisation has retained legal counsel to advise in its effort to fight against increasing federal and state regulation in the US. The foundation believes that increases in regulation are attempts to “control and stifle the adoption and use of so-called ‘virtual currencies’ such as Bitcoin.”\n\nIn a press release, Claasen claimed that the organisation’s first priority is to attempt to build a “more open and diverse dialogue with the US Congress”. The effort is a response to the planned introduction of a bill that aims to bring Bitcoin into the scope of US money-laundering enforcement agencies.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency or ""cryptocurrency"" that was created by an unknown programmer (or group of programmers) under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008. Unlike traditional forms of currency, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use encryption techniques to regulate the generation of currency and the transfer of funds. This means that the currency is decentralised – so no single institution controls the Bitcoin network. At the time of writing, one Bitcoin is approximately worth £3,365.27.\n\nBecause of encryption, the use of Bitcoin can remain anonymous. Though receipts of transactions are stored in ""blockchains"", users of the currency do not have their names, address, or other forms of personal information attached to their Bitcoin profiles. While some high street shops and bars accept the currency, many people associate the use of Bitcoin with the buying and selling of illicit services on the dark web.\n\nJust last month two of the dark web’s largest markets ""Alphabay"" and ""Hansa"" were seized in a joint effort from European police, Interpol, the FBI and the DEA. The website’s users bought and sold drugs and chemicals from one another using Bitcoin to protect their identities.\n\nUS Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in response that, “This is likely one of the most important criminal investigations of the year.” He also claimed that “The dark net is not a place to hide. We will find you.”\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation is, however, more optimistic about the future and use of the virtual currency. Their vision is to turn Bitcoin into a globally accepted method of exchanging and storing value which will operate without the need for third parties like banks.\n\nIn the release, Claasen said that, “the increased regulatory push by federal and state authorities, if it continues, is sure to threaten the existence of the fintech [financial technology] industry nationwide.”\n\nMr Claasen added: “Just as the fintech industry’s use of cryptocurrency was stifled in New York by the adoption of the so-called Bitlicence, it is highly likely that increased regulatory and legislative burdens [placed upon Bitcoin] will have a similar negative impact.”\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation was founded as a non-profit in September 2012. The body\'s mission statement is to ensure that every human has the right to privacy in transactions that involve no harm to others and the right to economic participation without a bank account or credit history.\n\nIn their efforts to defend Bitcoin, The Bitcoin Foundation has retained the Ciric Law Firm, PLLC for counsel. The firm is currently challenging the US Department of Financial Services’ “Virtual Currency” regulation (Part 200 of Chapter 1 of Title 23 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations), which was promulgated in 2015 and is also known as the New York ""Bitlicence"".\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Mr Claasen said, “state and federal legislation creates hurdles for innovation, well in advance of knowing what the impact of the technology is going to be – or what it enables.\n\n“[The Bitcoin Foundation’s] view is that it is not yet clear what bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are. But by regulating the technology prematurely, you put it into a box it might not fit into later on. It’s not that we don’t believe there’s a time and place to regulate Bitcoin, we’re just saying that it’s too early and that regulation will just do harm to very innovative businesses and technologies.”\n\nWhen questioned on Bitcoin’s potential to be used for fraud, money laundering and the buying and selling of illicit goods, Mr Claasen said, “Reports by the European commission in June specifically found that there is very little of that activity, particularly there is very little terrorist funding and money laundering.”\n\nClaasen added: “Bitcoin is too hard for criminals to use at the moment. It’s easier for a criminal to use the United States dollar.”\n\nAlongside being the foundation\'s Executive Director, Mr Claasen is a member of the international marketing advisory boards the CMO Council Advisory Board for Africa, the Customer Experience Board and The Forum to Advance the Mobile Experience. He is also the co-founder of Clicks2Customers, a digital marketing agency with annual billings of over £80 billion.\n\nClaasen made it clear that Bitcoin Foundation, “doesn’t want to break the system, but it is concerned that the system is already broken.\n\n“Bitcoin has the potential to be a store of value that’s outside the control of central banks. In the future, we would like to see more adoption of Bitcoin. It’s not going to be the only currency, and it won’t replace the current system, but among other options it’s a useful case for the future.”\n\nThe venture capitalist from Cape Town claims that Bitcoin is not currently at a stage where there are concerns that it will interfere with global monetary policy.\n\n“It’s immature technology,” he claims. “There is a perception that it allows unlimited transfer of value, but it can only do three or four transfers a second. The network cannot handle larger transactions. “\n\nA key reason Claasen opposes regulation is because, “it is not possible for governments to take the view they want to regulate Bitcoin. It’s important to understand that a decentralised currency means one which is not under control by anybody.”\n\nBitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?\n\n\n\n2 show all Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?\n\n1/2 Bitcoin exists without a central bank able to manipulate its value Alamy\n\n2/2 Bitcoin’s technical lead Gavin Andresen Getty Images\n\n“I understand that regulators need to protect the currency and people from risk. [In the future] regulators will probably regulate at the end points of the cryptocurrency network. I get that, it’s inevitable. Around the world the view is the same. But governments and financial services are already struggling, as in Venezuela, and people need an alternative way.”\n\nLlew Claasen concluded that, “Aside from other things, [Bitcoin] is a positive technology. It is not one that seeks to destroy or disrupt. It’s a pity when regulators view it as something that is dangerous.”', 'A forum account tied to the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e has offered new details on how it plans to revive the services weeks after it was taken offline following a crackdown by US authorities.\n\nIn a new update, a representative for the long-running and infamous bitcoin exchange outlined how the relaunch would happen over a several week-period, occurring in three stages.\n\nDuring the first part, user information will be transferred to an as-yet-unnamed company ""in full compliance with the European directives on personal data and in compliance with European legislation in this field"", according to the post. This is expected to be completed by September 15.\n\nAfter that, an unnamed financial investment firm – referenced in past posts as a key part of the revival plan – will move to restructure the exchange\'s digital assets, as well as begin an accounting of the transferred user data. In the last stage, the investment firm will ""audit and register personal data in accordance with AML laws and KYC identification procedures.""\n\nThe representative went on to write (in a translated statement):\n\n""In parallel with the legal issue of restructuring, users will be given the opportunity to check the integrity of the digital balance in the user\'s account, and users will be able to make changes in the security of the account. For chat and support, chat will be available. For these purposes, the service will be launched on the old domain (btc-e.nz). You will be able to log in and check your balance before recounting.""\n\nAs CoinDesk previously reported, BTC- was targeted by US authorities earlier this summer. A Russian national was arrested in Greece on July 26, and later that day, the US unveiled a 21-count indictment against the exchange, as well as a $110 million fine for a host of alleged money laundering violations.\n\nYet just days after the crackdown, representatives for the exchange, taking to the Bitcoin Talk forum, pledged to revive the service and repay users who lost money when the exchange was seized. Part of that plan, subsequent updates revealed, includes the release of a blockchain-based debt token.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As a result, bitcoin cash was made 300% more difficult to mine.\n\nThis, in turn, caused the profitability of the coin to decrease dramatically. Many miners left for bitcoin, and for about 10 hours only a few blocks were found.\n\nAs a result, emergency difficulty adjustments (a technical mechanism unique to bitcoin cash) were triggered, causing the difficulty to drop enough for miners to begin switching back.\n\nWhat's interesting, however, is that at the time, bitcoin cash was still less profitable to mine than bitcoin by about 20%. Still, many miners, including those using pools like BTC.Top, ViaBTC and AntPool continued dedicating computing power to the blockchain.\n\nThis means these miners were likely giving up profit that they could have earned had they been mining bitcoin. So what gives? And why are miners mining at a loss?\n\nThis is not an easy question to answer and my analysis here is speculative. But, here are some possibilities:\n\nMiners are committed to fork\n\nMiners may be committed to making the new cryptocurrency work, as they may have now accrued a large bitcoin cash position.\n\nArmed with this vested interest, they may believe slow blocks will cause bitcoin cash to tank, so they may be mining to keep the network working smoothly.\n\nThe argument against this is that during the 10-hour window after the non-emergency difficulty adjustment, many of the same miners left. If consistent blocks were the major concern, there should have been more mining power on bitcoin during that interval.\n\nMiners think the price will rise\n\nThe miners mining now may be thinking that the bitcoin cash price will increase in the near future to make mining worthwhile. A 30–40 percent increase in the bitcoin price relative to bitcoin would certainly make their mining profitable, and they may be waiting until then to sell.\n\nThese miners may have insider information about a large buy order or may be just hoping for larger fluctuations of bitcoin cash price.\n\nMiners are getting subsidies\n\nAnother theory is that there may be bitcoin cash supporters that are subsidizing mining in some way, behind the scenes.\n\nThis could be something like an over-the-counter market for bitcoin cash where buyers are paying a higher price than the exchanges to incentivize mining. If the buyers demand freshly minted bitcoin cash, this would effectively make it so miners were the only supply that could satisfy this particular demand.\n\nSimilarly, bitcoin cash supporters could simply be paying pools to point hash power the blockchain network.\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, there are now more questions than answers.\n\nWe don't really know why miners are mining bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin. But, we know that at the very least, they aren't making as much money as they could, and this means these miners are paying some opportunity cost in order to mine bitcoin cash.\n\nGold panning image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 SPX, -0.41% , and the Nasdaq Composite index COMP, -0.28% have all reached record highs lately, with emerging-economy financial markets also performing strongly, as investors search for stability amid widespread uncertainty.\n\nBut, because this performance is not based on market fundamentals, it is unsustainable — and very risky.\n\nAccording to Mohamed El-Erian, the lost lesson of the 2007 financial crisis is that current economic-growth models are “overly reliant on liquidity and leverage — from private financial institutions, and then from central banks.” And, indeed, a key driver of financial markets’ performance today is the expectation of continued central-bank liquidity.\n\nAfter the Federal Reserved revealed its decision last month to leave interest rates unchanged, the Dow Jones Industrial Average set intraday and closing records; the Nasdaq, too, reached all-time highs.\n\nBut there is another factor that could further destabilize an already-tenuous leverage- and liquidity-based system: digital currencies. And, on this front, policy makers and regulators have far less control.\n\nThe concept of private cryptocurrencies was born of mistrust of official money. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto — the mysterious creator of bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency — described it as a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash,” which “would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\nA 2016 working paper by the International Monetary Fund distinguished digital currency (legal tender that could be digitized) from virtual currency (non-legal tender). Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, or a kind of virtual currency that uses cryptography and distributed ledgers (the blockchain) to keep transactions both public and fully anonymous.\n\nWhether bitcoin is a bubble or not, the implications of cryptocurrencies are far-reaching.\n\nHowever you slice it, the fact is that, nine years after Nakamoto introduced bitcoin, the concept of private electronic money is poised to transform the financial-market landscape. This month, the value of bitcoin reached $4,483, with a market cap of $74.5 billion, more than five times larger than at the beginning of 2017.\n\nWhether this is a bubble, destined to collapse, or a sign of a more radical shift in the concept of money, the implications for central banking and financial stability will be profound.\n\nAt first, central bankers and regulators were rather supportive of the innovation represented by bitcoin and the blockchain that underpins it. It is difficult to argue that people should not be allowed to use a privately created asset to settle transactions without the involvement of the state.\n\nBut national authorities were wary of potential illegal uses of such assets, reflected in the bitcoin-enabled, dark-web marketplace called Silk Road, a clearinghouse for, among other things, illicit drugs. Silk Road was shut down in 2013, but more such marketplaces have sprung up.\n\nWhen the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox failed in 2014, some central banks, such as the People’s Bank of China, started discouraging the use of bitcoin. By November 2015, the Bank for International Settlements’ Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, made up of 10 major central banks, launched an in-depth examination of digital currencies.\n\nBut the danger of cryptocurrencies extends beyond facilitation of illegal activities. Like conventional currencies, cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. But, unlike official money, they also have no corresponding liability, meaning that there is no institution like a central bank with a vested interest in sustaining their value.\n\nInstead, cryptocurrencies function based on the willingness of people engaged in transactions to treat them as valuable. With the value of the proposition depending on attracting more and more users, cryptocurrencies take on the quality of a Ponzi scheme.\n\nAs the scale of cryptocurrency usage expands, so do the potential consequences of a collapse. Already, the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies amounts to nearly one tenth the value of the physical stock of official gold, with the capability to handle significantly larger payment operations, owing to low transaction costs. That means that cryptocurrencies are already systemic in scale.\n\nThere is no telling how far this trend will go. Technically, the supply of cryptocurrencies is infinite: bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, but this can be increased if a majority of “miners” (who add transaction records to the public ledger) agree. Demand is related to mistrust of conventional stores of value. If people fear that excessive taxation, regulation, or social or financial instability places their assets at risk, they will increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies.\n\nLast year’s IMF report indicated that cryptocurrencies have already been used to circumvent exchange and capital controls in China, Cyprus, Greece, and Venezuela. For countries subject to political uncertainty or social unrest, cryptocurrencies offer an attractive mechanism of capital flight, exacerbating the difficulties of maintaining domestic financial stability.\n\nMoreover, while the state has no role in managing cryptocurrencies, it will be responsible for cleaning up any mess left by a burst bubble. And, depending on where and when a bubble bursts, the mess could be substantial. In advanced economies with reserve currencies, central banks may be able to mitigate the damage. The same may not be true for emerging economies.\n\nAn invasive new species does not pose an immediate threat to the largest trees in the forest. But it doesn’t take long for less-developed systems — the saplings on the forest floor — to feel the effects. Cryptocurrencies are not merely new species to watch with interest; central banks must act now to rein in the very real threats they pose.\n\nThis article has been published with the permission of Project Syndicate — Barbarians at the Monetary Gate.', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Though not so long ago, one can assume that the new resistance zone in the BTC/USD pair is $4650.\n\nTechnically, the picture is as follows:\n\n$4400 is the support zone. There has been no full-blown retest, therefore $4400 test scenarios are highly likely.\n\n$4650 is the resistance zone. We’ve seen a lot of buys at this level over the last couple of days.\n\nGlobally, the uptrend continues. But the movement has slowed down a bit, as there is probably a gradual shift of money flow from BTC to altcoins.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\nThe most likely scenario of price behavior for the coming week is in the $4400-$4650 range. BTC will experience tests of support and resistance zones without any rapid price movements during the last hours of summer, after impressive growth in August.\n\nThe uptrend pressure may hit the $4650 zone. Apart from that, there are no other triggers. There’s no breaking news that could influence the price. In case a hit does take place, it’s very likely to be false.\n\nThe only factor that can profoundly change the course of events is some breaking news.\n\nETH/USD 31.08.2017\n\nAfter the release of the much anticipated Metropolis news, Ethereum’s upward movement has strengthened. Judging by the volumes, we will see an all time high test.\n\nThe situation is as follows:\n\nWe observe the ETH super uptrend, backed by the news. Positive news creates a good base for buys.\n\nFundamentally, the Metropolis structure leads to price increases. The difficulty bomb will affect prices significantly, in a positive way.\n\nThere are no obvious triggers for correction.\n\nGrowth is so powerful at the moment that it’s very hard to outline support and resistance zones on the global scale; whereas the buyer domination is vivid.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\nThe all-time high test is the most likely turn of events. All factors point towards it. A lot of people want to make a profit on Metropolis, that’s why there is ETH shortage on the market.\n\nNo apparent reasons for correction, any downfall is being bought out. It’s unlikely that there’ll be any strong downward movement before the Metropolis release.\n\nA flat in ETH is almost impossible, as there’s very strong domination among buyers.\n\nLTC/USD 31.08.2017\n\nThe main hedge asset of the crypto market has finally shown growth. A $55 level hit was a strong impulse that drew a potential resistance zone of $65. Charlie Li’s tweets along with Lightning Network (LN) talks are doing their job.\n\nTechnical situation:\n\nThere’s been a hit of the $55 support zone. Strong movement along the hit has proven this. No back retest has happened yet. There might be a good situation for buys.\n\nFor now, the support zone is $55 and the resistance zone is $65. But the movement in LTC is steady enough, so zones may seriously shift in the upcoming week.\n\nIn general, everything is quite good. LTC is a solid asset, so in case of any negative market movement, LTC acts as a direct beneficiary.\n\nThe news is positive and stable.\n\nSince April, a very long and powerful uptrend has formed in LTC. It’s quite a rare stability rate for a cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat to expect:', ""Bitcoin Price can Reach $4,750 or More by the end of Today\n\nBitcoin Price can Reach $4,750 or More by the end of Today\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Bloomberg has taken a closer look at what the meeting means for investors:\n\n“There are two big concerns among overseas investors who are interested in China -- the yuan and the uncertainties around the party congress,” said Han Tongli, chief investment officer at DeepBlue Global Investment Ltd. in Hong Kong, which oversees $200 million. “Once the dust has settled and the uncertainties have gone post-congress, investors will re-evaluate market pricing.”\n\nChina’s policy makers have stressed the need for stability and order in financial markets in the lead-up to what will be the 19th congress, even as they persist with a campaign against leverage endorsed by the country’s top leaders. Investors have taken comfort in the strengthened yuan and buoyant stocks, betting officials will act swiftly to quash any signs of speculation or upheaval that could distract from the party’s message of prosperity and control.\n\nBitcoin\'s spectacular gains this year have stoked concerns the digital currency may be in a bubble. CNBC has talked to Informa Financial Intelligence strategist David Ader who reckons the five-fold rise in the price of Bitcoin this year is a little over the top:\n\n""This is the price chart for an overly frothy market, in my opinion. I just don\'t see anything quite as comparable to this in bubblelicious terms,"" said Ader, a former top-rated bond market strategist.\n\nBitcoin climbed more than 3.7 percent Thursday to a record of $4,802.74, up nearly five times in price this year and about 67 percent higher for August, according to CoinDesk.\n\n""I think it\'s going to come to a sorry ending,"" Ader said. ""I don\'t know anybody who\'s actually used a bitcoin for any purpose legal or otherwise. This looks like an overly frothy market and frothy markets lose their froth.""\n\nAder said he used the Nasdaq telecom index since many of those stocks led the Nasdaq composite\'s overall gains during the tech bubble. The Nasdaq telecom index shot up more than 700 percent from 1995 to 2000, before collapsing 90 percent in the next two years. The index remains about 75 percent below its record high.\n\nChina\'s property market has been red-hot, with the pace of gains seeing Chinese cities dominate a list of the world\'s fastest growing housing markets. The South China Morning Posthas the details:\n\nTwenty one of the world’s 50 fastest growing housing markets, based on price, are in China, according to a latest report, rekindling fears the domestic sector is overheating as money continues to pour into bricks and mortar.\n\nComplied by research house Hurun Report, the study highlights growth in global home prices in the 12 months to June 30, with 42 of the 50 cities under the spotlight from 12 countries it examined, being hit with price rises of more that 10 per cent in the period.\n\nThe five cities to suffer the fastest growing prices were Toronto, Reykjavík, Wuxi, Hong Kong and Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of Henan Province.', 'The most popular online exchange for trading digital currencies is generating a surge in customer complaints this year even as investors are lured by a dramatic rise in prices.\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has received at least 293 complaints about Coinbase Inc., according to data reviewed by Bloomberg. That compares with about six complaints for all of 2016, and makes Coinbase the biggest recipient of CFPB virtual currency complaints this year. The website has struggled to keep up with spiking volume and longer transaction processing times as the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soared to record highs.\n\nMore than a third of the grievances came from individuals who said they were unable to access their money when promised. Many people also complained about other transaction or service problems. Accusations of fraud represented less than 15 percent of the complaints.\n\n“The funds were supposed to be transferred to my checking account within three-to-five business days,” one customer complained to the CFPB in May. “I need the money.”\n\nMegan Hernbroth, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Coinbase, declined to comment on the CFPB complaints.\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, the CFPB has received more than 250 complaints under the “virtual currency” category. About 60 percent of those were directed at Coinbase, while many of the others were aimed at PayPal Holdings Inc. and large banks.\n\nCoinbase, which was founded in 2012, said in June that it’s working to improve customer support. The exchange has grappled with a slew of performance issues, including outages, slow load times and a flash crash in ether, the second most valuable virtual coin.\n\n“Over the past few months, we’ve seen an unprecedented increase in the number of customers signing up to use Coinbase,” wrote the company’s co-founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong, in a June 6 blog post. “As a result, our systems have been pushed to the limit. This has caused many customers to have a negative experience.”\n\nOn its support page, Coinbase says transaction timing can vary depending on a customer’s location and payment method, and U.S. bank transfers can take up to five business days.\n\nLendEDU, a New Jersey-based student loan marketplace, pointed out the increase in virtual currency complaints this year, in a report earlier this week.\n\nCryptocurrency startups have been overwhelmed with unusually high volume as the price of bitcoin has skyrocketed almost fivefold this year. This month, the debate over how to speed up transactions became so contentious that bitcoin split in two.\n\nThe CFPB, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, started accepting complaints about virtual currencies in 2014, warning consumers about unclear costs, scams and lost funds. Three years later, the Securities and Exchange Commission said that cryptocurrency exchanges and companies that raise money through the sale of digital assets must adhere to federal securities laws, signaling a clampdown on the recent surge in virtual coin offerings.', 'The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is currently trading at $927 per share, with each share representing approximately 9/100 of a Bitcoin.\n\nThis price, if calculated with Bitcoin Cash disbursement, represents a price of $10,000 per Bitcoin, almost 120 percent premium on the current Bitcoin price.\n\nThe analysis was brought to light via Tuur Demeester, the economist and editor at Adamant Research.\n\n$GBTC is trading at an implied Bitcoin price of $9,000 per bitcoin - 95% premium.

Universa presents a number of overriding advantages over Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.\n\nUniversa introduces a new generation unique blockchain technology.\n\nUniversa was originally being developed not as a cryptocurrency, but as a distributed system for executing smart contracts. Therefore, the Universa platform does not depend on mining, which results both in high speed and transactions low cost, with a distributed consensus model providing the same level of trust as in the existing blockchain protocols. The consensus in Universa is the consent of 91% of the network nodes. Forging becomes practically impossible at this level of consensus.\n\nUniversa is 1000 times faster than Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nUniversa nodes do not require mining and are responsible for verifying the transactions and smart contracts that customers submit onto the network. Waiving mining opened a way to increase network performance by hundreds of times. The Universa blockchain simple protocol is supplemented by the highly developed declarative and logical language of smart contracts. Such architecture made it possible to reach the speed of 10,000 transactions per second on the network nodes.\n\nTransactions in Universa are 100 times cheaper than in Bitcoin.\n\nDue to Bitcoin’s volatile and speculative nature, microtransactions in the Bitcoin blockchain deem economically meaningless. It is not economically reasonable for a business to pay $3,5 for a few cents worth transaction, processed by the network for about 10 minutes, on top of that. Universa make a favorable difference if compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, by allowing its users to make hundreds of times more transactions per second, and at a very low price.\n\nIn the Universa protocol, smart contracts are smart indeed, which broadens their implementation in real business significantly. Universa smart contracts are more than applicable for programming all kinds of applications, both intracompany ones and those operating in a public blockchain.\n\nFor example:\n\nVehicle smart key / CarSharing , attached to the compartment, which creates an owner-vehicle-contract provisions chain.

Smart contracts on Ethereum operate with a limited set of metadata. Neither of the two blockhains can cope with simple task of linking a fixed amount of money to a smart contract in the currency required for a specific business at the moment – euro, dollars, or rubles. Universa allows to create and transfer existing currencies as well as the new ones through the contract. Universa provides a gateway for services that automatically accept input electronic documents (electronic money, obligations or agreements, intellectual property, excises, bids on auctions and tenders, id or electronic passports) and creates standard output documents based on the rules and provisions of “smart contracts.” The implementation of Universa makes the transition to electronic commerce very cheap – for example, by using the Universa ready-made communication service, one can buy electronic materials from individuals (for example, photos or articles), trade all sorts of goods, provide loans, exchange or sell securities, and operate with other financial instruments as well. The legal entities receive a convenient tool for working with excises, tenders, auctions, transaction passports, customs declarations. Almost any tasks are conveniently and easily automatized by applications and smart contracts of the new Universa blockchain.\n\nPress Contact Email Address\n\nico@artox-media.com\n\nSupporting Link\n\nhttps://www.artox-media.ru/']"
