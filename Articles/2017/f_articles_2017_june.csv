At the time, bitcoin was threatening its record high of $1,161 a coin before plunging more than 10% on the news.\n\nSince then, however, things have been going pretty well for the cryptocurrency. Aside from the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejecting two bitcoin ETFs, bitcoin has seen a steady stream of good news.\n\nIn early April, Japan announced bitcoin had become a legal payment method in the country. Additionally, Russia's largest online retailer, Ulmart, began accepting bitcoin despite Russia's saying it wouldn't consider the use of the cryptocurrency until 2018\n\nLast week, the Digital Currency Group, representing 56 companies in 21 countries, reached a scaling agreement at the Consensus 2017 conference in New York. That caused the cryptocurrency to hit an all-time high of $2,798 a coin.\n\nBitcoin has gained 155% so far in 2017.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>"", 'According to a recent article published to Trustnodes, Ethereum now has 3 times as many nodes as Bitcoin. This revelation follows recent news of Ethereum quickly catching up to Bitcoin in total transaction volume which could signal Ethereum someday surpassing Bitcoin as the world’s number one cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is a Node?\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are both blockchain /distributed ledger technologies. Blockchains are designed to be essentially a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Networks of “miners” process transactions in exchange for tokens. These transactions are then relayed and validated across the internet through what are called “nodes” which becomes the first step of the blockchain process. Nodes can either be full-functioning on a single machine/computer or partially shared over a network of machines. Since nodes are part of the mechanism that creates a decentralized network, more nodes mean the network is more secure. It also means that more transactions can be, and probably are being, processed. According to the Trustnodes article, Bitcoin has about 7,200 nodes across the world while Ethereum has over 25,000.\n\nEthereum is On the Rise\n\nPart of the reason Ethereum’s nodes have more than doubled in the last year while Bitcoin’s has remained relatively static is the fact that Ethereum by its very nature is more versatile in its applications. While Bitcoin was designed solely as a cryptocurrency with a blockchain that tracks only financial information, Ethereum was designed for a host of commercial applications. At the core of Ethereum’s blockchain are smart contracts. That means almost any contractual data can be stored on Ethereum’s blockchain and any kind of business can utilize Ethereum in some way. In fact, the number of businesses adopting Ethereum has been steadily increasing (see 86 new members to the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance). In contrast, Bitcoin is being utilized less and less and without any new adoption of Bitcoin by businesses, the incentive to act as a node remains stagnant.\n\nWe may be witnessing the first step of a new generation of blockchain cryptocurrencies. Many are likening it to a bubble given all the huge increases in the value of each coin. However, focusing only on the coin itself is somewhat shortsighted as the underlying technology behind the cryptocurrencies is, in my opinion, the most intriguing aspect of all this. Yes, there are huge profits to be made in the short-term from speculating on Bitcoin and Ether, but I believe the real profits will come in the form of innovations being developed by all of the companies adopting Ethereum’s blockchain.', 'Britain\'s largest online trading platform, Hargreaves Lansdown, is to allow its customers to invest in bitcoin, the alternative digital currency.\n\nThe broker, which administers £70bn of investors\' money, will give its 876,000 customers access to a fund that tracks the price of bitcoin, the best-known of a new breed of alternative currencies.\n\nReader Service: Choose Telegraph Investor for fast, efficient online dealing in ISAs, SIPPS and Trading accounts.\n\nCapital at risk\n\nThe fund, offered by a Swedish company, XBT Provider, is structured as an ""exchange-traded note"" (ETN). This is a fund listed on the stock exchange, meaning it can be bought and sold like a share.\n\nXBT buys complicated ""synthetic"" certificates, listed in US dollars, that aim to track the price of bitcoin. The ETN itself is denominated in Swedish krona. British investors are therefore exposed to two levels of currency risk.\n\nThe Swedish firm warned: ""The value of and any amount payable under the certificates will be strongly affected by the performance of bitcoin and the US dollar/krona exchange rate. As such an investment in the certificates is likely to be highly volatile and thus risky.""', 'With guest host Sacha Pfeiffer.\n\nThe skyrocketing price of Bitcoin, and the appeal of alternative currencies.\n\nIn this Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2014 photo, Jon Rumion, background left, talks with Michael Cargill at Central Texas Gun Works, in Austin, Texas.

Alternative digital currencies like Bitcoin were once on the fringe of finance. But they’re gradually gaining acceptance. There’s also Litecoin, Ethereum, Zcash, and others. So-called cryptocurrency has been associated with online crime, but it’s being embraced by some major retailers and investment firms.

That was up about 9% on the day and more than 15% from Friday’s closing price of $1,913, which itself was a fresh high. Bitcoin is up more than 130% this year alone, and about 397% from one year ago.""\n\nFelix Salmon: The Bitcoin Bubble and the Future of Currency — ""There are a couple of reasons why the bubble is sure to burst. The first is just that it’s a bubble, and any chart which looks like the one at the top of this post is bound to end in tears at some point. But there’s a deeper reason, too — which is that bitcoins are an uncomfortable combination of commodity and currency. The commodity value of bitcoins is rooted in their currency value, but the more of a commodity they become, the less useful they are as a currency.""\n\nForbes: The Rise And Fall Of Bitcoin (And The New Kid On The Blockchain) — ""Nobody is denying that bitcoin was disruptive. It was the first cryptocurrency of its time and has made a humongous splash – and that’s putting it lightly. Every super-government tried to shut it down and none of them could. J.P. Morgan tried to file patents for the exact technology of bitcoin and failed. Bitcoin is (or was) the cool kid at school that everyone wanted to be friends with but no one was sure how to ask for their number.""', 'Digital currencies like Bitcoin are back in the news in a big way. Major influxes of investment, increased usage, and public votes confidence from influential financial industry players seem to be validating a technology once thought to be solely the realm of hobbyists and tinkerers.\n\nDuring a speech last month, Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson declared that she still believes in digital currencies and revealed the company’s forays into the technology. She went on to outline several hurdles that she sees the technology needing to clear before it reaches mainstream adoption, one of which she called “the policy challenge.” Johnson correctly pointed out that innovation in the space “is outpacing the regulator’s ability to keep up.”\n\nIt’s not hard to see why this technology is exciting the world of payments. Traditionally we’ve had to rely on intermediaries like PayPal to maintain a database of account balances and transactions in order to send money online. In Bitcoin that database is maintained by thousands of nodes in an open network and constantly validated by the work of countless miners. Suddenly you don’t need to trust PayPal anymore. Since there is no intermediary, Bitcoin works a lot like cash, but online.\n\nMany applications of digital currencies like Bitcoin don’t fit into traditional legal buckets and some legal concepts may need to be rethought. If a regulator tries to apply old legal concepts to this new technology, companies that were never intended to be covered by existing laws could find themselves in a costly grey area. This undoubtedly chills innovation in the space and likely will drive it overseas.\n\nTwo decades ago, early Internet developers found themselves in a legal gray area. If old laws were strictly applied to them, they could be held responsible for the content that their users uploaded to their websites. In the 1990s, Congress passed the Communications Decency Act (CDA) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The laws protected Internet companies from liability for what their users did. Without these laws, the Internet would probably still exist today, but it would be a very different, and likely less useful, tool.\n\nRegulators should be looking at Bitcoin in the same way. Bitcoin could become critical infrastructure that one day revolutionizes the online economy. Like the open Internet, support from government is key to fostering its growth. Fortunately, there are concrete steps that the U.S. government can take to ensure the country’s competitiveness in this booming sector.\n\nThere are three things the government can do to give Bitcoin this level of support. First, some Bitcoin businesses fall under the definition of money transmitters and rightly need to get money transmission licenses, which are handled by the states. The problem is that there are 47 different state money transmission licensing regimes and they all have their own rules. It’s a nightmare for a digital currency companies to navigate, with compliance costs easily reaching into the millions of dollars a year. If a federal alternative, like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s proposed special purpose fintech charter, were adopted, then Bitcoin businesses would have a more streamlined alternative.\n\nAnother issue with money transmission licensing is that it shouldn’t apply to every application of Bitcoin. Some types of Bitcoin businesses never take custody of a customer’s funds, which means they can’t run away with or lose them. Those businesses should not need licenses. To protect those companies, Congress could create a federal safe harbor for non-custodial digital currency companies.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin taxation is broken. Since it’s not technically a foreign currency, it is treated as property by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax purposes. This means a user needs to calculate capital gains tax every time they buy a cup of coffee. That’s pretty difficult to manage. If the IRS amended the tax code to treat online currencies like foreign currencies, they would become much easier to use day to day.\n\nBitcoin and its fellow digital currencies will hit mainstream adoption based on the soundness of their technology, but there are common sense things the government can do to clear their path. Lack of understanding and ill-fitting laws should not be allowed to stand in their way.', 'The value of Bitcoin, a digital currency less than a decade old, has skyrocketed. One bitcoin is now worth around $2,430, according to World Coin Index.\n\nIllustration: Getty Images\n\nDemand for Grayscale Investments\' Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), the only vehicle of its kind tracking the cryptocurrency, has reached fever pitch, so investors who want a piece now will have to pay through the nose. ""GBTC is trading at a large premium to its underlying Bitcoin holdings as investors are eager to get long bitcoin exposure, but are wary of owning the actual asset,"" wrote Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners.\n\nBased on yesterday\'s close he estimates that GBTC is trading at a 106% premium. The XBT/USD cross rate was up 72% for May, but GBTC was up a whopping 248%.\n\nEarlier this year, investors were holding their breath to see if the SEC would approve the world\'s first exchange-traded fund tracking the price of bitcoin. Many said that if the Winklevoss brothers\' application received approval, it would legitimize the cryptocurrency. The SEC ended up denying the application and others like it. ""The main concern was that the market was not regulated,"" says Hossein Kazemi, CAIA senior advisor. ""It\'s a bad idea anyway. Bitcoin\'s appeal is anonymity and the fact that it lies outside of government control. An ETF would undermine that.""\n\nMass adoption is on the rise anyway. Japan recently announced that it would recognizs bitcoin as legal payment and Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson has emerged as its unlikely champion.\n\nBarrons.com reached out via email to Gavin Andresen, the man who built bitcoin, to ask some basic questions.\n\nQ: Does bitcoin really need an ETF?\n\nAndresen: No, no more than gold needs an ETF, but it would be a very convenient way for people to purchase and hold bitcoin.\n\nQ: The SEC\'s biggest complaint about bitcoin is the lack of regulation, but isn\'t that what makes it appealing?\n\nA: I haven\'t read the SEC\'s complaint, so can\'t really comment on which aspect of regulation they were concerned about. In general, there are lots of reasons people find bitcoin appealing. Given that most people seem to be happy letting an exchange or wallet service store their bitcoin for them, and those exchanges and wallets ARE regulated, I think lack of regulation isn\'t the main appeal these days. A lot of people are interested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an different kind of asset they can own, uncorrelated with any of the other types of assets they might already own (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc).\n\nQ: Can regulatory crackdown in China destroy bitcoin?\n\nA: Bitcoin has thrived under the ""regulatory crackdown"" that has happened over the last few years here in the United States. It is mostly clear what the rules are for operating a bitcoin exchange here in the U.S., and when I do my taxes it is clear how to report gains or losses on bitcoin trades or transactions. It looks like China is taking a similar path, and I expect the rules for Chinese exchanges and citizens will be just as clear six months or a year from now.\n\nQ: Do people really need a digital currency?\n\nA: You could argue people don\'t need currency at all-- we could all use barter to trade with each other, and use real estate or precious metals for our savings. Using a common currency just works better; transaction costs are lower so it is much more efficient. People will use a digital currency when and where it is better than traditional currencies, or will hold it as an asset (hopefully as part of a diversified portfolio) if they think it might be more valuable in the future.\n\nThank you, Gavin.', 'Bitcoin’s price action last month delivered the biggest growth in USD ever recorded at approximately $960.\n\nDespite volatility and a slump at the end of the month, May beat out November 2013 to become Bitcoin’s most successful month in dollars. That month, at the height of Mt. Gox’s fame, Bitcoin climbed $860, data reported on Reddit shows.\n\nThe timing of price activity was crucial, it could be argued. At the start of the last week in May, Bitcoin suddenly declined to below $2,000, losing more than $1,000 of its peak value in 24 hours.\n\nSince then, a correction has been underway, with one coin worth around $2,300 as the clock ticked over into June.\n\nFour weeks ago, prices stood at around $1,360 according to data from Coinmarketcap.\n\nHowever, the action pales in comparison to that witnessed by the Ethereum (ETH) camp. A price of around $78 at the start of May ended up as $220 one month later, despite altcoin rising and falling in line with Bitcoin towards the end of the monitoring period.\n\nToday Cointelegraph reported on China’s re-entry into the trading market having a significant impact on Bitcoin volumes as well as prices, outstripping Ethereum, which had just last week delivered higher 24-hour trading volumes.', 'Bitcoin price is expected to rise to as high as $4000 by the end of this year following increased demand. Read more...\n\nBitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency recently underwent a price correction, losing as much as $400 overnight. The sudden drop, following a steady, rapid increase in its price to record levels was considered as the end of Bitcoin’s bull run for a while. However, analysts believe that the development is just a minor setback which will be overcome in no time.\n\nFew investors believe that the cryptocurrency is just getting started and Bitcoin price is expected to rise again, hitting the $4000 mark by the end of this year. A leading financial news outlet has reported an analysis made by a seasoned investor, Daniel Masters — the Chairman of XBT Provider, a company that offers a “Bitcoin tracker” that can be exchanged and traded on Stockholm’s Nasdaq exchange.\n\nMasters believes that the recent Bitcoin-related developments happening around the world are going to be the important driving factor in putting the digital currency’s price at $4000 by the end of 2017. At the same time, the rise in Bitcoin price will be accompanied by increased stability, thanks to the cryptocurrency’s growing proliferation and volumes.\n\nIn the article, Masters was quoted saying,\n\n“What we’ve seen at XBT Provider is an increase in coverage and an increase in penetration into both the retail and institutional market. We’re now being covered on Nasdaq OMX by 27 different broker-dealers, and that is a stark increase from what we saw a year or two ago.”\n\nSome of the drivers of Bitcoin price listed on the article includes the recent legalization of cryptocurrency by Japan in April, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s review of Bitcoin ETF approval and more. With the Chinese exchanges removing withdrawal restrictions and possible regulations to be introduced by Russia, India, South Korea and other countries, demand for Bitcoin is expected to continue, supporting the upcoming price rise.\n\nThere are currently few concerns regarding the scalability issues faced by the Bitcoin network, which may put negative pressure on the cryptocurrency growth. Whether the community will be able to address the issue in time, without affecting the next rally is something only time will tell.\n\nRef: CNBC | Image: NewsBTC', 'Bitcoin just had its best month since November 2013.\n\n\n\nPrice found a top last week at nearly $2,800, which was a 200 percent rally from the ETF rejection low posted in March 2017. That trend remains immensely bullish with trading volume hitting record levels across the world, especially in Asian countries. South Korean exchanges continue to hold large premiums over the rest of the world. Even LocalBitcoins, a worldwide OTC exchange for bitcoin, broke an all-time high (ATH) in volume this past week. OKCoin.cn and BTCC resumed Bitcoin withdrawals yesterday after being under regulatory halt by the People’s Bank of China.\n\nAlthough block support for Bitcoin Unlimited and SegWit remains largely unchanged over the past few weeks, UASF/BIP 148 has grown in support among nodes. Even with the Silbert agreement, UASF-supporting nodes continue their defiant rise.\n\nTraders still seem to have doubts about UASF/BIP 148 on a technical level, however. It’s likely that most will not attempt to try and understand the pros and cons and just hope for the best, with the understanding that SegWit is a superior option to any alternative at this point in time.\n\nThe close for this past week’s weekly candle was an ugly one for the bulls. Bitcoin has never broken to the upside on the next week with a wick of that magnitude on the weekly chart. Despite this improbability, price is headed to retest local highs or, in this case, ATH.\n\nShould a tweezer top form on the weekly chart, it would be a strong confirmation signal for a ceiling top in the interim with a strong pullback to the mean of trend and/or a previous all-time high around $1,300. As a correction of the multi-week bull rally occurs, look for price to revert to mean and find support at a previous diagonal multi-week support/resistance level.\n\nBollinger Bands, a measure of volatility and quiescence, on the four-hour chart show a break of price to the upside, a bullish continuation sign.\n\nPerhaps the most bullish sign of all on low timeframes is the lack of a bearish 50/200 EMA cross on the one-hour chart. The lack of a significant cross, which last occurred after the ETF rejection, is also a sign of bullish continuation. Price was held up by the R4 yearly pivot as well while “resetting” the EMAs.\n\nI view these resets as refueling for the established trend. A sufficient pullback with profit taking has occurred with plenty of time for reaccumulation. A break of the R5 pivot and ATH would be immensely bullish, signaling a run well beyond to about $4,000–5,000. Another scenario would be to make lower highs and higher lows until the UASF occurs on August 1.\n\nSummary', ""At the start of each trading session, you will receive an email with the author's new posts.\n\nDisclosure: Please be informed that information we provide is NOT a trading recommendation or investment advice.

06/02/2017,"['On May 31, OKCoin, the largest Bitcoin exchange on the Chinese exchange market with over 34 percent market share, officially resumed withdrawals for its traders. Huobi and BTCC, the second and third largest Bitcoin exchanges in China, followed, resuming withdrawals for all users.\n\nAlmost immediately after the resumption of withdrawals by the big three exchanges within the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market, Bitcoin price surged, recovering back into the $2,400 region. On a weekly basis, Bitcoin price has recorded a three percent gain, recovering from its previous market correction which led to a $600 decline from $2,500 to $1,900.\n\nWithdrawal was not approved by PBoC\n\nAn interesting aspect of the recent resumption of withdrawals of the big three Chinese Bitcoin exchanges is that the withdrawal wasn’t ordered, requested or approved by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the central bank of the country.\n\nAccording to local sources including cnLedger, Huobi, BTCC and OKCoin came to a consensus in regard to their anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) systems update and decided to open withdrawals for all of their users.\n\nBefore the interruption and on-site inspection carried out by the PBoC, the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market accounted for a substantially large market share of the global Bitcoin exchange market. At one point, it was the largest Bitcoin exchange market ahead of the US.\n\nThe resumption of withdrawals by the three exchanges allowed the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market to recover and stabilize in a relatively short period of time, which led to a rapid rise in the demand for Bitcoin from local traders and users.\n\nCoincidentally, the trading volume and market share of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market suddenly dropped and the case that Chinese traders were purchasing Bitcoin via Japanese exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets can also be made.\n\nBitcoin price has sustained its momentum for three straight days, remaining and stabilizing in the $2,400 region. Currently, at the time of writing, Bitcoin price is around $2,425.\n\nNew regulatory frameworks and AML/KYC requirements\n\nIn June, the PBoC is expected to introduce new regulatory frameworks and AML/KYC requirements for Bitcoin exchanges and investors. Meanwhile, PBoC officials including Yao Qian, the head of Digital Currency Research Institute, are looking closely into both Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and ICO tokens.\n\nQian also noted that the PBoC and the Chinese government intend to regulate ICOs in the near future. Whether China’s future roll-out of regulations on ICOs means taxation on investment or approval of projects by the government remains unclear. Qian and the PBoC also emphasized that Bitcoin is not a currency based on the criteria established by the Chinese government and will likely be considered as a digital commodity.\n\n“Yao Qian, head of Digital Currency Research Institute at PBoC: Bitcoin does not fulfil the criteria of a currency; will soon regulate ICOs,” cnLedger reported.', 'Bitcoin exchange Coinbase is in talks with potential investors on a new round of funding at a valuation of more than $1 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.\n\nIt is not clear which investors are committing to the round, which was described as targeting around $100 million or more, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThat would represent the biggest funding round on record for venture-backed bitcoin companies, the report said.\n\nA Coinbase spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\nCoinbase, the world’s largest bitcoin company, has seen heavy traffic and trading on its platform in recent weeks as bitcoin reached all-time highs.\n\nFor more about bitcoin, watch:\n\nDemand for crypto-assets has soared with the creation of new tokens to raise funding for start-ups using blockchain technology.\n\nCoinbase said in January it raised $75 million from several major financial institutions including the New York Stock Exchange, USAA Bank and Spanish banking group BBVA.\n\nEarlier this year, Coinbase received a virtual currency and money transmitter license from the New York Department of Financial Services.', ""What could be more terrifying than making a lot of money and then losing it the next instant? Markets offer investors the opportunity to make money in both bull and bearish phases but to many, a market bubble is something appalling or frightening.\n\nWhat would happen if all their ‘hard earned’ profits just vanish as the bubble goes bust? Yet, we see somewhat of a resilience when it comes to Bitcoin investors, who have chosen to repose their faith in the world’s first every cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are naysayers and pessimists\n\nRecently, Bryan Rich a contributor at Forbes wrote an article titled, “Is Bitcoin a Bubble.” Rich writes, “If you're looking for a warning signal on why the Bitcoin move might not be sustainable, just look at the behavior across global markets. It's not exactly an environment that would inspire confidence.”\n\nHe goes on the propound the theory about Chinese stocks and how they took down the global markets. New York Post quoted Fidelity Investments Chief Executive Abigail Johnson as saying, “It’s no accident that I’m one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services company that hasn’t given up on digital currencies.” Just like Abigail, there are many who choose to see Bitcoin as a currency that has real world application and usefulness.\n\nThey also notice that just like any other currency, Bitcoin has come out of nowhere and its value is derived from the belief that its users hold in it. The currency has stood the test of time since it was founded in 2008 even though it has been accused of being a Ponzi scheme, a currency of criminals and other unsubstantiated and baseless things.\n\nBitcoin is important for the world\n\nBitcoin has become a foundation of a new economic system that is changing the way the world looks at finance internationally. The technology behind the currency has led to the birth of other cryptocurrencies, commonly known as altcoins that have their own user-base and applications.\n\nBitcoin has also become the currency of choice for troubled parts of the world where national currencies have come under pressure due to governmental mismanagement or other reasons. Whether it was Venezuela or Nigeria or the demonetization fiasco in India. Other than that there is now also a wider acceptance of Bitcoin even among governments, with Japan leading the pack by giving Bitcoin the status of Money.\n\nExplaining the importance of Bitcoin Tim Draper, Founder and Managing Director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson tells Cointelegraph:\n\n“Long term, Bitcoin is so important to the world economy that I suspect the price will continue to rise overall. Although, I expect to see fits and starts. The importance revolves around global liquidity and simplified and lower cost, lower friction cross-border transactions.”\n\nCertain parts of the world are more enthusiastic\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, China and Japan are way ahead of everyone else. China is already the mining capital when it comes to Bitcoin and Japan has already taken lead in adoption of digital currencies including Bitcoin.\n\nYet Bitcoin can not be relegated to just one geography as Tim Draper says:\n\n“I think Bitcoin is now a global phenomenon, so demand for Bitcoin is coming from all over the world. I know that China is using Bitcoin to more easily send money to other countries, and the people of challenged countries like Argentina and Cypress flee to Bitcoin when their own currencies are no longer viable or if they are inflationary. Throughout Africa, Bitpesa makes it easier to buy and sell goods with Bitcoin.”\n\nWhen it comes to East Asia though, Bitcoin has already made its mark in Japan and other cryptocurrencies are also on the rise. Kagayaki Kawabata of Coincheck adds, “I think Japan is greatly contributing to the overall price increase of cryptocurrency. At Coincheck user can buy and sell 12 different cryptocurrencies. As well as Bitcoin we are seeing a volume increase in all other cryptos as well.

An ETN is an investment instrument typically listed on a major stock exchange that can be bought and sold similarly to a stock. As more well-known wealth firms give their clients access to bitcoin investment, interest in the asset by mainstream investors will undoubtedly rise. However, these firms also risk exposing consumers to the dangers associated with unresolved regulatory issues around bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin still exists in a regulatory gray zone, which makes it different from most other asset classes. Mainstream asset classes include securities such as stocks or bonds and tangible assets like art. The former typically have dedicated regulators — like the SEC in the US, while investment in the latter results in the ownership of a physical product. And in both cases, investors are clear about what they\'re acquiring. However, in most jurisdictions, bitcoin is legally neither a security nor a tangible asset, and therefore does not fall neatly under any regulator\'s mandate. At the same time, most mainstream investors don\'t have a clear idea of the asset\'s nature. This ambiguity, compounded by bitcoin\'s relative novelty, arguably means that bitcoin investments are a special case and should be treated as such by existing financial regulators. Otherwise, it will remain unclear which regulators are responsible for consumer protections regarding the asset, putting investor capital at risk.\n\nThe onus is on regulators to classify bitcoin and increase emphasis on customer education. At the moment, only a few countries\' regulators are making serious attempts to establish clear legal frameworks to define and regulate bitcoin — and among those who have started, the approaches are very different. As such, regulators should start coordinating with each other to come up with an unambiguous status for the asset that clarifies under which regulators\' mandates it should fall. Moreover, regulators should consider devoting the same attention to enforcing customer education among incumbent wealth managers as they have been to the marketplace lending industry.\n\nNearly every global bank is experimenting with blockchain technology as they try to unleash the cost savings and operational efficiencies it promises to deliver.\n\nBanks are exploring the technology in a number of ways, including through partnerships with fintechs, membership in global consortia, and via the building of their own in-house solutions.\n\nSarah Kocianski, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider\'s premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on blockchain in banking that outlines why and in what ways banks are exploring blockchain technology, provides details on three major banks\' blockchain efforts based on in-depth interviews, and highlights other notable blockchain-based experiments underway by global banks. It also discusses the likely trends that will emerge in the technology over the next several years, and the factors that will be critical to the success of banks implementing blockchain-based solutions.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nMost banks are exploring the use of blockchain technology in order to streamline processes and cut costs. However, they are also looking to leverage additional advantages, including increased competitiveness with fintechs, and the ability to use the technology to create new business models.\n\nBanks are starting to narrow their focus, and are increasingly honing in on tangible use cases for blockchain technology that solve real problems faced by their businesses.\n\nRegulators are taking an increased interest in blockchain technology, and they\'re working alongside major banks to develop regulatory frameworks.\n\nBlockchain-based solutions will start to emerge in different areas of financial services. The most successful solutions will solve specific problems for banks and attract a large enough network to create widespread benefits.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\n\n\nOutlines banks\' experiments with blockchain technology.\n\nDetails blockchain projects at three major banks — UBS, Credit Suisse, and Banco Santander — based on in-depth interviews.\n\nDiscusses the likely trends that will emerge in the technology over the next several years.\n\nHighlights the factors that will be critical to the success of banks implementing blockchain-based solutions.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?

It’s an unlikely success story, subverting just about everything we know about economics, and giving rise to a nearly endless (736 and counting) stream of copycats, in the form of other new cryptocurrencies.\n\nImmutability\n\nBitcoin also gave the world’s innovators something else to play with – blockchain, a type of decentralized database that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built upon. Blockchain is a ledger that orders records in such a way that they cannot be changed unless all computers on the network agree to it; in that, it’s virtually immune to tampering and data theft, making it an essential consideration for any industry with information worth protecting.\n\nMany of the benefits of working with a blockchain-based currency like Bitcoin were listed in a recent article about Bitcoin and its future on the website of iGaming company BitCasino, which cited enhanced security, lower transaction fees, and worldwide acceptance as the impetus behind the company's decision to abandon dollars and pounds altogether and use Bitcoin exclusively. The site compares Bitcoin to Apple Pay in terms of its potential uses in retail.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nOutside of Bitcoin, one of the more notable uses of blockchain technology is Ethereum, something that’s “sort of but not really” like the original cryptocurrency, to borrow some of the internet’s wisdom - the two are different applications of the same thing. To put it briefly though, Ethereum is a way for software developers to create apps and execute “smart contracts”, pieces of computer code that respond to particular inputs in certain ways, in real time.\n\nSource: Pexels\n\nFor example, in the case of EthLance, a platform that organizes work for freelancers, the smart contract handles the exchange of work for cryptocurrency; in this case, Ether. Similarly, Alice.Si is an Ethereum program that forces charities to work for donors’ money, meaning that evidence of good work is a prerequisite of getting paid. It’s a system based on reciprocation; you have to put something in to get something out.\n\nA World Computer\n\nObviously, it’s possible to make just about any coding language do the above, so what makes Ethereum special? Integration with the blockchain means that any application running on the platform exists in a vacuum: it’s not possible to stop, break, or otherwise interfere with it. Developers aren’t tied to components either, as processing power and RAM is provided by Ethereum’s decentralized virtual machine.\n\nNext to Bitcoin, Ethereum is arguably the most important blockchain-based organization on the planet, and the value of its value token is suitably high, at $231.67 per coin as of early June. That’s nothing compared to the $2,435.76 of Bitcoin but Ethereum may just be getting started; after correctly predicting a $100 price at the beginning of May, analysts are now tipping Ethereum to overtake Bitcoin for value in the next few years.\n\nIt’s hard to say just how Ethereum will progress in the future but the added value its software platform offers to investors means that there are more than enough incentives to get involved with the cryptocurrency."", ""Investors are drunk on bitcoin. As I write this, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (NASDAQOTH:GBTC) is trading at more than 125% more than its underlying bitcoin are worth.\n\nShares currently trade at $505 per share, valuing the underlying bitcoin at 125% more than they can be purchased for at a popular online exchange. Each share represents ownership of approximately 0.093 bitcoin.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission carries some of the blame for Bitcoin Investment Trust's ridiculous premium to net asset value. Because it disapproved the Winklevoss' twins application to create a bitcoin ETF, the markets lack a proper exchange-traded vehicle for speculating on the price of bitcoin. Thus, eager speculators are willing to pay an extraordinary premium to get their hands on bitcoin through their brokerage accounts by trading the only vehicle to do so.\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust's premium to its underlying asset value has been a permanent fixture, but rarely has the premium been so high. In fact, as anticipation of the SEC's decision on a bitcoin ETF grew, the Bitcoin Investment Trust's premium collapsed to the single digits as investors feared a better alternative may soon come to market.\n\nOf course, that never happened. The SEC later wrote that it disapproved the Winklevoss' bitcoin ETF on grounds that most markets for bitcoin are unregulated, and thus manipulation in unregulated bitcoin markets could affect the bitcoin ETF and the exchanges that list it.\n\nThe SEC also worries that the bitcoin ETF may face supply and demand imbalance, as entities that help keep ETFs properly priced would find it difficult to buy or sell the underlying bitcoin in sufficient quantity to create or redeem the ETF's shares.\n\nSimilar problems have occurred when ETFs become big fish in small ponds. The VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF, which offers low-cost exposure to a pool of small-cap gold mining stocks, grew so large that at one point it stood to become a 20% owner of some of the companies that make up its portfolio. As a temporary fix, it had to buy shares of VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF, a large-cap gold miner ETF, to avoid becoming too large an owner of small-cap miners.\n\nOne can only imagine what impact a bitcoin ETF might have on the underlying bitcoin markets, as fewer than 250,000 bitcoin (worth roughly $600 million), trade hands each day on online exchanges, according to Bitcoinity.org.\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust's premium to net asset value is indicative of the fervor for all things bitcoin. The trust hasn't been able to issue new shares fast enough to keep up with demand, in part because of how it creates new shares. Accredited investors can buy shares of the trust at its net asset value and avoid the premium, but reports suggest that this privileged ability to buy new shares at their actual underlying value comes with a stiff limitation: Shares must be held for one year before they can be sold.\n\nThe primary buyers of Bitcoin Investment Trust are likely individual investors. It has consistently appeared in the top 30 stocks most commonly bought and sold at retail brokerage Fidelity, and shares often trade hands in very small blocks. Rarely do round lots (100 shares) change hands.\n\nBut all good things find their eventual end. The trust's recent premium of 134% could come crashing back to earth if new products make it easier for investors to buy and sell bitcoin, or if interest in bitcoin wanes. Due to its extraordinary premium, owners of Bitcoin Investment Trust could be left with substantial losses, even if the price of bitcoin keeps rising higher.\n\nThere are many ways to make money, but buying an asset for more than two times its actual market value isn't one of them."", 'A digital currency fund was the big performance winner in May, while semiconductor ETFs also outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) came out on top with a 251.5% return, according to Morningstar Inc. By comparison, the S&P 500 climbed 1.4% as the benchmark index marked new record highs in the last week of May.\n\nThe $396.2 million Bitcoin fund is trading at a huge premium to the digital currency, which was trading at record highs above the $2,400 level Thursday. While the price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed, the number of shares outstanding has remained fairly stable since the fund\'s September 2013 launch.\n\nX ""Grayscale Investments\' Bitcoin Investment Trust is trading at a large premium to its underlying Bitcoin holdings as investors are eager to get long Bitcoin exposure but are wary of owning the actual asset,"" S3 Research said in a May 31 report. ""With very little institutional ownership in GBTC there is very little stock in lending programs and total short interest has never been over 20,000 shares or $2 million until this month when short interest increased to 32,000 shares or $15 million.""\n\nComing in second was iPath Bloomberg Cocoa Subindex Total Return ETN (NIB), up 12.2% in May. The ETN is coming off of an April bottom as cocoa prices recover from a slump triggered by a supply glut.\n\nThree semiconductor funds made the top 10 as leading chip stocks rallied to new highs. SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) tied with an 8.7% gain for the month. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) followed close behind with a 7.9% advance.

SOXX is extended from a 138.06 flat-base buy point. SMH and PSI are extended after an April bounce off their 50-day moving-average lines.\n\nOther top performers included iShares MSCI South Korea Capped (EWY), iShares Austria Capped (EWO) and Global X MSCI Greece (GREK) with respective gains of 9.1%, 8% and 7.7%. Global X Social Media (SOCL) made the cut with a 7.3% advance.\n\nSOCL is far extended from a 24.94 cup-with-handle buy point initially cleared in March. The $126.9 million fund, which counted Tencent (TCEHY), Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB) among its top holdings, has a five-year annualized return of 17.3%.

06/03/2017,"[""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'On May 31, one the biggest Bitcoin exchanges in China by OKCoin is back on track helping to improve the Chinese exchange market after the suspension of withdrawal transactions.\n\nAs a result, more Bitcoin investors are resuming their interest and driving up the demand for Bitcoin. Thanks to the resumption of withdrawals, Bitcoin is now traded at a premium rate in China compared to last year. Also, mainstream Chinese media coverage that shows Bitcoin as digital gold in the country increases Bitcoin demand for local traders.\n\nSurge\n\nThe recent global average Bitcoin price is at $2,300.\n\nOn Friday, traders were trading Bitcoin at more than $2,340 in the Bitcoin exchange market in China. In fact, this is almost $50 higher than the US rate. Though it’s not as high as the South Korean premium rate of $400, the recent development in China’s Bitcoin exchange market is certainly a great sign of recovery and growth for the international market.\n\nSeveral important factors caused Bitcoin price to continue surging this year. Among these factors that drive the price increase are the legalization of cryptocurrency approved by the Japanese government, adoption of new Bitcoin scaling as supported by the primary parties involved in the Bitcoin community, and the use of initial coin offering or ICO in raising funds.\n\nUsers positive\n\nExperts believe that the increasing demand in the Asian region pushes the recent growth in the currency. Moreover, Bitcoin expert Garrick Hileman of Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, found out that users are ‘curious’ about how Bitcoin works when it comes to sale and purchase. And while more and more people are getting more interested in Bitcoin, the market is becoming more positive towards it.\n\nAt first, Bitcoin was known only within the US but it spread out across the globe since 2013. Asia is now a new market for Bitcoin as demand in this region is getting higher.\n\nKorea premium\n\nIn fact, in Asian countries like South Korea, Bitcoin price soars up to $3,100 which is much higher than the US dollar price of $2,400. It’s the same case with Japanese yen where the average price is equivalent to almost $300 higher than the US sustaining the momentum for Bitcoin’s demand in Asia.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bitcoin exchange head Adam White says that in the flying Bitcoin market, traders can’t just purchase in one market and sell it to another until the price increase. For instance, in South Korea, traders met logistical and regulatory hindrances when it comes to US dollar to Korean won conversion that stop them from hitting the Bitcoin’s increasing demand.\n\nAs far money transfer is concerned in the international scale, Bitcoin is taking the lead.\n\nRemittances factor\n\nDifferent startups are giving much favor to Bitcoin in sending remittances since it works faster than traditional money transfer networks.\n\nLet’s take Bluepan, a South Korean company as an example. The company serves to send money from overseas workers in East Asian countries like South Korea and Japan to their families in China and the Philippines.\n\nFor more than two years, Bluepan has processed payments worth $65 mln and for the past 18 months, they recorded a five time increase in the value and number of transactions. According to Bitcoin analyst, Chris Burniske, Bitcoin helps remittance companies to gain 10 to 20 percent growth every month.\n\nIn the same aforementioned report by Garrick Hileman, it was highlighted that the Asian region is the largest market in remittance industry.\n\nMoreover, his report analyzes the number of customers that these companies have according to different regions in the world and different business types that use Bitcoin. The study shows how Asia is well represented in different types of Bitcoin businesses.\n\nDollar and Bitcoin\n\nWhile Asia dominates the Bitcoin businesses and industries, it’s a different story for North America. In fact, in the same report, the region only shares a small portion of all customers in any categories. There is also less number of customers from North America who are using money transfer services.\n\nTo understand this low involvement of the region to remittance business, we need to take into account that the global financial system is primarily based on the US dollar. This means that remittance transactions are easier between dollars and non-dollar currencies compared with transactions that involve two non-dollar currencies.\n\nThus, companies that provide Bitcoin-based services are having a hard time competing with traditional remittance services in the US.', 'Just a few years ago if you thought of cryptocurrency you thought of Bitcoin and Bitcoin only.\n\nBitcoin was propelled into the limelight back in 2013. Around that time The Silk Road was taken down and the U.S. government confiscated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Back then, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin was more of an underground thing used mostly for dodgy purposes. But today, the tech and entrepreneurial community has gotten their hands on blockchain and cryptocurrency with the creation of other coins and technology. And now cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum are being used and backed by the biggest companies in the world such as Microsoft, JP Morgan Chase and Samsung to name a few.\n\nEthereum is leading the pack of the new age cryptocurrencies. The big difference is that these 2.0 and 3.0 versions of digital currencies actually do quite a bit on top of the basic technology that Bitcoin introduced to the world via blockchain. Bitcoin was just the beginning.\n\nHere are 4 cryptocurrencies worth watching this year:\n\nEthereum (ETH) got popular just a few months ago when the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was announced. The biggest companies in the world are officially backing and utilizing the new blockchain technology that Ethereum provides, specifically their smart contracts, decentralized applications on the blockchain, the creation of decentralized autonomous organizations and so much more. Ethereum does for code, apps and programming what Bitcion did for peer to peer transactions.

Their aim is to be the one-stop shop for all things blockchain, essentially becoming a Blockchain As A Service (BAAS) platform. They are similar to Ethereum in concept but also very different. Stratis runs on the Bitcoin blockchain. But, where Stratis makes itself unique is that it offers developers the ability to code in C# which opens up a ton of possibilities for app and other developers. Additionally, Stratis is soon to launch their breeze wallet that could revolutionize and redefine transactional privacy. Stratis has a very similar number of circulating supply as Ethereum. So if you wanted to guess where Stratis (STRAT) could be price wise in a short while then look at today’s Ethereum prices. is a powerful blockchain development platform.

This could (and is) revolutionize banking. Ripple and it’s token XRP have been critized for not having the technology and the currency truly connected. They also do not currently have their own currency wallet so storing it becomes complicated.

But instead of Siacoin doing that directly they allow other partners like hosts to connect and compete for the business of consumers via their technology. It is a little early for Siacoin but big developments are already happening. Once they have a few more big use cases things could really take off. Their technology could be backing the next Dropbox or Amazon AWS. And if you have ever paid Amazon AWS hosting or storage costs, you know that needs to be distrupted and made cheaper.

These are the 4 cryptocurrencies that I and many others in the community have their eyes on to make big movement in 2017.', 'Cody Brown, the founder of IRL, a VR production studio based in NYC, recently lost $8,000 worth of bitcoin on Coinbase. Based on current circumstances, the theft seems irreversible and the loss of Brown will likely not be recovered.\n\nBrown started using Coinbase since 2015 and like most users, he had a Verizon phone number attached to his Coinbase account. He had been using Coinbase to purchase thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin for over two years.\n\nHowever, during the two years he had been using Coinbase, Brown didn’t enable a two-factor authentication (2FA) security measure such as Google Authenticator and failed to implement necessary fraud prevention systems on his Verizon phone. Weak security measures of both Brown’s Coinbase account and his Verizon mobile phone made it significantly easier for hackers and fraudsters to access his account and move bitcoin out of the account.\n\nThe majority of bitcoin wallets recommend users to either implement a second password or Google Authenticator to approve outgoing transactions. For instance, Xapo requires a text and number combination-based password for users to confirm outgoing transactions. By doing so, even if hackers gain access to Xapo accounts, they will not be able to send transactions from the hacked account to another account without knowing the password. Xapo also requires users to input email and mobile confirmation codes to change the password and overall, it is difficult for hackers to circumvent the Xapo security system.\n\nBlockchain, better known to users as Blockchain.info, has a similar security system in which it requires users to implement both Google Authenticator and a pin code on top of a passphrase. To access the account via the web, users need to input confirmation codes sent to both their email addresses and the Google Authenticator app. To send transactions from a Blockchain account to an external account, users need to input their number-based pin code, as a second layer verification for outgoing transactions.\n\nAccording to Brown, Coinbase doesn’t set Google Authenticator as a requirement and accepts SMS verification. However, as seen in the case of Brown, without proper mobile phone fraud prevention systems in place, it is incredibly easy to gain access to the mobile phones of Coinbase account users.\n\nIn the case of Brown, an unknown hacker called Verizon support and provided a billing statement of Brown to gain access to his phone number. Brown wrote:\n\n“After talking at length with customer service reps, I learned that the hacker did not need to give them my pin number or my social security number and was able to get approval to takeover my cell phone number with simple billing information.”\n\nOnce the hacker gained access to Brown’s Verizon mobile phone, the hacker successfully hacked into the Coinbase account of Brown and moved funds out of his account. Before moving the transactions, Brown noted that the hacker reset the password of Brown’s Coinbase account and changed the device attached to the account.\n\nIn total, 1.18 bitcoin, 70.96 Litecoin and 16.03 Ethers have been sent from Brown’s account to an external account.\n\nAll of this could have been avoided if Brown would have:\n\nUsed Google Authenticator or Authy or any other secure 2FA methods Did not use an exchange to store bitcoin and used a non-custodial wallet like Blockchain Implement proper security measures into his mobile phone Used recommended security settings for Coinbase account\n\nCoinbase and other bitcoin wallet or exchange users must learn through Brown’s mistake and ensure that proper security measures are set in place.\n\nSome bitcoin wallet service providers including the popular hardware wallet manufacturers such as Trezor have even criticized Google Authenticator and other TOTP 2FA authentication apps for being insecure, as they store cryptographic codes online.\n\nAlthough apps like Google Authenticator are very convenient to use, if users are concerned about the security, Trezor recommends U2F.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A community to discuss the future of financial services and any other interesting trends, strategies, ideas, views.\n\nBlockchain has captured the imagination of intellectuals and polity alike with economists, technologists, governments raving about its potential and how its poised to fundamentally change the world.\n\nThough the very genesis of blockchain was about disintermediating banking and introducing a transparency that didn’t require numerous layers of intermediaries and central authorities, it’s the financial services that’ve in fact turned out to be one of the first to embrace blockchain. Devising use cases for a range of services from cross border payments, remittances, trade finance to loyalty programmes, financial services industry has been actively leading the blockchain experiments. And, why shouldn’t it?\n\nTake cross border payments for instance. On an average, it takes 3-7 days for cross border fund transfers which involve moving funds through a complex web of multiple banks, domestic and international payment systems. Similarly, in the capital markets, for executing a trade, several intermediaries such as exchanges, central counterparties, central securities depositories, investment managers and more must update their respective databases about the transaction. The increased number of processing layers belonging to different organizations introduces delays and increases costs.\n\nBlockchain’s fandom isn’t restricted to banking alone. Admirers beyond the financial services - from real estate, precious metals and stones, to music and the wine industry – all are discovering ways blockchain can lend ultimate transparency in tracking assets along their entire lifecycle.\n\nThe original blockchain, known as the underlying technology of the digital currency bitcoin, is also known as the bitcoin blockchain. (In this post, I’ll refer to it as simply the blockchain).\n\nBlockchain, a sophisticated technology, uses advanced computer science and mathematics to encrypt, validate and record transactions. Transactions, once written, cannot be altered. Blockchain isn’t maintained by one entity. Instead it’s a distributed database that’s autonomously managed by an extensive network of private computers.\n\nAnd this where the terrain quickly gets obfuscating – autonomously managed, network, private computers, distributed, unalterable records. Questions such as what do these terms mean, how are decisions made about recording transactions, can private computers be trusted to maintain data integrity are natural.\n\nMost blockchain related articles focus on it from the business perspective – the use cases, companies involved, projects initiated and so on. The hype around blockchain has lend it mythical powers of a technology that can do just about anything. The technology, undoubtedly a radical one, is still in its early days and is contingent on many factors such as interoperability, standardisation, and regulation. Its potential, capabilities and limitations are either being discovered or defined.\n\nFocus of this post, the first in a series, is to simply understand as a business technologist, basics of the blockchain and its underlying structure - what makes it the way it is.\n\nTo do so, we’ll take a quick look at the universe to which blockchain belongs.\n\nDistributed Ledger Technology\n\nThe terms distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain are often used interchangeably. Blockchain, in fact, is an example of a distributed ledger technology.\n\nOther well-known examples of distributed ledger technology are Ethereum, Ripple, Multichain, Hyperledger and Everledger.\n\nDistributed ledger technology is characterized by a shared, synchronized database that’s replicated throughout its network. DLT is an append-only database, which means transactions recorded in it are written just once and read any number of times.\n\nDTL’s architecture can be thought of as three tiered one with a distributed database as the third tier; examples of the third layer would be Blockchain, Ethereum, Ripple, Hyperledger. The second tier comprises consensus protocols or algorithms; examples would be Proof of work, Proof of stake, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). The top most tier would be the application layer; examples would be Bitcoin, Smart Contracts, Digital Identity.\n\nTo achieve its synchronized state, DLT uses consensus protocols or algorithms to drive agreement amongst all or a select set of participating nodes in its network. (A node is nothing but a private computer connected to the internet and running the blockchain software).\n\nThe part about “all or select set of participating nodes” is what defines the two main types of DLTs –\n\nA. Permissionless Blockchains\n\nAlso known as public blockchains\n\nNo restriction on who can be part of the network\n\nAll users can validate transactions\n\nProof of work and Proof of stake, the two consensus algorithms used, rely on user nodes’ resources such as compute power or currency\n\nExamples – Blockchain, Ethereum\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Permissioned Blockchains\n\nAlso known as private blockchains\n\nNetwork access restricted to a few trusted users\n\nApproved users authorised to validate transactions\n\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), the consensus protocol used, relies on endorsements in the form of identical responses from a large proportion of the users\n\nExamples – Ripple, Hyperledger, Everledger\n\nBecause a distributed ledger is replicated across many entities, additional resiliency and data integrity are ensured. Even if any of the nodes in a network fails, the ledger remains intact due to the remaining nodes. What happens if all the nodes in a network fail at the same time? The chances of the vast number of nodes in a DLT (in case of blockchain it’s in millions) all failing at the same time is negligible.\n\nThis is a major reason why DLT has strongly resonated with both financial services and governance. To record a financial transaction, as seen in the cross-border payments or capital markets examples, large amount of data is duplicated across disparate systems belonging to the intermediary organisations. Lack of standardisation among these systems result in data inconsistency leading to costly reconciliation processes. DLTs, on the other hand, carry a single version of truth. Another advantage is that DLTs can bring down the costs of building an infrastructure that is not just shared but also trusted by entities that may not otherwise have reasons to trust one another, as in governance for instance.\n\nEarly this year, when government enforcement officials decided to investigate Uber for illegally operating in certain cities and countries, Uber found ways to not just identify but also evade such officers. The officers were shown false data about their upcoming rides along with incorrect information about the drivers, ensuring the officers couldn’t ride an actual Uber car and impose fines on the driver.\n\nLate in 2015, Airbnb disclosed that 95% of its hosts have listed their property exactly once on its website. It was soon found out that just before the public announcement, Airbnb had purged its database of over 1000 illegal apartment listings to avoid running afoul of New York city’s rental property laws.\n\nUber and Airbnb are companies that’ve defied conventions by ushering in the sharing economy, riding on the coattails of improved transparency. But as the above incidences show, even such venerable organizations are susceptible to misusing their rights as data owners, for short term gains.\n\nAnd this is where a blockchain-like technology shows promise. But to understand, what makes a blockchain more secure, we’ll need to dive deeper into what constitutes a blockchain.\n\nBuilding blocks of Blockchain\n\nA blockchain is defined as a secure, distributed and shared database that stores transactions.\n\nLet’s try to deconstruct the above definition to identify the building blocks of a blockchain –\n\nTransactions\n\nShared\n\nDistributed\n\nShared\n\nTransactions\n\nIt all starts with a transaction. A transaction could be something as simple as a payment or fund transfer. Or it can represent assets such as property titles, precious commodities, votes, music rights, customer details and more – all encapsulated in a digital form.\n\nShared\n\nNormally, a transaction for fund transfer or payments would be verified and approved by your bank, with the transaction recorded in the bank’s central server.\n\nBut in a blockchain set-up, when a transaction is transmitted to the entire peer to peer network, each node in the network will receive the transaction, update its copy of the database with the latest transaction before sharing it with the rest of the nodes in the network.\n\nDistributed\n\nBecause there is no one single entity that is entrusted with storing a transaction centrally, transactions are captured in a distributed file, stored and maintained by the network - basically, the same copy of the blockchain is duplicated and stored on each node in the network, with each node holding the same, most-current version of the database.\n\nSecure\n\nIn the event where multiple transactions are requested and cancelled at the same time, how does blockchain operate? Which transaction happened first and which one is the latter can become a tough puzzle to solve given there’s no central arbitrator.\n\nWho defines what is ‘latest’ on a blockchain?\n\nMaking of a block\n\nIt’s the nodes that must agree about the order in which transactions are received and added to the blockchain.\n\nRather than updating single transactions, nodes in the network club together many such transactions into groups called blocks.\n\nA block has three sections – a unique block reference number, link to the previous block, and the group of transactions.\n\nThe transactions that get added to a block therefore, can originate from several different requests that would have occurred at about the same time. A block can accommodate a finite number of transactions and a typical block size is around 1 MB – capped to avoid network congestion. A block is added to the blockchain every 10 minutes.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nBecause transactions in a block are considered to have occurred at the same time, the time-stamped nature of each block along with references to the previous blocks help chronologically sequence the block in a chain of blocks – hence the name blockchain.\n\nBuilding consensus\n\nGiven the distributed and decentralized nature of the network, where any node can ‘author’ a block by lumping together transactions into a block and attempting to transmit it to as the next block on the network, there can be utter chaos. With millions of autonomous nodes, how is the security of the blocks ensured?\n\nTo answer this question, we’ll lightly skim the world of digital signatures and cryptographic functions\n\nRemember one of the attributes of distributed ledgers is that all nodes must agree on the correct state of a shared data source. DLT employs consensus algorithms to validate and agree that the data being added is the same throughout the network. There are two main types of consensus algorithms used by permissionless blockchains – proof of work and proof of stake. Proof of work is the consensus protocol used by blockchain whereas proof of stake is an upcoming protocol, one proposed by Ethereum blockchain. In a later post, we’ll look at the difference between these two algorithms in greater detail. Outlined here is how proof-of-work works to secure the blockchain.\n\nProof of work algorithm is executed more like a competition - the nodes compete by proving they have used up a certain amount of computing power to solve a mathematical problem and validate a block.\n\nBut what’s in it for the nodes? What’s the need for the nodes to use up their computing resources just so that a block gets added to the chain? Sheer altruism?\n\n- The winning node gets rewarded in bitcoins, every time it solves a puzzle and gets to place the block on the chain and distribute the block throughout the network.\n\n- The nodes are called ‘miners’ and the process of solving the problem is called ‘mining’, which means the miners working to validate a block are mining for bitcoins.\n\nWith so many nodes in a network, ensuring security of the transactions and thereby, blocks become paramount. To do so, blockchain employs advanced encryption technology such as cryptographic hash functions to encrypt blocks. In a peer to peer network, the threat of malicious actors who’ll attempt to subvert the system by spamming the network with false messages resulting in a ‘denial of service’ is just as real as it’s in a conventional network. Cryptographic hash function is a secure and robust method to verify integrity of the blocks.\n\nCryptographic hash function makes it easy to encrypt and difficult to decrypt\n\n- a string of characters or text will result in the same hash value. For example, the string “jewel” will have a unique hash value whereas the string “jewl” will have a different hash. (Hash value is a string of 64 letters or numbers)\n\n- Even a small change such as the presence or absence of a character in the string would drastically change the hash value such that it bears no resemblance to the original value\n\n- While it’s easy to generate a hash for a string, it’s difficult to do the reverse i.e., generate the string corresponding to a hash value\n\nBecause a hash value is sensitive to change, if someone tries to change it on the blockchain, everyone on the network will know it. Cryptographic hash function therefore, ensures the blockchain records are tamper proof and secure.\n\nA consensus protocol such as proof of work uses cryptographic hash function to ensure not only the legitimacy of the blocks that get added to the network but also the rigour of the process by which the mathematical puzzle is solved and the blocks’ validity ascertained.\n\nProof of work – all about random integers, network target and cryptography\n\nSo, what’s the mathematical puzzle about? - The mathematical puzzle is all about finding a random integer to meet a network target value\n\nRandom Integer\n\nNodes try to crack the mathematical puzzle by combining transactions from the new block with hash value of the previous block (one that has already been added to the chain) -\n\n\n\n\n\nNew transactions + Hash value of previous block\n\nNonce – Number used once\n\nNonce, a random integer, can take any value between 0 and 4,294,967,296.\n\nNonce is then added to the combination\n\nNonce + New transactions + Hash value of previous block\n\nThe entire combination is again encrypted using a cryptographic hash function\n\nThe resulting hash value needs to have a certain number of zeros in front of the hash string.\n\nYou could think of this as an equation with two constants and a variable.\n\nThe two known constants in this equation are the transactions belonging to the new block and the hash value of the previous block.\n\nThe third, the unknown variable, is the nonce.\n\nIt’s the random value of nonce that triggers off a computationally intensive process.\n\nNetwork target value\n\nRemember, the resulting hash value needs to have a certain number of zeros in front of the hash string. Because hashes are one-way functions and cannot be inversed to find the string they represent, the competing nodes must try out different, random nonces until the right hash with the target number of zeros is found.\n\nFinding the right nonce requires on an average, 1021 computations - a single node working alone can take up to a year to find the right number and solve the problem. But because there are millions of nodes in the network, the chances of finding the right random number goes up significantly high.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, blocks are added to the chain every 10 minutes and this is possible only due to the large number of nodes working to validate the block. The winning node(s) therefore, must prove that a certain amount of computing power was used up to solve the problem. Hence the name ‘proof-of-work’.\n\nIn a situation where two or more nodes simultaneously solve the mathematical problem, the blocks are broadcast to the network by the respective winning nodes. The other nodes in the network add the winning node that they each receive to the longest chain. This helps resolve the ambiguity of which block would be considered valid since all the nodes adopt the longest chain as the final state of the blockchain.\n\nConsensus protocols – The Litmus Test\n\nProof of work is a rather complex way of achieving consensus amongst disparate entities. Not only does it require significant amount of computing resources but also impacts the system throughput due to the latency in validating and adding the blocks.\n\nHow do the other consensus protocols stack up against proof of work? What are the upsides and downsides to using those? Answers to these questions are important, given the critical role that consensus protocols play in determining the type of blockchain best suited for a business use case.\n\nReferences\n\n- How Does the Blockchain Work? - https://medium.com/@micheledaliessi/how-does-the-blockchain-work-98c8cd01d2ae\n\n- Blockchain - https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/innovation/articles/blockchain.html\n\n- Cryptographic hash function - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function\n\n- How does Proof of Work, um, work? - https://decentralize.today/how-does-proof-of-work-um-work-f44642b24215', '“That was fast,” I keep saying. Why do I keep saying that? Because I keep this page open in my browser all the time:\n\n\n\nI had bought bitcoin at $2200. It promptly went down to $1700, and ether went from $203 to $150. The next day. That was fast.\n\nIn the past five days, ether has gone from $150 to $220, and bitcoin has gone to $2400. That was fast.\n\nIn a crypto-investing webinar two weeks ago, I recommended looking into buying the Brave browser’s Basic Attention Token (BAT). They screwed up the smart contract so instead of raising $25 million they ended up raising $35 million. In 30 seconds. That was fast.\n\nWhat’s Going On?\n\nSo let’s talk first about crytpocurrencies. Here’s the key thing to understand: six months ago, bitcoin was 90 percent of the market, ether was about 5 percent, and all other altcoins had about 5 percent market share. Fast forward six months without a neck brace, and today we’re at almost exactly 50 percent bitcoin and 50 percent altcoins. The total value of all coins and tokens has quadrupled. That was fast.\n\nWhat does that tell you? There are two things going on:\n\nBitcoin Whales are Snapping Up Tokens\n\nAny early bitcoin miner or investor now has thousands of bitcoins. Most are Chinese. Each 500 bitcoins is $1 million. These “bitcoin whales” are now very wealthy. They would like to reduce their exposure to bitcoin, but the last thing they will do is go to fiat currency — there they will have poor returns and have to pay taxes. In fact, what they would like to do is get their money out of China without the government knowing. So they are looking for altcoins, especially token sales.\n\nWhy? Because if a token comes out that will likely go up in value, it’s safer than having all your wealth in bitcoins. The Chinese are buying any token that looks legitimate and like it has a chance to go up later. Their hold period is 3 – 9 months or so, they hope to double their money and move on to the next token. This diversifies their portfolio while keeping their reporting and tax obligations to a minimum.\n\nSo the whales are effectively sucking tokens up, preventing the natural buyers — project supporters — from purchasing tokens in the initial offering. They effectively have an elephant gun loaded with cash. Yesterday, one whale paid around $2,000 just in ether fees to get his $7 million trade in ahead of the other orders. This is probably 1,000 times what you would normally pay in fees, just to be at the head of the line.\n\nIf a whale can close out a token sale and force the issuance of new tokens, he effectively locks in his bitcoin price for several months. Please let that sink in : the whale doesn’t care what token it is, as long as it looks legitimate. He’s watching the price of bitcoin to make the decision on when to pull the trigger — any token sale that happens to look like it’s going to close is simply in the way of this elephant gun.\n\nIs this bad? It appears to be, because these investors have no real interest in the project. They just want to see that it looks legitimate. They don’t do much homework. They look for some social validation and pull the trigger. (My thanks to James Drake @EmbermineDrake and @Crypt0Leviathan for helping me understand these dynamics.)\n\nBut I argue it’s not so bad. They are playing the role of underwriters. They are distributors. The group raising money gets the money they asked for. The fast investors aren’t looking to sell at a loss, so over the next year or so they watch the price and get rid of their tokens when they have increased in value. (In the case of the Brave browser, I understand tokens were changing hands at 4 times their ICO price just hours later) This diversifies the whales and gives them unleveraged gains measured in triple digits.\n\nSome months later, the project reaches some milestones, the price of the token goes up, and the natural buyers come in to support the price, and if they hang on they could also see significant gains. So everyone wins. The first buyers take most of the risk, and the second buyers hang on for the long-term realized value of the token. This could be natural market making at work.\n\nBut not so fast — everything is not always as it seems. There are pumpers and dumpers. Just buying all of a token sale practically guarantees the price will go up . It’s very likely this will cause the price to double in short order, and the pumper starts dumping, going for a return in the thousands of percent in hours or days. The pumper uses the unsuspecting token as a means to an end, and the value of the token could collapse shortly after everyone else buys on their signal.\n\nEven though there is some of this sort of manipulation going on, I would argue that most of it is actually the underwriting model I explained above. Here’s why: investors don’t like to lose money, so they aren’t going to sell all at once: Only if they have a liquidity problem in their portfolio will they sell at a loss.\n\nSecond, plenty of ICOs simply don’t sell out. Of 158 known ICOs, 118 are still actively in the process of selling their inventory. More than half don’t reach their maximum at the closing bell. So investors are being selective. It’s just that the fast sell-outs make the most news. This, along with the incredibly durable efficient market hypothesis, suggests that, in general, this is not a bubble, this is underwriting, and there are plenty of natural buyers coming in at the next stage.\n\nAnd that brings us to part two:\n\nNatural Buyers and Speculators are Arriving in Boatloads\n\nCrypto investing is in the news. People can see the hockey-stick charts and want to get in on this gold rush. So more and more buyers are pouring in to feed the frenzy. This, again, is not necessarily speculation, and there is no guarantee it’s a bubble that will pop. There are buy-and-hold investors in this crowd as well (I hope my readers are some of them). We’ve gone from about $20 billion in total crypto-market cap 6 months ago to about $90 billion today, and many of those buyers are going to stay in crypto. They probably aren’t going to cash back out to fiat after a quick win. There could definitely be corrections — we saw a good one last week. But it is quickly being erased by more buyers wanting to get in on the action. Most exchanges are hiring more people to help with the increased onboarding load.\n\nI study bubbles. Most bubbles are not bubbles. When they pop, people say it was a bubble, but then prices go back up and then some. Was the 2009 housing “crisis” a bubble? We have good evidence that it wasn’t. The pop is a buying opportunity for an overheated market that went up too fast. You can say it’s a velocity bubble, but I don’t think it’s a value bubble. As we say in economics, “never reason from a price change” because a price change can happen for many reasons. I’ll get to my recommendation in a moment, but people are quick to talk about bubbles, yet they rarely bring a sharp lens to the analysis.\n\nThink of it this way: whether you’re a speculator or an investor, suppose you just doubled your money or more in crypto-investing. Are you going back to fiat? Probably not. I predict we’ll go from $90 billion steadily to $1 trillion over the next few years. Millionaires will become billionaires, and I won’t be surprised to see $5 trillion of crypto-assets over the next ten years. It is still early. There is still huge money to be made. It’s really just getting started.\n\nIt all reminds me of the Internet in the 1990s — people kept underestimating the impact, and those who kept doubling down (like Jeff Bezos) ultimately came out with monster compound returns. I bought Google shares at $1 (through a fund) and and sold it at $100 just after the IPO. I missed 5x after that.\n\nThe Bitcoin Situation\n\nAs I said earlier, not everything is as it seems. Last week, the Segwit crowd announced victory in the bitcoin block-scaling wars. But I’ve come to believe it may have been mere propaganda in an ongoing war for control of the protocol. This is why, I believe, the price hasn’t jumped back up to $2500, yet the price of ether has exceeded where it was a week ago. Many bitcoin announcements are designed as salvos in an ongoing war between two sides, and they are getting increasingly non-Nashian, with each side hoping for total victory.\n\nWhat to Do Now?\n\nBitcoin remains uncertain, ether has gone through the roof, ICOs are impossible to get in on, and altcoins are all hitting all-time highs. Is there anything to do? Go short? Fear the crash? Nervously jump onto the rocket, despite the potential for a nasty re-entry back to earth?\n\nWhat follows should not be construed as investment advice, but it is what I plan to do myself. I already have a significant position in both ether and bitcoin. I plan to buy more. I can’t know your situation. Any investment you make is your own responsibility, and you can lose substantially in any speculative market. Do NOT seek the help of qualified investment professionals. They do not have your best interests at heart; they are salespeople. Rather, I suggest that you seek the help of a qualified statistician before making any speculative decision.\n\nHere’s what I’m doing: I don’t care what happens in the six to twelve months after I buy something — it’s noise. I don’t try to catch the bottom or sell at the top. I just buy and stick it away and don’t sell. I ask: Where do I think bitcoin will be in two years? Probably somewhere in the $4–10k range. Where do I think ether will be in two years? Probably in the $500–2k range. So what do I care if I buy bitcoin at $2000 or $2500? What do I care if I buy ether at $170 or $220?\n\nIf I were investing fresh today, I would buy about 50 percent ether, about 20 percent bitcoin, and 30 percent various altcoins I thought were going to add value. That’s because you can’t buy a good index yet. When the index products come from Token Factory, I will hold about 30 percent ether and 70 percent index products. I don’t mind easing into these positions. I can buy now and watch for a dip to buy more, in which case I may have to pay more to get in if it goes up. BUT — we can count on volatility, so I plan to watch and buy more ether fairly soon.\n\nI know that the day bitcoin’s scaling problem is really settled, the price will jump tremendously, but a press release is not a final solution. In the meantime, it’ll bounce up and down as the whales go into and out of tokens. So I’m looking for a buying opportunity. Anything under $2k looks like one to me.\n\nBecause there’s so much volatility, I don’t mind being ready to swoop in when I see prices drop 20 percent. If I see the price of ether or bitcoin drop by 40 percent or more, I will jump in with both feet. As Warren Buffett says, “Be greedy when others are fearful” (I’m leaving out the other half on purpose). I have no intention of selling; all my coins are in cold storage.\n\nWhat Should You Do?\n\nUse your head. Have a plan. Don’t overcommit. Don’t buy more than you can afford to lose. Be prepared to see your investment go down before it goes up. You can’t call the bottom, even if you think you can. If you’re really excited, commit up to 20 percent of your investable money into crypto-assets. If you’re a normal, rational person, go for ten percent. If it doubles, you’re fine. Do NOT let cryptocurrencies occupy more than 50 percent of your portfolio under ANY circumstances — sell to reduce your exposure.\n\nIf you are sitting on a ton of ether, now is the time to pay your taxes and look at real estate for some portion of it. Buy yourself an apartment that sends you a check every month forever — just in case. If you’re just getting in, don’t be afraid to buy now if you think the price two years from now will be much higher.\n\nThis is a guest post by David Siegel, CEO of Twenty Thirty, an open blockchain and decentralization community which will hold its own ICO in the near future. The views expressed are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of Bitcoin Magazine or BTC Media.\n\n\n\n', ""The use of Bitcoin will expand in the coming years, former Russian Finance Minister Aleksey Kudrin told RT at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). Kudrin warned of online crime and lack of regulation concerning the cryptocurrency.\n\n“I don’t rule out that there is a bubble here, but for several years we will have an expansion of bitcoin use. We are facing risks of deflation, fraud schemes [and] a lack of sufficient regulation. But it will be used for now, will expand its boundaries,” said Aleksey Kudrin, who served as Russia’s Finance Minister in 2000 -2011 and now chairs the Council of the Center for Strategic Reaserch think tank.\n\nREAD MORE: Skyrocketing bitcoin raises fears of asset bubble\n\nBitcoin has been surging in popularity as a digital payment system that allows users anywhere in the world to transact directly without interference from intermediaries, governments, regulators, or central banks. However, some worry that the surge in value of bitcoin can turn it into an asset bubble in an unregulated market.\n\n'OPEC deal will work more-less effectively till mid-2018'\n\nSpeaking on the recent nine-month extension of the OPEC deal, Kudrin said that it will “work more-less effectively” till mid-2018.\n\nRead more\n\nIn May, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reached a deal with Russia and other major producers to prolong output cuts for nine months until the end of March 2018. Oil prices dropped sharply ahead of the announcement.\n\nAfter mid-2018, “it will be more difficult to extend the deal, as other producer companies in other regions can block the decline, which some countries voluntarily decided to take.”\n\nThe deal between 24 oil-producing countries is expected to stabilize the market and reduce the global oil stock by the first quarter of 2018.\n\nAccording to the ex-finance minister, other companies also have opportunities for oil production.\n\n\n\n“New competition will emerge, again the same question will arise – should we cut production so that others occupy our place in the market?”\n\n'Ruble is overpriced'\n\nSpeaking about the value of the Russian ruble, Kudrin noted that it is slightly overpriced.\n\n\n\n“If the ruble is overpriced, then only slightly. If oil prices remain at its current level and won’t change, then we can expect a small, 1-1.5 percent easing of the exchange rate.”"", 'Despite the recent cryptocurrency massacres causing Bitcoin and altcoin prices to decline, Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, are poised to recover with rumors of its price potentially reaching $10,000.\n\nThroughout economic history, potential bubbles have been the result of overinvestment and hype. When such crashes happen, unexpected outcomes may occur. There can only be a few people who have loaded up in the electronic currency and doubled their money before such a burst.\n\nBitcoin crash of 2013\n\nIn 2013, when Bitcoin price crashed, early Bitcoin investors had gained up to three times their initial investment. In the past few months, the price increase has reached up to 87 percent.\n\nBitcoin price has surged to $2,800 due to various factors, including the acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legal mode of payment, a stable growth in terms of international remittance services, among others.\n\nMany have adopted Bitcoin as their mode of payment and it is already accepted by regulators as a legitimate way of investing. With its various potential consumer uses, Bitcoin may potentially become a mainstream asset. In fact, in some countries like Japan, Bitcoin is legally accepted as a method of payment.\n\nWill South Korea, Russia and Venezuela keep the demand?\n\nAccording to some Bitcoin market watchers, Bitcoin’s popularity will keep on increasing.\n\nIn fact, in other countries such as Nigeria, South Korea and Russia, people preferred Bitcoin as a more reliable way to conduct financial transactions as these countries’ economies are unstable.\n\nIn a declining economy such as Venezuela, Bitcoin is also being used to purchase food from Amazon through a mediating company. Sadly, Bitcoin is also often linked to crime-related activities including cyber hacking with ransom demands, drug deals and even the promotion of prostitution.\n\nHowever, last month’s 87 percent price increase is not a normal movement. Now, the next thing to consider is the possible damage it may bring if and when it bursts.\n\nOn one hand, the damage may not be that huge. While there are 16 mln Bitcoins with a total value of $35 bln, this is not yet a very large amount when we talk in the context of the global capital market.\n\nCompared to the $805 bln market value of Apple AAPL, Bitcoin is not that significant in figures. Meanwhile, a company named Associate British Foods has almost the same worth as Bitcoin - yet its market didn’t crash when it burst out.\n\nIn addition to possible overinvestment, many companies will possibly misallocate their capital through investing in a trending investment system like Bitcoin. Last month, RSK Labs invested $3.5 mln for a smart contract in Bitcoin. Coinbase also invested $75 mln in a Bitcoin startup. Though some risks are uncalculated, investors would still undertake a business venture even it involves their capital fund. Looking into the nature of a bull market, you could always find more than one asset with prices that are soaring high. But the most intriguing part is the existence of an asset bubble which would be a “real sign” that the bull market is reaching its peak. It is this scenario in which the market is expected to crash. Nevertheless, even if Bitcoin does burst, the damage may not be that bad. However, it’s still money and its loss could still affect others.\n\nTime to look at other cryptocurrencies?\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014, there have already been three crashes in the Bitcoin market and it has fallen almost 50 percent every time. Other digital currencies such as Ethereum and Ripple are also experiencing the same ups and downs as Bitcoin. While some are skeptical about the use of digital currencies, the bursting scenario is something that we have already anticipated.', 'Gavin Andresen, the former lead developer of bitcoin, is breaking his silence.\n\nWhile in recent months he\'s been more active on Twitter discussing the block size debate (even stamping his name on a new bitcoin scaling \'agreement\'), Andresen has largely been absent from the bitcoin developer community for about a year.\n\nBut, that doesn\'t mean the prodigious worker, who did much to help build out bitcoin\'s early developer team and market, hasn\'t been busy.\n\nAt the beginning of May, Andresen tweeted:\n\nI\'m looking for beta testers and collaborators for my Random Sanity Project: https://t.co/NEbpr1baqk — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) May 1, 2017\n\nThe project looks to better secure the internet by checking sources of randomness used by individuals and organizations.\n\nKeeping an eye on bitcoin\n\nThe Random Sanity Project not only stemmed from Andresen\'s interest in learning the programming language GO, but also in seeing the problems a lack of entropy can have in monetary software systems like bitcoin.\n\n""I certainly still do keep up with bitcoin,"" Andresen told CoinDesk, adding that he might contribute code review to DCG\'s new bitcoin scaling proposal, but that he\'s unlikely to write any of the code.\n\n""Bitcoin is such an interesting project because it’s security critical,"" he said. ""If the security fails, it\'s immediately obvious, people lose money and react immediately.""\n\nThis is different, he continued, than an email account being taken over or attacked, in that people typically don\'t notice those breaches for some time.\n\n""For a lot of security issues, bitcoin brings them into the light,"" Andresen said.\n\nThis quick reaction was seen in several mishaps based on faulty random number generation in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn May 2015, a vulnerability in Blockchain\'s Android bitcoin wallet left several users out money. According to Softpedia, the vulnerability allowed duplicate bitcoin addresses to be created and given to different users. At its core, the problem was with Blockchain\'s random number generator, random.org, which provided insufficient entropy on certain versions of the Android operating system.\n\nAnd two years before, in August 2013, all bitcoin wallet applications on Android operating systems were potentially at risk when several vulnerabilities were found within another random number generator, Java SecureRandom.\n\nMaintaining a distance\n\nWhile the project is definitely tangential to Andresen’s former work as bitcoin\'s lead maintainer, it’s also much different.\n\n""So far, it\'s a one-person project, which I like,"" Andresen told CoinDesk. ""It’s nice and simple. I chose something small and intentionally boring.""\n\nHe continued:\n\n""Bitcoin was a big, complicated project involving lots of people spread out all over the world; there was too much stress and politics and I didn\'t want that again.”\n\nAndresen has been working on the Random Sanity Project for about six months. According to him, the project is not intended to be a profit-making business. Instead, ideally, the project would be sponsored by an entity like the Linux Foundation to offer the service to anyone for free.\n\nSo how does Random Sanity work? Every system and every programming language has a way of getting random bytes – for instance, Linux has a special folder called \'/dev/urandom\' and OpenSSL provides several random number generators (which Bitcoin Core uses).\n\nUsers of the Random Sanity Project can take those random numbers – from 16 to 64 bytes – and input them into the service, which will return a \'true\' if the bytes look random, or a \'false\' if the numbers don\'t.\n\n""The problem of detecting whether your random numbers are good enough is a tricky problem,"" Andresen told CoinDesk. ""There are a bunch of ways you can screw up.""\n\nDigital health check\n\nWhile random number generators are created specifically to provide entropy (a lack of order, and hence predictability), there are several reasons something might go wrong.\n\nSoftware downloads and upgrades can mess with randomness. Or it can be as simple as someone tripping over the virtual machine utilizing a random number generator cord and unplugging it.\n\nBut a typical failure, Andresen said, is when an organization is using cloud computing and starts up multiple virtual machines at the same time.\n\nIn this case, the organization might save an image of the software and run multiple copies for the web servers that handle traffic. Because the virtual machines are starting in the same state, they could, according to Andresen, come up with the same \'random\' numbers.\n\n""There are usually tools for increasing entropy so this doesn\'t happen,"" he said, ""but [the Random Sanity Project] could be a good check.""\n\nWhile he doesn\'t think a company needs to run every string of bytes a machine gives them through the tool, it would be beneficial to send one string of bytes when the machine starts up to make sure it\'s generating reasonable randomness. Then, he said, if it fails, the problem can be investigated.\n\n""This is designed as a way to make sure catastrophic disasters don\'t happen, or you catch them quick enough,"" said Andresen.\n\nFurther, the more people and organizations that use the system, the more valuable it becomes, because it can then base randomness on many more strings of bytes.\n\nCurrently, though, only a few have beta tested the service, sometimes contributing code back to the project – including people from startups Blockchain and ShapeShift, according to Andresen.\n\nThe trustless trend\n\nOn Twitter, some praised the service, while others were worried about the system\'s architecture.\n\nFor one, the initial system used HTTP, which allowed anyone to eavesdrop and see the random bytes being sent to the system. Andresen quickly relaunched using HTTPS to provide a secure connection so that no one can see what bytes are sent.\n\nIf an entity’s random number generator is broken, seeing one supposedly random string of bytes could open that entity up to attack, said another complaint from a Twitter user. A chance worth taking, Andresen responded.\n\nAs far as Andresen having insight into the bytes being sent to the service, he said he has none.\n\nAnd, following the trend set by bitcoin, he said:\n\n""I\'m trying to arrange things where people don’t have to trust me.""\n\nWhile the service is currently running on the App Engine of the Google Cloud Platform, his next project is opening the project up to allow auditing by third parties. Presently, people can only audit the open-source code on GitHub, which Andresen assured CoinDesk, is exactly what’s running on the App Engine. The extra step, though, will prove it\n\nRandom numbers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

(I know; I’ve been covering a number of similarly themed events lately.)\n\nIt struck me, as I watched dozens of ticket holders get turned away from the oversubscribed event, that there was perhaps no better symbol of the speculative mania we’ve been witnessing in recent weeks than the sight of 70 would-be attendees sadly zip up their rain jackets, reverse course, and trudge home from an event that, not so long ago, would have been attended by few people. (William Mougayar, the summit’s organizer and a partner at the Toronto-based investment firm Virtual Capital Ventures, told me he would be forced to refund around $20,000.)\n\nIn case you’re just tuning in, tokens are a kind of digital currency built on blockchains, the innovative accounting technology that first made Bitcoin possible. Nowadays, most tokens are minted on Ethereum, a rival network that aims to create a virtual computer distributed across a swarm of volunteer machines. Lately entrepreneurs have been using Ethereum to coin their own digital currencies and sell them directly to the public. So far the tactic has been working: The market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies exceeds $90 billion today. Bitcoin accounts for less than half of that sum.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s tech newsletter, from which this essay originated.\n\nDepending on your perspective, tokens either herald the next wave of the Internet, or conceal a scam-riddled tulip garden. Advocates like Chris Dixon, the investor at Andreessen Horowitz, have described the technology behind tokens as “a breakthrough in open network design.” Critics, like Izabella Kaminska, a writer at the Financial Times, have disparaged it as a “Ponzi machine.” Probably both are right.\n\nOne thing both sides can agree on: We’re in the midst of a cryptobubble. Speculation, not utility, is driving an outrageous purchasing frenzy. This was made clear when Mougayar, one of the Token Summit’s hosts, polled the crowd on how many people own tokens. Essentially everyone—more than 500 people—raised a hand. How many people actually use them for something other than trading? About 10 hands went up.\n\nNevertheless, the most ardent believers take a longer term view. As Olaf Carlson-Wee, founder of the hedge fund Polychain Capital and a bull in the market, told me during a cocktail hour after the event, “It’s only a bubble if it crashes.”']"
06/04/2017,"['Concerns over the low saving rates in Japan and South Korea, the citizens of the two countries are investing more in bitcoin. Comparing to the average 17 percent gain of Asian stocks in 2017, the value of the cryptocurrency increased by 124 percent over the same period (after a 125 percent gain in 2016). Just in May alone, BTC had seen a 60 percent increase during the month.\n\nAfter a crackdown at China’s Central Bank earlier this year, more investors in Japan and South Korea turned to the cryptocurrency. According to the media publication Reuters, the increased Japanese and Korean investment had an impact on bitcoin’s surge in 2017.\n\nBitcoin exchanges in the two Asian countries are saying they had experienced higher interest in the cryptocurrency over the last two weeks. One reason could be that Japan accepted a bill in April officially recognizing digital currencies, including bitcoin, as real money. Due to strict money-laundering rules, which make it hard for investors to move the cryptocurrency in and out, BTC trades at premium in both countries. While, for example, on May 25, the global average bitcoin price was $2,514, the digital currency was traded on $3,800 in South Korea with a 33.5 percent premium.\n\n“After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. It’s like buying a dream. Everyone says we can’t rely on Japanese pensions anymore. This worries me, so I started bitcoins,” Mutsuko Higo, a 55-year-old Japanese social insurance and labor consultant said. Higo bought around 200,000 yen ($1800) worth of bitcoin in March to supplement her retirement savings.\n\nAsia is one of the main supporters of the cryptocurrency with the booming investment culture in the region, where it is common to swap investment tips. According to a ranking by CoinMarketCap, China, Japan, and South Korea are home to several high traffic cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nSince bitcoin is mostly unregulated in Asia and the laws for the exchanges are uneven, there is a significant risk associated with the trade of the cryptocurrency. For example, in Hong Kong, BTC exchanges operate under money service operator licenses. On the other hand, in South Korea, the regulation for exchanges is similar to online stores, trading physical goods. However, South Korea is planning to introduce regulations on the digital currency in 2017.\n\nSince in most Asian countries, there are no rules for investor protection, the rise of bitcoin’s popularity attracts an increasing number of scammers. South Korean authorities reported they had busted the members of a pyramid scheme, which gained approximately $55 million scamming thousands of victims. Because of the lack of regulations, India also sees the number of such pyramid schemes rising in the country.\n\nLeonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, who is also a bitcoin investor himself, warned bitcoin investors about the potential risks associated to the cryptocurrency:\n\n“Trading carries huge risk: there is no investor protection and plenty of market manipulation and insider trading. Some of the exchanges cannot be trusted in my opinion.”\n\nTo increase trust and user protection, some of the larger exchanges implemented security measures and compensation guarantees. However, numerous small cryptocurrency exchanges are operating with almost no supervision. Learning from the MtGox fraud in 2014, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan closely supervises exchanges, but not investors or traders.\n\n“The government is not guaranteeing the value of cryptocurrencies. We are asking for bitcoin exchanges to fully explain the risk of sharp price moves,” an FSA official said.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'When Bitcoin burst onto the scene in 2009, it challenged preconceived notions about the limitations of transactions. Fast-forward 8 years, and another platform is dominating the headlines. Ethereum has built on Bitcoin’s potential and is driving a revolution in financial transactions.\n\nEthereum is an open-source platform that facilitates the development of next-generation decentralized applications. It was conceptualized in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, who at the time was conducting research within the Bitcoin community. Since Buterin’s initial ideation, Ethereum has grown in interest and scale; today it is poised to overhaul open-source development.\n\nBitcoin opened the world to the possibilities of shared ledgers, and now Ethereum is expanding on that potential. According to Buterin, “Ethereum uses many of the same systems (such as blockchains and peer-to-peer networking) in order to generate a shared-world computing platform that can flexibly but securely run any application users want to code (shared ledgers like Bitcoin included).”\n\nSince Bitcoin’s debut on the world stage, many developers have sought to apply the ideology to new systems similarly underpinned by blockchain technology. However, these iterations failed to impact the tech and financial-services communities because they were limited to a few functionalities.\n\nThe intent of Ethereum is to transcend those limitations by creating a blockchain protocol with its own native programming language, which enables any application to be written on top. This structure supports all existing and future applications and lends itself to an environment of constant and immediate development innovation.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin birthed Ethereum, in the past year, Ethereum has eclipsed its predecessor in terms of future promise. In March 2017, Ethereum’s digital currency, Ether, reached an all-time high of $30, boosting the market cap of Ethereum to $2.57 billion.\n\nAnother facet that sets Ethereum apart from Bitcoin is the support Ethereum continues to receive from the financial and technological communities. Companies have recognized the immense power of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to boost security and efficiency, and they are joining the party. Institutions like Microsoft and JPMorgan have pledged their support to the development of Ethereum through the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The purpose of the alliance is to ensure the potential of Ethereum is realized across industries.\n\nCompanies involved in the alliance are working toward creating a standard, open-source version of Ethereum, which will serve as a blueprint for all adaptations. JPMorgan is already working on implementing its own Ethereum-based system to facilitate the seamless transfer of funds between global JPMorgan branches.\n\nAlthough many organizations are invested in leveraging Ethereum to serve as a basis for privatized versions, the overarching goal is that one day, each institution’s private networks will be connected to the global Ethereum blockchain. This will establish a new universal benchmark for information transactions.\n\nAlthough Ethereum has enormous potential to create a more secure and streamlined global transactional system, to concentrate on what is yet to come is to overlook the changes Ethereum is already enacting. Early Ethereum adaptors are driving innovation through decentralization. Here are some of the ways today’s cutting-edge businesses are applying Ethereum to solve existing problems and create future solutions.\n\nIncrease Protective Measures around Online Consumer Data\n\nIdentity theft is a constant concern across today’s global landscape. Organizations and individuals are increasingly aware of impending threats to digital security.\n\nOne company, KYC-Chain, is tapping into Ethereum to help businesses safely onboard new customers, blending simple identification processes and know-your-customer regulations. KYC-Chain’s solution empowers customers to manage their own identities by sharing only necessary information.\n\nKYC-Chain protects user data on the platform through a series of cryptographic protocols. The platform allocates responsibilities to “trusted gatekeepers” who have been given clearance to retrieve and authenticate customer documents.\n\nEnhancing Crowdfunding Capabilities and Transparency<\n\nBusiness development has changed drastically over the past decade. No longer are businesses and entrepreneurs relegated to raising funds through VC’s and private investor relations; today, hopeful entrepreneurs are finding public support through crowdfunding. Platforms like Kickstarter and GoFundMe have opened conversations and opportunities around business development.\n\nOrganizations like Weifund are looking to expound on the public’s growing affinity for crowdfunding through blockchain implementation. Weifund’s platform utilizes Ethereum’s Smart Contract capabilities to offer customizable solutions to contributors.\n\nStandard crowdfunding platforms generally issue basic refunds if project goals are not met; thanks to Ethereum’s Smart Contracts, project organizers can establish customized agreements, or “hooks,” as Weifund calls them. Smart Contracts expand the ways in which individuals can contribute to development, while ensuring complete transparency and strict adherence to contract boundaries.\n\nSmart Contracts are a way of transporting anything of value — money, shares or data — without an intermediary, and Ethereum technology makes this possible. It used to be that you’d have to make a request to receive something of value, and wait for an intermediary to facilitate that request. Smart Contracts are immediate. Another benefit of Smart Contracts is that the rules and regulations associated with the contract are automatically enforced.\n\nMaking a Decentralized Global Workforce a Reality\n\nButerin and Ethereum supporters believe in complete decentralization; they envision a system that puts users in complete control and allows them to innovate in any direction.\n\nEthereum can also help budding entrepreneurs build the right teams. An Ethereum-run organization is based on democratic shareholder voting, which means every backer or contractor has access to your latest updates and initiatives based on the contracts you’ve drawn up. Ethereum takes the pain out of managing an organization and answering to shareholders, because all of those initiatives are automatically executed within the contract.\n\nColony is one platform leveraging Ethereum to drive decentralized, global work organizations. Colony strips away organizational hierarchy and simplifies the management of a distributed workforce. Based on principles of meritocracy, Colony encourages people to invest their time, unique expertise, feedback and ideas in global projects.\n\nThe system, run on Ethereum, assesses users and the value they contribute to Colonies on the platform. Users are awarded tokens based on completed tasks and weighted value. Automated cryptocurrency payments are facilitated through Stripe to ensure that all contributors are adequately compensated based on value.\n\nColony envisions a democratized working future; one in which individuals are not limited by their location. Though it is still in beta, Colony is hopeful that its collaborative network will drive the future of workforce management.\n\nFinancial Development\n\nOne of Ethereum’s often cited benefits is the reduction of operational fees. Ethereum eliminates intermediaries, thus decreasing transactional fees and increasing the speed and efficiency of transactions. Every industry stands to benefit from improvements in efficiency and reductions in cost, but this innovation is especially exciting for organizations in developing economies.\n\nMany people in developing economies are subject to complicated remittance processes, exorbitant online payment fees and high currency exchanges. Everex, a FinTech company, is leveraging Ethereum to help people in developing nations with limited access to banks and global financial systems. Everex’s Cryptocash solution enables simple cross-border transactions.\n\nEverex’s comprehensive solution not only enables people around the world to employ more agency in managing personal finances; it also provides them with more global investment opportunities.\n\nThe actualization of Ethereum is nowhere near complete; however, the technology has already managed to set in motion decentralized solutions that were once deemed impossible. Recently it has been lauded as the future of cryptocurrency, but Ethereum’s potential outstrips even those accolades.\n\nThe mounting support for the development of Ethereum and rapid adoption among emerging organizations are changing how we think about digital safety, crowdfunding, workforce management and economic development.\n\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch', 'Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in the world, but other cryptocurrencies are catching up to it, including Ethereum.\n\nWhile Ethereum functions similarly to Bitcoin, its structure and design is very different.\n\nBitcoin was the first blockchain-based currency, and offers users the ability to safely and anonymously transfer funds through a decentralised distributed ledger.\n\nEthereum borrows the decentralised blockchain from Bitcoin, but expands the design to allow for almost limitless possibilities.\n\nComputer vs Currency\n\nBlockchain technology requires a large distributed network, where the ledger of transactions is recorded on each point in the network and every node is independent.\n\nThis allows users to send and receive currency without a third party such as a bank, while remaining secure through decentralised confirmation.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Bitcoin are based on blockchains, but Ethereum’s blockchain expands the concept of a distributed ledger to allow for more advanced commands.\n\nEthereum’s defining factor is the addition of a Turing-complete programming language to blockchain interactions.\n\nThis allows users to create “smart contracts”.\n\nEthereum can be perceived as a virtual computer made out of blockchain nodes, with every command being confirmed by the entire machine and saved to its public ledger.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin blocks, Ethereum data blocks can hold more than just transaction information and can function as autonomous contracts.\n\nIn simple terms, instead of sending money to an account, a user can use Ether to create an open contract which will automatically complete as soon as its requirements are met.\n\nThe contract is then verified and added to the Ethereum blockchain, remaining inert until complete.\n\nMining\n\nMining Bitcoin is done through specialised hardware and is rarely profitable for a single user without a large investment in ASIC miners.\n\nEthereum uses a different mining system which favours users with consumer GPUs, in order to encourage more independent miners and a stronger network.\n\nHowever, mining both of these currencies requires a sizeable initial investment in order to make a reasonable profit.\n\nWhen sending Bitcoin or Ethereum to another address on the blockchain, miners use their computing power to solve a proof-of-work problem and add the block of information.\n\nMiners earn rewards for mining blocks in addition to receiving a fee for the blockchain transaction.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum users both pay transaction fees in order to add their transaction to the blockchain.\n\nDue to the limited block size of the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin transfers can take over an hour for full confirmation, while Ethereum transactions take an average of three minutes.\n\nThe transaction fee paid to miners has another use in the Ethereum blockchain, as it prevents users conducting spam or repeated attacks against smart contracts – due to the increasingly high cost of a large volume of transactions.\n\nFor most transactions, the transaction fee on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain is minimal.\n\nDecentralisation and Value\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralised, but Ethereum attempts to prevent collusion and 51% attacks by encouraging users to mine with graphics cards.\n\nBitcoin’s blockchain nodes are grouped into many pools, some of which control a large percentage of blocks mined on the blockchain.\n\nDue to this, there is increased potential for collusion on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhile the proof-of-work mining system was the initial solution to the security of blockchain technology, Ethereum’s developers have proposed a new method to further increase decentralisation and lower computing power costs.\n\nThe upcoming system is a simple proof-of-stake concept which replaces mining with staking currency on whether a block should be added to the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies are the biggest cryptocurrencies by market share, and Bitcoin has been steadily losing its market share lead since March 2017.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin remains the most popular and high-value cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nNow read: OneBit debit card allows you to pay with Bitcoin and Ether', 'Forget U.S. stocks and emerging-market assets, even ignore bitcoin. Those brave enough to invest in the Wild West of tech are the ones making a killing.\n\nWhile the record-breaking rally in bitcoin has captivated markets, demand for other digital coins is surging as companies raise millions in minutes, or even seconds, from investors wanting in on the next big tech startup. Last week it took 30 seconds for Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich to issue about $35 million of basic attention token, the unit of exchange in a blockchain-based advertising platform built on top of the company’s Brave browser.\n\nQuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain\n\nDigital tokens tied to the blockchain platform issued this year have more than doubled in price on average since trading started, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tech startups are increasingly selling coins that can be used on their projects instead of resorting to traditional financing methods such as venture capital.\n\nThe sector isn’t for the fainthearted. The apps and websites behind most of these tokens are still only in development stage. Most are sold for pennies on the dollar and volatility can be extreme. TaaS, a closed-end fund dedicated to blockchain markets, had the coins it sold this year double in price in five weeks, and then fall 35 percent in two days.\n\nBut if you can stomach the risk, the rewards have been substantial. Coins from the 15 ICOs this year for which data is available have risen by an average of over 100 percent, while shares sold in initial public offerings in the U.S. this year have gained 13 percent on average since they started trading.\n\n“There’s been overwhelming demand for coins,” said Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. “Sure, a lot of it is based on speculation and traders looking to make a quick gain, but there’s also a fundamental driver, which is the anticipation that the digital-currency market is maturing.”\n\nRead more on how digital coins are letting startups bypass venture capital\n\nForty-four coins have been issued this year, according to blockchain research website Smith & Crown. Not all trade immediately after the auctions since some have vesting periods. The tokens with the biggest gain, a 500 percent jump since it started trading on March 30, was issued by Edgeless, which is building a decentralized gambling platform. That sale wasn’t open to U.S.-based investors since the company isn’t licensed to operate in the U.S.\n\nPrediction market platform Gnosis sold the highest valued tokens this year. The GNO token started trading at $52 on May 1 and has more than quadrupled.\n\nEven with growing acceptance of blockchain from companies ranging from Toyota Motor Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co., some advocates of the technology say they’re cautious of the digital tokens because of the exuberance sweeping through the cryptocurrency world.\n\n“It seems like a fad, and as a professional investor, it’s not what we do,” said David Dunn, president of Kingsbridge Wealth Management, who first bought bitcoin in 2014 and has invested in blockchain-related companies. “I’d rather invest in the companies using the technology themselves. The speculators might end up being right, and this becomes a solid investment because of the power of the technology, but we’re not at that stage.”\n\nToken sales like the one for Gnosis, which catapulted the company’s market capitalization to over $300 million without it even having a product, or Eich’s BAT coin, which was over in seconds, have raised some eyebrows. Still, the token market will probably continue to grow at least in the near future, said Nick Tomaino, principal at San Francisco-based venture-capital firm Runa Capital, who also runs The Control blog, which tracks digital currencies.\n\nMore than $100 million of coins has been raised this year, surpassing total sales last year, while total issuance is expected to jump to about $600 million, according to Tomaino.\n\n“There’s a lot of hype, and a lot of money being raised because it’s so easy for anyone to create these coins without having to deal with any third parties, and it’s so easy for people to buy them,” Tomaino said. “It can’t be stopped.”', '-- Published: Sunday, 4 June 2017 | Print | Disqus By Steve St. Angelo, SRSrocco Report When the Central Banks finally lose control of propping up the markets, will the BIG MONEY be made in owning gold, silver or crypto-currencies? This is the question many investors who are focused on \x93alternative assets\x94, outside the typical mainstream stock, bond and real estate markets, are asking. Most investors who have been concerned about the massively inflated Bubble Markets and the Greatest Financial Ponzi Scheme in history, have been investing in gold and silver. However, a new kid on the block, called Bitcoin and the other crypto-currencies, have gained a lot of attention due to the huge increase in their prices over the past few months. So, now many investors are wondering what to make of these extremely volatile crypto-currencies and if they are nothing more than purely speculative and gambling vehicles. This is a logical assumption based on the massive spike in many of their crypto-currency values. That being said, Charles Hugh Smith wrote the following in his article, Projecting The Price Of Bitcoin : The wild card in cryptocurrencies is the role of Big Institutional Money. I\x92ve taken the liberty of preparing a projection of bitcoin\x92s price action going forward: You see the primary dynamic is continued skepticism from the mainstream, which owns essentially no cryptocurrency and conventionally views bitcoin and its peers as fads, scams and bubbles that will soon pop as price crashes back to near-zero. Skepticism is always a wise default position to start one\x92s inquiry, but if no knowledge is being acquired, skepticism quickly morphs into stubborn ignorance. Bitcoin et al. are not the equivalent of Beanie Babies. Cryptocurrencies have utility value. They facilitate international payments for goods and services. This was very interesting analysis done by Charles Hugh Smith who is one of the more bright minds in the alternative media community. I have watched Bitcoin out of the corner of my eye over the past few years, but have not placed much attention on the leading crypto-currency. However, as the price of Bitcoin and crypto-currencies have surged over the past several months, I decided to take a closer look to see what all the hubbub was about. What I found out was quite interesting. Bitcoin\x92s price rise is not just based on mere speculative flows (as many assume), but rather it\x92s also rising due to the skyrocketing energy and capital costs to produce each coin. Yes, there is a lot more to this, but there is some METHOD TO THE MADNESS. Charles Hugh Smith understands this and realizes that cyrpto-currencies will likely to continue to gain in price, interest and market cap going forward due to the way they were designed. Now, I am not saying I totally agree with Charles, but there is more behind crypto-currencies than just mere speculative flows into digital assets. So, the question is . where will the BIG MONEY be made when the Fed and Central Banks lose control of propping up the Markets? That\x92s a good question. Yes, the Central Banks will lose control because they are facing one force that they are unable to manipulate . ENERGY. While the Central banks can manipulate the oil price, than cannot manipulate the Falling EROI \x96 Energy Returned On Investment that continues to decline. So, the more the EROI of oil falls, the more printing and propping up the markets the Central banks are forced to do. It is really that simple. Thus, the END OF MARKET MANIPULATION has an expiration date . and its not decades away. I wouldn\x92t be surprised that it takes place within the next 5-10 years or even less. To get an idea of the total current value of Gold, Silver and Bitcoin-Crypto-currencies, let\x92s take a look at the value of above ground gold and silver investment: According to the data put out by the USGS \x96 U.S. Geological Survey, GFMS, CPM Group and Kitco (market price), all the investment gold held in the world is worth $2.93 trillion versus $51.8 billion for silver. You will also notice that there isn\x92t much more above-ground investment silver in the world (2.59 billion oz) compared to gold (2.25 billion oz). NOTE: The total global gold and silver value is based upon $1,300 for gold and $20 for silver Now, if we bring in the total value of Bitcoin and all the other crypto-currencies, we have the following: All the gold investment (including Central Bank and private investment) is approximately $2.93 trillion versus $89 billion for the total Bitcoin-Cryptos market cap and $52 billion for silver. So, the current market cap of Bitcoin-cryptos now surpasses the total global value of silver investment by $37 billion. Of course, the Bitcoin-cyrpto market cap has increased significantly over the past few months. Common sense logic suggests the recent spike in Bitcoin and the other crypto-currencies will likely experience a large correction thus a falling market cap. But, I agree with Charles Hugh Smith that these crypto-currencies will likely gain significantly over the next five years. However, I also see the value of gold and silver rising considerably as well . especially silver. The price of silver will likely increase in a much greater percentage because there isn\x92t much more physical silver in the world compared to gold, and its price is so low, that when large funds move into the silver market . the huge pressure will be released by a much higher price. There is a lot to understand about Gold, Silver and the Crypto-currencies going forward. Investors need to realize that while the crypto-currencies will likely see large gains in their values in the future, the BIG ENERGY PROBLEMS will are going to face may not be good for Cypto-currency network functionality. Again . there is a lot of consider. Which means gold and silver will still be the some of the safest physical assets to own in the future.

Latin America and the Caribbean have been plagued with economic instability for decades.\n\nRampant inflation and devaluation of currencies and assets have left these nations unstable and often havens for criminal activities. Corruption of the banks and governments is often cited as the leading cause of these economic woes, specifically relating to the centralized control over currencies. Luis Cuende, co-founder and project lead at the ICO record-breaking Aragon, believes that the time is right for cryptocurrencies to play a role in revitalizing the economies of these regions, issuing in a new era of stability. And he’s not the only one.\n\nEconomic Stability is on People’s Minds\n\nBefore Bitcoin was even a twinkling in Nakamoto’s eye, the people of Latin America suffered at the hands of extreme inflation and wild swings in the value of their assets and currencies. Regional fiat currencies, like Venezuela’s bolivar, experience drastic inflation at an unpredictable rate, resulting in widespread poverty throughout the nation. Of the economic problems in Latin America, Cuende explains that they, “have been so sustained over decades, that it’s easy for people to relate to what’s going on in cryptocurrency, that governments shouldn’t determine how much your money’s worth.”\n\nCryptocurrencies, by design, are able to withstand economic turmoil. This results in a more stable store of value, unaffected by the whims of a central authority like a government or bank, and protects the integrity of savings and transactions. The governments throughout Latin America have turned their backs on their citizens for decades; cryptocurrencies give the people an opportunity to fight back. “We don’t really need permission from the banks or the governments to move this forward,” Luis says of cryptocurrency adoption, “and so what’s going to happen is that people are going to start using cryptocurrencies more and more and they are going to self-organize and maybe self-govern. I think it’s pretty organic.”\n\nIf you think about fiat currencies, you see crazy changes in value because governments can print whenever they want to, but it happens the opposite with crypto and it’s so funny because it can only grow in value – there is no other outcome at all.\n\nGlobal Support for Bitcoin\n\nRecently, the United Nations released a report detailing the possibility for using cryptocurrencies as a means for de-risking financial systems in the Caribbean. This is just the latest in a series of research reports, investigations, and calls for information surrounding blockchain, all focused on delivering international aid and improving global economies. The Caribbean report boils down to three primary options:\n\nThe adoption of Bitcoin or another fully-encrypted, private,commodity-like currency The use of permissioned blockchains operated by a consortium of institutions The institution of Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\n\n\n\nThough utilizing a permissioned blockchain or central bank issued digital currency are viable courses of action, Luis discussed how these options miss the point of cryptocurrency and therefore would be ineffective as solutions in Latin America. “What matters most, especially in Latin America, is the accountability part… I would love if they use the actual blockchain. That kind of accountability is what Latin America needs for fighting corruption.”\n\nGlobal Economic Stability & The Future of Blockchain\n\nWith the United Nations and the European Union being added to the ever-growing list of governments and corporations actively pursuing blockchain technology, the likelihood of cryptocurrency-based global solutions is increasing each day. As the total market capitalization for digital currencies surpasses $90 billion, it comes as no surprise that eyes are turning to this emerging technology. Dubai, Zimbabwe, Norway, Delaware; as more governments turn to blockchain, it’s only a matter of time before the nations of Latin America do as well. However, as Luis said, if the governments and banks don’t implement these changes, the people are in a position to do it themselves.\n\n“You have governments and banks who have a lot of power and they’re noticing what’s happening… we’re seeing that now, banks getting into the cryptocurrency space, and I think that trend is only going to accelerate.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

But more worrying is the digital tsunami poised to engulf us, as machine intelligence and a rising tech elite radically restructure life as we know it\n\nThose who mistakenly thought 2016 was an anomaly, a series of unprecedented events, should have few remaining doubts. Marine Le Pen may have stuttered but still picked up almost 11 million votes. Her opponent, the “normal” candidate, was leader of a party only one year old. The ongoing terror attacks, fake news panic, Trump’s tweets and James Comey: last year never really ended, it just carried straight on into this one.\n\nAfter decades of exaggerated prediction, the internet is finally transforming politics, but not in the way the digital prophets expected. The 90s, you may recall, were awash with optimism about our online future: limitless information and total connection would make us more informed, less bigoted and kinder citizens. But the internet is an overwhelming mess of competing facts, claims, blogs, data, propaganda, misinformation, investigative journalism, charts, different charts, commentary and reportage. It’s not the slow and careful politicians who have thrived in this busy environment, it’s the people with the shareable cut-through messages. Donald Trump might very well be the first truly social-media politician: his emotion-filled, simplistic blasts are perfect for the medium.\n\nAs a result, society is currently gripped by a curious consensus: that the internet has conspired with rightwing populists to sew up the future of politics. Noting the emergence of populist strongmen and demagogues, who seem to be digital wizards like recovering Twitter addict Trump, and violent opponents who seem only to bolster their support, many are comparing – with a certain grim fascination – our current turbulence with the 1930s. That is a very short-term view of things. The supremacy of the populist right is not the inevitable future. The rise of the right is better seen as an early skirmish in a much longer, and far more significant, technology-led restructuring of our politics and society. Digital technology has helped the populist right for now, but it will soon swallow them up, along with many other political movements unable or unwilling to see how the world is changing.\n\nConsider for a moment how your life has changed thanks to digital technology. You can become friends with 2 billion connected people, chose your own news, and watch/date/order whatever you want, on demand. Infinite choice and control is now the norm, and yet formal politics has barely evolved since the days of Robert Peel. Our modern political system came of age in the industrial revolution, which was a time of massive organisations and centralised control. We are now, however, firmly in a new industrial revolution, characterised by endless choice, digital technology, data, automation and artificial intelligence. The economy, identity, political allegiances, perhaps even the essence of what it is to be human, are all starting to change, and our politics will have to change with it. The current set-up, including the populist right, will cling on for a while, like a legacy IT system that’s too pricey to update, but it will shortly become redundant.\n\nCrypto-anarchy is taking over the world – millions now unwittingly rely on it for online security\n\nSo what else might follow?\n\nIn October last year, while researching my new book, Radicals, I was invited by a Slovenian hacker in his late 20s called Pavol to a place called Parallel Polis, a three-storey building in Prague that includes a 3D printer workshop and the “Institute of Crypto-Anarchy”. Crypto-anarchists are mostly computer-hacking, anti-state libertarians who have been kicking around the political fringes for two decades, trying to warn a mostly uninterested public about the dangers of a world where everything is connected and online. They also believe that digital technology, provided citizens are able to use encryption themselves, is the route to a stateless paradise, since it undermines government’s ability to monitor, control and tax its people. Crypto-anarchists build software – think of it as political computer code – that can protect us online. Julian Assange is a crypto-anarchist (before WikiLeaks he was an active member of the movement’s most important mailing list), and so perhaps is Edward Snowden. Once the obsessive and nerdy kids in school, they are now the ones who fix your ransomware blunder or start up unicorn tech firms. They are the sort of people who run the technology that runs the world.\n\nParallel Polis was putting on something called the Hackers Congress; a three-day gathering for Europe’s collection of crypto-anarchists, bitcoin enthusiasts, libertarians and hackers. The theme was Decentralised. “The concept of authoritative state is gradually becoming obsolete,” read the programme. “The rise of sharing economies with reputation models, digital contracts and cryptocurrencies makes the role of central governments useless.” The congress was designed to work out how to speed up its demise.\n\nWhen I arrived early on Saturday morning, the whole place was teeming with (mostly) men in their 20s or early 30s speaking in competent Atlantic English. The 3D printer whirred in the background, postcards of the elusive creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, were being sold, and eyes stared at lines of the incomprehensible language of computers: java, ruby, C++. At events and clusters, groups of these future-dwellers complained about inefficiency as if it were a cardinal sin; discussed “how to build a stateless world”; praised Edward Snowden; laughed about crap government IT; weighed up the latest anonymous and secure messaging apps; and talked excitedly about bitcoin and something called “blockchain”. Frank and Smuggler – two German crypto-anarchists – wore facemasks all weekend, because they were worried about facial recognition technology.\n\nI hadn’t eaten since I left London, so the first thing I did on arrival was join the queue for food and coffee. But my Czech currency, koruna, which I had dutifully exchanged at the airport at near criminal rates, was not accepted. “We only take bitcoin,” said the assistant. Parallel Polis is the one place in the world that accepts only bitcoin. In case you don’t know yet, bitcoin is a digital currency. It is secure, pseudonymous, and fast, with no central authority controlling value or supply. It’s a currency that operates independently of the government, and can’t easily be traced back to individuals or taxed. At Polis the staff are paid in bitcoin; rent collected for their co-working space is paid in bitcoin, too. I got a little plastic card with a QR code, and transferred bitcoin on to it using one of the three specialised ATM machines. From that point on, every time I wanted anything I scanned the QR code. Ping! A coffee. Ping! A Red Bull. Ping! Some goulash. Ping! A postcard of Edward Snowden. I didn’t use koruna once.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Parralel Polis in Prague, HQ of the Institute of Cryptoanarchy.\n\nGiven a bitcoin was worth around £300 back then, and is now trading at close to £2,000, my cup of coffee cost approximately £25 in today’s money. Some of the staff have probably now retired. A few years ago crypto-anarchists like these were the only people using bitcoin. Even though it’s now used by millions of people, and accepted at a growing number of businesses as a legitimate form of money, it was originally designed by a crypto-anarchist as a neat way of undermining central bank’s control over the money supply. It is a revolutionary idea wrapped up as efficiency gain. Bitcoin is more than a currency, it’s a new way of handling information. It uses blockchain, which is a technique to create a massive, distributed, tamper-proof database that anyone can add to but no one can delete, because no one controls it. Millions of pounds of investment are pouring into bitcoin and blockchain from governments, banks, IT and financial services, all excitedly eyeing up a novel way to store information or prove asset ownership securely. Specialists reckon it’s as revolutionary as the internet itself.\n\nCrypto-anarchy is taking over the world, since millions now unwittingly rely on it for online security, and more are scrambling after blockchain and bitcoin ideas, desperate not to be left behind. At Parallel Polis the idea of wholesale adoption of crypto-anarchism by society is met with shrugged shoulders and obviously-they-have smirks. That governments, businesses and friendly liberal types are falling over themselves to import exciting new tech that has been explicitly designed to undermine them is a bit of an inside joke. Most of us chase their latest shiny toys and have no real understanding of what we’re doing.\n\nThe rise of crypto-anarchism might be good news for individual users – and there are plenty working on ways of using this technology for decent social purposes – but it’s also bad news for governments. It’s not a direct path, but digital technology tends to empower the individual at the expense of the state. Police forces complain they can’t keep up with new forms of online crime, partly because of the spread of freely available encryption tools. Information of all types – secrets, copyright, creative content, illegal images – is becoming increasingly difficult to contain and control. The rash of ransomware is certainly going to get worse, exposing the fragility of our always connected systems. (It’s easily available to buy on the dark net, a network of hidden websites that are difficult to censor and accessed with an anonymous web browser.) Who knows where this might end. A representative from something called “Bitnation” explained to Parallel Polis how an entire nation could one day be provided online via an uncontrollable, uncensorable digital network, where groups of citizens could club together to privately commission public services. Bitnation’s founder, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, hopes Bitnation could one day replace the nation state and rid us of bureaucrats, creating “a world of a million competing digital nations”, as she later told me.\n\nDigital technology, like bitcoin, is a disruptive force of decentralisation, tearing down settled hierarchies\n\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg. As the theme of the congress suggests, digital technology, like bitcoin, is a disruptive force of decentralisation. It tears down settled hierarchical organisations and builds new networked ones (although, like Facebook, they can sometimes end up becoming very centralised too). Social media is “many to many” communication, rather than “one to many” broadcast. “Sharing economy” companies such as Uber and Airbnb are all about linking people and assets via smartphones. Even the internet itself is designed to be distributed, borderless and difficult to control.\n\nThat decentralising force is sweeping through society and economies and the affects are difficult to predict. The most fun to be had at Parallel Polis was guessing which industries would be “Ubered” next – that is, transformed into a peer-to-peer industry conducted on an app. Several companies are already monetising unused assets: borrowing cars (RelayRides), daily tasks (TaskRabbit), lending bikes (Liquid), lending money (Lending Club), home wifi (Fon) and even clothes (Neighborgoods). The conclusion at Parallel Polis – and indeed in Silicon Valley – is that any industry that takes a cut of a deal between two people or holds fixed assets that can be provided informally will be soon “Ubered”, because smartphones link buyers and sellers directly. Personally, I think estate agents might be next.\n\nThese so-called sharing economy companies proudly disrupt entire industries in the name of efficiency. Politics is struggling to keep up, and regulators aren’t always sure what rules apply to them. Uber, the largest taxi firm in the world without owning any taxis, runs gig-economy comprising temporary, zero-hour employees. It works well for consumers and some drivers, but the cost of flexibility is job security and legal rights – in addition to squeezing existing industries such as London’s black cabs. The Treasury reckons this gig economy could one day cost it a small fortune in tax.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest German crypto-arnarchists Smuggler, left, and Frank wore masks at the Hackers Congress weekend for fear of facial recognition technology. Photograph: Down the Deep, Dark Web/Zygote Films\n\nSpending time in Parallel Polis is like peering into the not too distant future and seeing the approaching disruption. Shortly after I emerged from the Tardis I watched Donald Trump get elected with tweets about borders and coal mines and reopened factories. He tapped into legitimate worries that many felt and feel, and correctly fingered the stagnating wages of middle America (in part a result of technological changes). But it all felt somehow marginal, a sticking plaster for what’s coming. Most people at Parallel Polis thought the US election was a bit of an irrelevance.\n\nEven in the short time since Trump’s victory, an even bigger technology challenge has loomed into view: artificial intelligence. Forget angry marching robots or some absurd “singularity”, whereby computers become sentient. The AI revolution is taking the boring form of machine-learning algorithms, which essentially means giving a machine lots of examples from which it learns what to do. Give it enough data and it can start doing things better, and faster, than humans. And because machine learning relies on data to improve, there is a powerful feedback loop: more data fed in makes it smarter, which allows it to get more data, which makes it smarter, which…\n\nIn the past couple of years we’ve entered this self-perpetuating loop. Brace yourself for a run of stories about machines doing jobs better than unreliable, break-taking, tardy Homo sapiens. Already this year software has trounced humans at fruit-picking, bricklaying and burger-flipping. That you’re probably not surprised by this remarkable feat shows how far we’ve come. It will very shortly move on to less routine and even very skilled work that takes years for a human to master. Already machine-learning software can outperform the top doctors at diagnosing illness from CT scans, by running through millions of correct and thousands of incorrect examples real live doctors have produced over the years.\n\nWhether this machine-learning revolution means fewer jobs, more jobs, worse jobs or different jobs is hard to predict. More jobs in the short term and fewer in the long term seems most likely: according to the Bank of England, as many as 15 million British jobs might disappear from the twin forces of AI and automation within a generation. At the very least it will mean disruption for people and some entire industries, twinned with sudden shifts in labour and skills needs. Take trucking in the US, which is the biggest employer in 10 states, responsible for 3.5 million jobs. It may be a mostly job-free industry within a decade. Things will still be shifted around in containers of course, but it’ll all be run by yet another software firm that rents human-free cabs. And with that, there will be no need for truck stops either, or the highway patrol, or the companies that make parts for radar guns, and so on and on.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Delegates at the Hackers Congress 2016 discuss bitcoin, blockchain and points between Photograph: https://liberate.hcpp.cz/\n\nIf large numbers of the tax-paying classes disappear, or are reduced to precarious freelances, what happens? The techno-optimist – the one that bounced around the Parallel Polis echo-chamber – says we’ll create new jobs, free people from the drudgery of dull work and all arc toward progress and freedom. The stock solution will doubtless be for the hapless to retrain for better, more creative, more meaningful jobs, putting aside the dubious evidence for whether that actually works – retrain for what exactly? The best we appear capable of at the moment is software programming and coding. But coding will probably be one of the first jobs to be automated out of existence, leaving the newly trained feeling like Minidisc specialists circa 2005: the exciting new future washed away before it could settle in.\n\nNo one in Prague or Silicon Valley or Shoreditch or anywhere else is willing or able to put the brakes on, which is why Parallel Polis people were excitedly discussing the “universal basic income”, essentially a way to pay economically useless people to live, consume and keep capitalism ticking over. Perhaps that will work – it is seriously worth debating – and perhaps new jobs will arrive too. But also possible is a dystopia in which millions of economically valueless citizens scratch out an existence as a client class while a small number of tech mega-monopolies and crypto-anarchist geniuses rack up unprecedented wealth and influence. No one really knows where this ends up.\n\nAt present, technology stands outside the messy business of politics, but in a couple of elections’ time, AI, big tech, the sharing economy, will be discussed as angrily as immigration or the NHS now. Does anyone seriously believe that Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May or Tim Farron or Nicola Sturgeon have the foggiest clue about any of this, and what to do about it? (I’ve not even mentioned climate change, synthetic biology, the continued mass movement of people, billions of connected internet-enabled devices.) To most politicians – even the left, which once imagined that its “white heat” would forge a better world – technology is mainly viewed as a job creator or deliverer of efficiency. The phrase “centre of innovation” is the digital equivalent of motherhood and apple-pie: no right-minded politician could ever oppose it. True, things are slowly changing and there’s more about digital technology in this round of manifestos than ever before: the Conservatives promise a digital charter, the Lib Dems mention artificial intelligence, and Jeremy Corbyn launched a special “digital manifesto” last year. Maybe I’m expecting too much, and maybe citizens don’t care enough either. But none of this yet amounts to a vision that matches the scale of what’s going on.\n\nAnd what of the populist right – with their focus on culture, borders, immigration, and sticking it to the establishment? When asked about the future of artificial intelligence and automation, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin replied: “It’s not even on our radar screen” and that he’s “not worried at all”. A few weeks ago his boss climbed into a huge rig wearing an “I love trucks” badge, just as nearly everyone in Silicon Valley agreed that artificial intelligence was about to decimate the industry. Trump might be able to stop the immigrants or slow outsourcing for a while, but who will stop the robots and the smiling data scientist? The little Trumps – Le Pen, Farage, Wilders etc– aren’t much better. Their concern with burqas and bankers means technology, the real driving force in society today, isn’t in their sights. The one MP that actually understood bitcoin, Douglas Carswell, recently resigned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Okonomiyaki Robot cooks a traditional Japanese pancake: it has 15 joints, can take verbal orders from customers and use standard kitchen utensils. Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters\n\nThe politics of rightwing populism won’t go without a colossal struggle of course, because it is, in part at least, a reaction to changes digital technology has already wrought. In the short term it might even strengthen: if the walls don’t keep people out, promises aren’t kept, wages stagnate, jobs don’t reappear, taxes don’t get raised, then disappointment fuels disillusion and we enter a spiral of ever-deepening radicalism. But the collapse of the centre ground of politics, into which noisy populists have barged, is also creating room for others: the French leftist politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon (and his deliciously pointless 100% income tax rate on top earners), Bernie Sanders, Podemos, Occupy, the Women’s Equality party. In Italy, comedian Beppe Grillo’s internet-based Five Star Movement defies placement on the left-right political spectrum, and is currently leading in Italian polls.\n\nThings are opening up in politics. So perhaps a better comparison than the 1930s for our age is the 1820s. That period witnessed what must have felt at the time like unprecedented change and confusion: the onset of industrialisation, political revolution and counter-revolution, great leaps in science, and the first railways. A British prime minister was assassinated. Luddites smashed machines, fearing that the power loom – that generation’s artificial intelligence – would cause mass unemployment. But the turmoil and instability of the last industrial revolution did not thrust us inexorably into the arms of tyrants. It did however shake up old assumptions as never before, stimulating a flowering of ideas, some of which were stirrings of the modern world: working-class consciousness, extended (albeit still limited) suffrage, Factory Acts, socialist theory, Catholic emancipation and utilitarianism.\n\nAt some point, and probably sooner than we think, the current left and right offerings of the major parties, including (perhaps especially) the populist, will start to appear ludicrous and unworkable. New political movements and ideas will arrive before long for this industrial revolution, especially once the majority of the population will soon have grown up online. It will be a politics that offers solutions to the challenges society will face, and be bold enough to steer technology rather than be led by it, to harness it rather than dismiss it, to see it as a motor of social change, not just a job maker. Perhaps there will be some back-to-the-earth, off-grid thinking reminiscent of the 1970s. (There are already small hints of it if you look in the right places: bricks through Google bus windows and digital detox days). I’m not sure. More likely is that groups like the Prague crypto-anarchists, who will embrace the changes and experiment with entirely new forms of governance and society, will emerge. After all, they were right about digital technology, about surveillance and bitcoin and most of us ignored them. And for better of worse, I think they’re probably right about this too.\n\n• Radicals: Outsiders Changing the World by Jamie Bartlett is published by William Heinemann (£20).

The system is not without its flaws however – centralization of validators is an issue, and so is the token distribution.\n\nBut while both are interesting topics, with the recent meteoric rise in XRP price, I think it's worth focusing on that part of the discussion.\n\nBasics of Ripple and XRPs\n\nRipple is a crypto 2.0 system launched in late 2012. It is based on a protocol predating bitcoin by a few years, known as Ripplepay. As any good crypto 2.0 network, Ripple allows its users to issue and transact in any currency. It also supports its own native currency – ripples, or XRPs.\n\nXRPs have a few key uses on the ripple network. They are used to pay transaction fees, and are required as reserves for any address using the network and creating trust lines. All in all, it serves as an anti-spam measure for the network. Moreover, since every account on the Ripple network can accept XRPs, it is also promoted as a bridge currency.\n\nIOUs are user-created currencies. While any address can issue their own currency, most people will be using IOUs issued by gateways. Those will usually be denominated in fiat or crypto. The IOUs can be traded directly on the network, sent from one user to another, and even perform atomic, multi-currency bounces in a single transaction.\n\nThere are a few key differences between XRPs and IOUs. IOUs have a counterparty risk: if the issuing gateway defaults, the tokens will be worthless. You can only send IOUs to or through people that also trust the same gateway. The gateways usually charge a small percentage fee on every transaction. IOU transactions are a bit bigger and more complicated, meaning they can cost more to execute. XRPs are their own cryptocurrency, meaning they are not redeemable for anything directly.\n\nBeyond that, the Ripple network handles both XRPs and IOUs identically: both can be traded on the decentralised exchange built into the network, both can be part of multi-currency transactions, both operate at the same speed and they are both highly divisible.\n\nCriticism of XRPs\n\nThe main criticism levelled at XRPs, and thus also against the Ripple network, is the way the XRPs were distributed. Ripple Labs, the creators of Ripple, created the network with 100bn XRPs in it, and no new XRPs have been created since the its inception. This is not an unknown practice in the crypto space – a lot of networks 'pre-mine' their tokens.\n\nHowever, the network creators usually only keep a fraction of the tokens for themselves, pre-selling the rest to anyone that wishes to buy some. Ripple, however, still owns about 60% of the originally issued tokens. This raises a few issues.\n\nFirst, the company could try cashing out and potentially crash the market. It is very unlikely, however. Ripple has recently taken steps to promote its XRP market and put the majority of their XRPs into an escrow (then again, the escrow is unlocking 1bn XRP every month for the next ~4.5 years, so it could be better).\n\nSecondly, since the network fees are paid through 'burning' XRPs, they essentially enrich everyone in proportion to the amount of XRPs they hold (if 1% of the tokens got burned, the remaining tokens would be worth about 1% more provided the market doesn't change). This means Ripple Labs is essentially earning 60% of all network fees on the network. This probably doesn't amount to much at the current time, but it may be more important in the future.\n\nLastly, the amount of XRPs owned by one company gives it a negative reputation. A lot of people in the crypto space dismiss Ripple outright as a 'pre-mined scamcoin' just because of the amount of coins owned by Ripple.\n\nAll in all, that isn't too damning, really. Ripple appears to be reputable enough not to try cashing out of what appears to be their golden goose. However, they are not the only major players around...\n\nThe founders of Ripple, Jed McCaleb, Chris Larsen and Arthur Britto, gave themselves 20bn XRPs early on. This later came to bite Ripple. McCaleb left the team to start his own version of Ripple called Stellar, and decided to sell his XRP stash, resulting in a legal kerfuffle, a settlement and a schedule for how those coins may be sold.\n\nIf those numbers are correct, McCaleb is still cashing out $20,000 per week, and come ~2019, he will be able to cash out 750m XRP (worth ~$256m at today's price of $0.34 USD/XRP). Not an ideal situation if the money from your network will be going to a former employee building your direct competitor to the tune of a quarter of billion dollars. While some of those funds might go to charity, that's still not an ideal outcome.\n\nNow that we've dealt with most of the issues XRPs have had to face, let's have a look at how they fare on their own network.\n\nXRPs vs IOUs\n\nWhile Ripple, the network, has to compete with bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrency networks, XRPs, the currency, have another important competitor – the rest of the assets on the Ripple network. Some networks, like NXT or Counterparty, ensure their native token is at the centre of every trade – you can't trade IOUs for one another on those networks.\n\nIn Ripple, you can transact purely in IOUs all day, every day, without touching XRPs for anything else than the fees. This ties to the central value proposition of XRPs – being the universal medium of exchange.\n\nThe following graph is meant to illustrate how a distributed currency network compares to XRP as medium of exchange.\n\nIn short, the problem is as follows. If you have many different currencies on the network, you can have potentially a very large number of markets between those currencies (mathematically, twice as many markets as there are currencies).\n\nThis means you would have to have a lot of market makers providing liquidity to every market. However, if everyone agreed to use XRPs as the common currency, you would only need to make one market per currency – between that currency and XRP.\n\nAt the moment, it looks like that is the case – the major markets on the Ripple network are all trading XRPs for the various currencies issued on the network. At the time of writing, $11m-worth of trades and $88m-worth of payments have been executed on the Ripple network in the last 24 hours, majority of which were using XRPs.\n\nThe main advantages given for XRPs being better than IOUs are:\n\nXRPs are acceptable by anyone on the Ripple network\n\nThere are no extra transfer or trade fees on XRPs\n\nXRPs have no counterparty risk.\n\nHowever, there are also some drawbacks to XRPs, even not counting the coin distribution and centralization. Just because someone can receive XRPs, doesn't mean they'll want to settle in XRPs. The network just essentially forces everyone to have an unlimited trust line to XRPs, even if they wouldn't want to hold them.\n\nXRPs might be a decent universal currency for people that want to hold XRPs, but that might not be ideal for banks or big institutions.\n\nThat's why we see networks like Corda, or even Interledger Protocol (also developed by Ripple Labs), that don't rely on a native cryptocurrency gaining traction, while the best example of a real-world application relying on a crypto token in the middle is Abra. Creating a universal, international settlement currency was the idea behind bitcoin, and you don't really see banks using it for that cause.\n\nMarket making essentially boils down to either trading the currency like any other crypto, or copying the market from another source to offset your trades. The amount of liquidity you could copy with XRPs is small in comparison to the nigh-on bottomless FX market from the real world. If you are going to see real-world use cases being deployed on Ripple, they are more likely to be leveraging the existing FX markets, rather than going through XRPs.\n\nWhile XRPs have no counterparty risk, they also have no counterparty protection. If anyone steals your XRPs, they are gone. With IOUs, you can still appeal to the issuing gateway to halt the transaction and potentially track down where it was withdrawn to. The IOUs are thus much less of a target.\n\nOn a similar note, XRPs are much harder to track, which would make them less appealing from a compliance standpoint. Gateways on the other hand can whitelist and blacklist addresses that can use their IOUs, thus having an easier time identifying anyone that uses their IOUs.\n\nIf the value of a given currency changes, you only need to adjust the market using that currency. If XRPs were the universal currency against which all of the currencies would be traded, any time the value of XRPs would fluctuate, you'd have to adjust the entire market.\n\nAdding a new currency to the distributed IOU network wouldn't necessarily mean you'd have to trade it against every other currency. You could only start trading it against the most popular currency or a few currencies that are easy to make the market for (say, fiatUSD, fiatEUR). Because you can easily execute multi-currency atomic transactions on the network, connecting to even one other currency connected to the network instantly means you are connected to the rest of the network.\n\nXRPs have no transfer fees attached to them. While is possible for a gateway to issue IOUs without transaction fees (that's essentially Tether's business model, but on another network), perhaps even leveraging some other big crypto like bitcoin or ethereum through voting pools, the fees on those IOUs can always be changed.\n\nIt seems that the network standard for transfer fees is about 0.2%, which seems to be smaller than the spread on XRP's biggest market (at the time of writing, 0.00015086 sell, 0.00015003 buy, giving about 0.55% spread). So, it is possible that by sending money through a very liquid FX market you would pay less in transfer fees than going through a less liquid XRP market on just the spread.\n\nSo this leaves XRPs with their primary role: paying transaction fees and fulfilling the needed reserves. All in all, about 50–100 XRPs per person or account would be enough for a lifetime of usage. That used to be less than $1, and now is about $35.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Ripple network is a very useful crypto 2.0 tool.\n\nHowever, because of the high flexibility and value propositions of the IOUs on the Ripple network, they are XRP's main competitor in its home court. While XRPs are still needed to pay the network fees, most of the remaining value prepositions can be seen as overstated.\n\nThe recent rise in the price of XRPs appears to be largely relying on market speculation (as is the case for all crypto) and a new exchange coming on the market.\n\nThis article originally appeared on the author's blog and has been republished here with permission.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership in Ripple, the company that overseas the open-source Ripple Consensus Ledger.\n\nWater ripples image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Even after the bubble popped, bitcoin was still worth billions.\n\nThis intrigued me because true Ponzi schemes have zero value when they crash.\n\nThe fact that bitcoin was still attracting buyers even after the onslaught of negative news… an 85% price crash… and universal scorn… said something to me.\n\nIt said that maybe this asset had real value. At the very least, it told me that more investigation was needed.\n\nI’ve seen skepticism like this before…Lessons From the Dot-Com Bubble\n\nBack in May 1997, Amazon went public at the split equivalent of $1.30.\n\nAmazon shot up to $113 during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. When the bubble popped, Amazon crashed 94%—to the split equivalent of $5.97.\n\nBut again, something interesting happened…\n\nIn the depths of the dot-com hatred, Amazon started quietly climbing in price. Back then, I made the mistake of dismissing this action.\n\nMy error was buying into the prevailing belief that dot-com stocks were dumb and worthless.\n\nI listened to the narrative instead of digging deeper into the Amazon story.\n\nThat was a mistake of lazy thinking.\n\nSo when I saw the same thing happen with bitcoin, I decided to do something different.\n\nInstead of listening to the skeptics, I asked myself: “Why are people still buying this supposedly worthless asset?”\n\nThat’s when I did a deep dive into bitcoin.\n\nI traveled all over the world interviewing experts, development teams, and venture capitalists. I wanted to understand why bitcoin had value.\n\nEven Governments Are Embracing Bitcoin\n\nJust as important, I wanted to know what would stop the U.S. government from banning it.\n\nHow would the currency outgrow its widespread reputation as a form of “black money” used by criminals?\n\nWhat I found out was this: At its core, bitcoin is just a way to send and receive value without the need for a trusted middleman.\n\nBitcoin has no central location. That means no government (including the U.S. government) can ever shut it down.\n\nIn fact, several countries have already tried to ban bitcoin and found that it was impossible.\n\nAt least two of them (Russia and India) have decided to recognize bitcoin as money.\n\nGovernments are realizing that it’s better to have a hand in how bitcoin is shaped and regulated than try to destroy it (which they can’t).\n\nThink back to when the U.S. government finally realized that prohibition was unenforceable. Better to regulate alcohol and tax it.\n\nThe real strength of bitcoin is the underlying network of highly secure computers that support it (called the blockchain).Where’s the Future Value?\n\nThis is where much of the value creation will come from.\n\nAs I write, software developers across the world are building applications designed to piggyback off this network.\n\nOver the next three years, we’ll begin to see a slew of new applications emerge for bitcoin and the network that supports it.\n\nThey will support everything from asset tracking to recording land registries.\n\nAnd much more that we can’t even think of yet.\n\nThat’s why bitcoin will continue to grow in value.\n\nSince those obituaries started popping up in 2011, bitcoin has rocketed from a low of 75 cents to as high as $2,770—an astronomical 369,223% gain.\n\nThe next time you find yourself being scared out of owning bitcoin by a negative article, do yourself a favor… Read the last 129 times bitcoin was declared dead.\n\nEditor’s Note: Teeka Tiwari has put together the ultimate asymmetric trade bundle of cryptocurrencies.

06/05/2017,"['It is getting increasingly difficult to find a mid-tier Radeon RX graphics card with a Polaris chip underneath the hood. That includes AMD\'s newer Radeon RX 580 or Radeon RX 570 parts. Both are in short supply with most online listings showing the product ""out of stock."" The blame isn\'t squarely on AMD, though, as AMD\'s latest Polaris cards are proving popular among cryptocurrency miners.\n\nAs PCWorld notes, you can find some Radeon RX 580/570 cards in stock if you look hard enough, though in many cases they are selling at inflated price tags. That is even the case with first-run Polaris cards—a look at Newegg shows just a handful of Radeon RX 480 cards in stock, but they\'re selling for around $640. It\'s a sour situation for anyone who wants a mid-range card using the latest silicon and who is not willing to wait for Vega.\n\nThe folks at Computer Base did some digging at Computex to find out why the newer cards are so difficult to find. Several of AMD\'s hardware partners responded that after things remained relatively quiet in the cryptocurrency community of the last several months, miners came in droves and snatched all the cards up.\n\nCryptocurrency participants can use graphics cards to ""mine"" various coins, which can be traded for Bitcoin, which can then be sold for actual cash. The result is that with the right GPU, you could potentially earn enough to pay for the hardware in a matter of months. Apparently this caught AMD off guard, though it is not the first time something like this has happened. Toward the end of 2013, Bitcoin and Litecoin miners caused a similar shortage by snagging every Radeon graphics card they could collectively get their hands on.\n\nOver the past few years, ASIC hardware built specifically for mining has become the next big thing, but newer hashing algorithms, like Ethereum\'s DaggerHashimoto or ZCash\'s Equihash, have made GPU mining profitable again. These newer hashing algorithms are somewhat resistant to ASIC hardware, plus it takes time to build an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) that will work well. Hence why cryptocurrency miners are once again turning to graphics cards. And the recent jump in Ethereum and Bitcoin prices has only fueled the flames.\n\nSix RX 570 GPUs, doing nothing at all related to gaming.\n\nAMD\'s hardware partners are not thrilled with the situation. While they appreciate the initial flurry of sales, companies such as Sapphire and PowerColor that only sell GPUs from AMD fear that ongoing delays could lead customers to look for alternative cards from other manufacturers. There\'s also the fear that cryptocurrency miners aren\'t gamers, so long-term this hurts AMD\'s position in the gaming world.\n\nOne final note is that while in the past Nvidia hardware was generally worse for mining, to the point where it was largely ignored, that\'s no longer the case. In the modern cryptocurrency environment there are enough hashing algorithms that Nvidia cards can nearly equal AMD in terms of profitability. Ethereum has been the main reason for increasing AMD graphics card prices, but ZCash and LBRY could do the same to Nvidia. A 1060 can do about 21MH/s on Ethereum compared to 26MH/s on a 570, but it uses less power and currently costs less, so....\n\nIf you are interested in cryptocurrency mining, our resident GPU expert Jarred offers this piece of advice. Gaming products are inherently targeting a different workload than crypto hashing. Mining is a 24/7, 100 percent usage workload, which can push power use, temperatures, and fan speeds to levels you wouldn\'t normally see while gaming. There\'s a reason Nvidia and AMD have professional GPUs designed for machine learning that run at lower clockspeeds than gaming cards. The GPUs are clocked so they can run heavy workloads 24/7, but they cost too much to be viable for cryptocurrency mining. Long-term, then, you\'re safer underclocking/undervolting and losing a bit of mining performance by dropping clockspeeds and temperatures, rather than burning out fans every 6-12 months.', ""The price of bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nThe market average has risen to as high as $2,911.86 as of press time, BPI data shows, surpassing the previous all-time high of $2,791.69 set on 25th May.\n\nBitcoin prices began the month below $2,500, according to the BPI, trading as low as $2,330.23 on 1st June.

Here logos are displayed at the Inside Bitcoins conference and trade show in New York. Mark Lennihan AP', 'New York City\n\nAbout a dozen rain-soaked people were crammed between the revolving doors and security barriers in the lobby of New York University’s Stern School of Business as torrents pelted down outside. All desperately wanted in to the hottest ticket in town, one that promised to make some of them overnight millionaires, if not billionaires. Among them was Dan Morehead, a former Wall Street titan turned bitcoin investor, and a dentist working on a blockchain startup who had flown in from Seoul.\n\n“I don’t really care that you overbooked, it’s not my problem! I don’t care about a refund,” one agitated man seeking entry barked at two T-shirt clad twentysomethings on the other side, one of them clutching a clipboard.\n\n“You can be upset and raise your voice, but we can’t change anything,” one of the gatekeepers replied.\n\n“We have three clients down there!” another man interjected.\n\nThe clipboard holder dutifully scribbled down names. When it was my turn, she said NYU wanted to clear out the huddled mass blocking the building’s entrance: “The auditorium holds like 470 people. We have more than 500 people down there right now. NYU is calling security.”\n\nInside, a conference called “Token Summit” was in full swing. The event was the first to focus on a rapidly snowballing phenomenon called cryptocurrency token offerings—a new fundraising method that allows companies to raise millions of dollars in mere minutes.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world has gone mad for token offerings. These launches, popularly known as ICOs or initial coin offerings, have already raised more than $150 million this year, according to research firm Smith + Crown. They are seen as a disruptive new mechanism that could displace traditional venture capitalists from the fund raising process—a view that’s been endorsed by a coterie of brand name VCs themselves—and remake the internet’s business model with decentralized applications and cryptocurrencies. Take an outfit known as Gnosis, a decentralized prediction market, which raised $12 million in under 15 minutes, valuing it at $300 million. Investors had invested based solely on a PDF prepared by its founders (recently a firm called Brave raised $35 million in 30 seconds).\n\nAmount raised in token sales. (Smith + Crown)\n\nAs cryptocurrency prices exploded, ICO fever gripped the over 2,700 blockchain tech enthusiasts who descended on New York in late May for a series of back-to-back industry conferences. Rumors flew about the fortunes being made, as the cryptocurrency ethereum climbed from $127 per unit of ether at the start of the week to $228 by Thursday. The head of an ethereum app development shop was said to hold 6 million ether, meaning he went from being a mere millionaire on Monday to an ether billionaire, holding $1.4 billion worth of the stuff, three days later. “Out of the 2,700 attendees there were at least 500 millionaires, and between zero to five billionaires,” said one longtime observer of the cryptocurrency scene, who wanted to remain anonymous.\n\nWhy are tokens a big deal?\n\nThe oracles of Silicon Valley say token offerings could reinvent the “freemium” business model of the internet, upending the huge centralized services—think of Facebook or Google—that have emerged. Instead of enticing users with free services, paid for by venture capital, and then eventually turning a profit by showing ads to those users, tokens offer a direct channel for capital to flow between user and the technologist.\n\nThe user would pay for a token upfront, providing funds for coders to develop the promised technology. If the technology works as advertised and gains popularity, it should attract more users, thus increasing demand for the token offered at the start. As the token value increases, those early users who bought tokens will benefit from appreciating token prices. Each token offering has different rules around the total supply of tokens and when they are released.\n\n“This is a ‘better-than-free’ business model, where users make money for being early adopters,” write Balaji Srinivasan and Naval Ravikant, a partner at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz and the founder of investing platform AngelList, respectively. Ravikant has launched a platform called CoinList that will help accredited investors put money into token launches.\n\nToken offerings could also correct an imbalance in the way financial rewards are distributed among technologists. Historically, the people who develop foundational technologies, such as protocols, have watched from the sidelines as others—firms that build the applications running atop those protocols—reap the riches. The Google search engine, for instance, is an application that trawls the world wide web, which is made up of a collection of open-source protocols. Yet it’s Google’s founders who are billionaires and not Tim Berners-Lee, who came up with the protocols that made not just Google, but the entire web, possible.\n\nCryptotokens could change that because protocol creators now have a way to be rewarded for the success of their technology, without having to create a hit application on top of it. “With tokens … the creators of a protocol can ‘monetize’ it directly and will in fact benefit more as others build businesses on top of that protocol,” writes Albert Wenger, a partner at Union Square Ventures.\n\nThis is the argument behind the “fat protocol” investment thesis: the protocols of the past were “thin” and unable to accrue financial value. The application layer resting atop those protocols were the ones to reap the rewards. But cryptotokens could enable the protocols of today to become “fat”—creating more wealth and value than even the enormously successful applications of the past. “These new ‘fat protocols’ may eventually create and capture more value than the last generation of Internet companies,” Srinivasan and Ravikant write.\n\nVenture firms who subscribe to this theory have wasted no time putting their money where their mouths are. This is why firms like Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz have backed funds like Polychain Capital, which invest exclusively in token offerings. While the tokens are being raised for digital services at the moment—things like storage, identity management, or chat room stickers—one can imagine them being used for offline products and services someday in the future, too.\n\nNor are tokens limited to new projects. The chat platform Kik, with 15 million monthly active users, launched its own token last week at the conference, in the hopes of seeding an “economy built around chat (pdf).” In practice this means Kik users can earn and spend on special stickers, images, or even entry to celebrity chat rooms using the chat app’s Kin token. Unlike traditional loyalty points issued by a merchant, however, the Kin tokens are decentralized because they are issued on top of ethereum (more on that below). The Kin digital currency could exist even if the chat app vanished after issuance—although it probably wouldn’t be used very much and would be worth little.\n\nWhat are tokens, exactly?\n\nAt this stage, an explainer on what tokens are, exactly, is helpful. You can think of a token offering as a hybrid between a Kickstarter campaign and a stock market flotation. On one hand, the launch lets customers reserve a product or service before it’s completed and ready for the market—that’s the Kickstarter part. On the other hand, it also gives those customers a stake in the future of that product or service; if the service gains in popularity, the token should rise in price, enriching the original users, making it a lot like getting in on a hot IPO. However, one of those analogies puts token issuers squarely in the sights of securities regulators, so the distinction is crucial. More on that later when we discuss the legal gray area that tokens occupy.\n\nLike the rest of the cryptocurrency industry, token offerings rely on a basic circular logic: A token has as much value as its users bestow on it, just as bitcoin rises in price so long as demand outstrips supply. But token boosters say their units of digital currency are different from bitcoin in one critical respect: they are programmable, and have been coded to perform various useful functions.\n\nTokens issued today are built atop ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market. Ethereum is like bitcoin because it is a tradable digital currency, which is called ether. It’s unlike bitcoin because it was designed with its own programming language—a significant departure from, and its creators say, an upgrade over, bitcoin. This language allows people to write “smart contracts” or automatically executed agreements on ethereum. A bond, for instance, might automatically pay out its coupon, without the need for an intermediary or paperwork.\n\nIt turns out that ethereum’s programming language is powerful enough that coders can write smart contracts that issue new units of digital currency, bound by their own rules. This is what the tokens offered today are: a series of complicated ethereum smart contracts. The ethereum network itself is being used as a giant token-issuing machine. “Right now ethereum is a token factory,” says Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Blockstack, a startup working on building tools for a decentralized internet.\n\nThe circularity of cryptocurrency economics is at play again here: Ethereum itself raised capital from its users by offering ether tokens in 2014, raising $18 million. The ethereum protocol then became a staging ground for experiments in token funding: A vehicle called the Decentralized Autonomous Organization managed to raise $150 million on the promise that it would be a new form of business structure, one that automated away managers using a combination of smart contracts and tokens. It was promptly hacked for millions and flamed out spectacularly.\n\nAn ethereum-based token is to ether as a concert ticket is to a US dollar, Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at the Coin Center think tank, suggests. “In the real world we often use all sorts of items rather like we use cash,” he writes. “We use tickets, coupons … and a variety of bearer instruments because they entitle the holder to different things.” These customized tokens can be traded on secondary markets, like exchanges, and have their own value, independent of the price of ether.\n\nOrange groves and securities law\n\nWhile the potential of token launches remains vague, though powerful, almost everyone I spoke to at the New York conferences agreed on one thing: The US government would crack down on the offerings eventually. No one seems to think the good times for ICOs will last.\n\nThe legality of tokens hinges on something called the “Howey test,” named after a Florida company in the 1940s that tried to raise capital by selling contracts against its citrus groves—a practice that the US Supreme Court ruled was similar to a stock offering. At the Consensus conference, the debate about whether or not ICOs were like citrus grove contracts was captured by an exchange between Van Valkenburg, who argued that tokens are like products and not securities, and Preston Bryne, a lawyer and founder of a blockchain company called Monax.\n\n“It’s like buying gold … it’s not like buying a security in a gold mine,” said Van Valkenburg. Responded Bryne, “This is complete nonsense. Everybody knows what this is. It’s, in substance and form, the sale of investments that people are purchasing with expectation of profit at a later date.”\n\nOf course, what really matters is the regulator’s opinion. The US Securities and Exchange Commission hasn’t weighed in on the matter yet. But an SEC official who spoke at the Consensus conference, Valerie Szczepanik, who heads its unit looking at blockchain tech, sounded a note of caution, according to Reuters: “Whether or not you are regulated by the SEC, you still have fiduciary duties to your investors. If you want this industry to flourish, protection of investors should be at the forefront.”\n\nToken boosters await official intervention with a mixture of trepidation and relief. Take Stan Miroshnik, a former investment banker with Morgan Stanley who until May 31 ran a firm called Argon that corrals big investors—like cryptocurrency “whales,” adventurous family offices, and hedge funds—into token launches to ensure they’re sold out.\n\nWhen a group of coders wants to raise money for their project, Miroshnik hits Slack teams, Telegram groups, and gets press in the cryptocurrency trade media to rustle up business. “Having seen the technology boom in the 90s, this is just another emerging capital market,” he says. “It needs institutional grade providers like ourselves who come out of traditional investment banks. One day Fidelity is going to show up and say, ‘I want $4 billion of that token, help me buy it.’ You need someone who can, frankly, speak their language.”\n\nFor Miroshnik, the sooner the SEC steps in, the better. “I welcome it,” he says. “It would be helpful to figure out where the boundaries are.”\n\nThis story was updated with Stan Miroshnik’s tenure at Argon.\n\nRead this next: Bitcoin set a new price record as the industry gathers for its biggest event of the year', ""Bitcoin is closing in on record territory.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was trading up by 2.1% at $2,573 a coin as of 7:03 a.m. ET. The early advance has bitcoin on track for its best close ever. It would need to top $2,799 to put in its best print of all time.\n\nMonday's advance comes absent any real catalyst. The bid seems to be a continuation of the gains that developed late last week after China's three biggest bitcoin exchanges announced they were allowing customers to begin withdrawals for the first time since February. At the time of the ban on withdrawals, bitcoin was threatening its then-record high of $1,161 a coin before plunging by more than 10% on the news.\n\nSince then, however, bitcoin has seen a steady stream of good news. In early April, Japan announced bitcoin had become a legal payment method. Additionally, Russia's largest online retailer, Ulmart, began accepting bitcoin even though Russia said it wouldn't consider the use of the cryptocurrency until 2018.\n\nThere is still one big hurdle to climb. Back in March, the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected two bitcoin exchange-traded funds. It has since taken public comment on its decision regarding an ETF started by the Winklevoss twins, but it has not made an additional ruling.\n\nBitcoin is up 172% in 2017."", 'Mozilla via The New York Times Last week it took 30 seconds for Brendan Eich to issue about $35 million of basic attention token.\n\nNEW YORK — Forget US stocks and emerging-market assets; even ignore bitcoin. Those brave enough to invest in the Wild West of tech are the ones making a killing.\n\nWhile the record-breaking rally in bitcoin has captivated markets, demand for other digital coins is surging as companies raise millions in minutes, or even seconds, from investors wanting in on the next big tech startup. Last week it took 30 seconds for Mozilla cofounder Brendan Eich to issue about $35 million of basic attention token, the unit of exchange in a blockchain-based advertising platform built on top of the company’s Brave browser.\n\nDigital tokens tied to the blockchain platform issued this year have more than doubled in price on average since trading started, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Coins from the 15 ICOs this year for which data is available have risen by an average of over 100 percent, while shares sold in initial public offerings in the US this year have gained 13 percent on average since they started trading.\n\n‘‘There’s been overwhelming demand for coins,’’ said Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. ‘‘Sure, a lot of it is based on speculation and traders looking to make a quick gain, but there’s also a fundamental driver, which is the anticipation that the digital-currency market is maturing.’’\n\nForty-four coins have been issued this year, according to blockchain research website Smith & Crown. Not all trade immediately after the auctions since some have vesting periods. The tokens with the biggest gain, a 500 percent jump since it started trading on March 30, was issued by Edgeless, which is building a decentralized gambling platform. That sale wasn’t open to US-based investors since the company isn’t licensed to operate in the United States.\n\nPrediction market platform Gnosis sold the highest valued tokens this year.

The speculators might end up being right, and this becomes a solid investment because of the power of the technology, but we’re not at that stage.’’', ""As the Bitcoin block size debate rages, unconfirmed transactions pile up and the minimum transaction fee recommended while sending Bitcoins continues to increase, we take a look at three things taken for granted a year back, but which have been made impossible due to high transaction fees.\n\nRedeeming physical Bitcoins\n\nPhysical Bitcoins come in all shapes and sizes. Casascius coins, which were made during the initial days of Bitcoin, range from 1 BTC to 1000 BTC. Physical Bitcoins produced later hold a much smaller value of Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin chips produced by BTCC start from 1K bits (or 1 mBTC). In case you want to redeem the Bitcoins contained in the chips, it would cost you more in transaction fees. This makes the chips worthless, except as collectibles.\n\nRoger Ver expressed his frustration in a tweet stating:\n\n“Core's small block & high fee policy have now made @YourBTCC physical Bitcoins worth less than the fee to redeem them. #Irony.”\n\nSpending small change\n\nEvery transaction generates change outputs. Sometimes, these change outputs are smaller than 1 mBTC, which means that they cannot be economically included as inputs in a transaction. If they were added to a transaction, the increase in transaction fees would be greater than their value. A perusal of the outputs over a full day indicates that ~5 BTC per day of output (change or otherwise) currently cannot be economically spent.\n\nTipping\n\nIn the early days of Bitcoin, content publishers often added their Bitcoin address to their articles. People who felt that these articles were deserving often tipped the authors a small amount of Bitcoin. While this is still technically possible, it would cost you $2 in transaction fees to tip an author $1. This kills the incentive for tipping small amounts. Microtransactions, in general, have become infeasible due to the high transaction fees.\n\nCommunity optimistic\n\nThe solution to high transaction fees is simple – increase the transaction capacity of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Whether this is to be done through larger blocks or implementing SegWit is a deeply divisive debate.

Shipping is one of the sectors that could be disrupted by the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin. Patrick Semansky AP', 'BitCart, the cryptocurrency gift card platform has decided to stop supporting Bitcoin payments and switch to DASH instead. Read more...\n\nBitCart, the online cryptocurrency discount gift card platform has announced an unprecedented move. The platform known to allow users to buy and sell gift cards for cryptocurrency was until now supporting both Bitcoin and DASH. However, in a recent announcement, the Irish company has divulged its decision to do away with Bitcoin payment option.\n\nBitCart, in its latest press release, states that the company’s decision to end support for Bitcoin payments is influenced by extremely slow transaction confirmation and settlement speeds. As Bitcoin network continues to struggle with scalability issues, the number of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool continue to increase. In such a scenario, BitCart is finding it increasingly impossible to provide 24-hour turnaround to its customers as promised.\n\nThe discount gift card platform partnered with DASH in April 2017 and since then, the number of BitCart customers opting DASH payment over Bitcoin have increased. In the release, the company states that some of its customers have made upwards of five orders for gift cards a day, all with DASH. Increasing DASH adoption among BitCart customers combined with the cryptocurrency’s increasing value has made the company prefer DASH over Bitcoin.\n\nThe CEO of BitCart, Graham de Barra was quoted explaining the challenges faced by the company due to delayed confirmations. De Barra said,\n\n“From a merchant’s point of view, bitcoin is extremely problematic. The backlog is vast and transactions speeds are terribly slow. I had to wait three entire weeks to fill two customer orders, simply waiting on the bitcoin network to clear. Bitcoin as a method of payment on BitCart is simply not sustainable and it’s a nightmare from a merchant point of view; every twenty or so transactions the platform would stop working and we would have to reintegrate the API.”\n\nBitCart currently allows users to order Amazon gift cards with cryptocurrency. Soon, the platform intends to introduce Hotels.com gift cards as well, offering more options for the cryptocurrency community to spend their digital currency.\n\nIt is indeed sad to see BitCart moving away from Bitcoin, but given the issues with the popular digital currency, it may not be the only one taking such a drastic decision. Hopefully, the community takes note of this development and make haste to make Bitcoin great again.\n\nRef: Media Release | Image: NewsBTC', 'As the leading cryptocurrency in an ever-growing field, Bitcoin has been making more and more steps towards becoming a full-fledged part of the general financial world in recent weeks. One of the latest of these landmarks is the news that Britain\'s largest online platform for trading activity, Hargreaves Lansdown, will soon allow its users to make investments in Bitcoin through the service. Hargreaves is a major trading platform, involving about 876,000 customers and overseeing the investment of about $90 billion U.S. dollars. What does this change mean for Hargreaves users and for the broader financial landscape?\n\nBitcoin Investment Through an ETN\n\nHargreaves plans to provide access to its customers to a fund which tracks the price of Bitcoin. This fund, which is offered by the Swedish company XBT Provider, will act as an exchange-traded note, or ETN, according to the Telegraph. An ETN is a fund which is listed on the broader stock exchange, so customers can buy and sell investments in it like shares of other companies.\n\nXBT will work to trade in what are known as ""synthetic"" certificates, themselves tracked in U.S. dollars. These certificates follow the price of Bitcoin. The ETN, on the other hand, will be overseen in Swedish krona. This means that Hargreaves customers are likely exposed to two different types of currency risk, as most if not all of them will be British.\n\nXBT Disclaims Currency Risk\n\nFor its part, XBT has made clear that Hargreaves investors face a risk when investing in the ETN. The firm has explained that ""the value of and any amount payable under the certificates will be strongly affected by the performance of Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar/krona exchange rate. As such, an investment in the certificates is likely to be highly volatile and thus risky."" At the same time, Bitcoin is seen to be a generally risky asset at this point, owing to widespread uncertainty about the future of digital currencies as well as lasting security concerns.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown stands by its decision to include the ETN on its platform. Danny Cox, a spokesperson for the company, said that they ""have seen a handful of clients asking for the ETN, so it\'s not purely driven by a provider wanting to be listed."" Rather, the platform is ""making it available to self-select investors in the same way [they] offer access to around 3,000 other exchange-traded funds, notes and commodities.""\n\nHargreaves customers already have the opportunity to invest in the Bitcoin Investment Trust, operated by Grayscale Investments. It seems likely that other platforms may follow suit, particularly since Bitcoin in particular among cryptocurrencies has seen exceptional performance in the past few weeks.

But if understand it, if the price of the #cryptocurrency crashes, the miners crash with it ? https://t.co/VfMEc9LkqR — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) June 6, 2017', 'File Photo\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has won a legal battle against GAW Miners and Zen Miners resulting in the now defunct companies shouldering the responsibility of $12 million in damages.\n\nOperated by Homero Joshua Garza, the two Connecticut-based companies were taken to court by the agency over allegations of operating as Ponzi schemes.\n\nSEC alleged that GAW Miners and Zen Miners defrauded investors by using ""the lure of quick riches from virtual currency.""\n\nAccording to SEC, which released the details of the case on Monday, Homero Joshua Garza offered shares to investors in the companies\' Bitcoin mining operation.\n\nBitcoin mining used to be an easy way to secure the virtual currency before the idea became popular. You need computational power to solve complex equations, and when these have been solved, you are awarded units of the virtual currency.\n\nHowever, as there are only so many in circulation -- acting as a traditional currency in this manner -- the more that were mined, the fewer were left in the wild, and these Bitcoins require more and more power to secure.\n\nOnce the price of Bitcoin surged, many abandoned mining as individuals and joined mining ""pools"" in which numerous people add their own computing power to mine the virtual currency and take a slice of the profit.\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin, $2,904 per coin at the time of writing and based on scarcity, means that it usually costs more and more to run a system for mining.\n\nThe complaint, filed 1 December 2015, alleged that the companies offered high-spec mining operations with the power necessary in return for investor funds. However, SEC said that GAW Miners and ZenMiner did not own enough computing power for the mining they promised, and as a result, ""most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed.""\n\nTo keep some investors off the scent, some returns were paid -- but these funds were generated through sales to other investors rather than mining.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin scams: Beware of crooks trying to steal your cryptocurrency with these schemes\n\nOn 2 June, the US District of Connecticut federal court sided with SEC and agreed to order that both GAW Miners and ZenMiner pay $10,384,099 jointly in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, as well as $1,000,000 fees in damages.\n\nThe companies themselves have been held accountable for the Ponzi scheme but SEC isn\'t finished yet as a separate case is ongoing against Garza.\n\nAs noted by The Register, irony plays a part here. Should the companies have simply purchased Bitcoin at the standard price at the time, between $400 and $450, considering the seriously inflated value of the virtual currency now -- upwards of $2,900 -- there would have been more than enough to keep the investors happy and have millions of dollars still left in the bank.', 'Japanese startups are leveraging Blockchain technology to increase their stock market value, reports suggest.\n\nBloomberg noted on Tuesday that Blockchain voting platform Infoteria and financial data services provider Fisco saw rises of 58 percent and 26 percent over the past month respectively.\n\nFisco additionally opened a Bitcoin exchange in 2016.\n\n“From about a month ago when all these virtual currencies started spiking like crazy, we began seeing the so-called “stocks of the virtual currency bubble,”’ Naoki Murakami, a major trader, told the publication.\n\n“Not everyone is sure they can trust bitcoin exchanges. And some don’t have accounts there. That’s why they’re using the stock market to speculate.”\n\nThe stocks of such startups are no doubt additionally profiting from Japan’s recent law change giving free reign to Bitcoin as a method of payment.\n\nTraders are lining up to buy into Bitcoin en masse via other methods as well, with commentators regularly suggesting the Japanese market is a major force behind the current price rise.\n\n“It’s pure frenzy,” Murakami added.\n\nBitcoin’s price continues to shy away from the $3,000 mark despite several run-ups over the past 24 hours.', '""Bitcoin Surges to Record Levels,"" ""Bitcoin More than Doubled This Year,"" ""Bitcoin Plummets, Loosing $4 Billion of Market Capitalization,"" ""Cyber Fraud Attackers Demand Payment in Bitcoin."" These attention-grabbing headlines are typical of the recent media buzz related to this cyber-currency. What is Bitcoin, and why has it garnered so much attention in the investment world? Who will benefit? Will this be trouble for the banks, Visa, Mastercard and Paypal?\n\nLet\'s start with some definitions, which we obtained from a white paper entitled ""Bitcoin - A Primer for Policy Makers"", by Jerry Brito and Andrea Castillo of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University:\n\n""Bitcoin is an open-source, peer-to-peer digital currency"" that relies on ""the world\'s first completely decentralized digital-payments system. Until Bitcoin\'s invention in 2008 by the unidentified programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto, online transactions always required a trusted third-party intermediary,"" like Visa/MasterCard or PayPal. Rather than relying on that third party, ""every transaction that occurs in the Bitcoin economy is registered in a public, distributed ledger, which is called the block chain. New transactions are checked against the block chain to ensure that the same Bitcoins haven\'t been previously spent, thus eliminating the double-spending problem. The global peer-to-peer network, composed of thousands of users, takes the place of an intermediary."" So, the term Bitcoin is used to refer to both the virtual currency as well as the decentralized payments network, and ""the dollar value of a Bitcoin is determined on an open market, just as is the exchange rate between different world currencies.""\n\nThis new virtual currency has caught on: a $100 investment in Bitcoin in 2010 would now be worth over $75 million!\n\nToday\'s global currencies have evolved. Prior to 1971, the dollar was backed by a physical commodity - gold. In other words, you could theoretically take your dollars to the government and ask for gold in exchange. But in 1971, President Richard Nixon announced that the dollar would no longer be backed by gold, but rather by the full faith and credit of the federal government. In other words, ""going off the gold standard"" meant that the dollar was now a ""fiat currency"", backed solely by a promise from the government.\n\nThe move away from the gold standard reflected a desire to better control the supply of money, especially in times of economic uncertainty. An article on the Motley Fool website by Jason Hall (""Fiat Currency: What It Is and Why It\'s Better Than a Gold Standard"") has this to say about an effective currency: ""People need to be able to count on its value, and that value needs to be stable over time."" Gold, while acting as a reasonably reliable store of value in normal economic times, did not provide the desired stability during times of financial crisis and economic upheaval. In fact, gold\'s tendency to appreciate during financial crises (as a result of hoarding) had the effect of restricting the money supply and thereby tightening financial conditions at a time when the opposite was needed. ""By severing the link between gold reserves and currency,"" Hall explained, ""the Federal Reserve is better able to combat major economic shocks to the economy.""\n\nAdvocates of fiat currencies argue that the Fed\'s ability to print trillions of dollars (""Quantitative Easing"") in response to the financial crisis was the only thing that prevented an even greater economic catastrophe on the scale of the Great Depression (or worse). On the other hand, advocates of a commodity standard (like the gold standard) would argue that the Fed\'s Quantitative Easing is dangerous as it will cause a surge in the money supply and will eventually lead to very high rates of inflation. Only by backing the currency with a scarce commodity like gold, they say, will policymakers be prevented from taking action that will devalue the currency. We suspect there is some truth in both.\n\nIn Bitcoin, we now seem to have a new form of currency that rivals fiat money as we move full speed into the age of technology. Unlike its predecessor currencies, it is not backed by a physical commodity (gold) or any government or bank. It transcends borders and allows for complete anonymity. Transactions are cheap to execute and it is quickly and easily transferred around the world. Bitcoins do not depreciate as a result of government budget deficits, and banks can\'t use your Bitcoins to make risky investments. Who needs a Swiss bank account? Or any bank account? What\'s not to like?\n\nFor starters, the value of Bitcoins has been extremely volatile. At $2,288, the value has increased exponentially in recent years - and it could go back down just as easily. Due to its anonymity, some people have been using Bitcoin to execute illegal transactions. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg believes that the surge in Bitcoin has been driven by the illegal narcotics trade. The recent ""Wannacry"" computer attack demanded ransom payment in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile I don\'t have a firm opinion on Bitcoin as an alternative currency, I do have more conviction on Bitcoin as an investment: it is not an investment. It is speculation. But, that doesn\'t mean it won\'t continue to gain in popularity and broader use. Japan has legalized crypto-currencies. Other countries will likely follow.\n\nBeyond the many illegal uses for an anonymous currency, there are other risks: hacking, no way to insure holdings (think FDIC), viruses, accidental deletion of accounts, and usual, other cyber-vulnerabilities.\n\nAs investors, we look to threats to the companies we hold or may consider as well as opportunities to invest in companies that may benefit. Earlier we mentioned the credit card companies and PayPal. PayPal emerged as a way to pay for online purchases by authorizing online transfers of money without having to disclose credit information online. It is now a stand-alone, publicly traded company with a market capitalization of almost $63 billion. Paypal links user accounts to their bank accounts or credit cards and doesn\'t undermine or erode banking or credit card businesses. Perhaps the banks will find ways to embrace cyber-currencies by linking those balances to credit cards or other borrowing and lending activities. Time will tell.', 'Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin surged above the prior high without any real issue, touched $2900 and pulled back to the break-out level from around the first Fibonacci-extension at $2925. BTC is still on a buy signal with the short-term trend still being intact. The Fibonacci based targets for the current move are $3050 and $3260, with the prior swing low at $2477 providing primary support. A new swing low might be developing near $2690 which would be confirmed by a break above the $2900 level, providing an opportunity for short-term traders to raise stop-losses to that level.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nRipple\n\nRipple remained in the same consolidation pattern that we laid out in yesterday’s analysis against the US Dollar while drifting below the 0.0001 level compared to BTC, still showing relative weakness. The USD is still a hold, with no new positions advised until the relative weakness persists.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum broke out above the $250 resistance following Bitcoin’s lead, but so far it is still trading in a consolidation pattern in the BTC pair. That said, ETH/USD remains at least a hold, and the ETH/BTC pair is also holding on well above the support zone between 0.08 and 0.085. The upside targets for the move are still $280 and $300, but short-term traders could cash out on some of their positions as the pair reached a Fibonacci-level just above $260, with the MACD indicator showing negative divergence.\n\nMonero\n\nXMR was one of the few coins that rose together with Bitcoin overnight, confirming the relative strength that we mentioned on Monday. The rally is still likely to hit the previous all-time highs at $58 on the Dollar pair, after breaking out above the key $50 level, despite this afternoon’s pull-back.\n\nLitecoin\n\nThe setup of yesterday’s trade recommendation is still active, with both the USD and the BTC pair holding in their technical pattern, despite the Bitcoin break-out and the increased volatility. The BTC pair is right in the convergence zone that we pointed out yesterday, hinting on a significant move in the coming days.\n\nEthereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic is still trading just below its prior high in a very narrow consolidation range against the USD, while drifting lower recently against Bitcoin amid the broad altcoin correction. The coin is getting close to a convergence zone on the USD pair, which could end the bullish consolidation, and set up a move towards $22 following a break-out above the $17.75 level.\n\nDash\n\nDash’s technical picture in the Dollar pair is little changed amid the Bitcoin move, which means that it has been losing ground in the BTC pair. The Dollar pair still looks promising and a break-out above the $150 level would trigger a short-term buy signal, with an initial target of $166, and further targets at $176 and $183. A move below $130, on the other hand, could set-up a move back to $115 or even $100.\n\nFeatured image from Antana, flickr.com', 'The investment category of cryptocurrencies hit a new milestone on Tuesday, one that would have been unfathomable just a couple of years ago: $100 billion in combined market capitalization.\n\nThe break above the 12-digit threshold is largely attributable to bitcoin, which is by far the largest digital currency in the still-nascent category, and which has been on a tear lately.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, +5.35% has more than tripled in 2017, according to crypto pricing site CoinDesk, and on Tuesday it rose more than 7% to $2,879.80.

( OTC : SING), an acquisition-based company with a focus on emerging markets, today announces its initiative to develop a bitcoin payments solution in partnership with First Bitcoin Capital Corp. ( OTC : BITCF). The two companies signed a Joint Venture agreement to develop and distribute a viable payments solution using block chain technology. First Bitcoin Capital is an industry leading Bitcoin and blockchain technology provider and SinglePoint has a deep history in distribution. The two companies believe this partnership will enable each company to focus on their core strengths to build and supply the best Bitcoin solution available.\n\nWith the massive and widespread adoption of Bitcoin worldwide, the two companies will pursue opportunities to leverage their payment technology background and develop a proprietary solution specifically for high-risk payment verticals including the cannabis industry.\n\nSinglePoints\' representation at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year saw many solutions being utilized in other countries based on Bitcoin and other crypto currencies such as Ethereum. SinglePoint and First Bitcoin Capital believe they have found a way for the customer experience to go unchanged at the point of sale when paying with a credit or debit card at medical and recreational cannabis dispensaries.\n\nUnder this initiative, the companies will offer a best-in-class Bitcoin solution to fill the payments gap that currently exists.\n\nAs SinglePoint CEO Greg Lambrecht states, ""In January 2014 SinglePoint announced and started working on a bitcoin payment solution, shortly after we recognized the issue of minimal user adoption of digital currency. The payments industry has rapidly changed since that time. There is now tremendous momentum and demand for bitcoin acceptance as an alternative form of payment. This Joint Venture with First Bitcoin Capital is perfect timing. Bitcoin payments are catching on and cannabis dispensaries need a solution fast.""\n\nSinglePoint has successfully completed technology integrations with companies such as Twilio, RedFynn, IATS, and all the major carriers ATT, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Which has enabled the company to provide its text message marketing and text based payment solutions. SinglePoint will now use its experience to work and integrate with First BitCoin Capital to provide an all-encompassing payment solution. First Bitcoin Capital and SinglePoint plan for this technology to be easily implemented into any Point of Sale machine through a simple download of the application.\n\nGreg Rubin of First Bitcoin Capital stated, ""We are optimistic that our partnership with SinglePoint will produce positive cash flow to our bottom line. Between the two of our companies, we will have the ability to develop a best in class solution and SinglePoint will be able to help in distribution. We look forward to providing cutting edge products and services to all states through the establishment of this new venture.""\n\nProjections by New Frontier put the cannabis industry at $24 billion by 2026. Cannabis is now legal in some form in 29 states and the District of Columbia. Increased need for payment options correlates with this industry growth, and bitcoin stands to be a promising solution. Based on prices from CoinMarketCap, bitcoin has provided annual returns of over 286%. As a testament, Japan recently recognized the currency as a legal payment method and projects that it will be accepted in 260,000 stores in the near future. Furthermore, bitcoin is an accepted form of payment for a number of large retailers, including Overstock.com.\n\nAs the cannabis industry continues to evolve, SinglePoint and First Bitcoin Capital are committed to initiatives to identify and develop solutions that enhance the success of the cannabis industry and participating businesses.\n\nAbout SinglePoint, Inc.\n\nSinglePoint, Inc. (SING) has grown from a full-service mobile technology provider to a publicly traded holding company. Through diversification into horizontal markets, SinglePoint is building its portfolio by acquiring an interest in undervalued subsidiaries, thereby providing a rich, diversified holding base. Through its subsidiary company SingleSeed the company is providing products and services to the cannabis industry.\n\nConnect on social media at: www.facebook.com/SinglePointMobile, http://www.twitter.com/_SinglePoint_, www.linkedin.com/company/SinglePoint and www.youtube.com/user/SinglePointMobile\n\nFor more information visit www.SinglePoint.com or www.SingleSeed.com\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements in this news release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of Rule 175 under the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 3b-6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and are subject to the safe harbor created by those rules.

Despite the hype around AMD, NVIDIA shares were essentially flat in afternoon trading on June 6.\n\nAMD data by YCharts\n\nBoth stocks, however, are up enormously over the past year, with NVIDIA slightly outpacing AMD.\n\nThe options market is certainly not seeing AMD as the newest cryptocurrency play lasting long.\n\n(Interactive Brokers TWS)\n\nThe chart above illustrates that most of the volume in the options market is occurring for expiration on June 9, which is this coming Friday, with strike prices at $11.50 and $12.00 being the most active. It tells us that at this point not many options traders are betting this trade will last more than the balance of this week. Options volume is heavily skewed to the call side, with the put/call volume at 0.30. The activity has also caused implied volatility to surge significantly higher. (For more, see also: AMD vs. NVIDIA: Who Dominates GPUs?)\n\n(Interactive Brokers TWS)\n\nThe June 9 $11.50 calls are trading at a price of around $0.70, implying a trader needs the stock price of the stock to rise to $12.20 to break even, while the $12 calls are trading around $0.35, suggesting the stock needs to trade to $12.35, to break even. Shares of the stock are currently around $12.20.\n\nBeing tied to Bitcoin is certainly a double-edged sword, if you want to trade up with Bitcoin, then one better be prepared to trade down with Bitcoin. The chart for the price of Bitcoin has certainly been anything but smooth, with plenty of signs of volatility in the past.\n\nThe way the options market is playing the latest development in AMD, it suggests this is likely to be a short-term pop. Add to that the lack of enthusiasm in shares of NVIDIA today confirms this notion. One would think if a derivative play for cryptocurrency was in AMD, then why would the same not hold true of NVIDIA? With shares of NVIDIA flat, it gives the impression that this AMD trade may be a stretch.\n\nWhen investors start stretching to find ways to rationalize a stock price or price movements, it should serve as a warning sign. Today's price action in AMD suggests that emotions may be running ahead of themselves and that AMD remains nothing more than a nirvana for day traders.

Though this is the case for most countries, there are several countries such as Sweden whose Nasdaq has already included cryptocurrencies in their public exchange.\n\nBitcoin status in the US\n\nBitcoin’s status and classification as per the US regulators have still not been decided as of yet. The SEC has not made any comment in classifying Bitcoin yet and it seems like it will not happen anytime soon.\n\nThe SEC has already rejected two entities that aim to provide Bitcoin ETFs to potential investors. From the legal side, it seems as though Bitcoin is not doing very well due to this hurdle.\n\nAccording to Radloff, it doesn’t look like Bitcoin will be accepted anytime soon following the two rejections that the SEC made, though this may all change in the future if the SEC becomes convinced by the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin in other countries\n\nAlthough the US is very stern with their decision on the Bitcoin issue, there are other countries that seem to be more open to the cryptocurrency. Other countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Italy have accepted Bitcoin in their public exchange and already have regulations regarding it. Radloff also stated that in the future, he is expecting more countries to accept cryptocurrencies.\n\nNotably, there are exchange-traded Bitcoin products in Europe, but they aren't ETFs, they are exchange-traded notes, which are similar to ETFs but carry different risks. However, European investors and regulators are more accustomed to ETNs, said Radloff.\n\nThe COINXBE and COINXBT ETNs are listed on the Nasdaq Nordic. Another ETN-style Bitcoin product was recently delisted from the Gibraltar Stock Exchange.\n\nNick Cowan, managing director of the latter exchange, said he's expecting two similar Bitcoin products to be listed soon, as well as a third based on a basket of several cryptocurrencies.\n\nConvincing the US\n\nWhile the market is still relatively new, it has already gotten a lot of attention from investors who have drawn a lot of data from it. However, the only problem would be the government regulations and licenses. A report by the University of Cambridge’s Center for Alternative Finance stated that 46 percent of exchanges are not government regulated. This means that the other 54 percent are not operating with licenses.\n\nWhile it may be difficult to convince US regulators to accept the digital currency, it is still possible as the US is looking for transparency and stability before they consider allowing it. The reason is that it involves a lot of money and it is quite a risk on their end.\n\nNevertheless, it would seem as though the US will not be one of the next countries to accept the cryptocurrency. However, it will only be a matter of time before this event happens. When the US sees a lot of other countries doing it, they will most likely join in the fray."", ""I've been writing about technology, careers, science and health since 1995.

Or just a bubble waiting to burst.\n\nFor foreign-exchange analysts trying to use traditional methods to value the so-called cryptocurrency and its digital cousins, it may be all of the above -- but it’s not quite a currency.\n\n""It is difficult to use standard FX valuation frameworks that are based on the fundamental drivers of the currency, like relative productivity, or terms of trade of the country, because there are no such concepts,"" said Juan Prada, a New York-based currency strategist at Barclays Capital Inc.\n\nThe market capitalization of digital currencies has soared to around $100 billion since the start of the year, with bitcoin almost tripling in price to as high as $2,938.50 on Tuesday, as the frenzy around cryptocurrencies grows. Demand is swelling as more companies embrace blockchain and the similar technologies backing the various methods of exchange and some investors see it as a haven from uncertainty across the globe.\n\nWhile the technology is used as a means of payment -- the most basic function of money -- it may be better to view digital currencies like gold or say, a painting, than a traditional currency. Bitcoin is more volatile than even the most capricious fiat currencies and its decentralized structure makes it difficult to consider valuation.\n\n""Both gold and bitcoin are different from usual currencies in the sense that there is not a single economic entity that uses it as a medium of exchange and unit of account,"" Prada said.\n\nThat aligns with the view of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which in September 2015 said that bitcoin and other virtual currencies were officially considered commodities. By saying so, the CFTC was able to assert its authority to provide oversight of the trading of cryptocurrency futures and options in the future.\n\nRead more on alternative digital currencies\n\nNick Bennenbroek, the head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities LLC, said to the extent bitcoin could be viewed as a form of wealth or an investment, it could be considered under the class of somewhat-vague alternative assets.\n\n""As an alternative asset, there might be some value in this electronic product because (a) you can use it for payment and (b) there might be some value from this blockchain and the ability to, in a decentralized manner, verify transactions,” Bennenbroek said . “There are other forms of assets, like people sometimes buy paintings and that’s part of their portfolio. People buy wine bottles. But some people would argue there is some intrinsic value in a painting.""\n\nTech billionaire Mark Cuban weighed in Tuesday on the speculation, saying on Twitter that bitcoin is a bubble, helping to trigger a more than $200 intraday price swing. Cuban noted that “ I’m not questioning value. I’m questioning valuation.”\n\n""It’s definitely a medium of exchange, but the price volatility means that as a unit of account, if you’re measuring stuff in bitcoin, it’s not very helpful,"" Bennenbroek said.\n\nBuying assets as a haven can have unexpected consequences. China’s three biggest bitcoin exchanges said last week they were ending a self-imposed moratorium on withdrawals that came almost four months ago following increased scrutiny from Chinese authorities amid concerns of capital flight and money laundering. In February, the People’s Bank of China had told bitcoin venues that it would close exchanges that violated rules on foreign exchange management, money laundering and payment and settlement.\n\n""You can’t really come up with a valuation for it and it doesn’t yield anything yet people perceive it as a safe place just in case everything else goes completely nuts,"" said Brad Bechtel, a currency strategist at Jefferies LLC.', 'In a first, Melbourne-based Blockchain Global Limited (BGL) has used bitcoin in an AUD$4.35 million investment to acquire a 40% stake in ASX-listed blockchain payments fintech DigitalX.\n\nDetails from an announcement today on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) reveal DigitalX to receive, in bitcoin, AUD$300,000 in a convertible loan. A further AUD$550,000 will be invested in convertible notes along with AUD$3.8 million in shares.\n\n“DigitalX has received AUD$300,000 by way of a convertible loan in Bitcoin (BTC),” the announcement stated. “The convertible loan is convertible into shares in DigitalX…”\n\nBlockchain Global Limtied (BGL), formerly operating as the Bitcoin Group, began as a bitcoin mining operator before diversifying into a blockchain solutions provider, a corporate incubator and more recently, an ICO specialist. The Bitcoin Group raised AUD$5.9 million and missed out on its target of AUD$20 million following a number of delays to get listed on the ASX itself.\n\nUltimately, the firm scrapped its efforts to become the world’s first publicly-listed bitcoin miner after the ASX raised liquidity and regulatory concerns.\n\nPerth-based DigitalX, formerly Digital CC, also saw a rebrand in late 2015 and shifted its objectives from mining bitcoin to blockchain software development. As a part of its shift in strategy, DigitalX has now developed AirPocket, a blockchain payments and remittance app that enables payments to 14 countries with a majority of them in Latin America.\n\n“DigitalX welcomes BGL as an investor in the company, and appreciates the confidence it has shown in DigitalX’s growth and understanding within the blockchain ecosystem,” said DigitalX CEO Leigh Travers.\n\nThe executive added:\n\nHaving just returned from Consensus, the biggest blockchain conference in the world, the growing support for blockchain, digital currency and decentralized organisations is unquestionable.\n\nAs a part of its investment, BGL is voluntarily escrowing its shareholding in DigitalX for a 12 month period from the date of issuance.\n\nMeanwhile, the ASX is invested in blockchain technology itself, having paid AUD $14.9 million for a 5% equity interest in New York-based blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings (DAH). Australia’s biggest private stock exchange is currently trialing a DAH-developed blockchain system to replace its existing post-trade processing system.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Crytpocurrencies are having a quiet and slightly bearish session, as Bitcoin failed to follow through on its recent break-out, so far, although it is holding on above its prior high despite the weak momentum. Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Dash, and Monero are among the relatively strong coins of the day. The smaller altcoins are more active today in general (see our previous update for details), as the market digests the new highs of the two major coins, BTC and ETH.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nBitcoin\n\nBTC is at a very important point, as a failed break-out attempt, and a break below the prior high could set up a quick decline towards the dominant trendline at $2500 or the top of the short-term base near $2350. That said, BTC is still on a buy signal and should the currency break above yesterday’s high, the Fibonacci-based targets for the move would still be $3050 and $3260, with the prior swing-low at $2477 providing primary support.\n\nRipple\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nRipple remained in virtually unchanged today, but there are some positive signs showing up on the charts especially as XRP/BTC broke a minor trendline which could be the start of a period of relative strength. A move above the more prominent trend-line near 0.000115 would trigger a break-out trade in the Bitcoin pair and the USD pair as well.\n\n\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is still a hold, despite the lack of momentum, as it is still trading between the $250 and the $265 levels in a narrow short-term range on the USD pair, while being stuck in a consolidation pattern on the BTC pair. The short-term upside targets for a move above the Fibonacci-resistance are still $280 and $300 for ETH/USD, with the dominant rising trend line providing support just below $250.\n\nMonero\n\nXMR is still showing the relative strength that we have been monitoring in recent days, as it remains on a buy signal both against the USD and BTC. The coin attempted a break-out overnight, but it couldn’t hold above the prior all-time high in the USD pair. Long-term traders might ease up on their holdings after the attempt and wait for a re-entry point, but the rising short-term trend remains intact.\n\nLitecoin\n\nLTC is trading inside the convergence zone that we pointed out recently, and both the short- and long-term setups remain unchanged in the sideways trading environment. Short-term traders could still wait for a break-out, but our long-term buy recommendation remains active.\n\nStellar Lumens\n\nStellar has given a short-term buy signal against the USD, breaking out from a consolidation pattern near the 0.045 level. The initial target of the move is at 0.0585, with the prior highs providing the next target at 0.066. The prior swing low is near 0.039, providing primary support for the coin.\n\nDash\n\nThe Dash/USD pair is still in the same setup as yesterday, despite the strength that the coin showed in early trading. The Dollar pair is still bullish, although we are still waiting for a sustained break-out above the $150 level, with an initial target of $166, and further targets at $176 and $183.', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

It sent to wrong address,” the user wrote.\n\n“i checked all browser windows, private messages, chat histories. i do not know this address that grabbed the 13 BTC.”\n\nOthers swiftly pointed out the address was likely changed by malware, specifically a clipboard-altering program which has, in fact, been in production for several years.\n\nThe funds were seemingly not backed up by hardware, yet the threat which successfully stole them is hard to guard against for the average Bitcoin bagholder.\n\nHardware wallets, another Reddit respondent points out, would “securely” display the destination wallet address before confirmation.\n\nThe 13 BTC transaction to the presumed malware operators has since been confirmed, despite petitions to major mining pools.', 'Bitcoin values have surged to new highs, passing $2,967 per coin yesterday. Its value has risen by more than 200% in 2017.\n\nLori Keogh, Director Financial Services Strategy with Deloitte Ireland joined Vincent Wall on Breakfast Business to discuss the electronic currency\'s future prospects.\n\nHe outlined two reasons behind the spike in Bitcoin\'s value:\n\n""Number one is that people are fleeing to bitcoin, instead of fleeing to gold in periods of volatility,"" Mr Keogh told Newstalk. He added that it has become a haven asset when markets become hard to predict.\n\nThe second factor which the analyst identified was the ""hype around blockchain technology.""\n\n""We are seeing a lot of financial services institutions and many other sectors look at blockchain technology as a means to disintermediate - and also to move to a peer-to-peer base,"" he told Vincent Wall.\n\nBitcoin\'s transfer mechanism is based on a centralised ledger (its blockchain) - this new technology offers security benefits and savings when transferring money.\n\nMr Keogh expects the value of the currency to continue to rise as it is recognised by a greater number of central banks around the world.\n\n""I see the price continuing to increase. I think by 2020 alone the price of Bitcoin will be nearing €10,000. That\'s what a lot of analysts are saying,"" he stated.\n\nCautioning that all investment decisions need to be thought about carefully and that diversifying your investment portfolio is key - he added that he believes that bitcoin should be considered as an investment option:\n\n""Do I think Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are worth a flutter? Absolutely. You can buy in for as little as €20.00 at an individual level,"" he concluded.', 'With bitcoin hitting record high prices recently, many investors are wondering if they should jump on to the cryptocurrency bandwagon. I\'m not a fan of buying the digital coins themselves for investment purposes, but there are other ways to invest in bitcoin and the technology behind it.\n\nCompanies with exposure to bitcoin and blockchain technology\n\nOne way to set yourself up to profit from the growing popularity of bitcoin is to invest in companies that themselves invest in bitcoin, or in the underlying blockchain technology.\n\nTo be clear, I\'m not talking about investing in over-the-counter stocks whose only business is investing in bitcoin. Most of these companies are extremely hard to evaluate, and as I\'ve written before, investing in penny stock-type securities is a good way to lose all of your money.\n\nInstead, I\'m referring to companies such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which in 2015 led a round of funding for bitcoin start-up Circle Internet Financial. In fact, there\'s an investment group in Goldman, known as the Principal Strategic Investments Group, whose main mission is to invest within the financial-technology space -- that is, technologies Goldman could conceivably use in its own business.\n\nYou can read more about Goldman\'s investment in this 2015 article I wrote, but the point is that Goldman is a well-established company that could reap the benefits of bitcoin.\n\nRetailers that accept bitcoin\n\nAnother way to potentially benefit from the increasing popularity of bitcoin is to invest in a retailer that accepts the currency. However, much of the retail sector hasn\'t been doing too well, so be sure to do your due diligence before investing in any of these companies – especially any brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nHaving said that, here are a few of my favorite bitcoin-accepting merchants that I think have bright futures ahead of them. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of companies that accept bitcoin as of this writing.\n\nOverstock.com NASDAQ:OSTK)\n\nShopify NYSE:SHOP)\n\nSatellite-TV provider DISH Network NASDAQ:DISH)\n\nAlthough it\'s not really a retailer, Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nThe bitcoin investment trust: Buyer beware\n\nOne final ""investment"" I\'d like to mention is the Bitcoin Investment Trust (NASDAQOTH:GBTC), which was created to allow investors to pool money and buy bitcoin like a stock or ETF, as opposed to setting up a separate account with a bitcoin exchange and buying coins directly.\n\nHowever, as my colleague Jordan Wathen pointed out in a recent article, this is perhaps the worst way to invest in bitcoin. Shares of the trust trade at an incredibly hefty premium to the value of the bitcoins the company owns, and the trust\'s 2% annual management fee will slowly eat away at the value of your investment.\n\nBecause of these two factors, it\'s entirely possible that investors in the trust could lose a substantial amount of money, even if the price of bitcoin continues to climb. As I mentioned, I\'m not a fan of holding actual bitcoins for investment reasons, but even that seems like a better idea than investing in this trust.']"
06/08/2017,"['Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may enable online threats like ransomware to spread, but they are also fueling demand for powerful and efficient new graphics cards.\n\nIt’s difficult to find an RX 500-series Radeon graphics card at retail or online right now in part because people are seeking them out to mine certain bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies, chip manufacturer AMD explained to CNBC. In April, AMD released its latest round of Polaris-powered GPUs which can render graphically intensive scenes without drawing excessive amounts of power. That combination of number-crunching capabilities and energy efficiency has attracted consumers who want to “mine” altcoin cryptocurrencies, which are alternatives to bitcoin.\n\n“The gaming market remains our priority,” an AMD spokesperson said. “We are seeing solid demand for our Polaris-based offerings in the gaming and newly resurgent cryptocurrency mining markets based on the strong performance we are delivering.”\n\nMining in this context means using a processor to help decrypt purchases made with altcoins in exchange for earning small fractions of new digital coins for yourself. GPUs are no longer economically viable for mining bitcoin because new tools have hit that market that are much more capable and have driven down potential earnings. But by mining altcoins, players can still trade them for cash or even proper bitcoins by going to an exchange website.\n\nFor the gaming audience, however, this means that the Radeon RX 500 cards are not available on store shelves or from online retailers like Newegg. And if this demand lasts, AMD and competitor Nvidia could potentially consider launching dedicated graphics cards specifically for cyrptocurrency mining to maximize on this opportunity while also keeping enough products in its supply chain for gamers.\n\nSubmit your PC game by December 14th for free testing and be entered to win an @intel\u200b CORE i9 PROCESSOR worth $1000, an iBUYPOWER\u200b Revolt 2 Pro Z370 worth $1750, or an ASRock\u200b X299.

This, in turn, has also affected other cryptocurrencies and pushed them to decrease in value as people are massively selling as a result.\n\nCoinbase opens up opportunities for other platforms\n\nWhile many investors are not happy with the crash of Coinbase as a result of the Asian frenzy, it could prove a good sign for the cryptocurrency market. Since the increase in the value of the cryptocurrency market, many investors have been putting their money in various other cryptocurrency platforms in order to take advantage of the riding trend. Coinbase also rode along this trend when hundreds of investors decided to try investing in their platform as well.\n\nAccording to a graph reported by Cryptorial, it can be seen that since early 2016, there has been a sharp increase in the number of Coinbase users, up until after January 2017 (refer to the graph below).\n\n- Source: Naira Digit\n\nThis did not bode well for Coinbase as their system could not withstand the significant surge in followers. At the same time, this sign shows how much of a high demand cryptocurrencies have. Although it may look bad at the moment, the cryptocurrency market should experience positive growth in the future due to surging investors.\n\nBuying opportunity a dip\n\nWith all the panic selling occurring after the crash of Coinbase, both Ethereum and Bitcoin present an opportunity for other investors to jump in and invest.\n\nEarlier this year, Bitcoin reached an all-time high and Ethereum saw steady growth. As reported by a monthly graph by Cryptocurry, it can be seen that after March, the price skyrocketed up sometime in the earlier part of May and went down again. It then slowly regained its momentum but slowly went down. Ethereum, on the other hand, has maintained stability this year and is expected to go up again later in the year (refer to the graph below).\n\n- Source: Cryptocurry\n\nOf course, this only shows a temporary decrease in value for most cryptocurrencies because of the panic selling that is happening due to the crash of Coinbase.\n\nHowever, this would be a good opportunity for more established cryptocurrency platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin to get more investors. This is also good for the investors in a sense that even the newer investors can take part in the opportunity of investing in a medium that has a lot of room for growth. It is also an opportunity for Coinbase to improve their system so that they may cater to the number of investors that will be putting their money into cryptocurrencies in the near future when the price goes up.\n\nWith the price of cryptocurrencies expected to rise by another tenfold this year, it would not be a good idea to sell everything just yet.', ""Bitcoin is like gold in many ways. Like gold, Bitcoin cannot simply be created arbitrarily. Gold must be mined out of the ground, and Bitcoin must be mined via digital means. Linked with this process is the stipulation set forth by the founders of Bitcoin that, like gold, it have a limited and finite supply. In fact, there are only 21 million Bitcoins that can be mined in total. Once miners have unlocked this many Bitcoins, the planet's supply will essentially be tapped out, unless Bitcoin's protocol is changed to allow for a larger supply. Supporters of Bitcoin say that, like gold, the fixed supply of the currency means that banks are kept in check and not allowed to arbitrarily issue fiduciary media. But what will happen when the global supply of Bitcoin reaches its limit?\n\nEffects on Bitcoin Miners\n\nIt may seem that the group of individuals most directly effected by the limit of the Bitcoin supply will be the Bitcoin miners themselves. On one hand, there are detractors of the Bitcoin limitation who that say that miners will be forced away from the block rewards they receive for their work once the Bitcoin supply has reached 21 million in circulation. In this case, these miners may need to rely on transaction fees in order to maintain operations. Bitcoin.com points to an argument that miners will then find the process unaffordable, leading to a reduction in the number of miners, a centralization process of the Bitcoin network, and numerous negative effects on the Bitcoin system.\n\nThis argument assumes that transaction fees alone will be insufficient to keep Bitcoin miners financially solvent once the mining process has been completed. On the other hand, there are reasons to believe that transaction fees and mining costs will even out in the future. Looking ahead by several decades, it is not difficult to imagine that mining chips will become small and highly efficient. This would reduce the burden placed on miners and would allow mining to become an activity with a lower threshold of initial cost. Further, transaction fees may increase, and this could help to keep miners afloat as well.\n\nPrice of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has already seen massive hikes in price in just the past few months. While no one is entirely sure how Bitcoin will continue to spread to the larger financial world, it seems likely that a limited supply of the currency may cause prices to continue to increase. There are also stockpiles of inactive coins that are held around the world, the largest supply of which belongs to the person or group who founded Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Perhaps this supply, consisting of roughly one million Bitcoins, is intentionally being saved for a time when the global supply is facing increased levels of demand."", 'Bitcoin has been flying high lately, making many investors overnight millionaires—investors who poured money into the digital currency when it was trading at a tiny fraction of its current price. And it will make more millionaires, as it could reach for new highs before coming back down to earth.\n\nFund 12-month performance SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) 12% Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares (GBTC) 800%\n\nSource: Finance.yahoo.com 6/6/2017\n\nThere are a few good reasons for Bitcoin to do so. First of all there’s the ultra-low interest rate environment, which makes the Bitcoin “carry trade,” an appealing proposition.\n\nThen, there’s a growing mistrust of national currencies, following a number of government policies that have pushed more investors to Bitcoin.\n\nOne of these policies is the pouring of new debt onto old debt by issuing new treasury bonds at record low rates. Japan, for instance, sells treasuries that yield next to nothing, though its debt amounts to as much as 250 percent of GDP. China’s treasuries yield something, but no one knows what its unofficial debt is.\n\nWouldn’t you rather hold Bitcoins rather than yen or yuan denominated debt? Apparently some investors think so.\n\nAnother policy is the efforts of governments in emerging markets to get rid of old currency notes, as was the case with India and Venezuela a few months ago – a move which coincided with the beginning of the recent Bitcoin rally.\n\nThere are advantages that makes Bitcoin a better hedge against global uncertainties than conventional hedges like gold. At least for the millennial generation, which understands the digital currency better than the baby-boomer generation.\n\nUnlike gold, for instance, Bitcoin is a convenient medium of payment around the globe.\n\nThen, there’s scarcity. Bitcoin supply is expected to be limited to 21 million. By contrast the supply of gold, on the other hand, tends to increase anytime its price rises, as that provides an incentive for gold miners to mine for gold.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s investor hype. More and more investors are becoming familiar with the digital currency, and can use ETFs to conveniently participate in the market.\n\nOf course we all know what happens to an investment when investor hype cools, or even worse, turns in the wrong direction. It dives back to earth; and millions vanish… much faster than they accumulated.', 'The effect of Bitcoin fee increases on businesses continues as major exchange Kraken announces BTC withdrawals will now cost $7.\n\nIn a circular to customers on Thursday, Kraken, which together with Coinbase is one of the US’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said the move “brings the withdrawal fee more in line” with costs.\n\n“Kraken always pays a miner fee that is sufficient to ensure transactions are processed quickly,” it said.\n\n“However, the average miner fee required to prioritize and confirm Bitcoin transactions has been increasing for some time without a corresponding increase in the fee we charge to clients.”\n\nThe new withdrawal fee will be a fixed 0.0025 BTC per transaction, currently equivalent to around $6.75.\n\nLike Coinbase, Kraken is feeling the pinch from a combination of increasing fees and increased transaction numbers as a wave of new adopters come on board.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, the withdrawal fee for USDT tokens also increased, coming in at 5 USDT as the token utilizes the same network.\n\nGnosis also came in for rises, this time to 0.004 GNO, Kraken saying this was due to a fall in the token’s value.\n\nThe move appears to be a precursor to what officials are calling “more dynamic” fees which will be active in future. These will track current miner fee rates, offering customers a suitable fee at the time of the withdrawal request along with more closely matching Kraken’s own costs.\n\nReactions were predictably dry, with users suggesting trading and withdrawing other coins with lower fees, including Ethereum (ETH) and even Dogecoin, the latter attracting fees of around one cent.\n\nYesterday, Blockstream’s Adam Back suggested Bitcoin users would ultimately accept paying up to $100 per transaction.', ""Photo: Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n\nOne vehicle for betting on bitcoin looks overvalued, according to a CNBC report.\n\nGet the best of Barron's Advisor Center every weekday.

Multiplying that number by the current bitcoin price and then dividing by the number of trust shares outstanding yields a value of about $250, the report says. The trust closed Wednesday at $528, however.\n\nAs of Wednesday’s close, the trust had soared about 336 percent so far this year, while the price of a bitcoin had risen less: 170 percent.\n\n“For investors buying into the fund, such large premiums are a disaster waiting to happen,” Sumit Roy wrote in an analysis for ETF.com, the report notes.\n\nA representative of Grayscale, which manages the trust, said it was legally prohibited from commenting, CNBC reports."", ""Bitcoin price was seen to have a fallen in price again Tuesday after hitting its new all-time highs.\n\nIn a recent tweet by billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, he states that Bitcoin might actually be a bubble.\n\nHe says, “I think it's in a bubble.

Despite all the growth by the Bitcoin, Mark Cuban still hangs on to the belief that the Bitcoin is a bubble that is just waiting to pop in the future.\n\nIn a follow up tweet, Cuban states that he is not questioning the value of the digital token but rather, the valuation. He states that cryptocurrency is similar to gold being more of a trend rather than being an actual asset if compared to a stock.\n\nWhile still very skeptical, Cuban did acknowledge the fact that the technology used for monitoring and creating Bitcoin, known as the blockchain technology, is very powerful and also very valuable for future transactions that would be used in the future in industries such as the financial industry, the health industry, and many more.

That pause began following meetings between regulators in China and domestic exchange operators earlier this year.\n\nInvestigators reportedly drew issue with the fact that the platforms were providing financing and margin trading services to clients, according to Caixin, while further faulting the exchanges for their anti-money laundering systems. The withdrawal freezes from earlier this year were initiated as those markets moved to update those systems.\n\nAccording to statements made previously by Xuedong Zhou, director of PBoC’s business management department, regulators are likely to ban the exchanges from providing leveraged trading, financing, and margin trading services. He also said that exchanges should not try to pump up the trading volume through waiving transaction fees.\n\nChinese regulators are also discussing possible regulations on initial coin offerings, or ICOs, according to a report review written by Yao Qian, director of PBoC’s digital currencies research department.\n\nHe wrote in May:\n\n“Although the government is being tough on bitcoin, but in some sense, we should give a break to companies that has a top 10 market capitalization ICO market. We should give a chance to people to invest on these companies -- at least you could possibly be investing on some disruptive technology. It’s better than buying some stocks that are actually trash.\n\nIn the same review, he suggested that Chinese regulators to speed up the legislation for ICO regulations and to use a sandbox model.\n\nYao also discussed several plans including establishing ICO platforms like crowdfunding platforms, which will be responsible for educating the investors, reviewing ICO initiatives, disclosure of information, and anti-money laundering.

Embrace it… more\n\nI love to watch a new adventure with intrigue. Even more, I love when there is something exciting going on with opportunities for business growth.\n\nIn the last few months, we have seen some dramatic developments in a field that has been previously obscured in puzzle, darkness, and uncertainty.\n\n\n\nEnlarge This relatively new adventure is filled with intrigue and great opportunities. Embrace it… more\n\nThe area is blockchain technologies. It is a way for people to use digital currencies like bitcoin and others as digital cash. This is in contrast to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Chinese Yuan, examples of money that is backed by a government and a central bank.\n\nBlockchain vs. fiat currencies\n\nBlockchain technologies are based on the internet and math. They also are different from fiat currencies in that they are not backed by the “good will and faith” of a particular government.\n\nThe blockchain is a database. Think of it like a database that is scattered among many different computers around the world. It is often called a distributed database. It is a ledger of what happened with various transactions, and these records are kept on thousands of computers around the world.\n\nThere is no one central place where we have all of the blockchain. Instead, each computer that has access to a blockchain, called a node, contains the information and tracks what is happening with other transactions.\n\nThis can be used for digital currencies, keeping track of records, and making sure that no previous records are changed. That part is very important. You can trust that you own the coins you have purchased or earned. They are not subject to change, and all those computer nodes around the world are keeping an eye on it to make sure the record doesn't change. This way trust is built into the system, and it is based on mathematics, not on trying to find a reliable third party to trust.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the most popular digital currency associated with blockchain. Some people find it mysterious and even question its legitimacy because it is often been associated with criminal activities. That perception is changing as many governments are accepting bitcoin as a legitimate payment system. Already this year, we’ve seen governments in Japan, Australia, the Philippines, Russia and others accepting or considering accepting the use of bitcoin in everyday transactions."", 'In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin discussed some of the scaling issues Ethereum is currently dealing with, the rising interest in Ethereum in Asia and his thoughts on the ICO ecosystem in general.\n\n\n\nIn late May, developers from the Ethereum-based job market platform Ethlance introduced an issue its freelancers were struggling to deal with. Twelve months ago, when the price of Ethereum’s token Ether was around $14, a smart contract to set up a freelancer profile on Ethlance cost less than $1.\n\nAs the price of Ether started to surge beyond $250, Ethlance freelancers were required to pay around $8 to set up their profiles. Issues of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps) and the rising fees on Ethereum led the community and supporters of Ethereum to express their concerns over the platform’s scalability.\n\nDiscussions on Etheruem’s scaling issues intensified as Buterin’s interview with Epicenter, conducted in December of 2014, resurfaced, during which he characterized Bitcoin’s $0.05 fee as “absurd.” Currently, Ethereum’s average fee is over $1 and its median fee is around $0.05, close to the level Buterin described as absurd.\n\nBitcoin Magazine spoke to Buterin to address some of these scaling issues Ethereum applications are currently dealing with, the rising transaction fees on Ethereum and the ICO ecosystem.\n\nScaling Issues of Decentralized Applications and How They Can Be Resolved\n\nIn regards to the issues that Ethlance and other DApp developers are facing, Buterin explained, “There are a lot of applications and contracts even now that are being built inefficiently. One major example is that there are a lot of applications that make one separate contract for each user which means that for every single user, it adds several kilobytes of data that cost a few million gas.”\n\nInstead, Buterin explained that the same logic or contract is not required to be copied onto each other and replicated tens of thousands of times. There are more efficient ways to process smart contracts that can significantly reduce gas costs for users. He noted that by implementing efficient smart contracts, users can save anywhere from 50 to 90 percent in gas costs.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the Ethereum Foundation and its development team recently asked writers to reduce their gas prices and some of them have agreed to do so to ensure that users are not required to spend upwards of $8 per smart contract. However, these solutions can only last for the short and midterm. Buterin explained that, in the long run, the only way to maintain low gas or transaction fees is to scale the entire Ethereum network and blockchain proportionally as it grows in size.\n\nAnother long-term solution or development plan the Ethereum Foundation is looking into is the possibility of switching the consensus protocol of Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS).\n\nAs it did after the execution of the DAO hard fork, which resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic, another major hard fork could lead to another network split. Ethereum Classic is currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nButerin recognized that there are some members of the community that are concerned over the possibility of a split chain.\n\n“I feel like recently, most of the people that are really against PoS have moved over to Ethereum Classic, so I’m not really sure if that substantial of a community will want to make another fork or split of Ethereum once the Casper switch happens. That’s just my instinct,” said Buterin.\n\nIn terms of development of the overall Ethereum ecosystem, progress has been slow but steady. “A lot of the things that we’ve wanted to do around Metropolis, privacy, proof of stake, Serenity, scaling, sharding, all of those things have been taking more time that we had expected,” Buterin admitted, “but I also think that the results that we’ve been moving towards are much better than we thought that we would get.”\n\nHe mentioned, as an example, that over the past two or three years, there have been improvements in protocol security that they hadn’t foreseen and that are of great benefit. “I think the end result of a lot of our work and a lot of our research is much stronger than it would have been two years ago.”\n\nEthereum Demand on the Rise in Asia\n\nSouth Korea has become the largest Ethereum exchange market in the world with a 19 percent market share, surpassing the U.S. and China in terms of daily trading volume. China, within a few days of its exchanges adding support for Ethereum, became a contender for top spot in market share.\n\n\n\nEthereum is being actively developed by educational institutions such as universities and government agencies including the Chinese Royal Mint. Recently, the People’s Bank of China stated that Ethereum is heading in the right direction, validating the network and project. As Bitcoin Magazine’s China-based journalist Bradley Fink previously reported, some of the largest companies in China, including Alipay and Peking University, are actively investing in the potential of the Ethereum protocol.\n\nFurthermore, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), connecting Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics and technology vendors with Ethereum, recently announced its expansion into China with a new office in Hangzhou. It will focus on providing Ethereum-based infrastructure to ensure Chinese enterprise can meet domestic market needs.\n\n“There definitely is a fairly large Chinese Ethereum community and there are several companies based in Shanghai and Hangzhou that have been working on Ethereum applications for a couple of years. There has been increasing amount of interest in the technology and the platform. In general, it is continuing to grow,” said Buterin.\n\nHe noted that while the Chinese community used to concentrate its interest solely on Bitcoin, that has changed. “But more recently, it does seem like more people are starting to look at both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The one thing that’s made me feel optimistic over the last year is that there is a lot of interest, not just on the cryptocurrency side and buying ether and holding it, but actually using it to build applications.”\n\nButerin also explained that developers of Ethereum are trying to match the rising demands and expectations from its investors. In the past week, Ethereum has surged exponentially in market cap, accounting for around 50 percent of Bitcoin’s market cap. He noted that the Ethereum Foundation and its developers are working to live up to the expectations of investors and rising demand in regions such as Asia.\n\n“I think the success that Ethereum has seen is definitely putting a lot of pressure on the core developers of the actual protocol of the platform to step up and deliver on the admittedly high expectations that the community has of us,” he said. “That’s an expectation that we’re eager to see if we can match.”\n\nEthereum-based companies are also coming to the forefront at a time when the ICO market is growing at a rapid rate, creating new opportunities for startups and investors alike.\n\nButerin was recently appointed as an advisor to the board of Primalbase, a startup that is aiming to tokenize a WeWork or Regus-type co-working space provider and grant micro-ownership to its investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I’m definitely very interested in all these applications, particularly the semi-financial ones with some components of finance and monetary value but also some components outside of it” said Buterin. “The general idea that we can create this economy where we micro-tokenize and let people have their own micro-ownership, I think that is definitely a very interesting and promising idea.”\n\n\n\nHong kong photo credit: By Diliff - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3963125\n\nVitalik Buterin photo credit: By Romanpoet - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=49232633\n\n\n\n']"
06/09/2017,"['Bitcoin has been having block size limit issues for quite some time. As a result, there have been debates as to whether Bitcoin should increase its block size in order to cater to more investors.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has a few scaling options, it appears that a number of Bitcoin investors have been switching to altcoins, according to Roger Ver.\n\nInvestors have switched to altcoins\n\nVer’s tweet shows how other cryptocurrencies have gained momentum as a result of the block size issue.\n\nThe graph also shows the percentage of total market capitalization between 2013 and 2017. From 2013 to early 2017, Bitcoin’s market capitalization remained on top when compared to other cryptocurrencies. However, it saw a dip after January 2017.\n\nWhile this happened, it can also be seen that the market capitalization of other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple has been increasing. In fact, Ethereum is expected to reach the same percentage of market capitalization as Bitcoin later in the year.\n\nRecurring problems\n\nBefore the Bitcoin block size issue is fixed, there remain many other crucial issues that users have been experiencing this year which, as a result, have affected investors. Aside from the block size issue, there have also been problems such as delayed confirmations and high transaction fees. While these problems have dragged on since last year, they only seem to have escalated in the middle of 2017.\n\nOpportunities for other cryptocurrencies\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has seen a rise in value this year and has been slowly sharing the spotlight with Bitcoin. With such issues still unresolved, it presents an opportunity for other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and many others to become noticed.', 'When Google’s director of engineering, Ray Kurzweil, started accepting audience questions at the Exponential Finance conference earlier today, the first three asks were about blockchain.\n\nThe man who in large part built his reputation based on what are widely considered accurate predictions based on historical data, talked about the power he believes cryptocurrencies have to cross borders and maybe replace national currencies.\n\nBut, he expressed skepticism that bitcoin would be that replacement. Addressing an audience of 700 senior executives, technologists and more, at the Exponential Finance event hosted by Singularity University, which he co-founded, Kurzweil explained his doubts.\n\nWhile he described ""assumptions"" about bitcoin’s ability to scale as ""quite accurate"" he said that people won’t be looking at algorithms to make their spending decisions.\n\nInstead he argued that it was the historic stability of a currency that makes it valuable, stability he said has been lacking in bitcoin.\n\nKurzweil said:\n\n""Ultimately, people need to have confidence in their currency and bitcoin in particular has not really demonstrated that. It’s had a good year, but a very rocky life before that.""\n\nIn the past year bitcoin’s price has increased from about $580 to almost $3,000. In February, the cryptocurrency surpassed a three-year old record of $1,165, only to regularly experience drops in price in excess of $100 in an hour and hundreds of dollars in a day.\n\nAccording to Kurzweil, who has developed a reputation as a ""futurist"" for his uncanny predictions, such inconsistency undermines the cryptocurrency’s value as a currency.\n\n""I wouldn’t put my money into it,"" he said.\n\nNational cyrptocurrencies\n\nIn spite of Kurzweil’s skepticism of bitcoin as a currency, he also expressed interest in the possibility that the blockchain technology that powers bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could eventually be adopted by national governments.\n\nHe called the ""theory"" behind blockchain ""sound"" but said that ""people don’t yet have confidence in it.""\n\nWhile bitcoin’s ability to store value and facilitate transactions across borders has developed a loyal following among a relatively small group of people, Kurzweil said that wider adoption won’t rely on the power of its algorithm, but its historic reliability.\n\n""There’s no reason why currencies should be associated with particular national boundaries and governments,"" he said. ""However, currencies like the dollar have provided reasonable stability, bitcoin has not.""\n\nHowever, even as Kurzweil expressed his doubts about cryptocurrency as it currently exists, he argued that the promise of ""greater transparency"" and control over the creation process behind cryptocurrency could eventually lead a re-imagining of the way countries mint their native currencies.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Providing greater transparency, and blockchain does provide that, could be something adopted by leading currencies like the existing national currencies.""\n\nImage of Ray Kurzweil on a robot via Michael del Castillo\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

After experiencing huge growth in May, traders thought that consolidation awaits BTC/USD. Potential support levels of $2,300, $2,500, $2,700 looked really good. However, there was no potential level of growth being shown, and the price moved to historic highs.\n\nRight now, we see the following picture:\n\n$2,600 area may be a strong support level.\n\nVolatility decrease forecasts have proved themselves wrong.\n\nNews background is flat.\n\nCurrently, the price is in the zone of a potentially high support level. Buys from this level might be a good idea for intraday speculators. If the support level proves itself strong, it’s a signal for bulls. Therefore, trades with $2,800 goals will have a decent expectation value. Right now, a level retest is just underway.\n\nIf the $2,600 level does not remain, then one should wait for the next price bounce and a shaping of new support zones.\n\nThe main rule is to exclude short positions for BTC/USD. The pair is under serious pressure from the uptrend, so deals against the trend are a bad decision. One should also remember that volatility remains. Always wait for retests to have a more precise signal for position entry.\n\nETH/USD 09.06.2017\n\nThe $200 resistance zone appeared to be great. We saw new highs and the ETH/USD pair has seen a decent decrease in volatility in recent days.\n\nCurrently, there are three possible scenarios. In the order of probability:\n\n$250 is a strong support zone. It will be a good entry point, with goals of $280 and higher.\n\nA continuing decrease in volatility and the formation of a $240-$260 channel.\n\nThe correction and formation of a $220 support zone, or downgrade to a more global level of $200.\n\nThe most likely turn of events is the formation of new highs (reasons: global uptrend, news, which might change the picture).\n\nAlso, mind that on the market with such a super growth there are no short positions. Look for entry points with longs and always use stops. And follow Ethereum news updates.\n\nLTC/USD 09.06.2017\n\nLTC cheers up with stability. The support zone will be $23 and $36 - a good resistance zone but keep in mind possible huge volatility.\n\nDespite the decent width of the $23-$26 channel, it has very strong support and resistance zones.\n\nThe price is trading in the middle of the channel, and there are now signals for deals. For position opening, one should wait for a price at either side of the channel.\n\nCurrently, the most likely scenario are resistance zone tests.\n\nHitting one of the zones is unlikely. For the price to leave the channel, strong fundamental news is required or a strong decrease of the whole Blockchain market.\n\nETC/USD 09.06.2017\n\nETC/USD has not had strong movements since the beginning of the month. Right now, price trades in the $15.5-$18.7 range. Usually, such consolidation happens before fast growth.\n\nThe resistance zone is around $17. So if this level gets hit and fixed, most probably we will see maximum tests for this pair. It can also be mentioned for ETC/USD that many fundamental factors drive the growth.\n\nMind the following points:\n\nETC will have a limited emission of 210 mln tokens.\n\nInterest from Chinese investors.\n\nStrong community.\n\nIt’s still Ethereum. Just another branch of it.\n\nAll these factors show that current consolidation can lead to strong growth. So watch the resistance zone, and chances are during these changes there might be very good opportunities for deals.\n\nFollow the news, ETC can bring many surprises.', 'The increase of ransomware attacks like WannaCry are driving up Bitcoin prices, as companies are stockpiling the cryptocurrency in order to pay future ransoms, Citrix CEO Kirill Tatarinov said at the Corporate Governance conference in New York.\n\nThe statement came as a response given in a panel discussion on managing cyber risk, hosted by Jim Cramer. According to Tatarinov, the trend of storing up Bitcoin was seen in UK-based firms.\n\n""We\'ve seen people pay up after ransomware attacks,"" Tatarinov said in the panel. ""We\'ve seen people who are proactively bulking up on Bitcoin anticipating those attacks. This is happening.""\n\nSEE: Ransomware: The smart person\'s guide\n\nAccording to a press release about the panel, the price of Bitcoin has jumped from $1,692 to $2,785, since WannaCry hit the scene on May 12, 2017.\n\nThe The WannaCry ransomware (also known as WannaCrypt) spread rapidly among businesses in early May 2017. Hospitals and healthcare organizations across the UK were some of the biggest victims, which would seem to coincide with the idea that UK firms would be putting aside some Bitcoin to pay for the ransom on their data.\n\nThe vulnerability that WannaCry exploits was uncovered by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and hackers ran with it, locking up data in companies all over the world. The attack seemed to affect Windows 7 users the most, and ransoms ranged from roughly $300-$600, on average.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are often demanded as ransom for cyberattacks, as they are harder to track than traditional payment methods.\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nThe cost of Bitcoin is going up due to UK businesses hoarding the currency to pay off ransomware attacks, Citrix CEO Kirill Tatarinov said. The price of Bitcoin has jumped since the infamous WannaCry ransomware attack, recently trading at $2,785. WannaCry primarily affected Windows 7 users, and spread heavily through healthcare systems in the UK at first.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

To start with, two digital currencies conferences that held in New York during week buoyed the speculative prospects of Bitcoin because the industry experts hinted at the possibility of increased adoption. Secondly, the ghastly terror attack in Manchester England revealed once again that no one is safe and investors are becoming more open to the idea of seeking safety in alternative investments such as Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the fact that Bitcoin soared by an unbelievable 40% in just two trading sessions raises serious concerns about its inherent value. More interesting, is the fact that the record high was immediately followed by a heartbreaking decline of 12%. In essence, investors have valid reasons to be worried about the upside potential and volatility of the cryptocurrency. This article explores some of the key drivers of market volatility in Bitcoin.\n\nHere’s why Bitcoin remains volatile\n\nBad press still fuels skepticism\n\nBitcoin has been at the center of many scandalous events in the last couple of years and it takes a degree of optimism to ignore the naysayers to put your money in Bitcoin. The crackdown on the infamous Silk Road has branded Bitcoin as a sinister currency designed to fuel illegal transactions. Other events such as the failure of Mt. Gox and some data breaches have also contributed to the bad aura surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nThe bad vibes surrounding Bitcoin means that the cryptocurrency lacks a loyal cult-like band of investors. Hence, many current investors often rush to the exits in order to run with their capitals and gains at the first sign of trouble. More so, many potential adopters of Bitcoin are skeptical and scared of putting their money in the cryptocurrency because of the less than flattering reports they’ve read about Bitcoin.\n\nUnpredictable fluctuation in the perceived value of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is very similar to gold in its similarities to gold – in fact, it is currently worth more than gold. The main reason Bitcoin is being regarded as digital gold is the fact that it boasts a store value like gold. The total volume of Bitcoin that can ever be mined cannot exceed 21 million Bitcoin much in the same way that the total volume of gold in the world can’t be increased by human effort. In essence, Bitcoin offers a sharp contrast to fiat currencies.\n\nHowever, the store of intrinsic value inherent in Bitcoin is somewhat difficult to judge because news reports have a huge influence in driving its value. The fact that no one can seem to accurately pinpoint the perceived value of Bitcoin is another reason that the cryptocurrency tends to swing in relation to fiat currencies.\n\nBitcoin is yet to build a critical mass\n\nMost of the people who own Bitcoin are stashing the cryptocurrency away as speculative investments. Bitcoin however is meant to be spent to increase adoption. However, the large stashes of Bitcoin lying idle in wallets instead of being part of the “real” Bitcoin economy makes it hard to gauge the true intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, you can’t blame the people who have large stashes of Bitcoin because the lack of critical mass makes it hard for them to push their Bitcoin into the market without moving the market. Investors with more than $10 million in Bitcoin must be smart about liquidating their holding into cash in order to avoid an oversupply glut that could crash the market price of Bitcoin.', 'In Brief Russia has shown a great deal of interest in Ethereum-based blockchain technology. This could signal a move toward diversifying Russian interests with technology outside of fossil fuels.\n\nRussian Evolution\n\nYou’ve likely heard of Bitcoin as the future of money, but it is not the only cryptocurrency in the running for cashless economy dominance. The second largest among them is found on the Ethereum blockchain and is called Ether. One of the critical differences between Bitcoin and Ether is that while Bitcoin is first and foremost a currency, Ether, however, can be a platform for a variety of decentralized applications. In short, Ether can do much more than Bitcoin.\n\nThe adaptive quality of the platform may be part of the reason why Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, seem to be showing great interest in Ethereum. Reporting from Bloomberg reveals that Putin has been thinking about digital currency. “The digital economy isn’t a separate industry, it’s essentially the foundation for creating brand new business models,” he said at last week’s St. Petersburg Economic Forum.\n\nRussia could be looking at Ethereum as a way to expand the country’s economic profile of fossil fuels with technology. Bloomberg’s Leonid Bershidsky suggests that Putin is “…under the impression that, to wean the country off its oil dependence, they needed a major leap in some specific area of technology that wasn’t yet dominated by Western, Chinese, or Japanese tech giants.”\n\nGlobal Decentralization\n\nRussia is already testing an Ethereum-based blockchain system through its central bank. When Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova was asked if Russia is pursuing a national virtual currency, she did not deny the possibility. Currently, there are a few countries already experimenting with national cryptocurrencies.\n\nCoindesk cites eight cryptocurrencies from a variety of countries in the Eurozone. Among them are Iceland’s Auroracoin, Pesetacoin and Spaincoin from Spain, Gaelcoin from Ireland, and Aphroditecoin from Cyprus. Cryptocurrencies offer a lot of benefits including both transparency and security. The level of encryption essentially makes counterfeit transactions impossible.\n\nRussia is among the most powerful countries in the world. Adoption of this technology would be a major boon for the platform and could accelerate the expansion of its influence across the world.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The state of New Hampshire has officially proven itself as one of the Bitcoin-friendly states. On March 9, 2017, the House of Representatives passed a bill that will effectively exempt those using virtual currencies from registering as money transmitters, with Governor Chris Sununu enacting the law on June 2, according to public records.\n\nIn the past, New Hampshire legislators have also proposed a bill to accept Bitcoin payments in taxes and to completely deregulate Bitcoin.\n\nExemptions from regulations\n\nThe text of the bill is to exempt “persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency” from the state’s money transmitting regulations.\n\nThe bill is remarkable since it has strong grassroots of support in the state. However, top regulators have predominantly blasted it during its public hearings. In a hearing held last April, advocates strongly appealed to the legislators to approve the measure, while the other party, representatives from the state’s banking and justice department, wanted it to be abolished.\n\nState lawmakers were divided by the bill and it was witnessed during the vote held last March.\n\nThe House of Representatives held an 185-170 margin and in April, when the measure was raised to the Senate, public records show that it passed with a vote of 13-10. The legislation will come into effect on August 1, 2017.\n\nIn other states\n\nMeanwhile, there’s still uncertainty about the future of Bitcoins in the US. On March 11, the SEC rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. Yet, instead of losing its value, it grew stronger and went confidently high. Due to the recent turn of events, they have decided to review the rejection.\n\nRecently, the state of Montana provided funds to a local Bitcoin mining project as a part of its efforts to boost employment in the region. In New Hampshire, the governor signed a bill that excludes digital currency traders from the state’s money transmitting rules.\n\nAround the world\n\nWith an increasing interest in Bitcoin, investors are keeping tabs on how laws and policies around the world are being shaped by Blockchain technology. In fact, the Australian government believes that it will have a profound impact on the country’s economy.\n\nIn addition, Japan recently approved Bitcoin as a legal form of payment on April 1, 2017. Japan is the third largest economy in the world, based on gross national product, and such recognition and acceptance of the digital currency will, in turn, further strengthen the trustworthiness and credibility of Bitcoin. This domino effect has meant that Blockchain technology has given greater credibility to its digital currencies.', 'Over the past year, there have been fortunes made with winning investments like bitcoin, ether and ripple. And yet many people don’t know how to buy a single bitcoin. If you are new to digital assets, you may find it a tap dance just to get your money in, between digital wallets, online exchanges and questionable regulations. If you are perplexed by blockchain technology and feel more comfortable having your money in traditional markets, there are companies you can invest in to get the technology in your portfolio. Companies like IBM and Microsoft are betting heavily on blockchain tech, and are positioning themselves as leaders for the Internet of Everything.\n\n\n\nHere are some familiar, publicly traded companies that have invested in blockchain technology:\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Nasdaq\n\nMicrosoft has been sponsoring blockchain technology and is now a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), along with dozens of other companies including J.P. Morgan and Toyota. The alliance was formed to create standards for Ethereum in business use cases and to collaborate for a blockchain-based online marketplace. Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service platform also supports Ethereum, offering Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) tools for app developers.\n\nQuoted in the MIT Technology Review, Marley Gray, who leads Microsoft’s blockchain efforts, said, “We see a huge opportunity here. Enterprise-scale and enterprise-grade infrastructure is going to be vitally important for this financial infrastructure that will be woven using blockchain over these next few years.”\n\nAs Microsoft adds development tools and industry expertise, its early bets on blockchain tech should grow in years to come. The stock is now sitting at a 52-week high in the $72 range, with a trailing annual dividend of $1.53 per share.\n\nIBM (IBM), NYSE\n\nWith a different approach, IBM has joined Hyperledger in its foray onto the blockchain. Governed by corporations, Hyperledger has five blockchain and distributed ledger projects in incubation. The one that IBM is most invested in is called Fabric, a blockchain layer for enterprise solutions, which also has support from companies including Accenture, Airbus, American Express, CME Group, Intel and others.\n\nIn 2016, IBM focused specifically on introducing blockchain technology to the company’s artificially intelligent computer named Watson. Potential applications include machine-to-machine communications and payments, machine self-diagnostics, and machine self-learning.\n\nSimilar to the Microsoft Azure developer platform, IBM also offers blockchain building tools for corporations. Shares of IBM are now trading around $152, with a trailing annual dividend of $1.40 per share.\n\nOverstock.com (OSTK), Nasdaq\n\nIn 2014, Overstock.com started a VC fund to manage investments in firms leveraging blockchain technology. Named Medici Ventures, the fund now owns a 2.5 percent stake in Factom, which may become a leading data hashing company. And in April 2017, Medici invested $428,000 in Bitcoin company Ripio, a leading digital wallet and exchange in Argentina. Medici has also invested in several platforms related to equity trading.\n\nOverstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne has long been a proponent of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. In 2016, he announced a new subsidiary blockchain-based equity trading platform named t0, which he thinks could revolutionize equity trading. t0 combines cryptographically secure distributed ledgers with existing market processes to reduce time and costs, and increase transparency, efficiency and auditability.\n\nMedici continues to invest in promising blockchain startups. The company’s stock is trading in the $14.50 range, with a market cap of only $363 million.\n\nFastForward Innovations (FFWD.L), London Stock Exchange\n\nFastForward Innovations is a VC firm investing in emerging technologies. In 2015 FastForward made a £279,000 ($431,300) investment in Factom, which in 2016 was revalued at £560,000 ($709,800) after another successful funding round. The latter round included funds from well-known investor Tim Draper, who stated, “Governments also need better security from hackers, and the blockchain avails them of better security than they currently have. I believe that the Factom team has the opportunity and the potential to build a company greater than Oracle and Palantir and IBM combined.”\n\nFastForward is also invested in digital gaming, wearable technology and online media. The company’s stock is currently trading at £12.65 ($16.24).\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), OTC\n\nIf you want exposure to bitcoin and only bitcoin, you can buy into the Bitcoin Investment Trust through your traditional brokerage account. A financial product of Grayscale, which is owned by Digital Currency Group, GBTC is meant to track the bitcoin market price on behalf of investors, who then don’t have to buy and safekeep bitcoins for themselves.\n\nThe fund’s bitcoins are kept in deep storage vaults with Bitcoin company Xapo, where they are protected by intense cryptographic and physical security. With $390 million in assets under management, the fund has a market cap of $882 million on Yahoo Finance. Recently, the price of the fund has soared above the market price of bitcoin, which shows an active demand for a bitcoin investment vehicle. Currently trading at $516, GBTC is up from $101 just six months ago.\n\nBlockchain Capital\n\nThough not publicly traded, if you would like to dabble in digital assets but don’t know which projects to invest in, Blockchain Capital offers an interesting way to play this space. Calling themselves the “First Ever Digital Liquid Venture Firm,” Blockchain Capital invests in promising blockchain projects and the platforms that support them, and now has what looks to be a strong portfolio. Their holdings include industry leaders Blockstream, Bitfury, Coinbase, Ripple, ShapeShift, BitPesa and more.\n\nWhat is unique about Blockchain Capital is that they have their own digital token called BCAP, which represents an indirect fraction of non-voting interest in their Digital Liquid Venture Fund. By buying the BCAP tokens, you will own a share of the fund of companies that Blockchain Capital invests in. When the fund released these tokens to the public earlier this year, the entire offering of 10 million BCAP sold out in less than six hours, raising a total of $10 million USD at $1 per token. Today the token trades on Liqui.io for $2.25.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice.

And that doesn’t even include those who’ve never heard of the term!\n\nHowever, one scientist from the Swedish University of Agricultural Studies has seen potential in the underlying technology of bitcoin. According to Guillaume Chapron, author of a paper on the topic, the “blockchains” which carry time-stamped information about bitcoin transactions could provide a viable method of regulating environmental practices.\n\nTechnology and ecology in harmony\n\nAt times, our knowledge of the natural world seems to progress almost hand-in-hand with our increasing technological capabilities. Indeed, there are a variety of ways in which technology is being implemented in environmental analysis, and Chapron believes that the blockchains which knit all bitcoin transactions together could become another weapon in the fight against unsustainable practices.\n\nIn layman’s terms, a blockchain is a sort of incorruptible record of events, with everything logged on a decentralised computer. How can this help the environment? Well, with complete transparency and no doubts about the veracity of blockchain information, Chapron thinks that the technology could help us mend our environmental ways through four key areas.\n\nThe fourfold benefits of blockchains\n\nChapron’s paper highlighted the four main advantages of introducing blockchains into our environmental practices. They are:\n\nGreen practices in the supply chain. At present, the supply chain which delivers our food is incredibly long and complex, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for unscrupulous producers or transporters to cut corners without detection. With a blockchain, the sustainability of all of their efforts would be open for everyone to see. Ownership. In underdeveloped countries, disputes often arise between governments, companies and local communities about ownership of land. If an official land registry was recorded in a blockchain, it would provide a firm and immutable account of who owns what and since when. Policies. Currently, if you want to hold a vote on environmental policy concerning land, farming practices or development ideas, it takes a lot of time, money and effort – and is also vulnerable to corruption. With a blockchain election, people could vote remotely, easily and securely. Facilitating payments and improving incentives. Blockchains can be manipulated in such a way that a certain action (e.g. payment of a promised sum) is automatically triggered when a number of conditions (e.g. a quota of green energy is produced). Furthermore, they can also provide a virtual wallet for those without a bank account.\n\nIn each of the four areas, the advantage of blockchains boil down to transparency, which creates trust. Chapron believes trust is instrumental in creating a greener tomorrow.\n\nFlies in the ointment\n\nDespite these four benefits, blockchains are unfortunately not a cure-all tonic for the world’s woes. There are still several teething problems with the bitcoin technology, including its speed, energy consumption and lack of failsafes.\n\nFor example, if a personal forgets or misplaces their digital security code, their funds will be lost forever. It’s also almost three hundred times slower than Visa as a transaction handler, meaning it would be unfeasible on a large scale. And finally, it’s incredibly inefficient in terms of energy usage; at present, it consumes almost double the amount of energy that the whole of Google does.\n\nIf these kinks can be knocked out, however, Chapron believes blockchains and bitcoins could provide the key to transparency that the world needs in order to solve its environmental problems, once and for all.']"
06/10/2017,"['While the spotlight has been on Bitcoin due to its record-breaking all-time highs, other cryptocurrencies are also on the rise. Though many investors have lost the opportunity to earn millions from Bitcoin, other opportunities are rising up in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most notable ones is Ethereum.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community was left stunned by the recent meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin.\n\nCatering to investors\n\nEthereum is now moving into the spotlight due to its sharp growth of 13,633 percent since 2015 - a record that not many financial mediums have seen in a long time. In fact, experts expect Ethereum price to go even higher than it currently is.\n\nWith all the spotlight shifting focus, Ethereum has been constantly trying to improve their system to further cater to investors.\n\nThe Ethereum platform aims for zero downtime and strong security. With the system features alone, Ethereum already holds the upper hand on Bitcoin. With its fast transaction rates, Ethereum has moved further ahead of Bitcoin.\n\nRipe for the taking\n\nAside from Ethereum, there are other cryptocurrencies that hold even bigger potential for earning, due to their lower price.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum are continuously growing, they will eventually reach a point wherein investors won’t receive much profit anymore because they will have reached their peak value. However, the younger and newer cryptocurrencies are still at a low base, which means that they have the potential for future growth.\n\nRipple and other altcoins\n\nThe third highest in value after Bitcoin and Ethereum is Ripple, which has a price of $0.33 and is expected to grow.\n\nRipple is predicted to have a one-year return of 5,478 percent, following the trend of other digital tokens. Following after is New Economic Movement (NEM), which is priced at $0.257 and expected to have a one-year return of 14,998 percent.\n\nAnother digital token that is being targeted by investors is Bytecoin, which is currently priced at $0.00395 and expected to have a one-year return of 9,785 percent.\n\nAll figures were taken from a report by CoinMarketCap.\n\nThese are only a few of the smaller players that are making their way to the heights of Bitcoin. However, among all of the digital tokens that are found in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum is seen as the biggest winner after Bitcoin and seems to be making its way to all-time highs in 2017.', 'Bitcoin price gained decent bullish momentum above $2700 against the US Dollar, and it looks like BTC/USD is preparing for a move towards $3000.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price is in a strong uptrend, and likely to extend gains above $2880 against the US Dollar.\n\nThere is a crucial bullish trend line with support at $2750 forming on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nA break and close above $2880 might call for a move towards the $3000 level.\n\nBitcoin price gained decent bullish momentum above $2700 against the US Dollar, and it looks like BTC/USD is preparing for a move towards $3000.\n\nBitcoin Price Support Zone\n\nIn the last weekly analysis, I mentioned that there is a real chance of Bitcoin price retesting $2684 against the US Dollar. The price did gain pace, and traded higher for a move towards $2700. It also managed to trade to a new all-time high at $2285. The price is currently correcting lower, but remains well supported above $2700. It recently moved below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $2566 low to $2885 high.\n\nHowever, the downside move was prevented below $2700. There is a key bullish trend line with support at $2750 forming on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. It is preventing downsides and holding losses below $2750. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $2566 low to $2885 high is also holding losses very well. Below $2750, there is another bullish trend line just above $2700.\n\nOverall, there are many supports on the downside, starting with $2780 up to $2700. As long as the price stays above these supports, there can be a break above $2880. However, the stated level is acting as a strong resistance, but may not be able to prevent gains towards $3000.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is reducing the bullish zone, but showing positive signs.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently moving lower, but remains well above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $2700\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $2880\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

I know that they are the technology behind Bitcoin, that they are very clever and that they will have uses beyond digital currency.\n\nSomehow these blockchains are the ledger for all Bitcoin transactions and are the arbiter of who owns Bitcoins. And that pretty much exhausts my knowledge of blockchain.\n\nProbably because I do not understand the technology, I have not yet purchased Bitcoin. There is always a suspicion and wariness of something you do not understand: can I trust this ""money""?\n\nAfter all, isn\'t money supposed to issued and controlled by governments rather than shadowy computer nerds who are possibly serving black market adventurers?\n\nBitcoin and the other digital currencies sit outside and government command and regulation.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Blockchain could cut real estate costs by streamlining transactions\n\n* Blockchain technology could increase the trust in data that we never knew we\'d lost\n\nIn fact, there are plenty of instances throughout history of currencies that are not issued or controlled by a government. A small, personal example of this is when I was on an expedition to climb Mt Everest 20 years ago: Base camp was fairly isolated with little opportunity to bring in fresh supplies.\n\nOne item, always scarce but critically important, were AA batteries. It got to the point that you could trade just about anything for AA batteries (four AA batteries for a bottle of Scotch). A currency does not have to be issued or regulated by a government.\n\nA currency can be whatever a group of people agrees - and a lot of people have put their trust in Bitcoin.\n\nTo own some Bitcoin is to give currency diversification. If there is political or economic Armageddon, it just might be good to own some Bitcoin (a bit like gold).\n\nLike gold, Bitcoin has scarcity value, pays no interest and, also like gold, has its fervent believers. Gold bugs (and some who believe in cryptocurrencies) have an enthusiasm for their products that rivals religious rapture.\n\nUsually the purpose of Bitcoin purchase is to speculate or to diversify. The currency has made a few people rich: Someone who bought Bitcoin in 2010 for US$100 would now, according to CNBC, be sitting on more than US$50m.\n\nBitcoin has been extremely volatile. There has been rabid speculation that has seen the currency take wild swings up and down. That volatility may be no bad thing for speculators who are encouraged to ride those swings to profit or to loss.\n\nAs diversification Bitcoin probably also works. It is possible to imagine an economic crisis that hits some currencies hard but where cryptocurrencies maintain their value.\n\nI will never understand block chain technology but, then again, I do not fully understand how computers on jet aircraft work either and yet most weeks I quite happily get on a plane. So, I will buy some Bitcoin for some diversification and to learn more. I do think cryptocurrencies are here to stay and buying in will help keep me in touch with what they are all about.\n\n* Martin Hawes is the chair of the Summer KiwiSaver Investment Committee.

They acknowledged the agency has offered taxpayers some virtual currency guidance in regard to taxation, but additional guidance is needed to assist businesses that accept virtual currency.\n\nGuidance is also needed to help individual taxpayers, the congressmen noted in their letter. Guidance is needed to increase reporting on income gained or lost on virtual currency transactions.\n\nLawmakers Acknowledge IRS’ Past Efforts\n\nThe IRS has offered guidance on complying with tax compliance risks related to virtual currencies since 2007, the congressmen noted. The agency’s Electronic Business and Emerging Issues policy group has stated there are tax consequences related to virtual currency transactions. Current policies could lead to underreporting of such tax consequences.\n\nIn 2014, the agency released answers to frequently asked questions about virtual currency tax implications. The notice classified virtual currency as property and noted that a taxpayer could have taxable income as a result of certain transactions.\n\nTaxpayers, according to the 2014 notice, are required to report taxable income from various transactions. They are required to include it as part of taxable wages, realized gross income from virtual currency mining, or realized capital gains or losses from the sale or exchange of such currency held as a capital asset.\n\nTreasury Inspector Cites Shortcomings\n\nIn 2016, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reviewed the IRS strategy concerning income produced from virtual currencies. The inspector reviewed 36 comments the IRS received and identified areas in which it would be helpful for the IRS to give detailed guidance on record keeping and tax compliance in relation to virtual currencies.\n\nThe inspector suggested the IRS revise third party information reporting documents to determine the amounts of virtual currency used in transactions that are taxable.\n\n“We encourage the IRS to consider the recommendations of the TIGTA and take action based on those recommendations to increase taxpayer compliance with Notice 2014-21,” the congressmen noted in their recent letter.\n\nAlso read: IRS virtual currency guidance: bitcoin is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes\n\nIRS Urged To Engage Exchanges\n\nPolis and Schweikert also urged the agency to communicate with virtual currency exchanges to gain a better understanding of their ability to report information, such as tracking realized gains or losses and the amounts of currency used in taxable transactions.\n\nDays after the inspector general issued the report on the IRS’ strategy for taxing income related to virtual currencies, the IRS issued a summons to Coinbase to facilitate an investigation into possible tax evasion by users of virtual currencies at any time between January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'On June 5, the Nevada State Legislature became the first US state to approve a bill which will block local government entities from taxing Blockchain transactions.\n\nNevada is often recognized as the “silver state” due to its significant silver resources. It is also famous for being the home to Las Vegas, the city of entertainment. A big chunk of its revenue comes from casinos, and money is valuable in this location. For the first time, the state of Nevada has taken a significant step in paving the way for the continued progress of Bitcoin.\n\nOn March 30, Republican Senator Ben Kieckhefer introduced Senate Bill 398 intended to protect Blockchain transactions under the state’s Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.\n\nThe bill provides an accurate definition of the Blockchain, stating that it is:\n\n“An electronic record of transactions or other data which is:\n\nUniformly ordered; redundantly maintained or processed by one or more computers or machines to guarantee the consistency or non-repudiation of the recorded transactions or other data; Validated by using cryptography.”\n\nBitcoin transactions are tax-free\n\nSenate Bill 398, the Blockchain-friendly bill, was introduced by Kieckhefer last March and was approved unanimously by the Senate in April. The move was made right before the moving of the Nevada Assembly in May, whereby it was amended, approved and then turned back to the Senate who confirmed the amendments.\n\nIt was then sent to Governor Brian Sandoval whereby it was approved. In regards to the approval, Kieckhefer states:\n\n“The potential uses of Blockchain are limitless, and I’m confident Nevada’s entrepreneurs will find ways to use this technology to innovate and drive our economy forward.”\n\nHe added: “I can’t wait to see what comes next.”\n\nFollowing in the steps of Arizona\n\nThis is the second Blockchain-friendly bill that has been enacted into law within the past few days. On May 29, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed a bill which recognized the legality of Blockchain’s signatures and smart contracts.\n\nDomino effect\n\nBitcoin influences and has a domino effect upon every state and company, and this law aims to promote both Nevada and the Blockchain community.\n\nLet us hope that Nevada continues to become a decentralized Blockchain-friendly stateso that the amendments may focus on promoting honesty, integrity, validity and immutability - all of which Blockchain is known for.\n\nOne by one, US states are gearing towards the direction of Bitcoin.

Lawyers for the men had no comment on their cases.\n\nLaw enforcement officials investigating these cases say that public documents underrepresent the number of cases involving the dark web because many court documents don’t mention the online sources of the drugs.\n\nAnd many cases — including the death last year of the musician Prince from a fentanyl overdose — are still being investigated because of the relatively recent advent of the phenomenon.\n\n“It has come to play a key role in the overdose crisis,” said Tim Plancon, who oversees the Drug Enforcement Administration in Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio, states at the epicenter of the overdose crisis. “It’s expanded beyond just your traditional drug smuggling and trafficking. There is just a lot more involved with it when you are dealing with folks on the dark web with virtual currencies.”\n\nThe United States is not the only country dealing with an influx of mail-order synthetic opioids. Canada and several European countries have also made recent arrests of suspects accused of being major online drug dealers responsible for multiple deaths.\n\nBut the numbers are particularly staggering in America. In 2015, the last year for which national data is available, fentanyl and similar drugs killed 9,580 people, or 73 percent more than 2014. The number of deaths rose even faster last year in areas that have released figures, such as Ohio and New Hampshire. Over all, deaths from drug overdoses are soaring in the United States, and most likely exceeded 59,000 last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAuthorities say that most of the illicit supply of synthetic opioids is produced in labs in Asia and especially China, where many of the precursor chemicals are either legal or easier to procure.\n\nLatin American drug cartels are also getting synthetic opioids from Asia and moving them into the United States. But the operational ease of sending the drugs through the mail gives the method obvious appeal for Chinese producers, many of whom are technologically skilled enough to set up their own dark web shops.\n\nOne of the most frequently reviewed vendors of synthetic opioids on AlphaBay goes by the screen name BenzoChems. The vendor has shared online videos of his operations in China.\n\nIn a series of messages exchanged on AlphaBay’s internal messaging system, BenzoChems, who declined to provide his real name, said he had found that routing packages through Hong Kong, and then through the United States Postal Service, was the most efficient method of transit.\n\nSome Chinese producers also list synthetic opioids for sale on websites on the ordinary internet, without requiring users to navigate to them through a special dark web browser. But most of the recent criminal complaints in the United States appear to involve drugs procured through markets that exist only on the dark web.\n\nBenzoChems said that he had sold his products on ordinary websites, but those sites were quickly shut down by the authorities.\n\nDark web technology was originally developed by American intelligence agencies to allow for encrypted communication. News organizations, including The New York Times, use it to receive story tips from vulnerable sources.\n\nBut the illicit markets enabled by the dark web have made stopping the flow of deadly drugs much more complicated than it was when the authorities were trying to stop earlier waves of drug overdoses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We could give you a pretty good idea of the drug traffickers in town who can order kilos from Mexico — that’s a known commodity,” said Joseph M. Pinjuh, the chief of the organized crime task force in the United States attorney’s office in Cleveland. “What’s harder to track is the person ordering this from his grandmother’s basement.”\n\nLawmakers have tried to attack the problem by introducing legislation in Congress that would tighten the requirements on information gathered by the Postal Service. Last month, at a Senate hearing on the problem, Postal Service officials said they were working to collect information on more packages coming from China.\n\nIn recent months, though, the number of listings for fentanyl on AlphaBay and other dark web sites has been rising steadily.\n\nMs. Haun, the former federal prosecutor in San Francisco, said the tools that enabled dark web commerce made it very unlikely that the expanding traffic would be curtailed anytime soon.\n\n“It’s only going to increase, and increase the types of communities and markets that might not have had as easy access to it before,” she said."", 'Coin Center was invited to present testimony on Thursday to both the House Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection and the House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. They explained to both subcommittees the role that digital assets play in the world, what the future of the sector may look like, and how regulators could interact with the sector in a way that protects both the consumers and the innovators and encourages businesses in the industry to reside in America.\n\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, spoke to the House Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection. He explained to the subcommittee the revolutionary role blockchain technology is playing in the world around us. “Just as the PC democratized computing, and the web democratized news and entertainment, open blockchain networks are democratizing financial services.”\n\nVan Valkenburgh, however, drew a stark contrast between the regulatory safe harbors given to early internet innovators, specifically the Communications Decency Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and what little is being done to protect blockchain technology innovators today.\n\n“Both laws created safe harbors for infrastructure-building businesses,” noted Van Valkenburgh. The laws protected the creators of the internet’s infrastructure from third-party liability stemming from the users of that infrastructure.\n\nIn a conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Van Valkenburgh gave the example of Google. Google isn’t liable for a user who illegally downloads pirated material from a website whose link popped up on their search engine. This is because of the aforementioned Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which provided a safe harbor and allowed Google to continue to build the infrastructure of the internet (in this case, a search engine) free from crushing copyright liabilities.\n\nA similar distinction should be drawn when it comes to regulating innovators in blockchain technology, Van Valkenburgh noted in the conversation. There are two main entities innovating in the space: custodians who hold the valuable digital assets for consumers, and developers who are building the infrastructure of blockchain technology, but who don’t hold consumer funds. “These very different entities,” said Van Valkenburgh, “should be regulated in very different ways.”\n\nAn example of a “custodian” would be Coinbase, who regularly holds a consumer’s bitcoin, ether or other digital assets. An infrastructure developer would be more like a software wallet developer, who simply creates a tool with which a consumer can interact with the blockchain, safekeep their own digital assets and send transactions. The wallet developers themselves don’t exercise any control over their users’ digital assets.\n\nThe infrastructure developers, Van Valkenburgh points out, should not then be regulated as money transmitters who must get licensed state by state before starting their business. Their role is just to create portals and pipelines through which the transactions can flow, not to direct or control the transactions themselves. If the developer were found to be misleading the consumer with his/her software product, then ex-post-regulatory punishment may be appropriate, but again, there should not have to be a permission process that precedes these developers’ endeavors.\n\nWhen it comes to the custodial financial services, much of the regulation, and therefore protection for innovators, is at the state level. This makes it complicated for innovators to be based in the U.S. because of the plethora of different regulators in the space. Each regulator has the ability to affect how an innovator in blockchain technology operates.\n\nVan Valkenburgh said in his statement to the subcommittee, “In order to reestablish the U.S. as a leader we need to rationalize the chaos of financial services regulation, starting with state-by-state money transmission licensing.”\n\nThese custodial services, the ones holding a consumer’s value, should be regulated, argues Van Valkenburgh, but they should not have to repeat a licensing process 50 or more times over. Because of that costly barrier to entry, someone innovating in the space today would be best-advised to leave the U.S. and start their business in a country with simpler regulatory structures. We must regulate at the federal level if we want a simpler licensing process.\n\nBitcoin and Terrorist Financing\n\nOn the same day, Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, joined a panel to discuss with the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance any national security implications of these financial innovations.\n\nBrito explained to the subcommittee, “[Bitcoin] is open to bad actors who take advantage of it. Criminals certainly use it today, and we have begun to see some nascent interest from terrorist groups. According to a recent report on the potential of terrorist use of digital currencies by the Center for a New American Security, however, ‘Currently there is no more than anecdotal evidence that terrorist groups have used virtual currencies to support themselves.’”\n\nBrito views the infancy of interest by these bad groups as an opportunity to get in front of the problem. “This means there is time to develop an appropriate response to the possibility; a reasoned response that targets the threat while preserving the freedom to innovate.”\n\nThe main take-home message from this meeting, however, was that, as Van Valkenburgh explained in his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, there doesn’t actually appear to be much use of digital currency in the funding of terrorism. In fact, it is a bit unwieldy for terrorists to use because of the public nature of the distributed ledger. However, this shouldn’t stop the U.S. from developing solutions to curb the use of digital currencies by terrorists.\n\nWhat Coin Center wanted these subcommittees to understand, at the end of the day, is that digital currency is here to stay. It cannot be destroyed. The technology is neither bad nor good, but instead is a new tool at the disposal of anyone with a computer. To ignore the technology is to allow other countries to take the lead in adopting and incorporating it, and gaining the benefits of it in the process.\n\nBeginning the process of effectively and sensibly regulating digital currency is a must if the government wants to derive any benefits from its existence and prevalence.', 'Since its inception in 2009, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply, climbing from zero to more than $2,900 earlier this month. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced this appreciation during a time of low interest rates and meager yields, a situation that could change in the coming years.\n\nThis period of ultra-low yields has lowered the opportunity cost associated with investing in bitcoin. While bitcoin\'s price has thrived in this environment, investors could find the cryptocurrency less attractive if interest rates and yields push higher.\n\nShould yields, including dividend payments (regular payments made to stockholders for being owners of a company) increase, it could produce one more headwind for bitcoin\'s price by making dividend-paying stocks more appealing than the cryptocurrency. And all this seems to align with other challenges, such as the scaling issue, that the protocol is facing, which could also put downward pressure on the cryptocurrency\'s price.\n\nAccording to some analysts, this increase in dividend payments is right around the corner. And the increase is likely to eclipse the S&P 500 Index\'s dividend yield (which measures a company\'s dividend payments relative to its stock price), which for the last decade has remained below 3%.\n\nTax cuts and their effect\n\nOne of the reasons dividend payments could increase is because of the momentum to reform corporate income tax. If reform happens, lawmakers would be giving businesses fatter coffers, making it easier for them to reward investors through larger dividend payments.\n\nNotably, US Republicans have proposed a major overhaul of corporate income tax, which would cut the rate to 15%.\n\nThis reform could significantly bolster the financial resources of companies, making it easier for them to hike dividend payments, again, making these types of investments more lucrative than bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFurthermore, President Donald Trump has made lowering the corporate income tax rate – which is currently the highest of any Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nation at 35% – a key part of his tax policy initiatives. Currently, both the House and Senate have Republican majorities, which might give him a better chance of successfully enacting the proposals.\n\n""The likelihood of something getting passed this year is high,"" said Eric Ervin, president and CEO of Reality Shares, which focuses on dividend investing. While ""the timing is uncertain ... we have the right legislature and presidency"" to get tax cuts passed, he asserted.\n\nWhile, many of bitcoin\'s libertarian-leaning supporters (whose mantra is commonly ""taxation is theft"") might see tax cuts in a positive light, for bitcoin\'s price, these cuts could be unfavorable.\n\nRepatriation-based price loss\n\nA second tax reform proposed by Republicans would allow global companies to repatriate – or bring home – foreign earnings at a tax rate of 10%, far lower than the current rate.\n\nAccording to FactSet data, during the 12 months through Q3 2016, S&P 500 companies paid out roughly $431bn-worth of dividends. This figure could increase sharply if companies can repatriate more of their foreign earnings.\n\nReality Share\'s Ervin said:\n\n""If S&P 500 companies that pay dividends took all their overseas earnings and paid them out in dividends, their dividends could triple.""\n\nEffectively, companies that historically parked their money in countries with lower tax rates could bring that money back home and use it to pay out higher dividends, making investors less likely to put their money in bitcoin.\n\nAnthony Parent, the founding partner at law firm, Parent and Parent LLP, agreed with that sentiment. With more foreign funds available, companies will increase dividends right away, he said, which is likely to have a negative impact on bitcoin\'s price.\n\nHowever, bitcoin could come out of this unscathed. Kevin Quigg, chief strategist for investment manager ACSI Funds, said he doesn\'t expect the bolstering of company dividends to be the ""primary result"" of overhauling corporate tax.\n\nQuigg continued:\n\n""The primary benefit will be that companies will be allowed to deploy their cash in an efficient manner. More efficiently run companies certainly may find themselves in a position to boost their dividends, if they feel that is the best use of cash.""\n\nBut instead of increasing dividends, companies might use the additional resources to hire new workers, purchase new equipment or find new capital.\n\nWashington bottlenecks\n\nAs a result, it remains uncertain whether the bitcoin price would significantly suffer from tax reforms. Not only that, but reforms might be easier said than done in a combative Washington, DC, environment.\n\nQuigg told CoinDesk:\n\n""Although it seems like both Republicans and Democrats agree that corporate tax reform is necessary, the current environment in Washington is so politicized that it seems any reasonable tax reform will be attached to partisan agenda items.""\n\nAnd without these dividend-bolstering tax reforms, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to shine in the low interest rate and yield environment.\n\nSuch developments, it should be noted, would only impact one country as well, and bitcoin is seeing robust inflows from China and Japan in recent months.\n\nAll in all, should lawmakers fail to pass the tax overhauls, it could provide tailwinds for bitcoin – which has frequently been seen as a safe haven asset for those concerned about macroeconomic turmoil.\n\nUS Capitol image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

06/11/2017,"['The price of bitcoin topped $3,000 for the first time in history today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nAfter spending much of the last week seeking direction in the $2,700 to $2,900-range, the average price of bitcoin across major international exchanges edged up over this threshold finally at roughly 17:00 UTC.\n\nThe new record comes at a time when alternative digital assets are seeing robust inflows, with ethereum\'s ether token setting a new all-time high of more than $300 today as well.\n\nIndeed, analysts spoke to the ongoing broadening of the cryptocurrency market as a tide that is benefitting bitcoin.\n\n""The inflows into \'alts\' are greater than those into bitcoin. In other words, bitcoin is growing at a very nice pace, but non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies are growing even faster,"" cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Tim Enneking told CoinDesk.\n\nJehan Chu, managing partner at cryptocurrency fund Jen Advisors, agreed, noting that bitcoin is likely benefitting from new investor interest and the surging interest of ""cryptos like ether"".\n\nStill, Arthur Hayes, founder of Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange BitMEX, stated that bitcoin is still the ""most talked-about cryptocurrency"", even as returns become more substantial in other areas of the market.\n\nHayes told CoinDesk:\n\n""As investors marvel at bitcoin\'s historical returns and the returns of altcoins, their natural first purchase is bitcoin. Bitcoin has under performed other coins this year, it is now playing catchup.""\n\nInvestor Sean Walsh largely agreed, pointing to bitcoin\'s growing price as a sign of its place in the market as the first stop on a road to other assets.\n\n""Bitcoin still seems like the dominant gateway to [alternative digital assets]. So, many first purchase bitcoin in order to then trade their bitcoin for altcoins,"" he noted.\n\nThe development coincides with signs that the cryptocurrency market is maturing to support new inflows and increasing interest.\n\nAs noted by CoinDesk research analyst Alex Sunnarborg today, the cryptocurrency exchange market has never been more globally diverse or buoyed by such an array of possible inflows.\n\nSuch tailwinds have combined in recent weeks to bring new investor attention to bitcoin, with expectations for bitcoin\'s growth becoming more and more exuberant. Danish investment firm Saxo Bank went so far as to publish a forecasting report in which it placed the possible value of bitcoin at $100,000 in the next 10 years.\n\nCharts on mobile device via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'South Korea and Japan, the third and fourth largest Bitcoin exchange markets, are no longer showing Bitcoin price premiums.\n\nOn May 25, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin price surpassed $4,500 in South Korea as the market’s premium reached an extreme. Bitcoin was traded within the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market for as much as five mln Korean won, the highest bid in the global Bitcoin exchange market’s history.\n\nAt the time, the global average Bitcoin price barely reached $2,600 prior to a major market correction which ultimately led to a $700 decline. However, as analysts including Max Keiser noted, Bitcoin price always recovers beyond its initial peak and at the time of reporting, Bitcoin price is stable at around $2,900.\n\nStrict anti-money laundering (AML) policies and capital controls\n\nWhen evaluating premiums in markets such as Japan and South Korea, it is important to consider the strict anti-money laundering (AML) policies and capital controls both countries have implemented in the past. Japan, in particular, significantly strengthened its AML policies as the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds came into effect on October 1, 2016.\n\nGlobal law firm Hogan Lovells, which houses over 2,500 lawyers, explained the changes made by the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds in its report:\n\n“The 2016 Amendments are particularly relevant for banks and other financial institutions operating in Japan as it sets out revisions in relation to how certain institutions should determine suspicious transactions, verify contracts with foreign correspondent banks and implement additional in-house AML measures.”\n\nSimilar AML policies and capital controls currently implemented in South Korea made it difficult for traders and investors in both countries to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. Hence, even when there was a 30 percent premium in South Korean and Japanese Bitcoin exchange markets, traders found it extremely difficult to profit from the premium rates. Even if they found a way to do it, large amounts of transfers would be immediately flagged by strict AML systems.\n\nFactors behind the extreme premium rates\n\nSouth Korea and Japan’s extreme premium rates did not dematerialize overnight. It began with the stabilization of the Chinese market and the resumption of withdrawals led by the big three Bitcoin exchanges in China - Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC.\n\nAs the global market stabilized and the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market recovered, premiums started to decrease. Chinese exchanges, which used to process Bitcoin trades around 25 percent lower than the global average price, began to process trades at a value higher than the global average Bitcoin price.\n\nDuring that time, liquidity in the Japanese and South Korean markets also increased drastically. Some of the largest companies in Japan, including the multi-billion dollar internet conglomerate GMO, opened a Bitcoin exchange to address the rapidly increasing demand for Bitcoin and South Korean exchanges also began to focus on providing higher liquidity toward traders.\n\nUltimately, the recovery of the Chinese market acted as a catalyst for global Bitcoin exchange market stabilization and standardization.', 'Bitcoin price is consolidating in a rising wedge pattern but bullish pressure seems to be very much in play.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is moving higher but is currently in a consolidation pattern.\n\nPrice has formed higher lows and higher highs, creating a rising wedge formation visible on its 4-hour time frame.\n\nBitcoin is testing support at the moment and could be due for a move back to the resistance around the recent highs or the $3000 level.\n\nBitcoin price is consolidating in a rising wedge pattern but bullish pressure seems to be very much in play.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside. In other words, a bounce off support around the $2800-2900 levels could be more likely than a break lower. The gap between the moving averages has been pretty steady, indicating the presence of sustained bullish momentum.\n\nHowever, stochastic is already turning lower from the overbought zone to suggest a return in selling pressure. RSI is also heading south after a brief stay in the overbought region, also indicating a potential return by bears. If so, bitcoin price could retreat to the area of interest around the $2600 mark, which is also near the 100 SMA dynamic support.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nThe dollar is putting up a bit of a fight against its peers in the past few days as the event risk from Comey’s testimony appears to have passed. Recall that traders are worried that this particular investigation could yield evidence that Trump committed an impeachable offense, which either has something to do with sharing intelligence information to Russian officials or impeding the investigation on former national security adviser Flynn.\n\nHowever, Comey’s statement didn’t reinforce either of the speculations so traders are regaining confidence that the Trump administration could move past this setback and continue the progress in implementing fiscal policy changes, particularly tax reform.\n\nFrom the bitcoin industry side of things, there have been no major updates so far but the latest ones have been positive for the cryptocurrency and supportive of more gains. Of course any negative reports could lead to dips in bitcoin price, especially since it is moving close to record highs and the chance for profit-taking is strong.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

From a unit price of $8.52 in the beginning of the year, Ethereum reached its all-time high this week, topping at an incredible $269.36 per unit. The price is up by over 3,000 percent since January 2017.\n\nThis week, Ethereum traded at an all-time high of $269.36, according to data from WorldCoinIndex. It has stabilized slightly below that price since June 6. The figure below retraces its 3,000 percent growth since the beginning of 2017.\n\nMany factors have led to this record rally, which fit pretty well in the quadriptych of the EEA, ICOs, South Korea and Russia.\n\nThe creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)\n\nIn March 2017, Blockchain startups, research labs and global companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). The goal of this alliance is to collectively develop industry standards and encourage collaboration between its various members.\n\nThe EEA now counts hundreds of members, among which include Microsoft, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Deloitte, Accenture, ING, ConsenSys and the Toyota Research Institute. The alliance is seeking to work on common projects and contribute to the future of the Ethereum permissionless Blockchain by focusing on its scalability, privacy and confidentiality.\n\nJulio Faura, chairman of the EEA, says:\n\n“The enthusiasm around EEA is remarkable. Our new members come from varying industries such as pharma, mobile, banking, automotive, management consulting, and hardware as well as the startup community driving innovation. It’s great to see everyone come together and build the next generation of our economy on Ethereum blockchain solutions.”\n\nSuch an initiative is without a doubt giving legitimacy to Ethereum, and played a role in its recent rally.\n\nThe boom of ICOs\n\nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a new way for Blockchain startups to raise millions of dollars in short periods of time, by selling custom tokens. This type of offering has flourished without a legal or regulatory framework, and it is perhaps exactly what made it so attractive.\n\nSmith + Crown is a Blockchain consulting firm that tracks ICOs and their achievements. According to the firm, ICOs raised $101 mln in 2016. Since the beginning of 2017, the total amount raised has passed the $300 mln bar, which represents a near 200 percent increase in less than six months.\n\nMany of the recent initiatives in this field are based on the Ethereum Blockchain due to its smart contracts capabilities, and thus, ICOs use Ether tokens and, therefore, contribute to raising the unit price of ETH.\n\nSouth Korea an Ethereum powerhouse\n\nSouth Korea’s three largest digital currency exchanges have integrated Ether, making it the largest Ethereum exchange market with a $335 mln daily trading volume. Since then, and over the past few months, the country accounted for around 38 percent of the total trading volume of Ethereum.\n\nThe sudden interest in ETH from South Korea is so strong that the ETH/KRW pair processes more trades than the ETH/BTC pair, which used to account for over 50 percent of all Ethereum trading.\n\nVladimir Putin meets Vitalik Buterin\n\nAt Cointelegraph, we recently commented on this historical meeting. Even though not many details have been revealed following it, we do know President Vladimir Putin is ready to support the development of Blockchain technology.\n\nThis interest has been further confirmed by referring to this meeting on the Kremlin’s website and through its Press Secretary. These are, in my opinion, the four main factors that altogether drove the price of Ethereum to its all-time high this year. What will come next?', 'The pace at which the world\'s leading central banks will shrink their balance sheets has come into sharpened focus, but it seems investors don\'t have to worry yet about China pulling in the reins.\n\nBloomberg has an interesting story looking at the People\'s Bank of China\'s balance sheet and how many market experts reckon it could expand further. Here\'s a little taste:\n\nWhereas the Federal Reserve’s $4.5 trillion asset pile is set to be shrunk and the European Central Bank’s should stop growing by the end of this year as the outlook brightens, China’s $5 trillion hoard is here to stay for the time being -- and could even still expand, according to the majority of respondents in a Bloomberg survey of People’s Bank of China watchers.\n\nThe PBOC balance sheet is a fundamentally different beast from its global peers -- run up through capital inflows and trade surpluses rather than hoovering up government bonds -- but it still matters for the global economy. Changes in the amount of base money in the world’s largest trading nation are having a bigger impact than ever, making the variable key for stability in a year when political transition in Beijing is in the cards.\n\n""China is more than a couple of years away from balance-sheet contraction,"" said Ding Shuang, chief China economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong, pointing out that the growth in the broad money supply is still behind the government’s target.\n\nBitcoin\'s red-hot run continues, with the digital currency powering through $3,000. Here\'s CNBC with the details:\n\nBitcoin traded above $3,000 for the first time on Sunday, continuing this year\'s massive surge and helped by increased demand from Asia-based investors.\n\nAfter trading in a range for the last week, bitcoin climbed to an all-time high Sunday of $3,012.05, according to CoinDesk.\n\nOn Chinese exchanges such as BTCC, the currency traded about $40 to $60 above that price. Last week, several major Chinese bitcoin exchanges allowed customers to resume withdrawals of the cryptocurrency, after halting withdrawals in early February amid scrutiny from the People\'s Bank of China.\n\nAsia\'s e-commerce platforms were in the spotlight last week thanks to Alibaba\'s two day investor meeting, but it won\'t be long before U.S. investors will have another e-commerce play to focus on. The South China Morning Post has a story about how Southeast Asian e-commerce and gaming platform SEA Ltd, which is based in Singapore, is preparing for a $1 billion IPO in New York. Here\'s a glimpse of the story:\n\nSea Ltd, Southeast Asia’s most valuable start-up, is prepping for a US$1 billion initial public offering in the United States, a move that would be a major pivot for Southeast Asia’s rapidly expanding tech industry.\n\nThe online gaming and e-commerce company, formerly known as Garena, has filed for a listing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a recent report by Bloomberg. The Singapore-based company has appointed Goldman Sachs to be its lead adviser and it could list as early as 2018. A representative with Sea declined to comment on the rumoured IPO.\n\nSea is one of the region’s few unicorns, a tech business valued over US$1 billion. It recently secured US$550 million in a new funding round from some of Asia’s biggest conglomerates.\n\nThese included GDP Venture, a venture capital firm in Jakarta founded by Martin Hartono, son of Indonesia’s richest tycoon R Budi Hartono.', 'Bitcoin continues its seemingly endless bull rally, gaining an additional 15% this week, closing convincingly above a nasty candle wick at $2745. New all time highs continue to be made week over week, with the spot price having now broken $3000.\n\nAny concerns for a more sizeable correction, or even the end of the bull run entirely, were eradicated when the price made a higher high, albeit an extremely unlikely event in and of itself. This signifies more than anything that underlying bullish momentum has not waned.\n\nOn June 4th, Network difficulty had its first double digit increase since January 22nd, now up a staggering 79.4% for the year. Difficulty increases as a function of hash rate, which also continues to break all time highs, now sitting at nearly 5 trillion GH/s.\n\nDespite the largely unchanged support over various block size and scalability options, there is overwhelming support for SegWit amongst the community.

Anomalies on the graph represent Sybil attacks, which is similar to ballot stuffing.\n\nLocalBitcoins saw a slight decrease in global volume this week, with the hardest hit region being China, which is expected considering deposit and withdrawal were recently re-enabled on the domestic exchanges.\n\nOver the past 6 months, the share of USD and JPY volume has risen substantially thanks to the shifting regulatory milieu in China.\n\nOn the exchange side for the past day, USD continues to hold the highest trading volume. A premium has returned to BTCCNY, something not seen since before the regulatory crackdown.\n\nBitfinex, which has somewhat miraculously risen from the ashes of it’s August 2016 hack, holds the highest volume traded amongst US exchanges, closely followed by GDAX.\n\nDespite being king in BTC volume traded, USD deposits and withdrawals remain halted on the exchange. This plays a large factor in the USD swap rates, which have been increasing since April, after the halt began.\n\nWith $389M in Assets Under Management, the Bitcoin Investment Trust ($GBTC) continues to hold a sky high premium over the spot price. This is likely due to those trying to gain exposure to the bitcoin market without having the knowledge or ability to trade the bitcoin spot market themselves. Each share currently represents 0.09289534BTC, setting Bitcoin price on this exchange at ~$4900 as of market close on Friday.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe trend is your friend until the end, and the trend has been fairly obvious the past few years, even more so this past year. Traders will continue to attempt to determine the strength and duration of the current trend. With price pushing all time highs, indicators relying on market memory are no good. This leaves us with indicators which project price, such as fib extensions, chart patterns, and pitchforks for resistance targets. The overall position of trend volatility can also be assessed with Bollinger Bands. Support can be gleaned from Ichimoku Cloud and/or moving averages.\n\nThe two active chart patterns are a large high timeframe Cup and Handle and a smaller timeframe Inverted Head and Shoulders within the handle.\n\nBoth patterns are slightly messy, but should be considered. The Cup and Handle is validated through the shape of market structure, descending volume profile, and handle which does not break the 50% fib. The Inverted Head and Shoulders is validated through the shape of market structure, descending volume profile, an on volume breakout of diagonal neckline resistance, and a throwback to that resistance which confirmed as support. The 1.618 fib extension of Cup and Handle and Inverted Head and Shoulders are ~$3600 and ~$3100 respectively, with a non-conservative measure move for the Cup and Handle just above $4000 (not shown).\n\nThe median line (red) of the Pitchfork gives the expected mean of the trend. Price will continually attempt to return to this diagonal. Each diagonal of the Pitchfork can be thought of as a potential reversal zone or support/resistance line. The upper yellow diagonal zone being ‘most overbought,’ or the top bounds of the trend, and lower yellow diagonal zone being ‘most oversold,’ or the bottom bounds of the trend.\n\nThe highest timeframe a Pitchfork currently makes sense is the four hour chart, this suggests trend is moving extremely rapidly. Using the anchor points shown above, this Pitchfork holds price consolidating at the median line, with an upper boundary of $3600-$4200 within the next few weeks. If price falls below this Pitchfork, around $2500, it becomes invalidated and price would likely be held by support on a higher timeframe pitchfork.\n\nBollinger Bands, a measure of volatility channels, are showing evidence for weakening bullish momentum with a bearish divergence on %B on the weekly chart and on both %B, RSI, and volume (not shown) on the daily chart. Percentage Bandwith (%B) measures price placement relative to upper and lower bands and can be used similar to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), so a higher high in price contained within the upper limit of the bands would be seen as bearish divergence.\n\nThe bearish RSI divergence on the daily chart has been growing since May 11th. Aside from twice in 2013 (not shown), this is the widest the BBands have ever been on the weekly chart.\n\nThe Ichimoku Cloud is a constant, auto-drawn indicator which quickly offers an immense amount of valuable information on any time frame. The Cloud is best used at higher time frames as more data generally provides more accurate signals and less false positives.\n\nThe indicator uses moving averages and dynamic support and resistance to make projections of key zones, as well as capturing 80% of any given trend. As long as the price remains above the Cloud, sentiment remains bullish. Price in the Cloud indicates a neutral trend, and below the Cloud indicates a bearish trend.\n\nWhen the Tenkan (T) is over the Kijun (K) sentiment is bullish. K over T would indicate bearish sentiment. When the Lagging Span (LS) is above the Cloud and above the price sentiment is bullish, below the Cloud and price would indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nThe best entry signals for the Cloud occur when the trend is obvious, but 1 or 2 of the signals have yet to become confluent with a higher time frame trend. All signals on this timeframe are bullish, and should therefore not be used as a measure of current entry signals.\n\nThere are currently no actionable entry signals on the daily chart, but support on the Tenkan and Kijun lines are printing at ~$2400 and ~$2050 respectively.\n\nSignals on the four hour timeframe are all bullish as well, meaning there are no actionable entry signals at this time. Traders typically use the Kijun and bottom of the cloud as support targets, ~$2900 and $2400 respectively. A countertrend short trade entry signal would be a candle close inside the cloud with the target being the opposite edge of the cloud, $2400.\n\nNo actionable long entry signals are present on the one hour chart either. The last two entry signals would have been the TK cross with price above cloud on the 9th (yellow) and the pseudo TK cross earlier today (yellow). Bids placed on the Kijun at $2900 would represent a safe re-entry on this timeframe.\n\nThe current rally is moving so fast that even using 50/200 EMA crosses you need to move down to the 30 minute time frame for an entry on May 31st with no current signal to exit.\n\nConclusion\n\nOrganic growth metrics of the network, which include mining power approaching 5 trillion GH/s, and bullish buying demand remain strong worldwide. SegWit and UASF continue to gain support throughout the community as we near closer to the August 1st flag day. The US and Asian countries continue to lead the world in global exchange traded volume. Technicals are showing price projections of $3100-$4200 within the next few weeks. Oscillators and volume on high time frames are showing evidence for growing bearish divergence. Ichimoku Cloud is showing strong support at $2900, $2500, and $2050. The moving average bullish entry signals are showing no actionable entries on most time frames. Time to sit back and HODL!', 'Is bitcoin’s price in a bubble? Those who say so believe people are buying the cryptocurrency is for speculative purposes versus its original purpose – for transactions.\n\nNathan Martin, writing in Economic Edge, believes most are buying bitcoin because it’s a better store of value. Bitcoin provides a better store of value than assets that are controlled by banks, he claims, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Hence, the number of people using bitcoin will continue to increase.\n\nNo Other Good Store Of Value\n\nPeople cannot earn anywhere near the pace of actual inflation by putting their money in traditional savings accounts. Central banks control the currencies most people use and are manipulating these currencies to keep interest rates low.\n\nStocks, bonds and real estate are all in a bubble, as is the U.S. dollar, Martin noted. Gold and silver are also being manipulated by central banks.\n\nHence, there is no good store of value. “Retirees on fixed incomes simply cannot, and will not be able to keep up as the impossible math of the dollar debt continues on its vertical ascent,” Martin wrote.\n\nWhy Bitcoin’s A Better Bet\n\nBitcoin is a better store of value for the following reasons.\n\n1. Bitcoin is decentralized. Martin and many others consider this the most important characteristic of bitcoin. No central power controls bitcoin. Central banks could indirectly manipulate cryptocurrencies by creating derivatives and exchange traded funds based on those cryptocurrencies. But this will not change bitcoin’s underlying store of value.\n\nShould central banks create derivatives based on bitcoin, Martin encourages people to buy bitcoin directly. Banks cannot manipulate what they don’t control.\n\n2. Bitcoin’s supply is limited. There will only be 21 million bitcoins created, and 80% of this number has already been created. The more funds invested in bitcoin, the greater the value of each bitcoin. Other blockchain currencies could affect bitcoin’s value, but all the other cryptocurrencies combined are not yet equal to bitcoin’s market value. In addition, those cryptocurrencies that don’t have limited supply will not hold their value.\n\n3. Bitcoin is secure. Encryption and decentralization make it so. It can be stored in cyber “vaults,” where owners keep a hard copy of the encryption cipher. While a bitcoin exchange and a computer can be hacked, bitcoin that is in a “vault” will not reside in the exchange or the computer, and only the owner has the code to access the stored bitcoin. No one can confiscate it.\n\n4. Bitcoin transactions are stored on a public ledger that lists all confirmed transactions. Decentralized bookkeeping is more secure than centralized ledgers.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin is no bubble in climb to $3,000\n\nA Bubble Is Far Away\n\nBitcoin will someday be in a bubble, but that time is far away, Martin noted.\n\nOne benefit of cryptocurrencies is that they coexist with other forms of money used for transactions. Bitcoin is not in a bubble. Instead, people are using it to park their dollars so central banks cannot destroy their value.\n\nVolatility will continue for bitcoin, as nothing moves in a straight line. Martin believes cryptocurrencies will trade along with sovereign currencies and eventually replace them.\n\nHe will not be convinced that the growth of bitcoin’s price has stalled until its market cap rivals that of the United States’ money supply, which is $13.5 trillion.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Jonathan Darcie has a PhD and Masters in General Theory of Law and Tax Law, and is partner of a law firm in Brazil with ongoing consulting for digital currency businesses.\n\nIn this CoinDesk opinion piece, Darcie speaks out about proposed cryptocurrency rules in Brazil, arguing that attempts to regulate the industry at this stage are premature and misguided.\n\nLiving in Brazil over the last four years has been an experience of watching a real and live – and even more interesting, some would say – version of TV\'s ""House of Cards"".\n\nThe still in-course criminal investigation called \'Operação Lava Jato\' (Operation Car Wash) has become the most comprehensive criminal investigation in the history of Brazil, sending many dozens of politicians, CEOs and executives of the most important Brazilian companies to prison.\n\nAt the same time, the country has entered the most intense recession of its history, leading businesses to bankruptcy, millions of people to unemployment and setting up a scenario of economic chaos.\n\nIt is within this window of never-seen-before-events (the last one being a wiretap of the actual president of Brazil) that the Brazilian House of Representatives is doing something else unprecedented – initiating a debate about regulating bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe environment today\n\nWhen reading the news that a legislative commission will study and regulate cryptocurrencies, one might have the impression that local startups will now have limitless freedom to transact and form businesses.\n\nUnfortunately, that\'s not even close to the reality of any business in Brazil.\n\nAs it happens with nations that have their legal system built under a civil law tradition, every innovation that emerges joins the current status quo to become legally equivalent of other similar technologies.\n\nBack in 2009, if someone living under Brazilian law made his or her first transaction buying and selling bitcoin at a profit, they had to pay (or should have paid) income tax in order of 15% of its capital gains (unless the total amount involved was less than to R$35,000 ($10,600) in a month, when a tax exemption was applicable).\n\nThis means the current situation is the same for cryptocurrencies as it is for guitars, books or any other goods involved in transactions.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were never legal currencies under Brazilian law, though a federal law issued a definition of digital currency by declaring it as a resource stored in a device or electronic system.\n\nAs this definition didn\'t capture the nature of cryptocurrencies in general – covering private cryptographic keys instead of \'digital currency\' itself – their legal status is given by Brazilian Civil Code, which defines them as regular assets. Being a movable asset means that transactions are possible without any kind of restriction – except for the duty of paying taxes and declaring its property to Brazilian IRS.\n\nThe business impact\n\nFor businesses, the requirements are a bit more complicated.\n\nIt\'s not easy to have a business in Brazil. Anyone wanting to do so needs to hire an accountant and a lawyer to prepare a contract equivalent to the articles of organization in the US. Afterwards, there is the need to obtain a taxpayer ID issued by the federal, state and municipal governments.\n\nSmall businesses are obliged to deliver monthly and annual income information for tax purposes (normally to more than one branch), including information about employees. The obligations more than double for larger businesses.\n\nThe exact same process is applied to digital currency businesses. It doesn\'t matter if we are speaking of an exchange, wallet or payment service: there is not much freedom involved.\n\nBut differently from most businesses, cryptocurrency-related ventures that deal directly with large sums of money, securities, art, jewelry or other assets are subject to very specific duties regarding anti-money laundering policies and compliance in general.\n\nThese obligations and duties were enacted in 1998 through a federal law written more than 10 years before the first bitcoin transaction happened.\n\nIt is therefore required that digital currency businesses comply with strict compliance policies and keep logs of transactions made within its field of operation, reporting activities considered suspicious to the federal council that controls financial activities.\n\nThe congressional debate\n\nConsidering the intent of congress to specifically regulate cryptocurrencies, most people at this point might be asking: ""What is left to be regulated?""\n\nCongressmen involved in the special commission gave statements covering tax aspects and the relation of digital currencies with criminal activities, though this suggests they don\'t have a strong familiarity with the current legal status of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt\'s notable then that the timing of the debate follows a recent kidnapping in which criminals asked for the ransom to be paid with monero and z-cash. Just a few weeks later, the WannaCry ransomware attack struck international organizations, bringing negative attention to bitcoin.\n\nIt may have seemed like an opportunity for Congress to present the public opinion with a (supposedly) good agenda.\n\nFirst presented in 2015, the discussed bill adds nothing to the digital currency legal environment.\n\nThere are three goals in the bill:\n\nTo consider digital currency payments to be legally payment arrangements, which they already are due to its legal definition\n\nTo declare that digital currency businesses must comply to the federal law of consumer protection, something that they indisputably already have to\n\nTo state that operations involving digital currencies are subject to anti-money laundering policies, which they already are, as previously explained.\n\nSo as long as the bill passes in the current form, owners and businesses should be just fine.\n\nGiven the tradition of complicating things and the Brazilian actual political crisis, however, \'just fine\' might be simply too much to ask for.\n\nBrazilian federal court image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Its users can now purchase Bitcoin from within the application.\n\nIn order to provide its customer, the new feature, BTC.com has entered into a partnership with another trusted name in the cryptocurrency industry, Kraken. With the integration of Kraken Direct service, users will now be able to purchase the digital currency by making ACH bank transfers. While this new service offers added convenience to the cryptocurrency users, it is currently limited to those from 49 US states.\n\nIn the announcement, BTC.com mentions that the integration with Kraken Direct service is just the beginning and the company will soon expand the feature to other countries in the world as well. To keep up with its promise, the company will probably forge new partnerships with other regional players outside of the United States.\n\nIn an email sent out to all the existing BTC.com wallet users, the company provides detailed instructions on using the new feature. As per the instructions, users can successful execute the transaction to purchase any required amount of bitcoin within minutes. In order to initiate the fund transfer, users will have to create an account with Glidera, the only purchase method supported at the moment.\n\nUsers can purchase Bitcoin by selecting the “Buy Bitcoin” option on their wallet’s sidebar. Once selected, they will be required to select their region (supported in the United States only) followed by the payment option — Glidera. If the user already has a Glidera account, he/she can directly log into it. Otherwise, they can easily create a new account. Once logged in, they can choose the amount of Bitcoin they want to buy (in BTC or USD) and execute the payment over ACH.\n\nThe funds will appear after the approval of ACH transaction, which might take anywhere between 3-4 days, following which they will get the bitcoins credited to their account. The cryptocurrency purchase option included in BTC.com wallet definitely makes the whole process of buying Bitcoin easier. But the waiting period is something that needs to be improved. It will be great if BTC.com starts offering Credit and Debit Card payment option, which could cut down the time to less than an hour.\n\nRef: BTC.com | Image: NewsBTC']"
06/12/2017,"['The price of bitcoin may have just topped $3,000 for the first time, but that doesn\'t mean the digital asset is leaving its historical volatility behind.\n\nAt roughly 10:00 UTC this morning, bitcoin prices fell abruptly, dropping more than $300 in a span of minutes from $2,980 to a daily low of $2,650. The more than $300 decline came just hours after bitcoin climbed to a new high of $3,000 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, a weighted average of prices across major exchanges.\n\nBut while precipitous, the decline was short-lived, with prices returning to just under $2,900 a half hour later on the BPI.\n\nAccording to analysts, early indications are the price capitulation could herald that the bitcoin price has diverged too far from fundamentals.\n\n""It is just standard technical divergences – we made a higher high on less volume and waning momentum,"" BTC VIX, organizer of the bitcoin trading forum Whale Club, told CoinDesk. ""[This could] signal a weakening trend.""\n\nIndeed, the decline coincided with the closure of millions of dollars in long positions on OKCoin, one of the major leveraged bitcoin exchanges, a development that likely exacerbated the decline.\n\nAll in all, however, the price of bitcoin has been surging of late.\n\nThough today\'s decline could give investors caution, bitcoin has risen more than $1,000 over the last 30 days as investor interest in cryptocurrencies continues to increase amid a period of robust gains for the asset class.\n\nSee-saw image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'As Bitcoin price continues to appreciate, breaking its own records, many people have come forward with stories on how they invested in the cryptocurrency. Some have said that they liquidated all their Bitcoin holding in the past few days fearing the onset of a price bubble, and there are those who have decided to make Bitcoin their sole investment. Recently another famous personality has chosen to divulge his tryst with the popular cryptocurrency.\n\nSteve Wozniak, the person who co-founded Apple Inc., with Steve Jobs, has mentioned that he has made some gains in this year’s Bitcoin price rally. Wozniak has stated that he initially invested a small amount in the cryptocurrency for fun. He bought about $700 worth of Bitcoin a while ago after a previous unsuccessful attempt back when the price was around $70.\n\nEven though the challenges to buy Bitcoin at that time did make him lose out on an opportunity to own a highly successful alternative financial asset early on, he did eventually succeed. Since his purchase, the cryptocurrency has witnessed few extreme fluctuations in value, falling as low as$350 at one time, only to hit the $3000 in the recent days.\n\nSteve was quoted in an article saying,\n\n“I remember getting interested in bitcoin some time ago. It was $70 for a bitcoin, man and I went online and you had to have a special bank account at a special bank and I couldn’t buy any bitcoin so I gave up. Eventually I got some of them at the $700 stage and it went down to $350. I didn’t invest, I did it so I could play with bitcoin.”\n\nThe tech wiz also vouches for the cryptocurrency’s underlying technology and its qualities that have got the financial institutions interested in its implementation. Wozniak, like many others in the Bitcoin community, feels that the cryptocurrency still has a long way to go before people can readily use it to pay for their everyday needs. But, hopes are high and the cryptocurrency is eventually going to get there.\n\nRef: CNBC | Image: NewsBTC', 'Bitcoin is unfolding an impulsive pattern to the upside, which means that red wave 4 correction has ended around the 1800 mark.

On May 31, Van-Petersen told CNBC that bitcoin’s price could see a meteoric rise that would translate to an increase of more than 3000% from its recent record high.\n\nThe numbers are based on Van-Petersen’s prediction that cryptocurrencies will be equal to 10% of the average daily volumes (ADV) of fiat currency trade in 10 years. Trading in foreign exchange (FX) markets averaged $5.1 trillion per day in April 2016, according to the Triennial Central Bank Survey of FX and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. The figure was down from the $5.4 trillion reported in April 2013.\n\nTen percent of $5.1 trillion indicates around $510 billion of average daily volumes (ADV). With Bitcoin accounting for 35% of the market share, it alone would account for $175 billions in average daily volume. Going by Van-Petersen’s analysis, the market capitalization for Bitcoin would be 10 times the average daily volume, translating into a whopping $1.75 trillion.\n\nBitcoins come into circulation through a process called Bitcoin mining. Since the amount of new Bitcoin released with each mined block (called the block reward) is halved every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, it is estimated that this diminishing block reward will result in a total release of Bitcoin that approaches 21 million. According to current Bitcoin protocol, 21 million is the cap and no more will be mined after that number has been attained. The 21 million cap would be reached only by 2140. It is further projected that in the next 10 years, Bitcoins in circulation would potentially be around 17 million. Based on this figure, coupled with the projected market capitalization, Van-Petersen has given a price estimate of $100,000 for each Bitcoin. (See also: What is Bitcoin Mining?)\n\nRecently, the overall market capitalization for cryptocurrencies crossed the $100 billion mark, primarily driven by Bitcoin and Ethereum. The surge in Ethereum’s price beyond $300 has taken it past $110 billion in less than a week.

The company had sought a court order after it was denied servicing by Bank Leumi, a local bank in the area.\n\nThe bank argued that the very nature of Bitcoin made it impossible for the bank to follow the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Because the recipients of Bitcoin transactions cannot be identified personally, the bank is unable to determine who is receiving the transaction and is therefore unable to obey the law.\n\nWhile the bank did make it clear that Bits of Gold was following the know your customer provisions of the law and was carefully reporting all transactions to the government over certain amounts, the nature of Bitcoin transfers precluded the company from obeying the AML rules.\n\nBits of Gold was following the letter of the law, however, the bank held the right to deny service due to the current legal ambiguity surrounding digital currencies in Israel. Without clear guidelines from the NFSA (national financial supervision authority), the bank was unable to complete its obligatory checks, and could therefore legally refuse service.', 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price was previously consolidating inside an ascending wedge pattern on its 4-hour time frame.\n\nPrice broke to the downside to indicate that selling pressure is getting stronger.\n\nThe longer-term uptrend remains intact and a test of the trend line support could be underway.\n\nBitcoin price made a breakdown from the rising wedge pattern to suggest that sellers are regaining control.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA on this time frame so the path of least resistance is still to the upside. In addition, the 100 SMA appears to have held as dynamic support for the time being as bitcoin price bounced back up from the $2500 area.\n\nThe 200 SMA lines up with the ascending trend line connecting the lows since the start of May. This could be the last line of defense by buyers, as a break below this area could mean more longer-term losses for bitcoin price.\n\nStochastic is pointing down to reflect strengthening selling pressure while RSI is also moving south so bitcoin price might follow suit. Both oscillators are closing in on the oversold regions so sellers might need to take a break soon and let buyers take over. A bounce off the rising trend line could lead to a test of the all-time highs close to $3000.\n\nA small double top formation can also be seen on the 4-hour chart and bitcoin price has already broke below the neckline around $2800. The bounce constitutes a short-term pullback to the broken neckline visible on shorter-term time frames.\n\nA larger correction could last until the broken wedge support at $2800 before more bearish momentum kicks in.

Because prices for bitcoin tend to vary across exchanges, there are slightly different ways to calculate the exchange rates — hence the variation.\n\nWhether it hit, or almost hit, $3K, however — it is undeniable that bitcoin has been on a “epic run” for about the last six weeks or so. Bitcoin’s price hit $1,400 in early May and has been on a steady upward climb ever since, despite the now-frequent protests that this latest spike in the price of bitcoin is a bubble.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban managed to briefly throw some cold water on the price surge by noting his concerns about a bubble. And those fears are not just for crypto-currency naysayers — central figures in the bitcoin community were warning of a bubble from the stage at the Consensus blockchain conference in May.\n\nThe enthusiasm is driven by the idea that bitcoin and its enabling technology, the blockchain, can bring data security innovation to a wide variety of fields from health care record management to supply chain tracking. Hence, bitcoin is not the only digital currency seeing a spike — the tide is also lifting rival blockchain-based currencies like Ethereum, Dash, and Litecoin, which are mostly rising in tandem with bitcoin.\n\nBut a speculation-driven market is also an emotionally fragile market, and as bitcoin has shown in the past, rapidly cooling sentiment in bitcoin land can cool the price of coins as quickly as increased passion can raise them.\n\nSo what’s next? With bitcoin, it’s always hard to say. This time next month we could be writing about how the bubble burst — and bitcoin is back to $200 — or we could be writing that bitcoin has broken $4K.\n\nWe’ll keep you posted either way.', 'No stranger to strange milestones, the cryptocurrency sector may soon see a historic first, one that could upend long-held perceptions of its market.\n\nBranded \'The Flippening\' by market observers, this new hypothetical is defined loosely as the point at which a competing blockchain network could replace bitcoin as the largest and best capitalized blockchain. Sparked by increasing inflows in cryptographic assets, the concept has already seen a dedicated hashtag and website.\n\nGiven that bitcoin invented and popularized blockchain systems, the development could herald a time of new diversity and experimentation for the nascent sector that, until recently, was largely defined in context of bitcoin.\n\nAt earlier points in 2017, bitcoin accounted for more than 80% of the total cryptocurrency market share, though this figure has been higher than 90% at times.\n\nHowever, so-called alternative cryptocurrencies have drawn robust inflows this year, causing their total market cap to reach a record high of roughly $117bn today, a more than 500% year-to-date increase, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nSo, will the event come to pass? And if so, what will it mean?\n\nAnalysts queried by CoinDesk largely believe ethereum\'s ether token is most likely to spur the change, given it has increased 3,000% this year with no signs of slowing.\n\nIndeed, ether\'s market cap has been drawing steadily close to bitcoin\'s amid a broader uptick in interest for so-called \'tokens\' based on the platform, with the two cryptocurrencies worth $35.9bn and $43.7bn at the time of report.\n\nBitcoin\'s governance problems\n\nStill, while some analysts focused on the promise of the ethereum network, others emphasized the perceived difficulties bitcoin has encountered of late as the reason this development could be likely.\n\nDevelopers and entrepreneurs building on bitcoin are still trying to figure out the best way to resolve its ongoing scaling dilemma, a matter which some allege is limiting the cryptocurrency\'s use as a medium of exchange. (Though, perhaps benefitting its use as a store of value).\n\nCurrently, blocks in bitcoin\'s blockchain can only include up to 1 MB of transaction date, meaning that they can only process a fixed number of exchanges. Thus far, proposals to increase the block size have failed, and efforts to implement Segregated Witness – a solution that would reduce the total size of each individual transaction and allow more of these to fit into blocks – have failed to gain the needed support.\n\nOther proposals have largely proved short-lived or polarizing.\n\n""Bitcoin is still stuck at [the] scaling dilemma,"" said Marius Rupsys, cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool. ""If some kind of agreement were achieved, [bitcoin] could regain much of its dominance.""\n\nHowever, the bitcoin community has not yet found a solution, so ether is benefiting from the situation, he said. As markets respond to these developments, Rupsys expects ether\'s market capitalization, or the total value of its available token supply, to surpass bitcoin\'s.\n\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency to scale, has to an extent become ""a victim of its own success,"" said Tim Enneking, managing director of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Fund.\n\nHe also noted that ether has benefited from coming into existence after bitcoin, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""Ether has learned and has fewer problems – as well as a comprehensive, coherent (more or less) roadmap going forward. It also has leadership. Bitcoin has none of that. And first-mover advantages dissipate if one doesn\'t continue to innovate.""\n\nCharles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange service CryptoCompare, was also optimistic that ethereum could become the dominant blockchain.\n\n""Ether has a strong chance of surpassing bitcoin due to its strong network effect and ability to negate the governance issues that bitcoin has been subject to,"" he said.\n\nICOs crucial\n\nSome market observers emphasized the key role played by token sales (or ICOs) when explaining why ether\'s market cap might surpass that of bitcoin\'s.\n\nAs these offerings allow participants to exchange bitcoin and ether for digital \'tokens\' that grant exposure to new ventures, investors purchasing these tokens (contracts on the ethereum network) frequently use ether because they don\'t want to miss out.\n\nFurther, the concentration of ether in the hands of a smaller set of startups is creating new economic pressures on the network.\n\n""This keeps many ethers locked up in new projects and [fewer] ethers are available for trading,"" Rupsys noted.\n\nBitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem offered a similar sentiment, noting: ""Right now, an immense supply of ETH gets locked up due to [ICOs]."" This ""severely reduces supply,"" and with each offering, more tokens are ""locked up"", he explained.\n\nStill, projects using this method of fundraising are going to sell some of the ether tokens they raise to pay for development, he said, meaning sell pressure could increase should this begin in earnest.\n\nBubbles and potentials\n\nWhile many analysts provided optimistic assessments of ether\'s future, some expressed concerns that the cryptocurrency is in bubble territory.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency platform Whaleclub, asserted that ether\'s price is tied heavily to the ICOs that use the alternative asset protocol.\n\n""I personally think ether price is incredibly overpriced, and that many of the ICOs funded will not deliver on all their promises. When that unravels, it\'s likely to cause a substantial crash in the ether price,"" he said.\n\nHowever, he did leave open the possibility that ether\'s market cap could surpass bitcoin\'s, depending on how much success ether-based ICOs produce.\n\nStill, analysts also emphasized the influence both networks could have on the world.\n\nWhile bitcoin could revolutionize the world of currency, ether could have more a wide-ranging influence through its use of smart contracts.\n\nMati Greenspan, senior markets analyst at asset trading platform eToro, spoke to this potential.\n\nHe added that, given its expansive goals, it might be likely for ether to surpass bitcoin in terms of market cap, though it may not have the largest network effect by other means.\n\nGreenspan concluded:\n\n""The development of both bitcoin and ethereum have far-reaching implications for our future world. Respectively, bitcoin and ethereum represent the future of money and the future of the internet.""\n\nMarkets image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Bitcoin\'s wild ride is continuing on Monday. The cryptocurrency climbed to a lifetime high of $2,999.97 a coin in overnight action, but it has seen a sharp drop from its highs. It\'s now trading down by $286, or 9.7%, at $2,666 a coin.\n\nMonday\'s action comes without any real catalyst, as trade appears to be fueled by buying in Asia. Recently, China\'s three largest bitcoin exchanges lifted their ban on clients\' withdrawals. Additionally, Japan\'s government announced in early April that bitcoin had been approved as a legal payment method in the country.\n\nBitcoin has gained 187% this year. Its meteoric rise has prompted tech billionaire Mark Cuban to call it a ""bubble."" Last Tuesday, Cuban tweeted: ""I think it\'s in a bubble. I just don\'t know when or how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $=bubble.""\n\nThe market continues to await the US Securities and Exchange Commission\'s ruling on an exchange-traded fund started by the Winklevoss twins. Back in March, the SEC rejected that ETF along with another. It has since taken public comment on its decision regarding the Winklevoss twins\' ETF, but it has not made an additional ruling.', 'In a report entitled “The Future Is Here,” Singapore’s central bank announced that it has completed the first phase of a project involving the development of a tokenized version of the Singapore dollar (SGD) on an Ethereum-based blockchain.\n\n\n\nProject Ubin, which began in November 2016, is an attempt to create a functional replacement for Singapore’s interbank payments network using tokenization and blockchain technology.\n\nThe first phase of the project was successful, developing a proof-of-concept replacement of the MAS Electronic Payments System (MEPS+), the Singaporean analog of the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) in the United States, which handles the settlement of interbank debts.\n\nIn the prototype model, MEPS+ transfers simply become transfers on a private Ethereum-based blockchain. Although it is still in the early stages, Project Ubin promises a future in which bank customers can send and receive payments and exchange currency without lengthy processing times, fees or intermediaries. In the long term, Project Ubin could herald the overthrow of fiat currency by tokenized cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is important to note that the prototype, if implemented, would not affect the net money supply, as all tokens are backed by Singapore dollars held in “custody” by the central bank and which can be freely exchanged back to fiat currency.\n\nIn June 2016, the Bank of Canada partnered with R3 and several major banks on Project Jasper to develop a blockchain-based competitor to the country’s current interbank payments solution, the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS).\n\nOn May 25, the Bank of Canada announced that a blockchain-based solution was not a viable substitute for the LVTS and abandoned Project Jasper.\n\nHowever, much of the code and architecture developed for Project Jasper made its way into Project Ubin. In turn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) says it plans to make the Project Ubin prototype available to students and professionals in order to further development and innovation.\n\nOther central banks have considered or experimented with tokenization, including the Bank of England, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nIn February, the PBOC began testing a prototype cryptocurrency that has been in development since 2014.\n\nThe Central Bank of Russia is currently testing an Ethereum-based blockchain solution to process online payments and perform customer verification. President Vladimir Putin met with Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum last week and reportedly encouraged efforts to advance blockchain technology in Russia.\n\nMany other countries are already on the blockchain bandwagon; however, if Singapore’s project is fully implemented, it would mark the first tokenized fiat currency and the first blockchain-based interbank payments system.\n\nBut Project Ubin is not over yet. The first phase was successfully completed on March 9, and the report only summarizes its conclusions and outlines the goals of the second phase.\n\nThe project’s next goal, according to the report, will be to test the viability of a tokenized blockchain-based solution to domestic and international securities transactions — such as the global stock exchange — and cross-border interbank payments.']"
06/13/2017,"['Former Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director Bruce Fenton has said Ethereum will become the biggest coin if the past 24 hours’ performance repeats.\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, Fenton said a reoccurrence of Bitcoin’s nine percent fall coupled with Ethereum’s 15 percent gains would result in the latter becoming the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nLast 24hrs Bitcoin was down over 9% & Ethereum was up over 15%.\n\n\n\nIf that happens again EVER from these levels then Ethereum is largest coin. — Bruce Fenton (@brucefenton) June 13, 2017\n\nFenton added that those investors who pulled out following yesterday’s drop in price had likely performed a “bad trade” as a correction gets underway.\n\nEthereum’s mammoth leaps have caused it to become the new focus of community attention, as various sides argue over its true value.\n\nFlippening\n\nOn Sunday, Twitter commentator WhalePanda released an extensive post on ETH, arguing why it was inferior to Bitcoin on a technical level.\n\nUnlimited supply, ICO hype and other factors contributed to the view that the asset was more likely part of a significant bubble than Bitcoin.\n\nNonetheless, Bitcoin’s dominance is slipping fast, by market cap now controlling only 40.5 percent of the total.\n\nWith further robust trading, very little stands between here and what is known in the crypto community as the ‘Flippening’ - where ETH’s market cap usurps that of BTC.', 'Fans of the financial ledger technology known as Blockchain may be interested to know Morgan Stanley analysts today unveiled a longish (43 pages) white paper on the state of the technology in the financial services business, declaring that there is yet not “killer app” for BlockChain, but rather “we are now firmly in the middle of the proof-of-concept phase of development.""\n\nThe report also offers some thoughts about why Bitcoin, the crypto-currency that took off in tandem with Blockchain, has been soaring in value.\n\nTech analyst James Faucette, along with several of his colleagues at Morgan, take a look bake at how things have progressed in the twelve months since they first wrote about the prospects for BlockChain to be used in financial settlements and other services.\n\nThe authors take a look at five case studies that have been done, including a government bond settlement project by BNY Mellon (BK), and something from UBS Group AG (UBS) called “utility settlement coin.""\n\nThe premise of all of these experiments, they note, has generally been that ""Blockchain is a tool to improve efficiency."" ""As the technology matures, funds and securities firms will have an opportunity to further reduce headcount and operational expense as Blockchain technology becomes more widely used to clear and settle transactions.""\n\nHowever, ""Many proofs of concept are in the process globally, but there is no killer app yet, which we think is needed to kick-start adoption.""\n\nAs a consequence, ""Blockchain still hasn\'t had a true test,"" the authors write. ""Early signs are that this is a promising technology, but many of the big questions have yet to be answered, and it hasn\'t been tested at scale in a complex, fast-moving business environment.""\n\n""It is still too early for specific investment conclusions; however, progress is being made, and we may see initial parts of the shared infrastructure emerge over the next 12-24 months.""\n\nTranslation, from now through 2018 is the “proof of concept” phase, with 2017 to 2020 being a time for “shared infrastructure” to emerge, and 2021 to 2025 being a time when “assets proliferate.""\n\nWhile it’s too soon to make an investment recommendations on all this, the authors opine that ""incumbents are generally more likely to benefit than new entrants and are most likely to see cost benefits or possibly increased capital efficiency further down the road,” by which they mean “companies that are more involved early on in the process […] including ASX, UBS, BNY Mellon, Northern Trust, State Street, and JPM.""\n\nRegarding Bitcoin, and other crypto-currencies such as Ethereum and Ripple, the authors write that it’s “not clear why cryptocurrencies are appreciating so rapidly (apart from the appreciation itself drawing in more speculation against a potentially inefficient ability to sell).""\n\nThey offer a few factors, including “ICOs,” the ""initial currency offerings” that have been rising in popularity. ""Rapid appreciation of cryptocurrencies is encouraging speculative formation of new currencies,” they note.\n\n""Many of these new currencies don’t actually have use cases yet, but are intended to be exchange mediums for everything from virtual goods in games to banking mechanisms for products like marijuana where legal implications are not yet fully clear,” they write. ""ICOs are funded with existing cryptocurrencies, hence driving an appreciation circle—e.g., to support/invest in a new currency, one must buy and trade an existing cryptocurrency.""\n\nAnother one is China’s cheap servers:\n\nMoving funds in China. Up until the last few days, a disproportionate share of Bitcoin mining was taking place in China (where there is cheap access to servers and cheap electricity). Numerous press sources including The Wall Street Journal (November 5, 2016) and Fortune (January 5, 2017) commented on the possibility that Bitcoin was being used to help avoid monetary controls in China, which may help explain why the Chinese government has cracked down on Bitcoin mining recently.\n\nAnd then there’s Korea and Japan:\n\nIncreased demand from Korea and Japan. Bitcoin appreciation seems to have been heavily driven in recent months by increased buying from Korea and Japan. In Japan, the recent legalization of Bitcoin has led to an increase in activity, including the recent opening of new Bitcoin exchanges. In Korea, however, there is not a clear explanation for the surge.\n\nIn case you were wondering how much of crypto-currencies is in circulation, the team offer another infographic:', 'Bitcoin has had a blistering start to 2017. It\'s up about 180% so far this year. However, its near-term outlook isn\'t looking so hot, according to a note released on Monday by Goldman Sachs head of technical strategy Sheba Jafari.\n\n""The market has come close (enough?) to reaching its extended (2.618) target for a 3rd of V-waves from the inception low at 3,134,"" Jafari wrote. ""It’s on track to forming a bearish key day reversal if today’s close settles below 2,749.""\n\nBitcoin hit a lifetime high of nearly $3,000 a coin on Monday, but was unable to hold onto those gains. The cryptocurrency finished the day at $2,599, well below the key technical threshold of $2,749 that was singled out by Jafari.\n\nNow, traders should be paying close attention to $2,475 on a weekly basis, as a close below there would cause even more damage to the technical picture, according to Jafari. ""Both daily/weekly oscillators are diverging negatively. All of this to say that the balance of signals are looking broadly heavy.""\n\nJafari isn\'t alone in calling for at least a near-term top in the cryptocurrency. ""I think it\'s in a bubble,"" tech billionaire Mark Cuban tweeted last Tuesday. ""I just don\'t know when or how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $=bubble."" Cuban did not say how far he thought bitcoin would fall.\n\nSo where will bitcoin go from here? ""Wary of a near-term top ahead of 3,134, Jafari concludes. ""Consider re-establishing bullish exposure between 2,330 and no lower than 1,915.""', 'Bitcoin price sold off sharply recently but has found support at the bottom of the ascending channel on its 4-hour time frame.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is trading inside an ascending channel on its 4-hour chart and has just bounced off support.\n\nA climb to the channel resistance around the $3000 mark could be underway.\n\nTechnical indicators are also suggesting that the uptrend is likely to resume at this point.\n\nBitcoin price sold off sharply recently but has found support at the bottom of the ascending channel on its 4-hour time frame.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA on the 4-hour time frame, signaling that the path of least resistance is to the upside. In other words, the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. Also, the 100 SMA held as dynamic support since it lined up with the bottom of the channel.\n\nStochastic has pulled up from the oversold area to reflect a return in buying pressure and has a long way to go before hitting the overbought zone. This means that there’s enough bullish momentum left for more gains in bitcoin price.\n\nRSI is also heading north so bitcoin price might follow suit. Stronger bullish pressure might even lead to a break past the channel resistance and the creation of new highs. On the other hand, a return in selling momentum could lead to a dip to the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point at $2300.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nDollar volatility could come into play for the upcoming trading sessions as the FOMC is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision. An interest rate hike of 0.25% is widely expected but traders are more interested to find out if more tightening moves are in the cards or not. Increased focus on balance sheet adjustments could lower the odds of a September hike.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin price seems to be recovering along with U.S. market gains as the tech rout appears to have passed. However, the return in risk appetite may also draw funds away from cryptocurrencies and onto rallying stocks and commodities.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Legal cannabis was a $6 billion industry last year and is expected to grow to $50 billion by 2026, according to Cowen & Co. But because pot is illegal under federal law, big banks and credit-card companies steer clear. That\'s forced most merchants to accept cash only, a logistical headache and constant security threat.\n\nEnter bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that consists of digital coins ""mined"" by computers solving increasingly complex math problems. At least two financial-technology startups, POSaBIT and SinglePoint Inc., use the cryptocurrency as an intermediate step that lets pot connoisseurs use their bank-issued credit cards to buy weed.\n\n""There\'s no industry — whether it\'s the production and sale of cannabis or the production and sale of a cup of coffee — that can operate safely, transparently or effectively without access to banks or other financial institutions and traditional services,"" said Jon Baugher, co-founder of POSaBIT, whose technology is used by 30 dispensaries in Washington state. ""That\'s where we thought we could leverage the use of digital currency.""\n\nMarijuana farm. Adobe Stock\n\nTrove Cannabis, one of the Washington stores using POSaBIT, sold $3 million of marijuana last year — in cash — and does close to 3,000 transactions weekly. Trove became a POSaBIT customer in February after being on a waitlist for six months, according to Yin-Ho Lai, Trove\'s founder and chief executive officer. Since doing so, about 13 percent of customers have chosen to pay with credit or debit cards, Lai said, and those who do tend to spend more.\n\nHere\'s how it works:\n\nOnce a customer decides on which marijuana product to buy, an employee asks if he or she would like to use cash or digital currency, Lai said. If the buyer prefers the latter, the Trove employee explains that the customer can use a credit card to buy bitcoin through a POSaBIT kiosk, with a $2 transaction fee tacked on.\n\nThe customer, who would now own bitcoin equal to the value of the purchase, can then redeem the currency in the store. Or the buyer can keep their bitcoin and use it anywhere else that accepts the currency. If the customer finishes the purchase in the store, POSaBIT, which pockets the transaction fee, then sends the value in U.S. dollars to Trove\'s bank account.\n\nPOSaBIT says it\'s taken steps to comply with federal and state laws regulating both marijuana sales and digital currency. For example, customers must present a valid ID that is scanned, encrypted and stored. Buyers are allowed to acquire no more than $150 in bitcoin to prevent money laundering. The company also has a nine-point fraud-detection program designed to thwart criminals, and requires that its retail customers have a bank account, not necessarily a given in the cannabis industry.\n\nPot is legal for both recreational and medical use in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine, Alaska and the District of Columbia, and approved in 20 additional states for medical purposes only.\n\nWhile the early bitcoin adopters are claiming success, the currency still has a long way to go before it gains wide acceptance. For many in the legal weed industry, the virtual currency\'s association with illicit drug dealing on the so-called dark web is a big drawback.\n\nOthers have a hard time grasping how a virtual currency works, including Neil Demers, who runs a cannabis store in Denver. At least for now.\n\n""I\'m sure education could enlighten me and a lot of this industry on bitcoin being a feasible payment option, but we just don\'t see it,"" said Demers, a franchisee of Diego Pellicer Worldwide Inc., which leases space to pot dispensaries.\n\nIt may only be a matter of time before pot dealers have an easier solution. The reluctance of banks to handle pot transactions will probably subside before the digital-currency solution has a chance to take off, said Jeffrey Zucker, co-founder and president of Green Lion Partners, a strategy firm focused on early-stage development in the cannabis industry.\n\n""The banking issues are going to be solved in such time that the people in this industry are going to gravitate toward traditional banking,"" he said.\n\nAt least some companies say bitcoin technology will make sense in the cannabis industry even after traditional banking becomes available. SinglePoint, a mobile-tech firm that specializes in payments via text message, signed an agreement last week with First Bitcoin Capital Corp. to develop a solution for cannabis and other high-risk industries without access to traditional banking.\n\nTwo years ago, the Seattle-based company put terminals into dispensaries in Washington. Within six months, however, banks shut them down, citing too much risk, said Greg Lambrecht, founder and CEO. SinglePoint had considered using bitcoin at that time, but the currency wasn\'t well known, he said. That\'s changed, and SinglePoint now expects retailers to begin testing its new product over the next two months.\n\n""It\'s not foreign to them now, like some sort of weird scam that they don\'t know about,"" he said. ""More and more establishments are accepting it, but it\'s kind of like the wild, wild west.""\n\nBloomberg News', 'Over the past 30 days, ether has risen a staggering 350% and, at this point in time, it could literally go to a million. There is no top, anyone telling you otherwise is a fool. The reversal will be swift, violent and highly publicized, but until then, I see no reason why the bubble cannot continue for the next few weeks at least.\n\n\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that Ethereum’s market cap will surpass Bitcoin for a period of time, at least until SegWit and Lightning Network are active. Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum will have to endure its own scaling growing pains, but may find quicker avenues of compromise thanks to Ethereum’s centralized nature. Unlike Bitcoin, however, Ethereum does not currently have a finite supply and therefore should not be seen as a store of value.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, South Korea has led the reported trading volume, even surpassing Poloniex, the ETH/BTC volume leader.\n\nWe have new ICOs and tokens being released every week. Everyone from Vinny Lingham to Trace Mayer are releasing ICOs. The current most popular use case for Ethereum is buying these speculative vehicles and turning them around for a quick profit. Correlation is not causation, but the proximity of the two should be damning enough. The top 1000 token wallets sit above $5 billion at the moment.\n\nMany people are comparing this to the Dot Com bubble, but I see it slightly differently. I’d compare it more to the early blockchain days when thousands of new alt coins were released. Most were useless, vaporware-riddled speculative vehicles which died quickly or slowly, though some still remain with valid use cases today. The early ICO/token days appear to be very similar, except for the speed at which the ICO 2.0 on the Ethereum blockchain is receiving funds. The BAT ICO raised $36 million in 30 seconds. Bancor, a platform and protocol that will enable tokenization faster, raised $150 million just yesterday in the largest ICO ever and is also the largest crowdfund ever.\n\nOne impetus for the end of the bubble would be regulatory guidelines prohibiting the average user from participating in ICO-like vehicles and reducing the participants to accredited investors only.\n\nThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\n\nWhen the bubble does burst, I would look towards the 200 EMA for support, currently sitting around $85. Price has not touched the 200 EMA since breaking above it in early February. Should RSI hold around 50 after the larger correction, expect continuation of trend. Should RSI dip below 30, there would be a larger chance that trend may be over.\n\nThe $100 sell off yesterday, with a bounce on the 30 minute 200 EMA and Monthly Pivot has already quickly retraced.\n\nFib extensions and monthly pivot yield an immediate resistance at $450. The 1.618 fib extension sits around $490.\n\nSummary', 'Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs warned its clients that the bitcoin market may be headed for bearish territory.\n\nIn a recent client note, published by finance blog Zero Hedge, chief technician Sheba Jafari, offered his view on the digital currency. It\'s a rare moment for Goldman, which doesn\'t regularly cover developments around bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a recent market color report on June 12, the banking giant suggested its investor clients to be cautious about a near-term high bitcoin price of $3,134.

It’s people looking for a rate of return. It’s in the bubble phase. [Bitcoin] goes through this periodically… it rises several hundred percent, and then collapses.”\n\nIn December 2013, Bitcoin ran up to over $900 and subsequently collapsed to below $250… it would take three years for the price to again reach those highs.\n\nExponential Moves Always Blow Up\n\nPal, speaking in an exclusive interview with Mauldin Economics, made ten-times his money on Bitcoin and thinks now is a good time to get out.\n\n“This is the most exponential move we have seen. I don’t know how far it goes, but I sold out last week… and I’ve [owned Bitcoin] since it was $200. Anything that moves exponentially, always [blows up].”\n\nHowever, Bitcoin’s meteoric rise isn’t the only reason The Global Macro Investor exited his position.\n\nOnly 21 Million Bitcoins? Not necessarily.\n\n“Bitcoin was supposed to be a store of value, you couldn’t mess with the formula… and now they are talking about a ‘hard fork’ changing it?”\n\nA feature that has attracted many investors to Bitcoin is its built-in scarcity. It’s widely thought that only 21-million Bitcoins can ever be ‘mined’ into existence.\n\nHowever, senior developers and miners are now contemplating a ‘hard fork’ which would split Bitcoin in-two and allow for the creation of more Bitcoins.\n\n“Even if they don’t change the formula, the fact that they could? That’s enough to say it’s not a long-term store of value.”\n\nPal says a recent development in India also changed his views on the crypto-currency.\n\nCould “India Stack” Replace Bitcoin?\n\n“India introduced a frictionless payment system, [something] that everyone in Bitcoin was working on… this was [Bitcoin’s] great project and India went and did it for 1.1 billion people, fifty-times faster than Bitcoin and its rolled out and working now.”\n\nPal is talking about “India Stack,” which will soon process more transactions than Bitcoin ever has.\n\nIndia Stack allows users to open a bank account, mobile phone account, or share medical records at any hospital or clinic in India with your fingerprints or by retina scan.\n\nIn the March edition of The Global Macro Investor, Pal said of India Stack:\n\n“This revolutionary digital infrastructure will soon be able to process billions more transactions than Bitcoin ever has. It may well be a Bitcoin killer or at best, provide the framework for how blockchain technology could be applied in the real world.”\n\nWhat About Blockchain and the Future of Finance?\n\nFor Raoul Pal’s thoughts on the technology behind Bitcoin, the financial system, cashless societies, and more, watch the full interview below.\n\nDownload a FREE Bundle of Exclusive Content from the Sold-Out 2017 Strategic Investment Conference\n\nGet access to exclusive interviews with John Mauldin, Neil Howe and Pippa Malmgren from SIC, an ebook from renowned geopolitical expert George Friedman and bonus SIC 2017 content…\n\nClaim your SIC 2017 bundle now!', 'Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says he bought Bitcoin at $700\n\nBitcoin surged past $3,000 over the weekend\n\nWozniak said he bought Bitcoin mostly to see what you could do with it.\n\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak revealed he bought bitcoin when it was at at $700 during an interview with CNBC at eMerge Miami on Monday.\n\nWozniak didn’t disclose how much he acquired, but the cryptocurrency surged above $3,000 over the weekend, meaning he gained $2,300 even if he just bought a single bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I remember getting interested in bitcoin some time ago,” Wozniak said. “It was $70 for a bitcoin, man and I went online and you had to have a special bank account at a special bank and I couldn’t buy any bitcoin so I gave up. Eventually I got some of them at the $700 stage and it went down to $350.

06/14/2017,"['In a move that’s certain to irk lovers of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Morgan Stanley came out with a statement on Tuesday calling for greater governmental control and regulation.\n\nThe very nature of Bitcoin is as a peer-to-peer non-regulated currency system that allows for greater levels of autonomy for holders. However, the recent meteoric rise of Bitcoin values has led speculators and major financial players into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBig money comes to crypto\n\nMorgan Stanley stated that the necessary regulations for different cryptocurrencies might require individual tailoring, depending on the nature of the underlying system. Regardless, however, they made it clear that government regulators are carefully watching the currencies to see what is happening with the market.\n\nThey said that “regulators are looking to have a master key so all transactions are visible to them.”\n\nThe very nature of that statement will certainly concern the vast majority of Bitcoin holders, given that the goal of Bitcoin was to have a system that did not require such governmental controls.\n\nRegardless of whether Morgan Stanley is right, the big money players on Wall Street have already begun to invest in cryptocurrencies. Whether they continue, however, remains to be seen.', 'Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany\'s Bundesbank and one of the most powerful figures in European finance, has warned that digital currencies like bitcoin have the potential to make financial crises in the future even more devastating.\n\nSpeaking in Frankfurt on Wednesday, Weidmann said he believes that central banks will eventually create their own digital currencies to reassure average citizens that such currencies are safe and stable, but in doing so could increase the risk of bank runs in future crises.\n\n""Allowing the public to hold claims on the central bank might make their liquid assets safer, because a central bank cannot become insolvent,"" Weidmann said in a speech largely focused on the European Central Bank\'s QE programme.\n\n""This is a feature which will become relevant especially in times of crisis – when there will be a strong incentive for money holders to switch bank deposits into the official digital currency simply at the push of a button. But what might be a boon for savers in search of safety might be a bane for banks, as this makes a bank run potentially even easier.""\n\nWeidmann\'s basic point is that by making currencies fully digital in future, withdrawing money from a bank would become much more simple. Instead of physically having to visit a cashpoint or bank branch to withdraw cash, customers could do it online. In times of crisis, when people tend to take money out of their accounts so they can have the perceived safety of cash, causing the phenomenon of the bank run.\n\nAt its simplest level, a bank run occurs when customers lose faith in the stability of the bank and the safety of their money, so decide to take out their cash. This, in turn, makes the bank\'s problems even worse, because they lose cash liquidity, making it more difficult for them to fulfil their obligations.\n\nA famous example of a bank run came in 2007 when British lender Northern Rock saw a run after it was revealed that it had to seek emergency assistance from the Bank of England. Northern Rock collapsed shortly afterwards.\n\nDigital currencies have hit the headlines in recent months after the price of bitcoin — the best-known cryptocurrency — began to increase rapidly.\n\nBitcoin\'s price has climbed from around $750 per coin in late 2016 to around $3,000 per coin today, a gain of 400% in just over six months. That has caused other currencies like Ether to spike higher as well.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', '', 'Jimmy Song is a bitcoin developer and principal architect at blockchain technology startup Paxos.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Song discusses bitcoin\'s scaling debate, arguing that the long-proposed idea of adding sidechains to the digital currency\'s protocol could ultimately provide the best path forward.\n\nPolitics has gripped bitcoin – it\'s about the only thing people have been wanting to talk about for the past few years.\n\nI\'ve written before about how the bitcoin ecosystem is like the three branches of government, with developers being the legislative branch, miners serving as the executive branch and users being the judicial branch. I\'ve also written about how bitcoin changes through consensus, and how consensus is not supposed to be easy.\n\nIn this article, I examine an alternative path to the current political stalemate and how that can help empower developers, miners and users.\n\nCurrent state of miners\n\nAmong mining manufacturers, it\'s pretty obvious that Bitmain is the biggest and most successful. They produce somewhere around 50–75% of the bitcoin network hash power through their chips and other manufacturers have a tough time competing with them on price.\n\nTheir first product, the S1, came out in 2014 when there were many more competitors (CoinTerra, KnCMiner and Spondoolies-Tech to name a few). They distinguished themselves by having the product on hand at various bitcoin conferences and, unlike many of their competitors, having great supply chain management helped them win fans around the world.\n\nAs bitcoin experienced a three-year bear market, many mining manufacturers simply went out of business as the economics turned from wildly profitable to barely survivable. It didn\'t help that many had products that often had defects and delivery issues. Bitmain not only survived this time, but thrived, and managed to capture significant market share.\n\nWhatever your opinion of the company may be, Bitmain is the most dominant miner and they are the 800-pound gorilla in the mining space.\n\nCurrent state of developers\n\nIt\'s well known that Satoshi Nakamoto made the first bitcoin client and released it to the world in 2009. Many people have contributed to what\'s called the \'reference client\' and Bitcoin Core, as it’s now called, has hundreds of developers that contribute to the open-source repository.\n\nWhat\'s less known is that there have been many different attempts to create alternative bitcoin clients. Obelisk, btc-d, Toshi and bcoin are just some of the many attempts at creating new clients from scratch.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT and the newest Segwit2x are some forks of Bitcoin Core. While each has had a varying degree of success, it appears most of the network continues to run Bitcoin Core (most estimates are well over 90%).\n\nWhy is Bitcoin Core the most popular? There\'s certainly history to consider. People managing money tend to be conservative and changing any part of the tool chain for managing money tends to be a dicey proposition as any errors may cause monetary loss. Further, Core has the largest developer community and the most rigorous development processes in place.\n\nWhatever your opinion of Bitcoin Core may be, the team continues to produce the dominant client on the network, and they are the 800-pound gorilla in the development space.\n\nBalance of power\n\nWhile before 2014 the miners and developers generally got along, things started to change once the issue of scaling came up. We\'ve now got to the point where the scaling conflict is often seen as Bitmain vs Bitcoin Core (I\'m sure neither are happy with that characterization). Either way, we have two dominant groups that have been in conflict.\n\nMiners are frustrated because they\'ve been asking for large blocks for years. From Bitmain\'s perspective, none of the developers seem even interested in any sort of hard fork. When they ask, the usual responses range from ""Follow the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process"" (which inevitably gets voted down) to ""Fork off"".\n\nDevelopers are frustrated because they\'ve been asking for SegWit for years. From Bitcoin Core\'s perspective, the miners seem to be obstructing good technology for no good reason. When they ask for a reason, the usual responses range from ""We want larger blocks"" to ""You\'re carrying water for Blockstream"".\n\nConsensus and control\n\nGenerally, when there\'s a conflict that\'s not getting resolved, you have to go up a level of abstraction to figure out the problem.\n\nWhile scaling is the reason everyone claims for this conflict, the actual reason may lie higher up. And when you think about the actual consensus process that\'s required to change bitcoin, it\'s clear that both sides want more control than they currently have.\n\nAnd this makes sense. Both groups are interested in more say over the long haul as bitcoin becomes more and more valuable. A small concession or precedent set now has consequences going forward.\n\nBitcoin Core may be thinking a hard fork now would set a precedent for additional, possibly more dangerous, hard forks later. Bitmain may be thinking cooperation on a soft fork without getting some concession would set a precedent for being dominated and having requests ignored later.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited in this context can be seen as a way to get around the developers by replacing them entirely. Similarly, BIP 148 and other UASF proposals are a way to get around the miners.\n\nThis has brought us to the current impasse. Both sides want control, but given that bitcoin is a consensus-based system, there\'s no way to give each side what it wants and keep bitcoin on a single chain.\n\nThe way to solve this problem, then, is not by trying to solve the presenting technical issue, but by solving the deeper issue of control. The question isn’t so much ""How can we scale bitcoin?"" but ""How can we give each side more control?"".\n\nThe naive solution\n\nThe most obvious way to give each side more control would be to split bitcoin in two, or what I would call the \'Solomon solution\'. We can hard fork bitcoin and each side can do whatever it wants on their chain.\n\nOne side would have to find new miners (or even a new proof-of-work function) and the other side would have to find new developers.\n\nWhile this has some appeal, splitting bitcoin in two has the potential to cause significant collateral damage. Indeed, most contentious forks have this as a possible endpoint as both sides have the ability to hard fork.\n\nBitcoin may be the baby that dies if nobody agrees.\n\nA more thoughtful solution\n\nSo far, we\'ve only been talking about two of the three branches of the bitcoin governance: miners and developers. When the two disagree, the ideal solution would be to have the users adjudicate. Unfortunately, safe, liquid adjudication is only available after a hard fork when the price between the tokens can float.\n\nBut what if we can give both miners and developers control over separate, smaller domains? What if each could run separate chains and each could change and use them according to their needs and desires? Further, what if these separate chains were actually extensions of bitcoin itself?\n\nWouldn\'t users naturally utilize the one that they preferred? Wouldn\'t the best idea win instead of the best political player?\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. This is what the whole sidechains project is all about.\n\nWhat are sidechains?\n\nIf you haven’t heard about sidechains, think of them as a separate blockchain where you can deposit and withdraw bitcoins. That is, if you deposit 1 BTC to the sidechain, you add 1 BTC to your balance on the sidechain. The same goes for withdrawals – it\'s all done on the sidechain.\n\nThe separate blockchain can have all sorts of new features and won\'t actually affect bitcoin. And this is the key. You can give control of one sidechain to the miners and another to the developers. In fact, you can add lots more sidechains for a variety of purposes to see how well they work.\n\nUsers can vote with their feet by going to sidechains that they find most useful. Merchants, for example, may want to go to a sidechain that\'s much quicker to confirm. Exchanges may want to go to a sidechain with more financial instruments available.\n\nThat sounds awesome! Why don’t we have it yet?\n\nGood question. One sidechain implementation already works. The sidechain is called Liquid and has been developed by Blockstream. The startup utilizes something called a \'federation\', which is a fancy way of saying deposits to the sidechain are bitcoins sent to multisig addresses.\n\nThe Liquid security model requires a bunch (11+) of known, trusted entities (like exchanges) and that\'s still in the process of being set up. The good news with Liquid is that it requires no changes to the bitcoin protocol in order to work. The bad news is that you have to trust that a majority of entities won\'t steal from you.\n\nThe other sidechain implementation is something called Drivechains. The good news is that Drivechains don\'t require (less) trusted entities and the code is almost done. The bad news is that Drivechains require a soft fork.\n\nWouldn\'t this give everybody what they want? It certainly seems so. Having the market decide instead of committees seems like a much more scalable solution (pun intended). And indeed Paul Sztorc [economist at Bloq] has proposed Drivechains as an alternative to SegWit or 2MB blocks. Segwit can easily be deployed on one sidechain and larger blocks on another.\n\nIt\'s not all good news, however.\n\nThere\'s the obvious fact that BIP 148 and BUIP 0055 are scheduled for 1st August and 18th October, respectively. Both are potentially contentious forks and may very well cause some serious disruption.\n\nLiquid requires finding enough trusted entities in enough jurisdictions. Many users don\'t like having to trust other entities, so this may be a non-starter.\n\nDrivechains requires a soft fork where miners validate new rules. Further, there are some technical issues that may need to be addressed, as well as code that needs extensive review and testing before a soft fork can happen. Developers and miners would ultimately have to agree to pursue this path.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe benefits of a sidechain solution are pretty clear. Developers and miners are empowered because they can try out new, riskier features on sidechains and don\'t have to get anyone\'s approval for doing so.\n\nEach can control their own sidechain without disrupting any other part of bitcoin. Users are empowered since they can have a choice of features without having to leave bitcoin.\n\nThe downsides of a sidechain solution are a bit murkier and require a more thorough examination of the incentives to really evaluate properly.\n\nAs bitcoin enters its fourth year of scaling conflict, creative solutions like Drivechains and Liquid deserve more rigorous consideration. There very well may be technical or trust issues that are insurmountable, but it\'s vital that, as a community, we leave no stone unturned.\n\nWe are currently embroiled in a bitter political war. This is because we\'re essentially stuck in a zero-sum game of consensus building. Innovation is a better way to resolve conflict than politics. Politics is messy, divisive and harmful. Innovation is clean, unifying and constructive. If an innovative path can be found, we owe it to ourselves as a community to find it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Medium and has been republished here with the author\'s permission.

Though there are still several uncertainties and speculations that Bitcoin is a bubble, Wozniak seems to believe that Bitcoin has some growth factor to it.\n\nWhy did he invest?\n\nWozniak stated during the interview that he wasn’t investing in Bitcoins for monetary gains. Instead, he is curious as to how the technology works and how other people can make money through it.

Labeled a “contingency plan,” the announcement is a response to the upcoming user activated soft fork (UASF), as defined by Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP148) — and the wipe-out risk that comes along with it.\n\n\n\nAfter an initial 8 megabyte proposal, Bitcoin Classic, the Hong Kong roundtable consensus, Bitcoin Unlimited, and SegWit2x, this marks the sixth time the Chinese mining giant has announced support for a hard fork in the space of two years.\n\n\n\nHere’s what their latest proposal looks like.\n\nHard Forks, Coin-Splits and Altcoins\n\nOn August 1st, a segment of the Bitcoin community will activate the BIP148 UASF. These users and miners will only accept Bitcoin blocks that signal support for Segregated Witness (SegWit), the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. If, at that point, a majority of miners (by hash power) does not signal support for SegWit through BIP148, Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency could split in two: a coin-split.\n\nNow, with Bitmain’s hard fork announcement, it seems there could be a third part to the split … sort of.\n\nBitmain refers to its announced hard fork as a “UAHF” or User Activated Hard Fork. While perhaps a clever play on UASF, this is not a very accurate term because the “contingency plan” will actually be very explicitly activated by Bitmain — and Bitmain alone.\n\n\n\nMoreover, use of the term “hard fork” is questionable in this context as well. Originally, at least, the term referred to a change to the Bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks or transactions valid. But for it to be a change to the Bitcoin protocol, it arguably at the very least requires the Bitcoin ecosystem to follow these new rules. Under Bitmain’s own stated condition this wouldn’t be the case, at least not to the full extent.\n\nRather, the “UAHF” will only be launched in response to a successful BIP148 UASF. It is thus more or less assumed that not everyone will adopt the new rules, which indeed seems likely. Technically, at least, Bitmain’s “hard fork” would be better described as the creation of an entirely new coin that shares a common history with Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFor purposes of this article, Bitmain’s version of Bitcoin will be called “Bitmain’s Bitcoin.”\n\nBitmain’s Bitcoin\n\nSo what. specifically, will Bitmain’s Bitcoin look like?\n\nBitmain announced it will create Bitmain’s Bitcoin exactly 12 hours and 20 minutes after the UASF activation, though this is configurable. At that specific point in time, under Bitmain’s new rules, a block must be included in the blockchain that’s bigger than one megabyte. This will automatically “split” the chain — or create a new chain depending on how you look at it. All existing full Bitcoin nodes would reject this block and ignore this chain, and would continue to follow the chain adhering to Bitcoin’s current consensus rules.\n\nFrom that point on, Bitmain will first mine on Bitmain’s Bitcoin chain privately for three days. After these three days, Bitmain will “officially” launch Bitmain’s Bitcoin to the public if three circumstances are met.\n\nFirst off, the BIP148 UASF must have been successful enough to have gained significant hash rate. Second, there must be strong market demand for Bitmain’s Bitcoin. And third, the non-BIP148 side of the split must not be doing great, comparatively.\n\nThen, if launched, Bitmain’s Bitcoin will accept bigger blocks. The statement mentions an initial limit of up to 8 megabytes, though this is slightly ambiguous as the same blog post mentions there will be “no hard-coded consensus rule” at all. The hardware manufacturer does add that miners should impose a “soft limit” of less than 2 megabytes, which is really more like a recommendation. Additionally, Bitmain writes that there will be a new protocol limit on “sigops,” which, in short, should counter some potential attack vectors on bigger blocks that could otherwise significantly slow down propagation times.\n\nFor the longer term, Bitmain lays out a “future roadmap” that includes a version of Segregated Witness, Extension Blocks, Bitcoin NG, Lumino, Schnorr signatures, Weak Blocks, and Bitcoin Unlimited-inspired base block size increases up to almost 17 megabytes in two years. Overall, this “future roadmap” part of the announcement does not seem very concrete yet, however.\n\nWhat This Means for You, and What This Means for Bitcoin\n\nThe good news is that anyone who holds bitcoins (meaning: their private keys) at the time of a split will receive coins on both (or all) sides of the chain. In other words, you will get free ""Bitmain bitcoins"", which you can keep, sell or spend as long as someone is willing to accept them as payment. Bitmain will even implement replay protection on Bitmain’s Bitcoin, which means that there should be no risk of accidentally spending the same (copied) coin on both chains.\n\nFrom a broader Bitcoin and scaling perspective, the chances of BIP148’s success may have actually increased, due to this announcement. If Bitmain follows through on their blog post, it means the company will take hash power that could have otherwise frustrated the UASF “off the table,” to mine on Bitmain’s Bitcoin chain. As a result, there is a greater chance that BIP148 miners will claim the longest chain versus non-BIP148 miners, avoiding a coin-split on the original blockchain. Additionally, Bitmain’s blog post seems to have angered some Bitcoin users that were so far undecided, further increasing support for BIP148.\n\nThe other scaling proposal in the running is SegWit2x, which is also supported by Bitmain. SegWit2x code should, according to its timeline, be up and running before August 1st. If that deadline is met, it may or may not prevent a coin-split in the first place, depending on its compatibility with the BIP148 UASF. But since this proposal has been mostly developed in private, the status of this project — as well as its (in)compatibility with Bitmain’s “contingency plan” — remains largely unclear.\n\nAnd of course, in the end, it\'s possible that neither BIP148, nor SegWit2x, nor Bitmain\'s Bitcoin will gain much traction. Status quo could prevail, in which case not much would change at all.\n\n', 'Lots of people speculate about the next big innovation that will take their industries by storm.\n\nIn the realm of accounting and finance, there is a major technology often misunderstood by professionals that could dramatically change the game for the financial services industry.\n\nThat technology is blockchain.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain technology can be hard to understand at first.

Financial-technology startups, such as POSaBIT and SinglePoint, use bitcoin as an intermediate step that lets pot buyers use their bank-issued credit cards to purchase weed.\n\n“There’s no industry - whether it’s the production and sale of cannabis or the production and sale of a cup of coffee -that can operate safely, transparently or effectively without access to banks or other financial institutions and traditional services,” Jon Baugher, co-founder of POSaBIT, whose technology is used by 30 dispensaries in Washington state, told Bloomberg. “That’s where we thought we could leverage the use of digital currency.”\n\nAccording to POSaBIT, the company has taken steps to comply with federal and state laws regulating both marijuana sales and digital currency. Customers have to present a valid ID that is scanned, encrypted and stored, while buyers are allowed to acquire no more than $150 in bitcoin to prevent money laundering.\n\nThe company has a nine-point fraud-detection program designed to thwart criminals. It also requires that retail customers have a bank account, not necessarily a given in the cannabis industry.\n\nPeople from the cannabis industry say it may only be a matter of time before pot dealers have an easier solution than using cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe reluctance of banks to handle pot transactions will probably subside before the digital-currency solution has a chance to take off, said Jeffrey Zucker, co-founder and president of Green Lion Partners, a strategy firm focused on early-stage development in the cannabis industry.\n\n“The banking issues are going to be solved in such time that the people in this industry are going to gravitate toward traditional banking,” he told Bloomberg.\n\nRT copy / TRUNEWS summary.\n\nPlease contact TRUNEWS with any news tips related to this story.

The company blamed “sustained heavy traffic,” likely caused by intense Bitcoin and Ethereum trading, for crashing the Coinbase website and mobile app, which remained completely down for at least four hours.\n\nAs has become a familiar frustration to blockchain enthusiasts in recent days, Coinbase went offline at the worst possible time, just as extreme price swings in the cryptocurrencies made investors desperate to buy or sell.\n\nAround 10 a.m. Thursday, the Bitcoin price fell as low as $2079, a more than 30% drop since breaking the $3,000 milestone last weekend (and a 19% decline in the previous 24 hours alone).\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum, a rival cryptocurrency whose eye-popping 40-fold gain this year has far outpaced Bitcoin’s returns, was down as much as 25% from its price a day earlier. The Ethereum price dipped below $274, just three days after it traded above $400 for the first time.\n\nCoinbase had a similar outage in late May while Bitcoin was trading at record highs, illustrating that new systems for trading blockchain currencies are not yet as reliable as traditional stock market exchanges — a lesson a number of investors were learning the hard way, based on their tweets. (While Coinbase initially said it had restored full access to the exchange by mid-afternoon Thursday, it was still trying to repair service for at least some users after 5 p.m., according to a status report on its website.)\n\nCoinbase still down tho pic.twitter.com/4tERCTPHLi — MONETARY MAYHEM™ (@MONETARY_MAYHEM) June 15, 2017\n\nDoes anyone have a reliable alternative to #Coinbase? It seems to be down at every critical moment — Jeffrey Schmidt (@JeffSchmidt9) June 15, 2017\n\nBearish comments by influential investors have triggered several recent selloffs in Bitcoin and Ethereum, such as when Mark Cuban said he thought they were “in a bubble” last week. Morgan Stanley likely contributed to this week’s declines by publishing a couple of research notes casting doubt on whether the surge in cryptocurrency prices is justified. “Market likely getting ahead of itself as we have not seen exponential rise in use case yet, but value is rising exponentially,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Wednesday.\n\nThat followed an even more skeptical research report the bank released a day earlier titled “Blockchain: Unchained?” “The rapid appreciation of Bitcoin and others is somewhat surprising in light of some developments that seemingly would have put downward pressure on the currency,” another group of Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, citing the SEC’s rejection of a Bitcoin ETF, among other factors. “Their values are too volatile and too hard to actually use for payment for most to consider them currencies,” they added.\n\nThe cryptocurrencies’ prices bounced back later in the day. As of 6 p.m. Thursday, Bitcoin was down less than 3% and Ethereum was down just under 8% over a 24-hour period.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Other digital coins are also falling. The decline coincides with a slide in technology stocks that began after a report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned that low volatility in the biggest tech stocks may be blinding investors to risks like cyclicality and regulation.\n\nOne of Goldman Sachs’s technical analysts, Sheba Jafari, sent out a note early this week saying bitcoin was poised for a reversal. Analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a report on Wednesday that bitcoin needs government acceptance and regulation in order to keep climbing.\n\nA Senate bill that targets money laundering and terrorist financing has also drawn criticism this week from some bitcoin enthusiasts, who say the proposed legislation is draconian. The bill, which was introduced in May, includes a section that singles out digital currencies and prepaid access devices.\n\nMany of bitcoin’s cousins, like ripple, NEM and monero, have also struggled in the last week, while the price of ethereum -- the second-largest cryptocurrency -- has increased 20 percent as investors speculate whether it can nab the top spot.\n\nThe weakness in bitcoin’s price also began after digital currency exchange Coinbase experienced an outage Monday due to high trading volume. The interruption followed a slew of recent performance issues that have frustrated users.

The change, which they call a “soft fork” in the currency, will make bitcoin transactions speedier and cheaper, they say.\n\nThe problem: Nobody has the authority to impose those new standards on bitcoin’s decentralized structure, and a major, Beijing-based bitcoin miner called Bitmain just threatened to derail the whole plan with a “hard fork” — namely, carving out a new, alternative currency that could compete with bitcoin.\n\nBitmain is about 20 percent more efficient than average when it comes to mining bitcoin, and the upgrades in the Aug. 1 proposal could threaten that advantage, according to van der Chijs.\n\n“They would lose their efficiency,” van der Chijs said.\n\nUsers have already nicknamed Bitmain’s new currency the “Chinacoin,” though it’s not known if it would only be open to Chinese investors.\n\nBitmain didn’t return an e-mail requesting comment.\n\n“With a new market, especially one that’s person-to-person, people are going to be a little more emotional,” Alan Friedland, founder of bitcoin trading company Compcoin, told The Post.', 'Long a sort of Cold War, bitcoin\'s scaling debate is escalating into what may be best described as a digital Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nNo longer open for diplomacy, users of the $40bn economic network, which hit an all-time high in value last weekend, are now in the midst of evaluating an ever-increasing array of threats from various network stakeholders, each of whom is seeking to steer discourse and development.\n\nIn yet another turn to the scaling debate, major mining firm Bitmain revealed yesterday a strategy outlining how it will respond should a controversial bitcoin code upgrade known as BIP 148 – a change the firm opposes – activate later this summer.\n\nIn a blog post, the company outlined its ""contingency plan"" if users attempt to force a protocol change, thereby circumventing the network\'s current structure in which those running its mining machines signal for upgrades.\n\nMost notably, the proposal would dedicate mining resources to hard forking the network to a rule set with a larger block size – an upgrade that would likely result in two bitcoin networks and two tradeable bitcoin assets.\n\nIn response, the firm, long the center of bitcoin\'s long-running debate and often the foil to the open-source network\'s developers, invited the wider bitcoin community to join the effort.\n\nLay of the land\n\nAdmittedly, there been many proposals that could have lead to a network split over the last few years of bitcoin\'s scaling debate, but none have panned out so far.\n\nIn recent weeks, action has increased, though, with groups starting to form around two scaling proposals, SegWit2x and BIP 148. Each hopes to usher in a code change known as Segregated Witness (SegWit) in a different way. But, each also has a risk of splitting bitcoin into two assets and impacting the value of the network and its users. (Although, as of this morning, it looks like the two proposals might be made compatible.)\n\nAs such, the proposals have been highly politicized, creating market uncertainty and confusion that has arguably exacerbated a diversification by investors into other digital assets.\n\nFor instance, some have gone as far as to call BIP 148\'s activation date bitcoin’s ""Independence Day"" since it pushes through a change without requesting miners to signal support for it first. Philosophically, the movement takes the argument that bitcoin\'s mining was never meant to be so centralized, and that those that contribute resources to securing its ledger weren\'t meant to have outsized control.\n\nBut, Bitmain, among others, disagrees that BIP 148\'s user-activated soft fork (UASF) is the best way to push through upgrades to the cryptocurrency. As have others, the group is citing public safety in its comments.\n\n""BIP148 is very dangerous for exchanges and other business,"" the firm\'s post reads.\n\nElsewhere, the company has described its plan to hard fork as a way to save users from the consequences of a split once BIP 148 activates.\n\nOne potential problem with the UASF is what\'s known as a \'reorganization\', where user transactions could later be erased from the blockchain history. This could happen if two chains persist temporarily, but then merge back into one chain, erasing transactions that occurred on the \'losing\' chain.\n\nThe company goes on later to expand on its plan to hard fork (or mine on a different version of bitcoin\'s blockchain history) in response to the UASF in an effort to make the split more permanent.\n\nThe statement read:\n\n”Bitmain will use some of its own hash rate and work with the developer community to have a contingency plan based on [the user-activated hard fork]. We will develop options for miners to voluntarily join us.”\n\nBitmain said it will kick off the hard fork, which it called a ""User-Activated Hard Fork (UAHF)"", about 12 hours after the UASF starts. Though, the firm plans to mine it privately for three days before it opens to other miners.\n\nForthright plan\n\nWith each new twist, bitcoin\'s bitcoin scaling debate is growing more confusing and harder to follow. Moving quickly from proposals as diverse as SegWit, SegWit2x, UASF and now UAHF, the situation so far this year may be too complex to describe in full.\n\nIn this light, however, some believe the strength of the UAHF proposal is that it moves the market to a kind of certainty.\n\nCornell University computer science associate professor Emin Gün Sirer thinks that it\'s a good sign, at least in that parties are being ""transparent"" about their future plans.\n\n""The fact that they’re being forthright about it is nice to see. From the perspective of someone who\'s not on either side [of the debate], this is a welcome development,"" he said, adding:\n\n""You can look at this and you can plan what to do next. What we need in this space more than anything is, if not a compromise, at least some predictability. That\'s what we seem to be moving towards.""\n\nOthers have argued similarly, noting that the proposal outlines a way to bake in safety features, including resistance to \'replay attacks\' should the network split. (This was a problem in the aftermath of ethereum\'s split into ethereum and ethereum classic last summer).\n\nBitcoin Unlimited developer David Jerry Chan argued on social media that the change protects the main blockchain from a UASF.\n\nStill other observers think that no outcome is likely and that, at the end of the day, neither side will sacrifice the network\'s accrued value and market leader position for a small technical shift.\n\nThe opposition\n\nAs usual, though, reactions to the plan were split, generally between those that support volunteer developer group Bitcoin Core’s technical roadmap and those who don\'t.\n\nSatoshiLabs CEO Marek Palatinus, the company behind mining pool Slush Pool, reported that the company has been ""monitoring"" the debate, but ""the situation is getting really foggy"".\n\nHe argued that he interpreted the blog post to mean that Bitmain will mine a private blockchain that would be governed by the company.\n\nHe told CoinDesk in an email:\n\n""It looks like Bitmain is preparing hard fork to some kind of privately mined blockchain which [means] we cannot offer mining on such [a] chain for our customers. We believe in open development and therefore we consider [it] very unfortunate that such important decisions happen behind [the] close door of [a] private company. We won\'t call such [a] private blockchain \'the bitcoin\'.""\n\nAlong these lines, Henry Brade, CEO of European cryptocurrency trading platform Prasos, added that he thinks bitcoin users are resistant to the idea of miners controlling the rules of the network.\n\nWhile he believes miners play a ""crucial"" role for bitcoin, he said that Bitmain\'s new roadmap is a sign that the company is trying to dictate the rules of what is supposed to be a ""decentralized"" online currency.\n\n""It\'s good that Bitmain released this \'plan\' though, because it shows everyone that what they really want is complete control over bitcoin,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said, putting the same idea in a different way.\n\nOthers, such as pseudonymous developer Alphonse Pace, argued that the hard fork is a ""complete bluff"", adding to the idea that this is merely an escalation of claims.\n\n""They make no details about how much hash power to commit to it. It may be so insignificant that it has virtually no blocks, and they won\'t even publicly show what they are mining because it probably will be embarrassingly small,"" the developer said.\n\nMore talk of a UASF\n\nStill, some are taking the event as a sign that the 1st August UASF is working as it\'s supposed to.\n\nBrade, who favors the UASF, told CoinDesk that he\'s ""very optimistic"" about this turn of events, arguing that Bitmain would ignore the UASF if they thought it would not work.\n\n""It\'s a sign that Bitmain actually thinks the UASF community plan is legit. They are worried that it\'s going to happen. Apparently they don’t like it,"" he said.\n\nFurther, he believes it will further push users towards a UASF, an upgrading mechanism that he favors.\n\nHe added:\n\n""The way they\'re going about it, I think it\'s going to only strengthen the resolve of the UASF movement. I think they will get more support. People in bitcoin don’t like the idea that there’s one miner that has a lot of power.""\n\nIndeed, to some, the appeal of a UASF is that it has more of a psychological effect. Pseudonymous developer Shaolinfry, who popularized the idea of a UASF a couple of months ago, argued that the threat of a UASF is what led mining pools to ultimately support SegWit on litecoin, for example.\n\nFurther, despite Bitmain arguing that a reorganization is a reason to split off into another chain, others have claimed that safety is the key reason they will upgrade to BIP 148. That way, a user\'s bitcoins are less likely to disappear in the event of a split.\n\nEither way, this uncertainty (to which Sirer alluded) is a reason why some developers argue that bitcoin companies and users should put a pause on bitcoin transactions at around this time to stay safe.\n\nFor one, while 30 or so firms have pledged support for the UASF, the big players that such an upgrading mechanism is contingent on (eg exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken) have not.\n\nLonger-term roadmap\n\nAfter the hard fork, Bitmain also outlined a farther-looking technical plan for the resulting blockchain if its upgrade works as planned.\n\nThe company said that three bitcoin developer groups are working on the UAHF code, which will be ready by 1st July. Long-term plans are to eventually add the scaling optimization SegWit, an RSK sidechain that would port ethereum-style smart contracts to bitcoin, extension blocks, the scalable protocol Bitcoin-NG and other features.\n\nAll that said, the company said that it still supports SegWit2x, a recent scaling \'agreement\' that boasts the support of most major bitcoin companies and groups that control more than 80% of the mining power. As with the hard fork, response to the roadmap was mixed.\n\nFor one, some of the included technologies might be incompatible with what developers are working on right now.\n\nLightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark noted that the technology Lumino is not compatible with Lightning Network. Developers of several different versions of the transaction-boosting software drew up standards last October so that all of them would work together.\n\nStill, others are hopeful about the company\'s long-term roadmap.\n\nSirer said that he wasn\'t surprised to see that Bitcoin-NG, a potentially more scalable version of the protocol that he co-architected with other researchers at Cornell University, was included.\n\n""It shows that they\'re not just kicking the can down the road. Instead they have a medium to long-term vision for how to really address the scalability problem,"" he said.\n\nGame of bluffs\n\nStill, there are signs that the debate, despite its diversity of proposals, is getting more and more dictated by emotion.\n\nIn comments, Haipo Yang, CEO of bitcoin mining pool ViaBTC, for example, continued to voice his support for Bitmain and its proposal on the basis that it might eliminate network congestion and fees.\n\nAt play, however, is a complexity of underlying ideas and motives.\n\nYang, for instance, believes high fees are forcing away potential users (not showcasing that demand is escalating and growing), that developers are seeking too much control (despite largely still backing the same proposal for months), that users should be able to choose from multiple clients (though they technically can and aren\'t) and that a split into two networks is better for all involved (though that might affect the value of users\' funds).\n\nOn these issues (and more), there are arguments to take on either side.\n\nBut, in this jockeying for control, the migration of investor funds into alternative protocols may prove to be adding pressures to what some are calling a \'power struggle\'.\n\nFinally exasperated by the questioning, Yang concluded:\n\n""I don\'t know which side [will] win. [A] split to two bitcoin is better, I think.""\n\nThe question now may be whether this market change will force action, and if it does, whether users will be caught in any fallout.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the SegWit2x proposal and has an ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nArms race image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Coindesk explained it best: ""Most notably, the proposal would dedicate mining resources to hard forking the network to a rule set with a larger block size — an upgrade that would likely result in two bitcoin networks and two tradable bitcoin assets.""\n\nBut the writing has been on the wall. Bitcoin gained about 180% from the beginning of April through the middle of June. That run prompted tech billionaire Mark Cuban to call bitcoin a ""bubble."" Goldman Sachs also sounded the alarm on bitcoin in a note to clients sent earlier this week, saying that ""the balance of signals are looking broadly heavy"" and the price could fall to as low as $1,915.\n\nWhile the news surrounding the cryptocurrency has been mostly positive as of late, with China\'s three largest bitcoin exchanges lifting their bans on client withdrawals and Japan\'s government naming it a legal payment method, one big issue still needs to be resolved. The US Securities and Exchange Commission took public comment on its decision to reject the Winklevoss twins\' proposal for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, but it is unclear when an updated ruling will be handed down.', 'Europe’s only exchange-traded note (ETN) issued by XBT Provider has passed $100 mln of managed assets.\n\nIn a press release issued on Thursday, the Swedish issuer also announced a partnership with Swiss-based Xapo for cold storage of its investors’ Bitcoins.\n\n“In the last 60 days, XBT Provider’s exchange traded bitcoin note has experienced unprecedented volume in trading and demand from both retail and institutional investors searching for exposure to bitcoin,” Jean-Marie Mognetti, head of trading and operations at XBT Provider, commented.\n\nXapo recently concluded its move to Switzerland after a lengthy process hampered by regulatory uncertainty.\n\nNow free of headaches, the startup’s fortunes appear more buoyant as a flagship member of Switzerland’s Crypto Valley initiative.\n\n“The addition of Xapo to our infrastructure is a critical step in ensuring that our products remain the most professional bitcoin investment products available to investors, globally,” Ryan Radloff, head of investor relations at XBT Provider, added.\n\nXBT, meanwhile, became accessible to UK investors earlier this month as the country’s largest retail trading platform Hargreaves Lansdown added the option as a result of user requests.\n\n“This is very exciting for any investors who have been thinking about buying Bitcoin but did not want the hassle of security and regulation involved in buying Bitcoin directly from exchanges,” Radloff said about the move.', 'Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany’s central bank Bundesbank and one of the most powerful bankers in Europe, proposed the development of central bank-issued digital currencies to compete with Bitcoin.\n\nWeidmann argued that Bitcoin could potentially worsen future financial crisis due to its decentralized nature and the non-existence of central entities within the Bitcoin network.\n\nAlthough Weidmann’s recognition of the explosive growth of the Fintech and cryptocurrency markets should be appreciated, he is dismissive of the structure of Bitcoin and the characteristics of decentralized cryptocurrencies that make settlement networks such as Bitcoin valuable.\n\nTo this date, only a very limited group of traders, experts, analysts, investors and users understand the technical intricacies of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin’s concept is simple in theory, it has been difficult for the vast majority of people within the traditional finance sector to understand because they have learned to deal with centralized monetary systems and financial networks.\n\nFor most, it is difficult to embrace Bitcoin’s decentralized nature because it contradicts the very purpose of the global financial sector.\n\nDuring a speech featured by Business Insider, Weidmann stated that the issuance of central bank-based centralized digital currencies is safer for the public as a central bank cannot become insolvent. He stated:\n\n""Allowing the public to hold claims on the central bank might make their liquid assets safer, because a central bank cannot become insolvent. This is a feature which will become relevant especially in times of crisis - when there will be a strong incentive for money holders to switch bank deposits into the official digital currency simply at the push of a button. But what might be a boon for savers in search of safety might be a bane for banks, as this makes a bank run potentially even easier.""\n\nHowever, Weidmann was dismissive of the reason behind the rising demand and explosive growth of cryptocurrencies. The vast majority of investors trading and purchasing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are looking for decentralized settlement networks with which they can process transactions without intermediaries and with lower costs.\n\nSafe haven\n\nThe rest have invested in Bitcoin as a safe haven asset because its value and price are not dependent on the economy and the performance of other sectors. Rather, Bitcoin’s price is solely affected by its market and the demand from investors.\n\nTechnically, Weidmann’s basic point in that central banks can’t become insolvent or bankrupt because they are supported by their respective governments is accurate. But, his point that central bank-backed centralized digital currencies could compete with Bitcoin is not valid as investors and users of Bitcoin perceive the cryptocurrency as the alternative financial network to the global banking system.\n\nMore importantly, Weidmann brought up an issue with liquidity which could become an issue for Bitcoin in its later stages. Most overseas markets have already heavily regulated Bitcoin and in many regions including Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, Bitcoin is recognized as a legal payment method and currency.', 'Digital currency bitcoin has risen by more than 200% in 2017, and it actually broke through the $3,000 level for the first time just hours before I wrote this -- and dropped by more than $500 soon after. It\'s fair to say that not only is bitcoin hitting record highs, but the market is extremely volatile. Many people have made speculative investments in the currency, with no upper limit to the price of a ""coin"" in sight.\n\nWhile I never recommend buying or not buying an investment simply because of what a billionaire says, it can be a smart idea to listen to what some of the most successful people in the world have to say. This is why Warren Buffett\'s investing wisdom is so widely followed, just to name one example. With that in mind, here are what three of the most respected billionaires in the world have said about bitcoin.\n\nThis billionaire sees lots of value, but thinks the price is in a bubble\n\nBillionaire investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban seems to have mixed feelings on bitcoin. On the bearish side of things, in a recent series of tweets, Cuban made it clear that he thinks bitcoin is in a bubble.\n\n""I think it\'s in a bubble. I just don\'t know when or how much it corrects,"" tweeted Cuban. He went on to mention that when everyone is bragging about making easy money, it\'s a sign of a bubble. When I think back to the tech bubble of the late \'90s, or especially to the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, this certainly makes sense. ""Everyone always thinks that this time is different,"" Cuban added.\n\nWhile Cuban was tweeting his comments over a span of about an hour and a half, the price of bitcoin noticeably fell. The billionaire felt that this was further proof of his point, and tweeted a few hours later: ""You know it\'s a bubble when a random twitter thread bounces the price.""\n\nOn the other hand, Cuban also praised blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin. ""I think blockchain is very valuable and will be at the core of most transactions in the future,"" tweeted Cuban. ""Healthcare, finance, etc all will use it.""\n\nIn a nutshell, Cuban is saying that bitcoin and its blockchain technology does have value. It\'s just not worth $3,000 at this point in time.\n\nIs bitcoin a mirage?\n\nWarren Buffett is perhaps the most respected investor in the entire world, and hasn\'t said much about bitcoin recently. However, the Oracle of Omaha notably dismissed bitcoin as an investment in a 2014 CNBC interview.\n\nBuffett essentially said that bitcoin is essentially a more modern version of writing someone a check or sending a money order, and advised investors to avoid it. ""Stay away from it. It\'s a mirage, basically...The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is a joke in my view.""\n\nNot surprisingly, the response by many tech industry heavyweights, such as Marc Andreessen, was to dismiss Buffett\'s comments, claiming bitcoin is yet another new technology Buffett doesn\'t understand. And Andreessen may have a point -- Buffett has notoriously avoided investing in new technologies throughout his career, and has actually said it\'s because he doesn\'t understand them well enough to invest.\n\nTo be fair, remember that Buffett\'s comments were made over three years ago, and the value of the blockchain technology in particular has been made much clearer since then. So, it\'s entirely possible that Buffett\'s viewpoint on bitcoin has changed somewhat. Even so, don\'t count on Buffett buying bitcoin with Berkshire Hathaway\'s capital anytime soon.\n\nThis billionaire is a fan of blockchain technology\n\nFinally, billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson is perhaps the biggest fan of bitcoin and blockchain technology of the three men discussed here. In fact, Branson has gone so far as to refer to blockchain as an ""economic revolution.""\n\nAt last year\'s Virgin Disruptors event in London, Branson specifically mentioned a potential application of using the blockchain to create a better land titling system. He mentioned that in developing countries, land titles are frequently forged or taken from the rightful property owners, and said that a blockchain-based solution could solve this problem once and for all.\n\nBranson has held an annual ""Blockchain Summit"" on his private island for the past two years, which has resulted in several new ideas and partnerships.\n\nIn regards to bitcoin as a currency and whether or not it will work, Branson replied ""Well, I think it is working."" However, Branson also acknowledged the currency\'s volatility, and that other similar currencies could emerge that ""may be even better.""']"
06/16/2017,"['Banking giant Goldman Sachs has recently warned its clients that Bitcoin may halt in its bullish movement and head for a bearish movement very soon, according to a report by Interactive Investor. While the company that does not regularly monitor cryptocurrency news, it recently expressed its own opinion regarding Bitcoin in its report called Blockchain Unchained on June 12, 2017.\n\nAccording to the bank, once it reaches its high at over $3,100, there would be an expected fall because of its continuous bullish movement.\n\nBitcoin price slides\n\nAccording to ZeroHedge, there is an expected reversal once it reaches its all time high. This is because he claims that the oscillator shows negatively which indicates an eventual bear movement.\n\nIn fact, recent movements in Bitcoin price shows trends of it going lower than the highs that it has accumulated over the past weeks essentially reaching a ten week low of $2,547.\n\nWith this in mind, Bitcoin is expected to further drop in value as the weeks go by. Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that hit a low. In fact, other cryptocurrencies have hit a low red mark including the the second contender to Bitcoin, Ethereum, which has also reached a low of $361 after it went over $400 in its last all time high.\n\nIn fact, almost all the cryptocurrencies experienced lows this week so it could be a market correction which frequently happens in other financial markets such as the stock market.\n\nHowever, with this movement, it does seem that the prediction of Goldman Sachs may be right on cue with their prediction of a bearish market.\n\nThe Ethereum takeover?\n\nWhile Ethereum has also been experiencing price correct along with Bitcoin, it seems that Bitcoin’s drop is much lower than that of Ethereum. This might be an indication that Ethereum is set to overtake Bitcoin this year. According to report by Market Watch, the value of Ethereum is rapidly increasing in an uptrend although there are occasional drops.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is remaining quite steady with a big price drop which may be a chance for Ethereum to take over.', 'The working group behind the Segwit2x bitcoin scaling proposal has announced that the first version of its code is now ready for review and testing.\n\nAs such, the release provides the market with a first look at the technology underlying one of the most broadly supported bids to enhance the network. Announced in May as an ""agreement"" that united miners and startups, Segwit2x is an alternative technology roadmap to one proposed by Bitcoin Core, the network\'s open-source developer group.\n\nIt has since emerged as a frequent subject of praise, criticism and discussion.\n\nHowever, in what could be a promising sign, Segwit2x could become a moderate option that helps to avoid a contentious network split, and it looks like it could end up being somewhat compatible with an alternative proposal, the user-activated soft fork (UASF) BIP 148, which, as coded, will activate on 1st August.\n\nThe news is notable because earlier this week any compatibility between the two proposals seemed less likely – a discordance that raised fears of a split of the blockchain into two competing assets.\n\nThe development became apparent on Wednesday, when bitcoin developer James Hilliard submitted a change request, along with a code change that would reduce the time it takes for mining pools to lock in the update.\n\nOn GitHub, Hilliard said:\n\n""This should reduce the chance of a conflict with BIP 148.""\n\nBy reducing that time, mining pools will have one (or maybe two) three-day periods in which they can lock-in a controversial code change called Segregated Witness (SegWit) by signaling support using the SegWit2x software before the UASF occurs on August 1st. Though, it\'s unclear if mining pools will decide to do so.\n\nThe request was well-received, being met with several \'ACKs\' – developer shorthand for \'agreed\', and a sign of approval.\n\nFirmer timelines\n\nThe alpha release of SegWit2x includes a working version of the software, which combines two changes, the scaling optimization SegWit and an increased 2MB block-size parameter.\n\nThe increase to 2MB is now scheduled for three months after SegWit activates, according to an email from BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. Prior to this, it\'s been less clear (even to some SegWit2x participants) when the 2MB hard fork would take place.\n\n""Segwit2x development has been moving quickly according to plan, and the project is in good shape,"" Belshe said, in the message to the working group.\n\nThe 2MB block size has long been a point of contention, partially because it could lead to a blockchain split if not everyone agrees to upgrade to the new blockchain code. Further, some in the industry have already suggested they don\'t plan to.\n\nHowever, SegWit2x has won the support of most major bitcoin companies and mining firms, in total representing over 80% of bitcoin\'s hash rate. (Though it remains unclear how reliable this support will be owing partly to fatigue around the issue).\n\nWith the alpha version out, the wider community now gets to review and test the software. The release also includes a new bitcoin testnet that developers can use to put the software through its paces and identify any bugs.\n\nTesting phase\n\nDevelopers can trial the software using the new test network, called testnet5, for the next two weeks.\n\n""We are planning to conduct rounds of testing against the new testnet5 including everyone from the working group who would like to participate,"" BitPay senior developer Justin Langston said in another email to the working group.\n\nThe plan for these rounds is to simulate the code\'s deployment lifecycle, from signaling support for SegWit to activating the 2MB block-size parameter.\n\nThese rounds of testing and review are aimed to help avoid any future network problems, such as, in a worst-case scenario, the loss of users\' bitcoin.\n\nIn the email, Langston wrote:\n\n""My perspective is limited. We need your feedback on what tests would be essential for your company to adequately assess applicable risks and be prepared to deploy on livenet, signaling accordingly, when the time comes.""\n\nSecurity loose ends?\n\nFeedback on SegWit2x\'s plan has already been rolling in.\n\nOne working group participant argued there is potential for \'replay attacks\' in the event of a hard fork. Replay attacks, in the event of a split leaving the community with two bitcoin tokens, could allow users to accidentally spend their bitcoin on both networks.\n\nThis confusion happened last summer when ethereum split into two coins, leading some companies to lose money.\n\nThe participant argued that protection from this confusing and potentially dangerous issue is needed within Segwit2x\'s code.\n\nSome Bitcoin Core developers have also criticized Segwit2x\'s development timeline as being too short, because it often takes a significant amount of time to catch all errors associated with bitcoin code changes. SegWit itself was tested for over a year before it was launched.\n\nSo far, though, SegWit2x developers haven\'t skipped a beat, saying the project will continue to move forward along the original timeline, with the beta release scheduled for 30th June. On 21st July, users will be able to run and signal the fully vetted software, according to the group.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the SegWit2x proposal and has an ownership stake in both BitGo and BitPay.\n\nBinary code image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

You made your first and perhaps your second million of dollars -- quickly, very quickly. Perhaps in the last six months in the Bitcoin investment trust. Now make sure that you don't lose all that money faster than you made it, and then some.\n\nLike Sir Isaac Newton back in 1720s who amassed a great fortune by buying shares early on in South Sea Company -- and then lost it all and much more.\n\nNewton's mistake was that he didn't resist a common temptation during bubble markets: getting back into a bubble asset at higher price, and staying with it as market sentiment changes and the bubble bursts.\n\n“Back in 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in the South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England,” writes Jason Zweig in the commentary for the revised edition of Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor. “Sensing the market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that he “could calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people.” Newton dumped his South Sea Company shares, pocketing a 100% profit totaling 7,000 pounds.\n\nBut just months later, swept up in the wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in… at a much higher price — and lost 20,000 pounds (or more than $3 million in today’s money).\n\nFor the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words “South Sea Company” in his presence.”\n\nBehavioral finance experts have a good explanation for this kind of behavior. It is called mental accounting, which —unlike traditional accounting— causes individuals to treat gains in financial markets, lottery winnings and other bets differently from money earned from labor, interest income or other sources.\n\nHow? By assuming higher risks.\n\nThat’s often the case with money won in a casino.\n\nAs Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein explain in Nudge, “you can see mental accounting in a casino. Watch a gambler who is lucky enough to win some money early in the evening. You might see him take the money he has won and put it in one pocket, and put the money he brought with him to gamble that evening (yet another mental account) into a different pocket. Gamblers even have a term for this. The money that recently has been won is called ‘house money’ because in gambling parlance the casino is referred to as the house. Betting some of the money that you have just won is referred to as ‘gambling with the house’s money’ — as if it were somehow different from some other kind of money. Experimental evidence suggests that people are more willing to gamble with money they consider house money—like buying into an inflated asset.\n\nStill, Newton’s example suggests that committing this costly mistake has nothing to do with intelligence, and everything to do with emotions -- like greed -- which lead investors to costly mistakes."", 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nBy now, chances are pretty good that you\'ve heard of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency unleashed on the world in 2009 by a mysterious person or group that goes by Satoshi Nakamoto. Maybe you\'ve heard it\'s the currency that fuels massive darknet drug markets like the now-defunct Silk Road. Or maybe your encounter with the cryptocoin was more benign and you saw one of the weird looking bitcoin ATMs in a convenience store.\n\nBut unless you\'re already pretty involved in the cryptocurrency world, you may not have heard of ethereum, the second largest crypto asset that\'s recently been giving bitcoin a run for its virtual money. Even if you have heard of ethereum, you may be at a loss when it comes to explaining how it differs from bitcoin.\n\nIn either case, you\'ve come to the right place.\n\nWHAT IS ETHEREUM?\n\nEthereum is often touted as a ""world computer.""\n\nWhat that fancy language really means is that ethereum is a platform for the creation of decentralized applications (dapps), using what are known as smart contracts. Smart contracts are bits of code that automatically execute an action after certain requirements have been met—say, sending a slice of an app\'s profits to investors after a predetermined date has passed. Bitcoin has smart contracts, too, but ethereum makes them really easy to use since they\'re baked into the system\'s design.\n\nAll of this takes place on a blockchain, which bitcoin uses, too. All a blockchain does is act as a public ledger that lists everything that goes on in the network in real-time. It\'s the tool that makes the whole thing possible. The blockchain, and thus the ethereum network, is distributed across thousands of computers (or ""nodes"") around the world. It\'s also ""Turing complete,"" which means that smart contracts on the blockchain can handle most computational functions, allowing them to be pretty sophisticated.\n\nFor example, say that I want to send my colleague Jordan some money. I would register this contract between myself and Jordan on the blockchain and the ethereum network would automatically facilitate the exchange of money. Since the blockchain is a public ledger, anyone and everyone can see that this transaction happened.\n\nYou may have heard that bitcoin is relatively anonymous, since people are identified by cryptographic addresses, not their names. Ethereum is similar. Unless Jordan or I decide to broadcast our identities on the network, no one will know who executed that transaction—they\'ll just see that a transaction for X amount of money occurred at a given time.\n\nIf you want to take a look at what\'s happening on the ethereum blockchain for yourself, you can check out all the transactions on the ethereum network, or look at a particular user\'s history, at any time using a tool called Etherscan.\n\nWHO MADE ETHEREUM?\n\nEthereum was invented by Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian computer programmer born in Russia who cut his teeth on bitcoin as a teenager. In 2013, Buterin published the white paper that would lay the foundations for the ethereum network. He was only 19 years old at the time, which is why he is often hailed as as a boy genius.\n\nIn 2014, Buterin hosted a crowdsale to fund the launch of ethereum and raised 18 million dollars through his Swiss company, the Ethereum Switzerland GmbH. On July 30, 2015, the first (or genesis) block of data on the blockchain was created and the ethereum network was born.\n\nIt\'s early days for ethereum, and Buterin is still leading the bulk of development work. He has a team of programmers behind him, however, and the ethereum community is fairly active when it comes to sharing ideas about what should come next. Buterin still holds most of the influence, although he told Motherboard in an interview that he is already thinking of reducing his role and getting others to take up the mantle.\n\nVitalik Buterin, inventor of ethereum. Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\nHOW IS ETHEREUM DIFFERENT THAN BITCOIN?\n\nThe short answer is: ethereum can do a lot more. Bitcoin was created to be a decentralized currency that would be an alternative to the centralized banking systems and fiat currencies of national governments. Both ethereum and bitcoin are based on a blockchain and have their own currencies, and like bitcoin, ether (ethereum\'s currency) can be used as virtual money.\n\nBut because the ethereum network also functions as a global computer thanks to smart contracts, this ether isn\'t limited to being used as a currency. Rather, ether can be used to underpin any sort of computer application you can imagine. The use cases for the ethereum network are only limited by the imaginations of application developers. For example, people are developing apps for energy distribution, digital advertising, and a digital marketplace for unused computing power.\n\nEthereum also promises to be even more decentralized than bitcoin. The method that bitcoin uses to upload blocks of data to the blockchain, called ""mining,"" pits people against each other in a race to be the first to complete a useless math problem. All this does is waste resources, but the computational effort ensures that only serious people are contributing. In return, miners get a reward in bitcoin. This is called ""proof of work.""\n\nBecause of this requirement, bitcoiners are using increasingly powerful (and expensive) computer chips, preventing most normal folks from participating. Ethereum\'s mining scheme, on the other hand, was designed to be ""memory hard,"" which means that using more powerful chips won\'t improve your chances of being the first to win the race. In practical terms, this means that individuals will always to be able to use their home computers or low-cost chips to mine ether. Ethereum miners are also rewarded with ether.\n\nHowever, bitcoin will always be based on wasting computational resources in this way, but ethereum is already planning to move away from the ""proof of work"" mining system to something called ""proof of stake""—more on this later.\n\nWHAT IS ETHER?\n\nThe ethereum network runs on a crypto asset (sometimes called a cryptocurrency) called ether, which is abbreviated ETH.\n\nEther is how people pay for things in the ethereum network. For example, when someone invests in a new ethereum app, they do so by sending ether to the developers. Ether\'s value is determined by a market where people buy and sell it for real-world money. Like bitcoin, new ether is mined by people using their computers to complete useless math functions that prove they did some work.\n\nAt the moment there are about 90 million ether in circulation. No more than 18 million ether are newly minted each year. While bitcoin has a hard cap on the number of coins that will ever exist, ethereum has no predetermined limit for the total number of coins that will be in the network years from now.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean new ether will be entering the system at that rate forever. Soon, ethereum will change the method it uses to mine new ether, which will in turn cause the cap of newly issued ether to be restricted. As for how much lower the cap will actually be, ethereum\'s website simply says it\'s still being researched.\n\nWHAT IS GAS?\n\nGas is the ""fuel"" that runs the ethereum network. The value of gas is determined by the cost of computation for an action the network performs—basically, everything that dapps and smart contracts do cost gas. This ensures that nobody does work for nothing, and discourages inefficient code.\n\nGas is paid out in ether, and currently the value of gas is a tiny, tiny fraction of ETH. The reason that ether itself isn\'t the fuel for ethereum is that the price of ETH can change based on market demand. It wouldn\'t be good for anybody if the cost of performing actions on the network was suddenly unaffordable because ETH had a good week. Instead, gas will always be pegged to the actual cost of computation, and paid out in ether.\n\nHOW IS ETHER BOUGHT AND STORED?\n\nJust like in bitcoin, users on the ethereum network need a wallet in order to buy, sell, and hold ether.\n\nUnlike a wallet you use for cash in the real world, ethereum wallets don\'t actually contain any of your cryptocurrency. Rather, all cryptocurrency is floating around in the blockchain network itself. Wallets are just an address that you use to register your transactions on the blockchain and signal to everybody else that you own some of that cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen you create an ethereum wallet, just like in bitcoin, what you\'re really doing is creating a pair of unique cryptographic keys. The public part of the key pair is your wallet address, which others can use to send you ether. The second half of the key is secret, and known only to you. This secret key allows you to move the ether that is associated with your wallet address on the blockchain.\n\nA good way to do this is by creating a \'paper wallet\' on a service like myetherwallet, which will generate a public and private key that you can then print and store in a safe location. A more secure method, however, is to use a hardware wallet like the Nano Ledger or Trezor, which allow you to store your keys offline and away from hackers. Fair warning: If you lose your paper or hardware wallet, you\'ve lost your private key. This means you\'ve lost all the ether in your wallet forever. There is no possible way to recover it.\n\nYou can buy more ether using real-world money on sites known as ""exchanges."" These are kind of like stock markets for cryptocurrencies. One popular site is called Coinbase, which is part exchange, and part wallet service that lets you store your ether. On Coinbase, instead of having to remember your keys, you just need to remember your email and password.\n\nThis sounds easy, but it can be dangerous. Coinbase actually stores your private key, which allows their service to be very user-friendly, but could mean disaster for you if hackers ever compromise their site and take your key. That would allow them to steal your cryptocurrency. If you do use Coinbase, use an application like Authy or Google Authenticator to make it a bit more difficult for the bad guys.\n\nWHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT DECENTRALIZED APPS?\n\nThe main selling point of decentralized applications, or dapps, on the ethereum network is that they can be run without a central authority facilitating the transactions.\n\nIn a centralized system, like, say, Facebook, there is one central point of control—and of failure. If Facebook\'s company-owned servers go down, so does the site. But on a decentralized model, each node on network is both a server and a client, which means that if any one node gets taken offline, the platform will still be able to keep on trucking. To take down the ethereum network completely, you\'d have to take down the 30,000 nodes around the world that comprise the network—that\'s not likely to happen.\n\nDapps, because they\'re based on smart contracts, also allow for a relatively easy model of collective ownership and even governance using what are known as ""tokens."" Tokens are kind of like shares in a corporation, and are sold by dapp owners to eager investors during Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs.\n\nWHAT IS AN INITIAL COIN OFFERING (ICO)?\n\nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are essentially the blockchain equivalent of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), when a company issues its first shares to investors. But in ethereum, they\'re called ""tokens."" It\'s important to note that buying tokens in an ICO is not the same thing as owning stock in the company. Rather, these tokens have specific utility relative to the company\'s function. Often, they may allow token-holders to vote on company decisions or get a share of the profits.\n\nOver the last few months, the number of ethereum ICOs has skyrocketed. Many of the ICOs have managed to raise tens of millions of dollars in just a matter of minutes (or occasionally, a matter of seconds). This has become a point of concern for the ethereum community, who worry that ICOs will essentially function like Kickstarter—purely a method of raising startup capital. This isn\'t a bad thing in and of itself, but many ICOs have been funded without deploying a single line of code, leading some to worry that bad actors could get funded and eventually screw investors.\n\nWHAT IS ETHEREUM CLASSIC?\n\nThe largest ICO in history was the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), an ethereum venture capital fund that managed to raise $150 million before a previously unknown glitch in the smart contract saw an anonymous attacker run off with $55 million.\n\nTo fix this, ethereum implemented a hard fork, which saw the currency split into two versions, each with their own blockchains. On the new version of ethereum, the hacker\'s stolen funds were invalid. This was a controversial decision, since the blockchain\'s great virtue is that it\'s supposed to be unchangeable, and a group of stubborn enthusiasts kept using the old version of ethereum, eventually rebranding it as its own currency: Ethereum Classic.\n\nEthereum Classic is still chugging along, and it stands as a testament to how nobody really knows what\'s going to happen next in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nWHAT IS PROOF OF STAKE AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?\n\nAs of March, ethereum is on the second version of its network, called Homestead. At some point in the future, it will be transitioning to the fourth version of ethereum called Serenity, which will shift the network from a Proof of Work (PoW) model to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model.\n\nFor now, mining ether requires demonstrating that miners have actually done the wasteful computations necessary to add a new block on the chain. Although this prevents spam attacks on the network, it\'s also incredibly resource intensive and makes it hard for ethereum to scale. Bitcoin, unlike ethereum, is locked into this system forever.\n\nProof-of-Stake, on the other hand, doesn\'t require miners to do useless math in a race to solve a block. Rather, the creator of each new block on the chain is chosen by an algorithm, based on the amount of of ether that the user has—or, stake. The larger your stake, the more likely you are to be chosen to validate a new block. Under PoS, there is no longer a reward for creating a new block. Rather, the user responsible for creating the new block—called a forager—is rewarded with the gas associated with that block.\n\nPoS will also drastically reduce the amount of electricity required to perform a transaction on the blockchain. For example, Bitcoin still operates on a PoW model and the energy required for a single bitcoin transaction required the same amount of energy that 1.5 American households use every day. The PoS model is a more green, sustainable alternative.\n\nNow that you\'re all brush up on the basics, take a deeper dive into the world of cryptocurrencies with Motherboard\'s Primer on Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that the ethereum network would switch to Proof of Stake during the third version of its network, Metropolis. The transition to PoS will actually occur during the fourth version, Serenity. Motherboard regrets the error.\n\n', 'What the heck is happening in the crypto world? Is Ethereum finally dead? Is ETH taking its last breaths?\n\n\n\nNot likey. In fact, the recent pullback on the ETH-USD market is probably one of the best and healthiest things investors and traders could have asked for. Given ether’s 300% price rise in just over a month, this pullback has a left many traders and investors bullish on the ETH-USD market.\n\nOn a macro-scale, we can see ETH-USD had a very nice, textbook market correction along the 50% Fibonacci Retracement Line (shown in brown). This test of the 50% line was immediately rejected and is illustrated by the massive spike in volume (shown in blue).\n\nFor healthy, growing markets 50% retracements are a very common occurrence, and the market response to the retracement can be viewed as a sort of litmus test for the strength of a market (i.e. a positive rejection of the 50% line with upward price action tends to indicate the market still desires higher prices, and a negative move from the 50% line will typically indicate the market is still extended and thus overvalued).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ETHUSD, GDAX, 12HR Candles\n\nLooking at the micro-trend, we see the strong price rejection bounced off the 50% Fibonacci Retracement Line and is currently in the process of forming what is known as an “Inverse Head and Shoulders” pattern. This pattern gets its name simply because it has the following, easily identifiable characters:\n\nA well defined neckline (shown in yellow)\n\nA break of the descending trend line (shown in brown)\n\nA left shoulder, a head which makes the lowest peak, and a right shoulder\n\nA re-test of the neckline (at the time this image was made, the market was testing the neckline)\n\nFinally, to confirm the reversal pattern, volume usually needs to increase after the re-test of the neckline to gain strength in the upward movement.\n\nFigure 2: ETHUSD, GDAX, 30Min Candles\n\nThis sort of pattern is often traded in FOREX and stock markets because it is seen as a reliable and predictable indication of future price movement. Typical price projections for Inverse Head and Shoulders are easily calculated with the following formula:\n\nPrice Movement = Price of the Neck Line (~$350) - Price of the Head (~$250) = ~$100\n\nPrice Target for Trend = Price Movement + Neck Line Price = $450\n\nGiven the strength of the macro-trend’s rejection of the 50% Fibonacci Retracement Line and the current pattern forming on the 1-hour charts, we must then look to other indicators to give us further market insight. Two commonly used momentum indicators, RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), show us that the price increase from the initial, aforementioned 50% Fibonacci Retracement Line rejection is welcomed with a rising trend on both momentum indicators; this shows us that the price growth still has upward momentum.\n\nSummary:\n\nAlthough the sudden price drop was a bit terrifying for many investors and traders, it was much needed and has now shown the strong market value of ether. Now that we have proven the strength in the market, it is very likely we will see new price highs in our future before we see further tests of lower prices. On a macro level, ETH-USD sentiment still remains bullish; on a micro level, we are seeing strong indications of a trend reversal from the sudden bear market over the past few days.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Statements and financial information on Bitcoin Magazine and BTCMedia related sites do not necessarily reflect the opinion of BTCMedia and should not be construed as an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell or hold. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\n', 'Bitcoin certainly has lots of potential, but that doesn\'t mean you should risk your future to buy it.\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin has performed extremely well in 2017, up more than 200% year-to-date as I write this. Even more significantly, the digital currency is becoming more widely accepted around the world. So, it may seem like a good idea to buy some bitcoin while it\'s still in the early stages as part of your retirement investing strategy.\n\nIs bitcoin in a bubble, or is it just getting started?\n\nJust before I wrote this article, bitcoin traded above $3,000 for the first time, with this latest leg up mainly fueled by high demand from Asian investors.\n\nThere are some who say that bitcoin could now be in a bubble. For example, billionaire Mark Cuban recently said that the digital currency is in a bubble and that it\'s headed for a correction. ""When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making (money) = bubble,"" Cuban said on Twitter. ""Everyone always thinks that this time is different...""\n\nHowever, Cuban also emphasized that he\'s not saying bitcoin is worthless. The underlying blockchain technology, Cuban says, is very valuable and will be in widespread use in the future. ""I\'m not questioning value. I\'m questioning valuation,"" said Cuban.\n\nOn the other hand, there\'s also a good case to be made that bitcoin could potentially go much higher. As I wrote in a recent article, it\'s possible for bitcoin to rise to $1 million under the right circumstances -- specifically, if the currency gets widespread mainstream acceptance and becomes a major player in the global currency market. To be clear, I don\'t think it\'s particularly likely to get anywhere near that amount, but it\'s certainly possible.\n\nDon\'t be blinded by bitcoin\'s potential\n\nHere\'s the main point of this discussion. Just because something has the potential for massive growth doesn\'t make it a good investment, especially for retirement.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement investing, slow and steady is the way to go. You want stocks and bonds that aren\'t going to make you rich overnight, but are likely to grow at a steady pace and compound into a nice nest egg over time. An investment that could potentially make you a millionaire quickly, and is as volatile as bitcoin is should be avoided with retirement savings. It\'s important not to confuse investing with speculating or gambling. Think of bitcoin as a $3,000 lottery ticket that could potentially win you a lot more money.\n\nNow, lottery tickets can be fun, and I confess to buying Powerball tickets myself when the jackpot gets big. However, I\'m not going to pursue lottery winnings at the risk of my own financial comfort in retirement. While the odds of success are certainly higher with bitcoin than with Powerball, the same concept still applies. Sure, it could go to $1 million -- or it could drop back down to one-tenth of its current value, or less. Either scenario is possible, and it\'s just too much of a gamble to take with money you\'ll need in the future.\n\nThe right way to invest in bitcoin\n\nThe short answer to ""Is bitcoin a good investment for retirement?"" is a resounding no.\n\nHaving said that, however, there\'s nothing wrong with doing a bit of speculating in assets like bitcoin if and only if you\'re already doing a good job of saving and investing for retirement. In other words, if you\'re actively contributing to an IRA or are setting aside 10% or more of your salary in your employer\'s retirement plan, have a properly allocated retirement portfolio, and want to put a small amount of money into bitcoin in addition to this, there\'s nothing wrong with this approach.\n\nI view this as a similar situation to investing some of your capital in risky stocks, but only as a compliment to a rock-solid ""base."" As a personal example, I own shares of Fitbit, which I consider to be highly speculative, but my largest stock positions are in well-established companies that won\'t make me rich quickly, but also have little risk of making me broke.\n\nIf you buy bitcoin with the idea that it\'s a speculative investment in mind, you\'re setting yourself up to take advantage if the price keeps going up, without putting your own retirement at risk if you\'re wrong.\n\nMatthew Frankel owns shares of Fitbit and Twitter.

Failure to report funds, even if unintentional, can lead to the seizure of the money and criminal or civil penalties.\n\nThe Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act would expand “monetary instruments” covered under current law to include “prepaid access devices, stored value cards, digital currencies, and other similar instruments.” This is particularly problematic because digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, are theoretically always transported by the owner of the digital currency account wherever he or she goes, which means digital currency owners with accounts valued at $10,000 or more must always report their funds or risk having them seized.\n\nEven more troubling is the law treats all blank checks as though they are financial instruments valued in excess of $10,000 if the checking account contains at least $10,000, which means if a traveler accidently fails to report a blank check floating around in his or her luggage, the account holder could face stiff penalties — even if there is no suspicion of criminal activity.\n\nIf a traveler is believed to have deliberately concealed a blank check, even if no other criminal activities are alleged, it appears under the provisions of the proposed law he or she could face up to 10 years in prison.\n\n[graphiq id=”6sGR9f0wF6J” title=”Asset forfeiture” width=”500? height=”357? url=”https://sw.graphiq.com/w/6sGR9f0wF6J” frozen=”true”]\n\nA number of complex legal problems could also arise under the law’s provisions that could lead to innocent Americans losing their property. Under current federal law, through a process called civil asset forfeiture, citizens’ property can be seized if it is believed to have been involved in criminal activity, even if the owner of the property did nothing wrong.\n\nIn federal civil asset forfeiture cases, the burden of proof is only “preponderance of the evidence,” which means a prosecutor only needs to show it is more likely than not that property was involved in a crime for it to be seized.\n\nFor instance, if a person driving his or her parent’s vehicle has marijuana in the trunk, it’s possible the car could be seized regardless of whether the owner of the car had any idea it was being used for illegal activity.\n\nBecause the definition of “monetary instrument” would be greatly enhanced under the proposed law, it’s not inconceivable a person transporting a book of blank checks into the United States who deliberately chooses not to report the checks to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency could have the car the checks were found in seized, even if the car belongs to someone else who had no idea what had happened.\n\nDespite these potential problems, Grassley said the law is necessary to fight terrorism and other organized criminal activities.\n\n“Terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and other criminals are actively looking to exploit and harm Americans, whether by attacking our way of life, flooding our country with highly addictive drugs, or defrauding unknowing victims,” Grassley said in a news release. “The recent terrorist attack in the United Kingdom is the latest somber example of how real these threats are to our country and its allies. We must continue to fight them on every front, and that includes going after the profits of crime that are also used to fuel the ongoing activity of these diabolical enterprises. Our bill updates our money laundering laws for the 21st century.”', 'After a pretty rough overnight session in the bitcoin price, it looks as though we are finally getting some reprieve on the correction that has dominated this week’s action. This isn’t to say we have seen the last of it, there is every chance that it might continue and that this could just be a small bounce, but for now, at least, it looks as though the worst of it is over.\n\nThis means that we can switch our risk off sentiment to something a little bit more risk on, widen out our stop losses and go after a little more aggression to the upside if we see a breakout trade materialize. Those who have been with us all week will know we have been looking primarily to the downside for our breakout entries. We have got in and out of the markets on a couple of upside positions, but we have been forced to limit our targets based on the overarching beverage momentum.\n\nGoing forward, we can be a little bit more neutral, as long as price continues to act as it did overnight last night.\n\nIf things turn around again, we will have to reevaluate our bias.\n\nSo, let’s get to the details. As ever, take a quick look at the chart below before we get started. It is a one-minute candlestick chart, and it has our key range overlaid in blue.\n\nAs the chart shows, we are trading at the very top of price action today, with a range defined by support to the downside at 2485 and resistance to the upside at 2503. Standard breakout rules apply, so a close above resistance will put us in long towards 2520. Conversely, a close below support will have us in a short trade towards 2465. Stop losses on both positions will ensure we are taken out of the trades in the event of a bias reversal.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Here I want to outline the technical building blocks with which this idea can be implemented.\n\n\n\nSince I see a lot of downsides to having one large uber-blockchain connecting all others, I will focus on a token-LESS solution. This would have several advantages:\n\nNo need for an additional token.\n\nUsers can “remain” on their blockchain.\n\nNo need to trust a centralized third party.\n\nThere are a couple of downsides to such an approach however. Since there is no uber-blockchain or a centralized party ensuring the connection, there needs to be enough liquidity between two blockchains to be connected. If I want to transfer funds from the Ethereum to the Bitcoin blockchain, for example, I need someone who, at the same time, wants to go from bitcoin to ether. For these two large blockchains, you will always find someone willing to go in either direction, but what about from Ethereum to a smaller blockchain or a small blockchain to another small blockchain? While I will be laying out a way on how that could even be solved, I want to stress that liquidity is the key economic factor in such a cryptographically secure multi-asset network.\n\nBasic Building Blocks\n\nLet’s look at the three very basic building blocks that are needed to connect any two blockchains:\n\nMultisignature feature (Multisig); Hashing functionality; and Time-lock functionality\n\nLet’s work through each of these three and combine them into a larger single picture.\n\n1. Multisig is an old and well-trusted concept that can be compared to a shared checkbook with multiple required signatories. A multisig transaction allows for the enforcement of arbitrary joint signature rules. In the case of a cryptographically secure, off-chain, multi-asset, instant transaction network (COMIT) one would use 2-of-2 multisig transactions for which both signers have to sign a transaction to become valid and be accepted by the network (an example of this will follow right after). This means a multisig transaction established between two parties needs to be signed by both so that its outcome becomes valid and can be accepted by the network.\n\nIn the picture below, a transaction was created with 1 BTC as input; however, in order to get it out, both parties (Alice and Bob) have to sign the transaction:\n\n2. Hash functions are standard cryptographic concepts. These are one-way functions to convert arbitrary data (in our case a secret “s”) into a unique hash “h.” This hash h can then be shared safely without anyone being able to compute the secret s used to create it. This allows us to build a hash-lock transaction which will only unlock the funds with the knowledge of the secret s. In order to route across different blockchains, we need the same cryptographic hash function available in the smart contracting language of each blockchain participating on such a route.\n\nIn the picture below, someone put 1 BTC into a contract, but Alice can only take it out once she has the secret (which she normally would get from Bob).\n\n3. Time-lock is a simple requirement for funds to be locked up until a future date. Blockchains are found to have two different time-locks: relative and absolute. Absolute time-locks will lock a transaction output until a fixed point in time in the future, whereas relative time-locks will lock a transaction output relative to an event or a point in time. That is to say, a relative time-lock rather defines a time span than a specific point in time. Time-locks are a requirement for trustless payment channels, and relative time-locks are recommended as they allow for indefinitely open payment channels.\n\nIn the example below, someone put 1 BTC in, but in order for Alice to get it out, she has to wait a predefined time.\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting It Together\n\nIf we go ahead and combine these three building blocks, we get something called HTLCs (Hashed Time-Lock Contracts) whose states can be updated on a multisig basis. HTLCs combine the concept of a time-lock for refund purposes with a hash-lock. If the recipient can provide the secret s for the hash-lock before the expiry of the time-lock, he will be able to retrieve the funds. Otherwise, the sender can safely reclaim the funds. In case one party wants to update the HTLCs state, he needs the other party’s approval (signature). This is how the multisig function comes into play.\n\nIn the example below, Alice put 1 BTC into the contract with Bob. Bob can either take the 1 BTC out if he gets the hash from Alice within a predefined time, or Alice will get the funds back automatically after that predefined time has past.\n\nTwo HTLCs can be coupled with each other resulting in something called atomic transactions. To do so, the recipient first generates a secret s and computes its hash h. Subsequently, the recipient will share this hash h with a sender who in turn creates the first conditional transaction, i.e., its output is (hash-)locked by h. This output can only be redeemed with the knowledge of the secret s.\n\nIn layman’s terms, this would mean that if Bob wants to send Alice 1 BTC and wants ETH in return, they could open two payment channels (one with BTC and the other with ETH) and couple them with a hash h. Bob sends Alice BTC as long as she sends him ETH. In case either one backs out, the original amounts would just be returned.\n\nThe Full Route\n\nNow we can stack an arbitrary amount of transactions onto each other as every node in this chain can safely use the same hash to create a transaction which is also conditional on knowing the secret s. This hash is initially shared with the sender, who will then subsequently send a conditional payment to the first node requiring knowledge of the secret s to redeem it. Each node in the route can then safely forward the transaction while adding the same condition to the transaction redemption. Through the use of HTLCs we can guarantee that either all of the transactions via this route get fulfilled or all payment channel transactions will be unredeemable. No trust has to be put in any of the nodes in the middle of the route. In the end, you have a chain of transactions which all depend on the same secret to be fulfilled. When the receiver takes the last transaction and uses the secret to redeem the money, every other node will see the secret that was used and can then fulfill their own incoming transaction.\n\nAfter the secret s has been shared across the route, every payment channel will then settle the transaction back into the channel. This is done by updating the payment channel’s state to the final balances and then invalidating the HTLC transactions by revealing the invalidation key k to the payment channel counterparty, which will eventually make the transaction complete.\n\nThe time-lock mechanism is used as a refund mechanism in case of an intermittent routing failure. The time-locks need to be stacked from receiver to sender to make sure no one is able to cheat by having a shorter period than someone after him/her and thereby being able to pull out first.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese transactions can span within the same blockchain, but can also go cross-chain as long as you find someone who is willing to transact on both blockchains. This is where the concept of liquidity and routing comes in. To go back to the beginning where we thought about connecting two low-liquidity blockchains we see now, that we actually don’t necessarily transact between those two directly. By using stacked payment channels one after the other, money could flow from one low liquidity chain to a high liquidity chain and then to the final low liquidity chain.\n\nThis concept connects payment channels to a large network that is now:\n\nCryptographically-secure (relies on cryptographic standards),\n\nOff-chain (like the Lightning- or Raiden-Network) ,\n\nMulti-Asset (cross-chain),\n\nInstant (no need for a transaction to settle on the blockchain as updates only happen between the parties until it gets broadcasted)\n\nA Transaction Network, such as COMIT.\n\nIn the next blog post, I will talk about the concept of liquidity and Liquidity Providers (LP) and also on how routing through such a network could work.\n\nThis is a guest post by Dr. Julian Hosp, the co-founder of TenX and co-author of the whitepapers of TenX and COMIT.

06/17/2017,"['Tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban has recently stated that Bitcoin is facing a bubble. However, Daniel M. Harrison, the CEO of DMH&CO and managing partner of Monkey Capital, reveals that such a thing is impossible due to the market-influencing capabilities of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nMarket bipolarity\n\nThe main factor that makes a digital bubble impossible is market bipolarity. For many people, market bipolarity is confusing but it can be distilled in a few important and understandable viewpoints. Apparently, market bipolarity is directly affected by George Soros’ “theory of reflexivity.”\n\nAccording to George Soros, market conditions are not influenced by equilibrium. Rather, they are “reflexive” due to the synchronization of two functions: cognitive and manipulative function. The cognitive function is a neutral thinking base - this is where economic participants assess facts for what they are.\n\nThe manipulative function, on the other hand, turns one fact (or a couple of facts) in order to gain an advantage. Once the cognitive mind is affected by the manipulative mind, the neutrality will be “painted” in a different light it becomes a manipulated fact.\n\nTherefore, markets reflect the view and perspective of participants, not the full scope of economics.\n\nThe situation can be represented in two ways:\n\nManipulative Cognitive = Reflexive\n\nManipulative + Cognitive = Equilibrium\n\nThe aforementioned equations show that a manipulative thinking pattern is the usual baseline and not a cognitive function. This shows the reflexive nature of all markets one of the clear indicators that Bitcoin and Ethereum are far from experiencing a digital bubble.\n\nArtificial vs. Natural\n\nMore importantly, Ethereum and Bitcoin markets are influenced by two thinkers: artificial and natural. Artificial pertains to the Blockchain AI and natural is all about human intervention. Many experts think that Blockchain is adopting an ""economic mindset.""\n\nIf markets with manipulative and cognitive participants are suddenly annexed, it will always result in reflexivity or positive feedback loops. In this case, digital markets are bound by reflexivity or states of reflexivity. This is a self-perpetuating situation that can go on for many years.\n\nIt’s also important to know that artificial thinkers are the “igniters” of self-perpetuating reflexivity. With AI (Blockchain), digital markets will continue to thrive, leading to fluctuating values of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market bipolarity will always be constant.\n\nThrough market bipolarity, any episode of a digital bubble is canceled out. The whole Blockchain system will never return to its “roots” but it will continue evolving. Price valuations, on the other hand, may remain grounded and directed by economic factors.\n\nInnovation or its application in various sectors is also another important factor that shapes Blockchain technology’s tenacity and ability to survive a “bubble.”', 'Vinny Lingham, CEO of Civic Keys, thinks August 1, the proposed date for the Bitcoin scaling, is not an independence day for the trailblazer of cryptocurrencies – but in fact a judgement day. In a Twitter post on early Thursday morning, the crypto investor and analysis pundit wrote that: “Bitcoin may need to “die” just one more time so that it can live forever. August 1 is NOT Independence Day, it’s Judgement Day”\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nWhen Hacked.com asked Vinny why he took that position, he explained the situation is blurry.\n\n“.. it’s not clear which split or fork will win,”\n\nVinny told Hacked.com.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nHe also believes the upcoming event accounts for the ongoing Bitcoin price adjustment. Since Wednesday evening, prices have been falling.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Bitmain, the Chinese mining company, has published a contingency plan calling for User Activated Hard Fork (UAHF) in the likelihood of UASF being implemented on August 1.\n\nResponses From His Followers\n\nBut some people who replied to Vinny’s post expressed reservations. Rob Furse urged Vinny not to be afraid of the hard fork since massive hash rates are still ready to be deployed on a UASF chain. “No other crypto comes close in their POW,” Rob replied.\n\n“One side will win after August 1. There will be a carnage but Bitcoin will survive,” wrote John Pitchers.\n\nOthers were of the opinion that with a hard fork or not, Bitmain is going to lose the acrimonious scaling dispute and that people should keep trading.\n\n“Either outcome is good. Segwit passes – sweet, or eventually, there is a hard fork and Ver and Wu sell coffee for BUtcoin,” another follower commented.\n\nMatthew Achak also believes that if you believe in Bitcoin, you think in decades, not in days.\n\nJimmy Song’s Response To Bitmain\n\nMeanwhile, Jimmy Song has published a piece on Medium explaining what Bitmain’s contingency plan for a hard fork after Segwit means. The Dev and entrepreneur maintains the main thing everyone needs to know is that Bitmain wants to add a wipeout and replay protection.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n“Note that the hard fork starts roughly half a day after the UASF. Most likely, this is to see exactly how much of a threat the UASF soft fork is. If the hash rate of UASF is below 1% of the network, it’s likely that a single block won’t be found on the UASF in those 12 hours and gives Bitmain time to not mind with a hard fork.”', 'Bitcoin price corrected lower from $2970 against the US Dollar, and now BTC/USD is back above $2400 and looking for a move towards $3000.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price after a strong correction found support at $2040 against the US Dollar, and started a recovery.\n\nThere is a monster ascending channel forming with support at $2260 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nThe price may soon gain momentum and break $2700 for a move towards the last swing high at $2970.\n\nBitcoin price corrected lower from $2970 against the US Dollar, and now BTC/USD is back above $2400 and looking for a move towards $3000.\n\nBitcoin Price Resistances\n\nIn the last weekly analysis, I highlighted the chances of Bitcoin price moving towards $3000 against the US Dollar. The price did break $2880 and moved towards $3000. However, there was no complete test of $3000, as the price traded as high as $2970. Sellers appeared and ignited a downside move below $2900. A correction wave started and the price fell sharply below the $2500 and $2300 supports.\n\nHowever, there was no close below the $2000 support, which is a positive sign. The price traded as low as $2043, and later started an upside move. It has already breached the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $2972 high to $2043 low. Furthermore, there was a break above a bearish trend line at $2500 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. It is a positive sign since the price is above $2500.\n\nNow, the price needs to break the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $2972 high to $2043 low at $2620. Furthermore, a break and close above the 100 simple moving average at $2600-20 could ignite further gains. There is also a monster ascending channel forming with support at $2260. As long as the price is an uptrend, it may test the channel resistance at $3050-80.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is moving back in the bullish zone.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently above 50, and heading higher.\n\nMajor Support Level – $2500\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $2970\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The two cryptocurrencies have had returns over the past year that make a big-time hedge fund manager look like he’s running a lemonade stand in front of his parents house.\n\nSince last year, Bitcoin is up (at the time of this writing) 390.55 percent and Ethereum’s currency, Ether, is up a mind-blowing 1,896.13 percent.\n\nNew money is pouring into the cryptocurrency space, with one investment fund announcing a raise of $400 million dollars. Though talk of the inevitable Tulip mania and Internet 1.0 bubble burst abounds (and has for years), it does not feel a burst is likely anytime soon. (Note: not investment advice.) And that is actually kind of a problem.\n\nIf you go back to the Bitcoin whitepaper (everyone should read it, it’s fairly consumable), the title is very clear about its intent: “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”\n\nBitcoin, Ether and a host of other currencies are faced with hourly and daily price volatility (in relation to the US dollar). It is not uncommon to see drops of $50-$100 in Bitcoin and $30-$50 in Ether in a day, even if the overall trend line is up. On multiple occasions, we have seen drops of 10 and 20 percent in one day.\n\nWhat this means in practice (and I know from firsthand experience) is that the earrings I bought for my wife with Bitcoin that cost $13 at the time of purchase were worth $16 a few hours later and today are the equivalent of $28. My wife is worth it, of course, but such volatility can wreak havoc on people. Even more so on companies, which desire stability for financial planning purposes.\n\nThe Bitcoin believer’s mantra of “HODL” or “Hold On For Dear Life” is precisely the opposite of what you want in a system designed to encourage people to treat digital currency like cash.\n\nThe need for crypto-stability\n\nTrue believers in blockchain and decentralization recognize that these new technologies and monetary systems will never achieve mass mainstream adoption with these kinds of violent swings.\n\nEthereum’s creator, Vitalik Buterin, identified this challenge back in November, 2014 in his post “The Search for a Stable Cryptocurrency.” It’s a very long and complex read (as are many of his writings), but he ends it with a fairly prescient prediction:\n\n“There would then be multiple separate classes of cryptoassets: stable assets for trading, speculative assets for investment, and Bitcoin itself may well serve as a unique Schelling point for a universal fallback asset, similar to the current and historical functioning of gold.”\n\nThe groundwork for this environment is being laid right now, as the number of new crypto-tokens continues to grow into the thousands. The second part, however, the “universal fallback asset” has not materialized fully. The SchellingCoin is the search for the stability.\n\nMany of the advanced financial instruments that Wall Street uses and that are familiar to many of us through the 2008 housing crisis and the book/movie The Big Short have achieved some degree of notoriety. Still, we don’t want to throw the baby out with the proverbial bathwater.\n\nVitalik further wrote that “One of the main applications of Ethereum that people have been interested in is financial contracts and derivatives … [and] the underlying concept in fact has a number of legitimate uses, some of which actually help people protect themselves against the volatility of financial markets.”\n\nA new crop of startups is emerging to do just that with “smart contracts.”\n\nSmart contracts: The foundation of stability\n\nIn simplified terms, the smart contract takes the “if/then” statements that form the basis of legal and business rules and puts them into computer code. Then, with the security of the blockchain behind it, the contract is executed automatically without any human interference or risk of tampering.\n\nEthereum was built to support smart contracts in a way that Bitcoin was not (though a recent release by Rootstock is seeking to make it easier to run smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain). This fact explains why almost every new crypto-token being issued today happens in the ERC20 format, which is designed specifically for the Ethereum blockchain. It may also be a core driver of the huge Ethereum price run-up.\n\nBy relying on smart contracts, in theory, we have the ability to remove centralized systems (like banks), which introduce risk and lack transparency, and lower fees significantly. Venture capitalist and thought leader Vinay Gupta highlights that smart contracts can reduce “the 7 percent margins taken by all manner of middlemen to a more realistic 0.07 percent margin.”\n\nIf you can reduce the cost of executing contracts by 99 percent AND do it with increased confidence that the assets are not going to be highly volatile, that would be fairly appealing to an extremely large number of people.\n\nThe goal of each of these smart-contract-driven projects is to bring some degree of financial stability to the crypto-asset market.\n\nMaker, MKR, and SAI: Stability through programmatic collateral\n\nThe first effort I’ve come across of a crypto-native solution to volatility came from an organization called MakerDAO. In its original white paper, it introduced a very complex concept known as a DAI, that would derive its value (and stability) from a simple centralized collateral custodian model.\n\nHowever, in a sign of how quickly things change in this industry, MakerDAO has already abandoned that pursuit because, in the company’s own words, “an individual custodian takes on some level of risk, and no one enthusiastically stepped up to take this risk on.”\n\n[Correction 6/20/2017: According to a Maker spokesperson, “We have not abandoned Dai but rather decided to release an alpha version — Sai — in order to gather crucial data before releasing Dai into the wild.]\n\nBut don’t confuse the company’s change in focus as a lack of intellectual rigor. On the contrary, there is some heavy thinking in its latest effort, known as a SAI (or Simple DAI). A SAI is designed to be the stable coin that people need to make long-term investments. It is backed by collateral (at this time, only Ether, aka ETH) through a mechanism known as a collaterized debt position (CDP). The total number of SAI available is limited by a debt ceiling, and SAIs are created and destroyed (through the power of smart contracts) as people open and close their positions.\n\nA SAI does its accounting in US dollars, a peg of 1:1, that is based on an “oracle” that automatically pulls its information from trusted resources. (How you know those sources are trusted is a different topic that I’ll leave aside for now). There is no guarantee that the peg will stay at this level. However, the designers believe that the fact a SAI is basically “backed” by ETH means an efficient market will form around this price point.\n\nThe ETH itself is not the direct collateral in this system. Instead, all of the ETH are kept in a global pool for liquidity that creates the system’s collateral token, called SKR (Simple MKR). You need SKR to open a CDP.\n\nYou get SKR (which ultimately represent a proportional claim on all of the Ether in the system) by depositing Ether into the central pool. The SKR tokens you get in return are created at a rate that maintains the ETH:SKR ratio. Here’s a short example from the company’s whitepaper.\n\nThere are 345 ETH in the system\n\nThere are 678 outstanding SKR\n\nThe ETH:SKR price is 345/678 = 0.5088\n\nBob deposits 100 ETH\n\nBob receives 100 / 0.5088 = 196.54 SKR\n\nNow there are 445 ETH in the system\n\nThere are 874.54 SKR\n\nThe ETH:SKR price is 445/874.54 = 0.5088\n\nIn other words, you\n\nput Ether into the global liquidity pool You get SKRs You use the SKR to create a collateralized debt position (CDP) You get SAI tokens\n\nThe “magic,” if you will, is in how the underlying smart contracts enforce the relationship between total Ether, total SKR, the components of the collateralized debt position, and the SAI token to try and keep everything in balance.\n\nConfused? Don’t feel bad. It’s confusing. Even more so, as Andy Milenius (the white paper’s author) writes, “the value of ETH could fall so far that there isn’t enough value to back the outstanding SAI, forcing the SAI holders to take a haircut as well.”\n\nWhat’s important here isn’t necessarily how this whole system works, what’s important is that this is one of the first serious efforts to address volatility in the crypto-market.\n\nDCorp and DRP: Stability through decentralized derivatives exchange\n\nUnderstanding what DCorp is trying to do may take a bit less effort, but it’s an equally bold vision. [Disclosure: DCorp is a client of mine.]\n\nLet’s put the DCorp opportunity in context first. Last year, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade (described by The Economist as “The biggest financial exchange you have never heard of”) created 3 billion contracts, all done via centralized systems, and pulled in revenues of $3.5 billion and profits of $1.5 billion. DCorp’s goal is to create a more transparent, more secure, and more open exchange, all while distributing the profit to its “shareholders,” i.e. those who own a DRP token.\n\nHow, specifically, will DCorp bring less volatility to derivatives and crypto-assets in particular? In a few ways. Its smart contracts will allow people to:\n\nApply risk management strategies in order to limit potential losses to an asset’s option price or the spread between the bid and ask with multi-asset derivatives. Reduce volatility by locking assets into derivatives contracts, making them unavailable for panic sell. Enable futures with ascending stakes. For example, participants who use leverage to buy futures while speculating the decline of an asset’s value will need to keep contracts valid by buying the asset over time while the price is declining. In doing so, the participant reduces volatility by buying while others are selling.\n\nFurthermore, in a significant departure from how the CME operates (or any other exchange, for that matter), the governance of the decentralized exchange is open and transparent as well.\n\nAs a DRP token holder, an individual not only gets a share of the profits that accrue from the trades that occur on the network, they have the opportunity to vote on how the business itself evolves.\n\nAnyone can submit a governance or funding proposal, but these proposals require shareholder approval to be implemented. In order to eliminate spam, submitting a proposal will require a payment in Ether.\n\nIt’s a message that seems to have some resonance. DCorp has so far pulled in over $2.2 million in its crowdsale.\n\nDCorp may or may not be the ultimate winner in this market, but someone is going to figure out how to decentralize and reduce volatility in this massive industry. The token holders of that protocol are going to be pretty happy.\n\nBancor and BNT: Stability through liquidity\n\nThough the number of cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, the Bancor team believes there are not enough of them yet. They foresee a future where anyone or any organization can create their own digital currency. And they just pulled in almost $150 million in the first day of their crowdsale, June 13, breaking all previous token crowdsale records.\n\nLet’s take an offline example and bring it back to the online world.\n\nSay you belong to a church, synagogue, or mosque, and the organization offers coupons or gift certificates for doing business with other members of the group or, perhaps, local merchants.\n\nThe goal of this type of initiative is to build a reinforcing circular economy that enriches and empowers its members. In theory it’s great, but in practice it’s tough to get off the ground. The reason is liquidity. You end up with a lot of coupons and certificates, but you cannot redeem them for all of the things you need, so at a certain point, the economy hits a limit.\n\nIt’s great to support the cause, but you won’t keep doing it at the expense of feeding your family.\n\nNow, let’s look at the same example viewed through the lens of Bancor. The same church, synagogue, or mosque decides to create a “OneGodToken” (OGT for short).\n\nIf you agree to accept one of the OGTs, you need to be confident you can actually use it for something you need.\n\nWhat Bancor, which issues the Bancor Network Token (BNT), provides is a smart contract that allows the creator of the OGT to establish a constant OGT-BNT rate that is backed by a pool of Ethereum as well. This functionality is delivered via a “token share” mechanism.\n\nHow it all works is the subject of a multi-page white paper and is based on the established Constant Reserve Rate (‘CRR’), but what it means is you can happily take OGTs from your fellow congregants for your services with the full confidence that, at any time, you can trade out the OGTs for BNT. Having that BNT is the liquidity security you need, because the BNT, which backs a large number of other crypto-economies, can then be transferred to another asset or back into ETH, if you so desire. They call this entire capability a “token changer.”\n\nA visit to any of the crypto-exchanges out there like Bittrex highlights the need for something like BNT. There are a ton of tokens that have been issued. However, since a traditional exchange requires a “coincidence of wants” (two people who want opposite things — buy/sell — at the same time) or a centralized market maker to keep liquidity, many of them are just sitting there, with the owners of the assets unable to sell and buyers not always able to buy.\n\nThe Bancor Protocol essentially does away with this by making a smart contract the automated market-maker of this “long tail” of crypto-tokens. By building a guarantee of liquidity into the token creation itself, Bancor’s belief is that BNT enables an explosion of financial innovation from tokens with huge network effects all the way down to the individual level.\n\nLike the rest of the examples here, this is a really new concept, but when you think about it (and read the company’s material a few times), you see that it’s actually very powerful.\n\nHaving BNT as the de facto exchange token for all of these micro-economies (what they call “Token Networks”) creates a network effect, the potential upside for BNT token holders.\n\nConclusion: It’s the beginning either way\n\nIn 20 years time, we may look back at each of these examples and laugh at them for their simplicity. They could be the Boo.com of this era. Or they could have real staying power. No one knows.\n\nWhat we do know is that in order for the decentralized, crypto-based economy to take off, we will need a next wave of financial tools and technologies. They will build on the initial, simplified use cases of “digital cash” to help create greater stability and less volatility. When that happens, we will see even more people and organizations have the confidence to move their activities to cryptocurrencies.\n\n[Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The country famously sought to end corruption (a la India in November 2016) by removing the 100 Bolivar note from circulation.\n\nThe widespread panic that the already nearly valueless currency would now be worthless led to massive lines and protest from citizens seeking the protection of assets.\n\nAt that time, many Venezuelans began seeking refuge from the economic turmoil by investing in cryptocurrencies. The market responded and Venezuela’s first Bitcoin exchange was opened.\n\nHowever, according to a recent report by Bloomberg this week, the demand for cryptocurrencies in Venezuela has continued to soar. This week’s trading volume on Bitcoin soared again to over $1.3 mln, nearly doubling the levels from two months ago.\n\nThe volatility of cryptocurrencies is minimal, compared to the massive devaluation of the country’s local currency (6000 Bolivars to $1).\n\nBut cryptocurrencies are not only being used for safe haven investments. Consumers are also using Bitcoin and others as a means of settling accounts and continuing business in the uncertain and volatile economy.\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies are decentralized, they are seen as a simple and safe solution to the need for stable currency in countries where government practices have destroyed currency values.', ""Close Get email notifications on David Erickson daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\nWhenever David Erickson posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items."", 'White hat hackers, it seems, are being stripped of their accounts on Coinbase.\n\nLess than a year ago, Vinny Troia, CEO and principal security consultant of Night Lion Security and a certified white hat hacker, was sent a compliance form by US bitcoin exchange Coinbase, where he had an account.\n\nCoinbase wanted to know how Troia was using bitcoin and his account.\n\n""I told them I run a security firm. I pay for ransoms and buy documents on the dark web when clients request it,"" Troia told CoinDesk.\n\nThe ransoms Troia helps his clients pay are those stemming from ransomware attacks, which have surged in number over the past few years. Many, like the well-publicized WannaCry attack, are asking for bitcoin. And the documents?\n\nTroia said:\n\n""We do breach investigations a lot of times. If a fraudster is saying they\'re selling my client\'s stolen documents, the only way to make sure they have what they say they have is to buy those documents.""\n\nAccording to Troia, Coinbase ""did not like that at all"".\n\nCoinbase then asked the IT expert whether he had a letter from the Department of Justice giving him permission to do those things. No, Troia said. Upon further research, Troia has not found that any such permission exists.\n\nBut, ""I have my clients authorizing me to do this,"" he said.\n\nCoinbase sent Troia back an email explaining that those actions were against the exchange\'s rules and shut down his account. Troia then tried setting up an account with his wife\'s information, but that too was shut down. Then he tried his brother. Shut down. Then his mother. Shut down.\n\n""My entire family is blocked from Coinbase,"" he said.\n\nThe only option?\n\nThe problem is ransomware attacks are on the rise, and the prevalence of those attackers requesting bitcoin over bags of cash (or even wired fiat funds) is also up.\n\nBlack hat hackers love bitcoin, primarily because its wallets don\'t have to be registered with a central intermediary, and with the use of anonymizing mixers and tumblers, the movement of that money can be hard to track.\n\nLast month, several publications reported companies stockpiling bitcoin in preparation for future ransomware attacks. According to Citrix Systems, in 2016, about one-third of British companies were hoarding a store of ""digital monies"" to recover critical data in the event of an attack.\n\nSometimes, it\'s the only option.\n\nTroia, who is based in St Louis, worked with a vendor last year who was hit with a ransomware attack performing full disk encryption. In this case, full disk encryption meant the hackers had encrypted all the data held on the company’s hard drive storage. And according to Troia, almost no companies, including the one he was called to help at 2:00 am on a Sunday morning, keep full disk backups.\n\nTroia scrambled around looking for ways to purchase bitcoin quickly and get the attackers paid. His solution: purchasing bitcoin through a bitcoin ATM at a mall in St Louis.\n\nWhile the process took nearly 24 hours, without the bitcoin ATM, it would have taken even longer with waiting periods for bitcoin account onboarding and purchasing and withdrawal limits, Troia said. He even tried the Craigslist-like LocalBitcoins service, but since it was Sunday, a bank wire transfer wouldn\'t be initiated till the next week.\n\n""When someone has to pay a ransom, they need to pay it right away, not wait four days or so,"" he said. ""The consequences [of waiting] are more on the business side, reputational risk, with customers trying to get access to the system and not being able to. And there can be significant financial impacts of customers\' inability to access the system.""\n\nRegulatory pressures\n\nIt seems almost antithetical that it\'s becoming harder for the \'good guys\' to use bitcoin, when companies like Coinbase that operate with the digital currency have an uphill battle convincing individuals, businesses and government agencies that cryptocurrency should not be faulted for the bad actors\' use of it.\n\nBut, according to Juan Llanos, a cryptocurrency compliance expert and the fintech and regtech lead at blockchain startup ConsenSys, it\'s all part of the same battle.\n\n""Coinbase is meeting the expectations and standards of any highly regulated and scrutinized financial institution,"" Llanos told CoinDesk. ""They are a systemically important player and are backed by big-name investors. They all are, as they need to be, cognizant of the reputational and regulatory risks of associating themselves with negative news and potentially bad actors.""\n\nHe continued:\n\n""This is a very controversial topic.""\n\nSeems so. The non-profit advocacy group Coin Center, for example, voiced strong opinions last month about a court filing which suggested helping someone exchange fiat for bitcoin to pay a ransomware attack might be unlawful.\n\nThe policy-focused non-profit declined to comment for this story, though Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s director of communications, did say: ""The decisions that Coinbase or any other company make about who can and cannot use their platforms are private matters internal to those companies.""\n\nBrought against Coin.mx, the court filing stated that the exchange violated anti-money laundering law in that it ""knowingly processed and profited from numerous bitcoin transactions conducted on behalf of victims of ransomware schemes"".\n\nJudicial actions such as this obviously make others wary.\n\n""I don\'t blame them,"" said Llanos.\n\nAlthough, while federal law enforcement agencies typically caution US businesses against paying digital ransoms, in October 2015, FBI agent Joseph Bonavolonta told C-level business executives they might be better served succumbing to attackers requests for ransom in return for data.\n\nCoinbase offered little comment on the situation.\n\n""We work with a number of third-party vendors and need to make sure we comply with the types of businesses and activity they are comfortable with us servicing,"" said David Farmer, director of business operations at Coinbase.\n\nFarmer also sent a link to the exchange\'s publicly available terms and conditions and prohibited business activity list. While neither document states anything specifically about white hat hacking or ransomware, the prohibited business activity list does note that it\'s ""representative, but not exhaustive.""\n\nThis gives Coinbase sole discretion to remove an account that increases any risk to its business.\n\nDon\'t say a word\n\nTroia isn\'t the only security consultant doing this kind of work at the behest of legitimate and paying clients.\n\nAlthough, he doesn\'t know exactly why his account was flagged for suspicious activity in the first place. In this light, he wonders whether the accounts he sent ransom payments to might have already been flagged as problematic.\n\n""I could never figure it out,"" he said. ""I had, maybe traded an entire bitcoin, literally one. I didn\'t have a high volume of trading.""\n\nTroia recently tried reaching out to Coinbase executives, including CEO Brian Armstrong, explaining the situation, and that theoretically he could have lied and kept his account, hoping the truth angle could win him some points.\n\nVia email, Armstrong said he would look into it, and forwarded Troia\'s email to the support team.\n\nThe next day, though, Troia got a message back from support, saying upon further inspection, he was still unable to open an account, whether it be business or personal. And that looks unlikely to change.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nEmpty cash drawer image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

CCN reported that billionaire Mark Cuban was calling bitcoin’s recent price surge a bubble. However, this is not the case since the cryptocurrency is showing an uptrend, recently standing on $2,831 and continuously going upwards.\n\nMourdoukoutas shared a partly similar opinion to Cuban’s. Matching in the terms of saying that bitcoin’s price will drop after the huge surge, however, the university professor did not state that the cryptocurrency is a bubble. Mourdoukoutas added that the digital currency made many “overnight millionaires” – people who invested into BTC when it was worth only a fraction of its current price. He added that bitcoin will reach new highs, making more billionaires in the course of the action, before “coming back down to earth”.\n\nAccording to Mourdoukoutas, one reason for the increasing investment into the cryptocurrency is the “ultra-low interest rate environment, which makes the trade of bitcoin an appealing proposition. In addition, there is a growing mistrust in the national currencies of multiple countries, following the government policies that pushed more investors into the cryptocurrency.\n\nMourdoukoutas said that one of these policies is the act when governments issue new treasury bonds at record low rates to cover the old debts with new ones. For example, Japan sells treasuries that yield almost nothing for the state, however, the country’s debts amount approximately the 250 percent of the GDP. The professor stated that China’s treasuries yield “something”, although, no one knows the exact amount of the “unofficial debt”.\n\nThe fact that there is a huge amount of debt connected to the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen, makes the confidence of the investors disappear. And since there is bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that increased its value by 125 percent in 2016, people in Asia take advantage of the possibility and invest more into the digital currency.\n\nThe university professor stated there is another government policy, which could decrease the trust in a country’s national currency. This move is when governments want to get rid of the old currency notes, as was the case in India and Venezuela. According to Mourdoukoutas, one of these actions started the recent bitcoin surge.\n\nMourdoukoutas added in the write-up that there are certain advantages making bitcoin a better hedge than conventional ones, such as gold. He added that the millennial generation is one of the biggest supporters of the cryptocurrency as they understand BTC better than the “baby-boomer generation”.\n\n“Unlike gold, for instance, bitcoin is a convenient medium of payment around the globe,” Mourdoukoutas wrote.\n\nAccording to the professor, bitcoin’s supply is expected to be limited to 21 million. Comparing to gold, there is no scarcity from the mineral since when the price of gold rises, it provides more incentive for gold miners to mine for gold.\n\nFinally, Mourdoukoutas stated that the investor hype around bitcoin continuously helps the cryptocurrency to go upwards, as more and more investors are becoming familiar with the digital currency, and can use ETFs (exchange-traded funds) to “conveniently participate in the market”.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'As previously reported by CCN, Venezuela is a country in which bitcoin has become a necessity for some, as it allows people to buy goods and services they would otherwise be unable to. According to one Redditor, the cryptocurrency is even helping his family survive.\n\nVenezuela’s problems came in early 2014, when hyperinflation struck the country’s economy. Since then, bitcoiners have been having a hard time in the country, as Venezuela’s state-owned internet service provider CANTV blocked several bitcoin-related websites and mining pools in the past. Mining centers have been taken down, and the country’s leading bitcoin exchange, SurBitcoin, even had to temporarily shut down operations after Banesco bank closed its account.\n\nRecently, a new bitcoin exchange dubbed Monkeycoin, with its claim to fame being government permission to operate fully, meaning the exchange cooperates with authorities on issues like KYC (Know-Your-Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering). It’s regulated by Sudeban, the country’s banking regulator.\n\nLocal cryptocurrency publication DiarioBitcoin recently contacted Sudeban, who told said “there was no authorization on their end”. The publication also caught up with the exchange’s representatives for an interview.\n\nDuring the interview Monkeycoin revealed they are the first exchange to obtain a mercantile registry, meaning the company has been registered in compliance with the country’s laws, and doesn’t have to hide anything.\n\nMonkeycoin representatives claim to have realized that the vast majority of Venezuelans had limited options when it came to buying goods and services abroad. After doing some research, they found draglet’s Exchange Software, and built the exchange with it.\n\nThe software allows Monkeycoin to use a Distributed Shared Orderbook (DSO), connecting it to a global network of exchanges that ensure there’s a healthy order book. It’s owned by a team of Venezuelan entrepreneurs who want to help the country’s population survive.\n\nThanks to draglet’s software, the exchange has access to integrated wallets and guarantees 99.9% uptime, software that covers all languages, and security for its users. According to DiarioBitcoin, bitcoin’s price in the exchange is equal to the price on peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins, being one bitcoin worth over 19 million Venezuelan bolívares.\n\nMonkeycoin on Venezuela’s Bitcoin Crackdown\n\nMonkeycoin claims miners have been arrested in Venezuela because they were stealing electricity to mine bitcoin. In some cases, mining equipment was illegally shipped into the country. The representatives stated (translated statement):\n\nWe know cases in which users imported equipment via door-to-door services and this is what makes it illegal, since there is no payment record of customs duties, and under the effects they are obviously committing tax evasion offenses\n\nRegarding SurBitcoin’s bank problems, Monkeycoin stated that they have never been duly registered and, as such, are breaching commercial and tax legislations.\n\nAccording to the company’s representatives, Monkeycoin is registered for the purchase and sale of digital assets, an activity that currently lacks legal framework in Venezuela, which was said to be penalizing the company. It is also currently awaiting statements from several state organizations.\n\nCommunity reactions\n\nOn social media, some bitcoiners remain skeptical of Monkeycoin’s relationship with the government, as some claim Venezuela wants to crack down on digital currencies, not support businesses associated with them. Some even claim that the exchange puts bitcoiners’ privacy at risk and may be a way for the government to reach them\n\nOn the other hand, some believe this is the first step towards the creation of legal framework for bitcoin and other digital currencies in Venezuela, although it is still too soon to draw conclusions, as the exchange is still in its infancy. In a conversation with James Ash, Monkeycoin owner Gabriel Giannitsopoulos revealed that in the first 48 hours the exchange already had over 300 registered users.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
06/18/2017,"['The following guest analysis article is written by Taki Tsaklanos, lead analyst at InvestingHaven.\n\nTalking about fundamental strength in Ethereum, it is interesting to apply traditional relative strength ratios to cryptocurrencies. When analyzing traditional markets we look at the gold to silver ratio to identify which of the two is outperforming or to understand whether a bull market has started or ended. In stock markets the S&P 500 to Russell 2000 ratio is popular as a gauge of risk (the small cap Russell typically outpeformers when investors are in ‘risk on’ mode).\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies the most popular way among analysts is to compare market caps. While that is a good indicator it is not the most valuable one in our view.\n\nWhat really is valuable as an indicator is the price ratio, for instance the Ethereum to the Bitcoin price ratio. The reason why we prefer this ratio above a market cap comparison is that, bottom line, whatever the market cap, all that matters is price. The point is that price reflects supply and demand factors; price is the point where supply and demand find equilibrium.\n\nThe Ethereum to Bitcoin price ratio is shown on the following chart:\n\nThis ratio reveals a very interesting insight. In March of this year, Ethereum’s relative strength moved to an “all-time high” right when it crossed the horizontal red line annotated on the chart. In chart analysis terms we call it a “breakout.” As goes with most breakouts it tends to come back down to test the breakout point before moving higher as of that point. That is called a “confirmation of the breakout” so it suggests that the uptrend will continues.\n\nThe “real deal” took place in May, when the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio crossed the other red line, see green circle. That is when the acceleration of Ethereum’s outperformance started.\n\nWhat all this means is that Ethereum is the clear winner, and that this ratio was able to forecast it in April and in May.\n\nIt also learns that readers can do their own research by looking for other ratios, for instance Ethereum to Ripple or Ethereum to Litecoin to get an idea of the real outperformer. Relative strength tells much more than absolute prices.\n\nGoing forward, as prices continue to fluctuate, we will start seeing new patterns on this chart. That is what investors are closely following, and we suggest readers with positions in Ethereum do the same.\n\nNote that this ratio does not suggest anything about the future price of Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'For digital-marketing agency Cooperatize.com, taking bitcoin for payment was easy enough, all co-founder Roger Wu had to do was obtain a digital wallet. To promote the move in 2014, he even penned a blog post for Forbes explaining the decision.\n\nThe number of transactions the New York-based firm has made since? Zero.\n\n“The biggest thing is are people willing to pay in bitcoin?” Wu said. “The reality is that most of our customers are other businesses and other businesses don’t use bitcoin.""\n\nEven as the euphoria over bitcoin reached a fever pitch last week as the price surged to almost $3,000, slow transaction times and inertia are helping to prevent it from achieving widespread usage. Adoption has slowed, according to Morgan Stanley, after a slew of companies from Microsoft Corp. to Expedia Inc. initially trumpeted its use, and hurdles remain when it comes to longer-term viability.\n\n“We see few reasons for consumers to use bitcoin over a credit/debit card given that paying online with bitcoin represents a marginally more inconvenient way to pay,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a 33-page report released June 13. Processing costs for bitcoin and other digital currencies are likely to grow, they said.\n\nRead more on the companies benefiting from the demand for cryptocurrencies\n\nTime Inc. and Dell Inc. said they’ve stopped accepting the cryptocurrency, with the computer maker citing low usage. When website content management system Wordpress stopped taking bitcoin in 2015, founder Matt Mullenweg said usage was “vanishingly small,” adding that it was initially incorporated for philosophical reasons, not commercial ones.\n\n“It’s quite possible that after a while you just realize it’s not worth the cost of tooling up to take it and you decide to drop it if the publicity has run its course,” said David Yermack, a professor at New York University Stern School of Business who studies bitcoin.\n\nStill, there’s plenty of evidence the price surge has helped boost bitcoin’s use -- albeit from a low base.\n\nPayment processor BitPay said its now handling about $2 million in transactions a day, up almost threefold from April 2016. Coinbase’s volume has doubled since the start of the year. Overstock.com Inc., an online discounter, said it’s been handling around 100,000 bitcoin transactions per week, up from about 30,000 when it first added the payment method in 2014.\n\n“There is what might be called a wealth effect that occurs, so as price increases people actually counter-intuitively are more likely to spend bitcoin,” said Justin O’Brien, product manager at Coinbase in San Francisco, which has partnered with more than 46,000 businesses for bitcoin payment.\n\nYet somewhat paradoxically, there’s the question of whether its status as a red-hot asset is compatible with being a stable method of payment.\n\nThere’s the issue of volatility. This year has seen bitcoin surge and plunge by as much as 19 percent over the course of a day. As transactions rise, processing them is also becoming slower and more expensive because of a cap on the data the bitcoin blockchain can process -- an issue whose resolution has spurred bitter infighting within the development community.\n\n“The blockchain underpinnings of most cryptocurrencies scale too poorly for most currency-like uses,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. “Time to clear single transactions can often be from 10 minutes to more than an hour.”\n\nAnd probably most importantly, bitcoin isn’t recognized as legal tender. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has ruled that bitcoins are property, while regulators treat it as a commodity.\n\nMost big businesses take bitcoin through payment processors such as BitPay and Coinbase. When a consumer makes a purchase via those platforms, he or she will pay at a conversion rate based on the latest bitcoin price. The processors then convert the bitcoin immediately and pass the fiat currency to the seller, essentially removing all exposure to bitcoin’s volatility.\n\nRead more on how bitcoin is perplexing analysts\n\nFor merchants, Coinbase charges nothing for the first $1 million and 1 percent of transaction values afterward. That compares with Visa Inc.’s roughly 2 percent interchange rate and almost 3 percent charged by PayPal Holdings Inc.\n\nThe process is more complicated for shoppers. Unless your digital wallet is already on the platform that’s processing the payment, transferring bitcoins incurs a transaction fee, which can vary depending on its size, how quickly you want it processed and network conditions. The median transaction fee was $2.10 on June 15, compared with an all-time high of nearly $3 reached earlier this month, according to BitInfoCharts.\n\nSonny Singh, BitPay’s chief commercial officer, said bitcoin is more useful in emerging economies where trust in local currencies is weaker and credit cards are less common.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is making more headway in markets like Japan, which started recognizing digital currencies as a form of payment this year, and in Venezuela, where the bolivar is almost worthless. It’s also useful for businesses that can’t rely on traditional banking, such as cannabis sellers.\n\nWhile greater usage remains in question, there are often some unexpected benefits for merchants who’ve embraced bitcoin.\n\nSince the Roast of Sherwood added a Coinbase wallet six weeks ago, it has averaged five bitcoin or ether transactions each week, according to Lee Galloway, who runs the sandwich stall with his father in a bustling street market along London’s Whitecross Street.\n\n“For a few small payments we’ve taken, it’s a large amount of publicity,” the 32-year-old said. “If we’re taking large amounts of cryptocurrency payments, I’ll probably have to re-address and re-look at the entire issue, but I can’t imagine that happening any time soon.”\n\n— With assistance by Yuji Nakamura', ""Courtney Goldsmith\n\nBitcoin has rocked headlines this year as its price jumped more than 100 per cent to reach all-time highs of over $3,000 - but what actually is it?\n\nAs the cryptocurrency breaks into the mainstream market, we take you back to basics.\n\nWhat is bitcoin and where did it come from?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency, or cryptocurrency, which is created and held electronically. It became the first decentralised digital currency in 2009 thanks to an unknown software developer (or potentially a group of programmers) under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. It runs on blockchain technology, which acts as a public ledger, permanently recording every bitcoin transaction.\n\nHow do I use it?\n\nBitcoin can be used to buy things electronically just like pounds or euros, but there are still relatively few merchants who accept bitcoin payment. Accessing bitcoin can be another hurdle as the process is not consumer friendly and banks in the UK are particularly suspicious of serving bitcoin companies. Traditionally, people go to a cryptocurrency exchange to download a bitcoin wallet, however, new services like bitcoin ATMs and bitcoin debit cards are starting to pop up to make the process easier.\n\nWhy did the price rise so much recently?\n\nBitcoin is still riding on a high from back in April when Japan made a landmark decision to legalise it as an official method of payment. This was a major step in pushing bitcoin away from the fringes of society and towards the mainstream. Asia is the key driver of the cryptocurrency boom, but Europe is not far behind. Adam Davies, a consultant at Altus, said deep analysis of the blockchain shows a clear up-take of bitcoin as an investment vehicle in Europe, particularly in the UK. More and more countries are getting regulators to look at bitcoin and investing in blockchain, which legitimises the cryptocurrency.\n\nRead more: This analyst thinks bitcoin could hit $10,000\n\nIs this expected to last?\n\nThis depends on who you ask. Generally speaking, bitcoin analysts say growth will continue as awareness of the digital currency spreads. However, it is still a highly volatile, high risk asset. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro said bitcoin “could easily crash to $100 a coin or easily surge to $10,000 a coin or go anywhere in between”.\n\nDavies has some solid predictions for the cryptocurrency. He expects a sudden drop of about 20 to 40 per cent in the fourth quarter followed by a quick recovery. He then sees bitcoin reaching between $5,000 and $7,000 in mid-2018 and breaking the $10,000 barrier by 2019. Analysts say the price is a function of the extent to which people think its technology will be useful in the future, but they have mixed opinions about when bitcoin’s volatility will even out, ranging from the next few years to no time soon.\n\nDoes the UK have a position on bitcoin?\n\nWhile the UK is certainly an earlier adopter of bitcoin and interest is rising, cryptocurrencies are yet to catch on like they have in Japan. UK regulators have been quiet on bitcoin, but analysts say that’s because the market is still so small here. Recently, bitcoin got some bad press after it was used as a way to collect money in a global ransomware attack.\n\nWhat other cryptocurrencies are doing well?\n\nEthereum’s ether is the second most popular cryptocurrency, and it has recently seen huge growth as well. However, where bitcoin uses blockchain technology to take the currency out of one person's control, ethereum is a way to decentralise servers, or internet third parties. Its aim is to be a “world computer”. Without getting into the nitty gritty, ether tokens are used as a form of money to fuel ethereum.\n\nWill cryptocurrencies ever take over from more traditional payment methods?\n\nDavies predicts cryptocurrencies will take over from cash one day, but they might look a little different. He compared digital currencies to other technologies like the internet and email that started out as fringe ideas before becoming widely adopted. Davies said we could be about five years away from bitcoin becoming mainstream enough to be used alongside physical currencies.\n\nRead more: As the bitcoin rally continues, are we witnessing a bubble?"", 'A- A+\n\nBy Jennifer Kaplan Bloomberg\n\nCannabis companies are turning to the world’s most popular digital currency in an effort to get rid of all of that cash.\n\nThe inability to access traditional financial institutions is one of the marijuana industry’s biggest impediments. Legal cannabis was a $6 billion industry last year and is expected to grow to $50 billion by 2026, according to Cowen & Co. But because pot is illegal under federal law, big banks and credit-card companies steer clear. That’s forced most merchants to accept cash only, a logistical headache and constant security threat.\n\nEnter bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that consists of digital coins “mined” by computers solving increasingly complex math problems. At least two financial-technology startups, POSaBIT and SinglePoint Inc., use the cryptocurrency as an intermediate step that lets pot connoisseurs use their bank-issued credit cards to buy weed.\n\n“There’s no industry — whether it’s the production and sale of cannabis or the production and sale of a cup of coffee — that can operate safely, transparently or effectively without access to banks or other financial institutions and traditional services,” said Jon Baugher, co-founder of POSaBIT, whose technology is used by 30 dispensaries in Washington state. “That’s where we thought we could leverage the use of digital currency.”\n\nWhile the early bitcoin adopters are claiming success, the currency still has a long way to go before it gains wide acceptance. For many in the legal weed industry, the virtual currency’s association with illicit drug dealing on the so-called dark web is a big drawback.\n\nIt may only be a matter of time before pot dealers have an easier solution. The reluctance of banks to handle pot transactions will probably subside before the digital-currency solution has a chance to take off, said Jeffrey Zucker, co-founder and president of Green Lion Partners, a strategy firm focused on early-stage development in the cannabis industry.\n\n“The banking issues are going to be solved in such time that the people in this industry are going to gravitate toward traditional banking,” he said.\n\n17516861', 'About The Author\n\nAli is a freelance journalist, having 5 years of experience in web journalism and marketing. He contributes to various online publications. With a master degree, now he combines his passions for writing about internet security and technology. When he is not working, he loves traveling and playing games.', ""The US Government Clamps Down on Ability of Americans To Purchase Bitcoin\n\nYou have to feel sorry for Americans. They are some of the most financially enslaved people in the world.\n\nThe bankrupt US government has been instituting capital controls for years now and have ensured that Americans can’t open a bank account nor even a bitcoin exchange account outside of the US through things like the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and just outright threatening to attack any bank or bitcoin exchange in the world who accepts Americans as clients.\n\nThis leaves Americans in the “land of the free” with very few options for bitcoin exchanges.\n\nNo exchange outside of the US will accept Americans as clients. They’ll accept North Koreans. Iranians. Russians. Chinese. Anyone… except for Americans.\n\nAnd due to all the regulations in the fascist/socialist mixed US economy, it is incredibly hard to even operate a bitcoin exchange in the US.\n\nWhile there are now a few other options, which we’ll discuss further below, until recently, there was only one option. Coinbase.\n\nTo be fair to Coinbase a lot of the issues with the exchange aren’t its fault directly. They are due to the myriad of rules and regulations that are strictly enforced in the US police state.\n\nThis has led to countless complaints about how difficult it is to open an account at Coinbase. Many have said that it is just as difficult to open an account at Coinbase as it is to open a bank account in the US… which usually requires a phone book stack of documents and needing to report in each morning with what you ate for breakfast.\n\nAnd there have been countless reports of people saying that Coinbase closed their account without reason or notice. And many others have reported that their bank accounts have been closed once the bank noticed they were doing business with Coinbase.\n\nMatters were made worse when late last year the IRS requested a John Doe summons as part of a bitcoin extortion-evasion probe, seeking to identify all Coinbase users in the US who “conducted transactions in a convertible virtual currency.”\n\nAfter all, the thieves at the IRS expect to get their cut.\n\nTo add to that, the US federal government is pushing a bill called “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017” - which we talked about a few days ago.\n\nThis bill takes a further step to target bitcoin and wants to put any business which “issues” cryptocurrency under this umbrella of anti-money laundering regulations. Also, it will include bitcoin on the list of monetary instruments that must be reported when entering or leaving the US.\n\nAs you can see, trying to do anything related to bitcoin in the “land of the free” anymore is becoming more and more difficult. This combined with the SEC turning down a bitcoin ETF months ago has all but ensured that many Americans missed out on massive gains in the rise of bitcoin and other altcoins in the last year.\n\nAll in the name of protecting Americans, of course!\n\nLately, the site has also been plagued by technical issues as it is unable to handle the demand from customers.\n\nThere have been numerous website inefficiency and maintenance issues which rendered buy and sell orders useless for extending periods of time.\n\nPlus there were extended periods of time when the site couldn’t be accessed at all, which left users unable to move their funds into other wallets. It’s worth noting as well that the majority of these instances occurred during periods of massive price movement which probably costs users millions in potential profits and losses.\n\nAs if all that weren’t enough to make its users furious, it just came out that Coinbase disabled the fundraising account being used to pay the incarcerated founder of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht’s defense attorneys.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, for those who don’t know, was given numerous life sentences for having a website in the, need I say again… “land of the free.” Here was my recent interview with his mother on the massive injustice done to him.\n\nThis happened not long after Coinbase hired the former Silk Road’s federal prosecutor, Kathryn Haun.\n\nWait a sec… why in the world is Coinbase hiring US government criminals?\n\nMany libertarians were going to give the boot to Coinbase after hearing this… but it turns out this prosecutor was the one who put the corrupt FBI agents who stole Ross’s bitcoin in jail.\n\nSo, she may not be totally evil. We aren’t passing judgement just yet.\n\nAnd, yesterday, Ross’s account was enabled again:\n\nSo, Coinbase saved some face this time.\n\nBut, if they can’t somehow lessen their adherence to the millions of US government regulations and fix their site technically they will lose customers to competitors.\n\nAt this time we are only aware of two other bitcoin exchanges operating in the US that will allow users with American bank accounts to exchange fiat for bitcoin.\n\nThere is New York-based Winklevoss twin’s Gemini exchange and the San Francisco-based Kraken exchange.\n\nWe recommend Americans at least consider them as alternatives to Coinbase.\n\nThat’s just being prudent.\n\nAs always, though, ignore Mike the Health Ranger Adams on anything to do with bitcoin.\n\nHe recently put out an article entitled, “Bitcoin wallet COINBASE now seizing accounts of Americans… users rage against ‘total ripoff’ as their Coinbase accounts VANISH,” saying that Coinbase stole everyone's money.\n\nThis, as usual from Mike, is completely untrue. Please stick to vitamins Mike… we got the cryptocurrency space covered over here.\n\nYou can tell Mike doesn’t understand what he’s talking about in his article because he refers to Coinbase as a “popular bitcoin wallet”. Of course, it provides users with different wallets for different currencies, but only an inexperienced user would refer to an exchange as a “wallet.”\n\nMike goes on to quote an issue Coinbase is having with Wyoming users saying Coinbase is stealing their money;\n\n“Although we strive to provide continuous access to Coinbase services, Coinbase has indefinitely suspended its business in Wyoming and we regret that we cannot currently support services in Wyoming. You can find a further explanation of our account suspension policy here. We hope to restore service in Wyoming soon, so please check back again.”\n\nWhile it is true that many users in the state of Wyoming experienced this issue, Coinbase hasn’t yet stolen the funds Mike, let's not jump to conclusions. And, as I said earlier, this issue is caused yet again by the egregious labyrinth of laws in the “land of the free”, not by Coinbase.\n\nIt seems like lately Mike seems to be jumping at any opportunity to incite more bitcoin-based fear propaganda, maybe he’s upset he sold his bitcoin at such a low price level?\n\nIn any case, one thing is clear through all of this. As an American, it is becoming harder and harder to get access to bitcoin.\n\nThis should be a wake-up call to many. The US government is bankrupt. The US government is installing capital controls to ensure Americans cannot leave the country with their money.\n\nAnd, they are making it harder and harder for Americans to convert their US dollars into bitcoin.\n\nThe writing on the wall is clear. And if you haven’t begun to get at least some of your assets outside of the US you should be running not walking to do so.\n\nThis is what every country on Earth does just before their currency hyperinflates into worthlessness or the government defaults. Just ask people in Greece. The government there has just decided they will begin taking people’s homes and the contents of their safety deposit boxes in order to keep the country from bankruptcy.\n\nPeople like Peter Schiff have been warning people to stay out of bitcoin since it was $20. And now the Health Ranger is warning you to stay out of it too.\n\nYou have to wonder what is the motivation of these people who should be smart enough to know that we are on the verge of a collapse of the US dollar to warn people away from alternatives that could save them.\n\nCryptocurrencies have a lot of risks and we wouldn’t recommend anyone put all their assets into them. But we do recommend you begin to use them, put a small percentage of your assets into them and learn more about them.\n\nFor that I have created a free four-video webinar on the importance of cryptocurrencies which you can view HERE. And we’ll even send you your first $50 in bitcoin if you accept our offer to get more information in the videos.\n\nTo summarize, Coinbase has a lot of issues, but most of the issues are just because it operates in the US. It still, however, is the largest exchange in the US and does offer an excellent bitcoin ATM/debit card. And you can get $10 in free bitcoin if you signup using this link.\n\nAmericans can expect to have more and more problems as the US government bankruptcy and Federal Reserve hyperinflation of the dollar nears closer.\n\nMy advice is just to get out of the US for much freer places across the world where you can trade easily in bitcoin.\n\nBut, if you can’t, or won’t, you should be at least ensuring your assets are kept out of the easy reach of the world’s largest terrorist organization, the US government and the world’s largest extortion racket, the IRS.\n\nBitcoin is just one easy way to do that.

According to some, Bitcoin Core should remain in charge. Others, such as ViaBTC, feel Bitcoin Core developers should be fired. Not only is that an impossible statement, it only fuels the ongoing bickering even more. Statements like these add nothing of value whatsoever.\n\nViaBTC Makes A Ridiculous Statement\n\nViaBTC has always been a rather controversial Bitcoin company. Their transaction accelerator tool has been somewhat successful. However, they also support Bitcoin Unlimited, which most people still see as a big joke. It is evident this Chinese pool wants nothing to do with Bitcoin Core and its developers. That is fine, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion. However, issuing things such as “Let’s fire core” only exhibit a high degree of immaturity.\n\nLet's fire core — ViaBTC (@ViaBTC) June 17, 2017\n\nTo put this into perspective, it would be impossible to fire anyone working on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a company, and there is no employees, CEOs, or management. One cannot “fire” developers by any means. The best ViaBTC could do is ignore any proposal presented by Bitcoin Core in the future. They have done so for quite some time, yet even that situation has come to change. The company supports SegWit2x, a solution largely based on SegWit developed by Bitcoin Core.\n\nThe Scaling Debate is Far From Over\n\nAdditionally, choosing SegWit2x further confirms ViaBTC made the wrong decision in the past. Few people are talking about Bitcoin Unlimited anymore right now. Many experts knew that the solution would ultimately fail, for obvious reasons. Multiple code bugs and semi-clueless developers should not determine the future of Bitcoin. It is good to see alternative implementations, but only if they hold up under pressure. BU was never capable of doing so, unfortunately.\n\nIt is evident there will be some form of “separation” on the Bitcoin network very soon. Those supporting SegWit2x will do their thing, and the UASF camp will do something else. They are not mutually exclusive, but it is doubtful Chinese pools will support the UASF. The coming weeks will be quite interesting for Bitcoin. Things may finally be resolved, or the situation could grow worse. Only time will tell what will happen.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock"", 'A new initiative designed to help Bitcoin users with the upcoming fork advises them to maintain 100 percent control of their Bitcoin, rather than keeping it in exchanges.\n\nThe reality is clear - most Bitcoin blocks hit the block size limit of 1 MB and are plagued by fees and slowdowns. The solution, though, is still up in the air as debate rages about how change should happen.\n\nOne solution, the user-activated soft fork (UASF) is scheduled to go live on August 1, while another competing group has threatened to split the chain if that occurs.\n\n1August.org claims to be a neutral third party designed to help users understand and navigate the upcoming fork, and how to best protect their Bitcoin.

The only way to completely control Bitcoin is to be in control of your private keys on either a wallet application or a paper wallet.\n\nAs they continue to evaluate the situation, 1August has promised to continue informing users in an unbiased fashion.', 'Recently, Ramki Ramakrishnan, an international banker and treasury manager, who is also a contributor at Forbes, technically analyzed bitcoin’s recent fall with Elliott Waves.\n\nBitcoin’s Recent Correction\n\nOn Thursday, all the top 25 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, experienced a huge price fall. The average value drop exceeded ten percent in almost all cases. Both Ethereum’s and bitcoin’s market cap fell by billions of dollars, with BTC dropping to $37.4 billion and ETH to $28.9 billion.\n\nHowever, one day later, on Friday, bitcoin recovered from $2,150 to $2,521, and is currently standing on $2,640 (as of Saturday 6:40 PM). Some people credited bitcoin’s tumble to Bitmain’s announcement saying that the network of bitcoin is at a high risk of being split. Although, analyst Nicola Duke predicted such a correction in May for both BTC and Ethereum. The analyst stated that bitcoin could experience a correction of 46.5 percent. Duke predicted that BTC’s price will go as low as $1,470, however, that drop did not happen (yet).\n\nElliott Waves\n\nAccording to Ramakrishnan, bitcoin experienced its biggest correction in two years. The banker had seen the opportunity in the fall to show traders and investors a technical analysis “to demonstrate to you how traders can benefit enormously by paying attention to technical factors.”\n\n“Elliott Wave Analysis is based on a theory put forward by Ralph Nelson Elliott back in the 1930s. He figured out that all bull cycles are made up of five waves, and once the five waves are complete, we will experience a correction that will bring the price down in three waves. The first wave is counted from a significant low, as shown here. The first and third waves are often related to each other by a standard ratio. And one of the three waves going upwards is extended to travel a distance that is much longer relative to the other two,” Ramakrishnan explains.\n\nThe banker explains that, in his analysis, he started a wave count from a significant low in 2015. In the below chart, one can see that Wave 1 was corrected by Wave 2. The third wave surged quite high, exactly 361.8% of the first wave.\n\nOnce bitcoin reached the third wave, the cryptocurrency started in a correction move (as seen in the chart below). Ramakrishnan explained that Elliott Wave practitioners often look for such correction to relate to “the prior impulse wave by a Fibonacci ratio.” In the current case, Wave 4 reached the 38.2% measure of the previous wave.\n\nFor a real-time bitcoin price chart, click here.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'About The Author\n\nAli is a freelance journalist, having 5 years of experience in web journalism and marketing.

06/19/2017,"['""The Flippening"" is a term being dropped into cryptocurrency conversation more and more in recent weeks. While Bitcoin has dominated the conversation, as well as the wider efforts of all digital currencies to achieve a greater degree of recognition in the larger financial world, Ethereum seems to be making quick gains on its more established rival. Despite Bitcoin\'s nearly tripling in price since the beginning of 2017, the iconic cryptocurrency has also seen its share of the total industry market cap drop from 87% to 39% in the past four months. Ethereum, on the market for just two years compared with Bitcoin\'s decade, has undergone an inverse effect: its share of market cap has risen from 5% back in February of this year to about 31% as of mid-June.\n\nBasics of ""The Flippening""\n\n""The Flippening"" refers to a point in time at which Ethereum (or, potentially, some other cryptocurrency) switches places with Bitcoin, taking on the largest position in the cryptocurrency world in terms of market cap. So far, this has yet to take place, in spite of the efforts of many fledgling digital currencies to overtake Bitcoin with new technology, partnerships with corporations, and innovative marketing efforts. And yet, some analysts see the latest wave of growth in Ethereum as the most likely contender to topple Bitcoin\'s reign at the top.\n\nFor most of Bitcoin\'s history, a potential Flippening was a highly remote possibility. Even at the beginning of 2017 such a prospect seemed unlikely. Part of what has given Ethereum a chance to overtake Bitcoin has been its rise in value over the past few months. The currency is currently hovering just below $400 and has reached highs over that level.\n\nPossible Consequences\n\nWhat would the Flippening mean for the cryptocurrency world? Some suggest that once Bitcoin is toppled it may never reach the top of the pile again, as newer and more improved cryptocurrency systems continue to emerge. Bitcoin could continue on without being the center of attention, or it could gradually fade away. Further, Bitcoin could see its system completely disintegrate as a result of scaling problems or other significant growing pains. In any of these cases, the rise of Ethereum could see the broader acceptance of the Ethereum blockchain system across the digital currency field.\n\nOther analysts are skeptical of the Flippening. According to CryptoCoinsNews, Gyft co-founder Vinny Lingham took to Twitter to express his view that ""Bitcoin is better money, deflationary & scarce. Ether is not really money, inflationary & abundant. The Flippening makes no sense."" In Lingham\'s opinion, Bitcoin and Ethereum are actually not competitors. Bitcoin has been built to function as a currency with a limited supply, while ether is designed to power Ethereum\'s smart contracts platform as a token, not a currency.', 'Jun 19, 2017 at 17:35 // News\n\nNina Lyon Author\n\nIn the previous article about Bitcoin price trends at Coinidol.com, the experts have predicted that the price of Bitcoin could hit $3,000 by the end of December 2017. However, it’s June now and last week the Bitcoin price has already reached $3,000.\n\nWe contacted dozens of leading world experts in the field of cryptocurrency, among which are top managers of Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund PLC, Gemini Exchange, BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Alphabit.Fund and many others.\n\nWe asked them to comment on the possible future of the Bitcoin price and whether we should expect a victorious continuation of Bitcoin’s price rise to $3,000 and above.\n\nLegal recognition in Japan\n\nOne of the main reasons for this year’s largest price rise is the official recognition of Bitcoin as a currency in Japan.\n\nThe Japanese cryptocurrency market is flourishing and other countries seem to be warming their attitude towards cryptocurrency use in society.\n\nDaniel Masters, Director at Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund PLC stated to Coinidol:\n\n\n\n\n\n“Our stated target as of December 2015 has remained at $4,400 by year end 2017. I can say that there are obvious explanations behind this most recent price movement. Mainly, positive legislation out of Japan and Australia, and subsequent higher than expected trading volumes.”\n\nAdam Norrie, Portfolio Manager and investment adviser at Bitstocks , a bitcoin investment company from London, said that currently, where the Bitcoin price is moving can be heavily attributed to a few reasons and also named Japan legitimizing Bitcoin as legal tender as the first reason for the Bitcoin price to grow. He stated:\n\n\n\n\n\n“Japan legitimising Bitcoin as legal tender. This has been a huge step forward for Bitcoin and has now set the precedent for other countries to follow and has led to an influx of new capital entering the Bitcoin market.”\n\nJuan J. Manini-Rios, CEO at SHA256 Trading S.A., a proprietary trading firm and market maker focused on developing and implementing algorithmic trading patterns in bitcoin markets, believes that there are several factors to consider that are driving this Bitcoin buying frenzy. He commented to Coinidol.com:\n\n“During the last weeks there have been some very good news for Bitcoin of which worthwhile mentioning are the regulation of the cryptocurrency as an approved payment method in Japan and the resumption of withdrawals at the main Chinese exchanges. Additionally some jurisdictions that until last year were leaning towards a hard stance against cryptocurrencies are now looking much more friendly. Russia is a clear example of such situation with Vladimir Putin very recently meeting Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin and so on. 2017 certainly presents itself as much more regulatory friendly compared to 2016 and earlier.”\n\nMark Dukas, Bitcoin and Blockchain Consultant, cryptocurrency trader at BitcoinSmartMoney.com, stated:\n\n\n\n\n\n""Over the past few months we have seen great acceptance from Japan. Japan went through the ""Lost Decade"" in the 90\'s and early 2000\'s and has now become a pioneer for mainstream adoption. This allows people interested in alternative payment systems to use Bitcoin. This also fuels price increases due to the limited supply of coins in the ecosystem. When mainstream adoption is coupled with speculation we have tremendous price moves.""\n\nNo double tax in Australia\n\nThe Australian government has been planning to solve the problem of double taxation on cryptocurrency for several years. Finally, the Australian government decided to drop the goods and services tax (GST) on digital currency purchases, including Bitcoin, starting in July 2017.\n\nJonathan Millet, Bitcoin Investor, CEO of NEWSBTC, points out the importance of this decision:\n\n\n\n\n\n“Cut of double tax on btc in Australia, legalization and increased use and investment in Japan, more funds going to crypto in general and much talk of scaling by end of 2017. Next 7 months if scaling progresses then 4 months plus. Australia set to implement very soon while Japan also expect to cut purchase tax in July”\n\nCryptocurrency traders are expecting another wave in Bitcoin price rise by the beginning of July, while the Australian blockchain and Bitcoin-related businesses that have relocated abroad will probably now considers the possibility of returning home.\n\nMore ICOs will drive cryptocurrencies\n\nThe emergence of the ICOs on the market makes the cryptocurrency investment industry stronger. The whole cryptocurrency market cap has already surpassed $100 billion USD and keeps growing.\n\nAdam Norrie stated to Coinidol.com that new money entering the industry is also a reason for the Bitcoin price to continue growing. He said:\n\n“We can chart this due to the fact that cryptocurrencies, in general, have grown in regards to their market caps and that this has not impacted the Bitcoin price at all in a negative way but rather shows how as a collective the space is growing.”\n\nMalcolm Pallé, Managing Director at MiningMaven and Non-Executive Director at Coinsilium , also commented:\n\n\n\n\n\n“Such fluctuations are not unusual when a new asset class is created. Whale Oil went from zero to a war time peak if $67.2 a barrel on 1864 as new use cases were discovered in lighting, lubrication and more. Better people look in the direction of the fundamental drivers for the exponential growth in cryptocurrency adoption and usage if they want to make some sense of the current speculative noise. A good starting point would be the new funding paradigm with ICOs which is driving huge numbers of new adopters into the space.”\n\nDaniel Masters noted:\n\n“I believe we are witnessing the emergence of a new use case for digital assets, bitcoin included. Since 2009 and the inception of bitcoin, the perception has been that digital assets initially could solve problem associated with currency. With the advent of private blockchains, we began to see the emergence of the solutions built for problems in trading and settlement. Now, with the emergence of a vibrant ICO market, we have moved to a new phase where digital assets can solve problems in capital formation.”\n\nJuan J. Manini-Rios, also stated:\n\n“We must consider that right now Bitcoin is less than 50% of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies. There is much more going on in the blockchain assets space that just bitcoin. This means that it is now possible to invest money in this asset class with some degree of diversification which of course is very helpful for big investors that want to capture the return of the sector while hedging idiosyncratic risks of each specific coin. Furthermore crypto derivatives markets are slowly becoming a reality which adds another dimension to the potential investment and trading strategies that can be implemented. Crypto is now much more than just Bitcoin and that makes the class more interesting to professional traders and investors.”\n\nChinese exchanges have resumed Bitcoin withdrawals\n\nIn February, the PBOC have intervened to block margin-based and zero-fee Bitcoin Trading and imposed inspections on the local exchanges. Soon after, several cryptocurrency exchanges suspended withdrawals in USD. As we reported before, starting April 2017, customers of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex, were unable to withdraw their Bitcoin to fiat due to problems with the Taiwan banks that the crypto exchange is moving customers funds through. Soon after, OKCoin.cn and several other Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges have sent a message to its users stating that starting from April 18, 2017, they were temporarily suspending USD deposits.\n\nHowever, in June, major cryptocurrency exchanges started to resume allowing withdrawals .\n\nAdam Norrie noted that this fact is driving the Bitcoin price today as well. He commented to Coinidol.com:\n\n“Finally, a more recent event is that Chinese exchanges have resumed Bitcoin withdrawals and therefore trading confidence in the region has begun to grow again and has therefore positively impacted the price.”\n\nGoing mainstream\n\nThe above-mentioned reasons work on the popularization of Bitcoin in the world. As more people know about the advantages of the currency of a new era, the faster it goes mainstream.\n\nDell Jensen, a Bitcoin Mining developer and Trader, commented:\n\n“We\'re still in the early adoption phase, so the main public acceptance jumps will take place soon. It\'s only just begun though. By 2018, I believe Bitcoin price will hit $4-5K due to barriers breaking down, this process is exponential.”\n\nMark Dukas points out that Bitcoin is spreading to new countries and into the hands of new investors and users:\n\n“Emerging markets are hot right now with investor money pouring in at a rapid rate during the first half of 2017. Bitcoin has real use cases in emerging markets such as Brazil and India. With that you will see more and more people flocking to it. An estimated 2,500 people in India are investing in Bitcoin every single day despite RBI warnings.”\n\nCryptocurrency speculators entering the arena\n\nFrom another side, the recent price fluctuation is often associated by experts with speculation on the cryptocurrency markets, especially by the Chinese, and a bubble inflated by exchanges.\n\nJoël Hubert, Software engineer at Otonomos , a Blockchain-enabled company governance processes with Ethereum, said:\n\n\n\n\n\n“We are seeing a new wave of speculators enter the arena: I would generally typify them as friends and acquaintances of those that were previously invested in crypto and now want to join the ""fun"". It\'s a decently sized ""word of mouth"" expansion of the old crypto trader circle. The newbies are not particularly knowledgeable about the topic (""dumb money"") and will be laughing one moment and crying the next when this bull market ends. I think we may see BTC prices up to 5000 this summer - some have even called for $10,000 but that appears a bit of a stretch. Anything in that range is plausible though! The effects have spilled far beyond Bitcoin into the altcoin market; you can take any alt chart and will find a few parabolic moves in recent times.”\n\nDaniel Kim, Sales and Trading at SFOX , an enterprise-grade trading platform with algorithmic trading tools for businesses and traders to buy and sell bitcoins, former Director of Institutional Sales at Gemini Exchange and assistant of Vice President at BNP Paribas , expects high volatility because of the new investors and speculators entering the market. He said:\n\n\n\n\n\n""Asia continues to lead the gain but US is not too far behind. The exponential gains in digital currency investment has put digital currency in the spot light, driving interest from new investors and speculators; I foresee over the next seven months we expect high volatility in all digital currencies.""\n\nMattia Rizzi, electronic trading and blockchain expert at Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking , sharing his personal views, said that what we see now is a bubble, when the more price rises the more people want to buy, hence the quick rise to $3,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe continued:\n\n“In the next few months we will break over $3,000 and likely reach $4,000. Lots of buying volume coming in, more mainstream people looking to buy in. Obviously we need to factor whether on August 1 a Bitcoin HF will be implemented, if that is the case it could bring the price down around $1,200-1,500 in my opinion. However that seems unlikely to happen.”\n\nDemand from an ever-expanding group of investors\n\nDaniel Masters noted that beyond this, we are seeing increasing demand from an ever-expanding group of investors who see bitcoin as a useful hedge/allocation when building their portfolio. He continued:\n\n“This trend was expected, but I believe it hit mainstream sooner than many predicted. For instance, the NASDAQ OMX listed bitcoin ETN offered by XBT Provider AB (“XBT”) (and guaranteed by Global Advisors) has seen its assets under management more than double since January to $100m; and last week saw the announcement that the UK’s largest broker now offers the ETN via their online platform making XBT available for placement in tax advantaged, SIPP, retirement accounts.”\n\nStelian Balta, Founder of HyperChain Capital , a Singapore-based digital assets hedge fund targeting Blockchain enabled technology companies, stated:\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think the increase of price is because the new institutional money are coming to the ecosystem. Not only bitcoin price is up, all major digital assets are up. Having achieved $100bn marketcap, new interest will come from institutional investors, hedge funds, etc.”\n\nNathan Lands, Co-Founder and CEO at Binded, a company developer of copyright ownership platform, that helps artists to manage their copyrights, using the blockchain of Bitcoin to create a permanent record for proof of publication, commented:\n\n\n\n\n\n""I think it\'s primarily driven by the fact that bitcoin has shown to be more resilient than expected(no major crashes or technical issues) as well as increasing interest by major corporations and investors. I suspect many big players are slowly dipping in and testing the waters. Price will likely go up, possibly a lot.""\n\nAlexis Roussel, CoFounder at Bity , a Crypto-Currency broker in Switzerland, trading with bitcoins and ethers, and managing a network of Bitcoin ATMs, commented:\n\n\n\n\n\n“The price of bitcoin and ether have still a lot of space to grow, as the inflated assets from the old economy are moving into the crypto economy. If you want to invest in some project that make sense in our new digital economy, they will only accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Expect major shift of assets. expect majors movement of prices.\n\nExpect major crackdown on the crypto economy that will fuel its price rise. And this is still not the mass adoption phase. That will come later.""\n\nInvestments from small family offices and hedge funds\n\nMattia Rizzi noted that increased blockchain interest from financial services firms attracted investors into buying cryptocurrencies (Santander, JP Morgan Quorum). However, he also believes that a number of family offices and hedge funds in the United States that have started to invest small parts of their portfolios in Bitcoin is also an important reason for cryptocurrency price to grow.\n\nMark Dukas also stated:\n\n“The speculative market is a driving force creating these parabolic moves. We have newbies, traders and wealthy individuals who are now experiencing FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). My belief is price growth will continue with Bitcoin having actual uses cases. It provides value for those in need and tops it off by being the greatest digital asset ever created.”\n\nLiam Robertson, CEO of Alphabit.Fund, the first regulated crypto fund in the world, also stated that the bullish price continuum running up to $3,000 is indicative of new capital entering the market, and in general a higher grade of cryptographic currency acceptance within the wider investment community. He stated to Coinidol.com:\n\n\n\n\n\n“Anyone who says with any conviction that the price is going to be higher or lower than those levels in seven months is pretending to know the answer. 15-30% price swings are all part of the fun with bitcoin, and could happen at any time. One thing I would say however, is that it is my belief that bitcoin will hit $10,000, and sooner than 2020.”\n\nMassive media frenzy\n\nThe technology standing behind the Bitcoin – Blockchain – is now more and more used in different management and governance fields. New Blockchain-based projects are entering the market worldwide every week. However, the acceptance and understanding of new financial technologies is impossible without reports in mass medias. This also works in favor of Bitcoin.\n\nJuan J. Manini-Rios noted that recently there has been a massive media frenzy around bitcoin, particularly following the currency setting a new all-time high. He continued:\n\n“This year bitcoin and ethereum have been portrayed multiple times in specialized finance media outlets like CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes as well as general news outlets worldwide. I’m pretty sure that most old time bitcoiners are constantly receiving messages from family and friends wanting to jump in. The amount of people interested in investing in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is growing dramatically and there are several indicators to support this claim. Data from Google searches as well as account number growth at main exchanges like Poloniex, GDAX (Coinbase), Kraken and so forth. Most of these exchanges are really struggling to keep up with the rate of growth some even experiencing periods of serious service degradation.”\n\nIncreased mining difficulty\n\nMattia Rizzi said to Coinidol that among the reasons of the Bitcoin price that we observe now is increased mining difficulty. To date, the mining difficulty has already surpassed 700,000,000,000 and continues growing.\n\nVladimir Lialine, the founder of Twixsoft , a Bitcoin Mining and Trading company, developer of Blockchain-based solutions for banking, the founder of Honeypotz , and a solution developer of Blockchain digital assets integrity verification “Everexpay”, an Ethereum powered P2P money transfer software wallet. He also pointed out that Bitcoin mining difficulty has gone up tremendously and miners have to be compensated for processing transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also commented that the price will continue growing and there are 10 reasons for that:\n\n“#1 Reason illiquidity, price discovery is very opaque\n\n#2 Japan\'s quick adaptation of BitCoin for store payments\n\n#3 Major uptrend in Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies\n\n#4 Bitcoin is a benchmark\n\n#5 Bitcoin is going mainstream\n\n#6 Mining difficulty has gone up tremendously, miners have to be compensated for processing transactions\n\n#7 Volatility is here to stay\n\n#8 Major uptrend with severe drops/pullbacks\n\n#9 Limited supply\n\n#10 Network congestions”', 'For digital-marketing agency Cooperatize.com, taking bitcoin for payment was easy enough. All co-founder Roger Wu had to do was obtain a digital wallet. To promote the move in 2014, he even penned a blog post for Forbes explaining the decision.\n\nThe number of transactions the New York-based firm has made since? Zero.\n\n“The biggest thing is, are people willing to pay in bitcoin?” Wu asked. “The reality is that most of our customers are other businesses and other businesses don’t use bitcoin.”\n\nEven as the euphoria over bitcoin reached a fever pitch last week as the price surged to almost $3,000, slow transaction times and inertia are preventing it from achieving widespread usage. Adoption has slowed, according to Morgan Stanley, after a slew of companies from Microsoft Corp. to Expedia Inc. initially trumpeted its use, and hurdles remain when it comes to longer-term viability.\n\n“We see few reasons for consumers to use bitcoin over a credit/debit card, given that paying online with bitcoin represents a marginally more inconvenient way to pay,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a 33-page report released June 13. Processing costs for bitcoin and other digital currencies are likely to grow, they said.\n\nTime Inc. and Dell Inc. said they’ve stopped accepting the cryptocurrency, with the computer maker citing low usage. When WordPress stopped taking bitcoin in 2015, founder Matt Mullenweg said usage was “vanishingly small,” adding that it was initially incorporated for philosophical reasons, not commercial ones.\n\n“It’s quite possible that after a while you just realize it’s not worth the cost of tooling up to take it and you decide to drop it if the publicity has run its course,” said David Yermack, a professor at New York University Stern School of Business who studies bitcoin.\n\nStill, there’s plenty of evidence the price surge has helped boost bitcoin’s use — albeit from a low base.\n\nPayment processor BitPay said its now handling about $2 million in transactions a day, up almost threefold from April 2016. Coinbase’s volume has doubled since the start of the year. Overstock.com Inc., an online discounter, said it’s been handling around 100,000 bitcoin transactions per week, up from about 30,000 when it first added the payment method in 2014.\n\n“There is what might be called a wealth effect that occurs, so as price increases people actually counter-intuitively are more likely to spend bitcoin,” said Justin O’Brien, product manager at Coinbase in San Francisco, which has partnered with more than 46,000 businesses for bitcoin payment.\n\nYet somewhat paradoxically, there’s the question of whether its status as a red-hot asset is compatible with being a stable method of payment.\n\nThere’s the issue of volatility. This year has seen bitcoin surge and plunge by as much as 19 percent over the course of a day. As transactions rise, processing them is also becoming slower and more expensive because of a cap on the data the bitcoin blockchain can process — an issue whose resolution has spurred bitter infighting within the development community.\n\n“The blockchain underpinnings of most cryptocurrencies scale too poorly for most currency-like uses,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. “Time to clear single transactions can often be from 10 minutes to more than an hour.”\n\nAnd probably most importantly, bitcoin isn’t recognized as legal tender. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has ruled that bitcoins are property, while regulators treat it as a commodity.\n\nMost big businesses take bitcoin through payment processors such as BitPay and Coinbase. When a consumer makes a purchase via those platforms, he or she will pay at a conversion rate based on the latest bitcoin price. The processors then convert the bitcoin immediately and pass the fiat currency to the seller, essentially removing all exposure to bitcoin’s volatility.\n\nFor merchants, Coinbase charges nothing for the first $1 million and 1 percent of transaction values afterward. That compares with Visa Inc.’s roughly 2 percent interchange rate and almost 3 percent charged by PayPal Holdings Inc.\n\nThe process is more complicated for shoppers. Unless your digital wallet is already on the platform that’s processing the payment, transferring bitcoins incurs a transaction fee, which can vary depending on its size, how quickly you want it processed and network conditions. The median transaction fee was $2.10 on June 15, compared with an all-time high of nearly $3 reached earlier this month, according to BitInfoCharts.\n\nSonny Singh, BitPay’s chief commercial officer, said bitcoin is more useful in emerging economies where trust in local currencies is weaker and credit cards are less common.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is making more headway in markets like Japan, which started recognizing digital currencies as a form of payment this year, and in Venezuela, where the bolivar is almost worthless. It’s also useful for businesses that can’t rely on traditional banking, such as cannabis sellers.\n\nWhile greater usage remains in question, there are often some unexpected benefits for merchants who’ve embraced bitcoin.\n\nSince the Roast of Sherwood added a Coinbase wallet six weeks ago, it has averaged five bitcoin or ether transactions each week, according to Lee Galloway, who runs the sandwich stall with his father in a street market along London’s Whitecross Street.\n\n“For a few small payments we’ve taken, it’s a large amount of publicity,” the 32-year-old said. “If we’re taking large amounts of cryptocurrency payments, I’ll probably have to re-address and re-look at the entire issue, but I can’t imagine that happening any time soon.”', ""(Shutterstock)\n\nThis story appeared in the June 19, 2017 issue of Level Up by Forbes newsletter.

The price for one coin has spiked to about $2,900. If you haven't already, now is the time to buy in.\n\nNixing exchange rate fees is just one of the appeals of a digital currency like bitcoin. Forget intermediaries like credit card companies or PayPal retaining your money in transaction fees. Forget the hassles of converting when you travel—dollars and euros don't matter with this universal currency. Nor does your name, given bitcoin's anonymity, so go for guilty pleasures like $56 worth of cupcakes. This brings up bitcoin's biggest drawback: volatility. The relative novelty and mixed press have caused the value to vary, meaning those delicacies bought in April 2013 for .5896 BTC equated to $800 when BTC soared to 1,000 in December that year.\n\nFor the most user-friendly bitcoin experience, consider Coinbase. Like mobile banking, the app lets you buy, sell and check transactions on the go. Coinbase is a hosted wallet, so if you don't want a third party to have access to your money, consider a user-controlled wallet, like Blockchain or Mycelium."", 'Bitonic, a Dutch Bitcoin company, has recently come out in favor of the BIP148/UASF position for scaling.The company issued a statement that detailed the rationale behind their latest announcement.\n\nBitonic voiced strong opposition in regards to any hard fork option, especially Bitmain’s statements regarding an exclusive hard fork should BIP148 gain a majority.\n\nDeep concerns\n\nBitonic’s release stated:\n\n“As soon as one company with a position of power within the Bitcoin mining industry gains the ability to change the protocol in such a centralized manner, then a decentralized Bitcoin will be a thing of the past.”\n\nTheir position also expressed deep concerns regarding the Segwit2x proposal made at Consensus NY.

But while the actual Segwit2x code is not ready for mining pools to run yet (it\'s still in the testing phase until 30th June), this isn\'t stopping mining pools from demonstrating they support the measure.\n\nMining pools AntPool, Bitcoin.com, Bitfury, Bixin, BTC.com, BTC.top, BW Pool, F2Pool, and ViaBTC (which represent about 71% of the network\'s mining power) are already adding a piece of text to each block that they mine to show their support.\n\nOnce the code is ready for showtime on 21st July, mining pools will be able to run the software. The Segwit2x scaling agreement will require 80% of the mining hashrate to run the code for roughly three days starting on that date.\n\nMining firms already announced their intent to support Segwit2x, but after a meeting in Chengdu last week, 16 total mining manufacturers, exchanges and mining pools ""unanimously"" agreed to a set of resolutions, including their intent to follow through with locking in SegWit by 31st July.\n\nAs such, the roundtable bears similarities to past miner meetings, such as one held in late-April where mining pools agreed to signal support for SegWit on litecoin, an alternative blockchain platform.\n\nIn the resolution, there is also no explicit mention of BIP 148, a soft fork that aims to lock-in SegWit in a different way, and whose supporters have been vocal about what they feel has been a resistance to SegWit over political and social issues.\n\nAs for whether the full terms of Segwit2x will be enacted, however, that remains to be seen.\n\nA hard fork has long been seen as a contentious move by developers and some users. (Mining pool ViaBTC is already taking steps to indicate it could take aggressive actions to ensure a hard fork would enforce a 2 MB upgrade).\n\nAs such, it remains unclear what the final impact of Segwit2x will be on the network, and how many mining pools will ultimately run the terms of the resolution.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which acted as organizer for the Segwit2x proposal.\n\nGreen light image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Picture: PerthNow\n\nPerth man Adrian Pollard was an early investor in Bitcoin, and says the recent surge has pushed the value of his digital assets “into the six figures”. He has, however, experienced the downside of the currency, having been caught up in a major hacking incident in 2014.\n\n“In the very beginning, I only put in $100 and that was a big deal for me to put that much in and then it took off,” Mr Pollard said.\n\n“I put in $2000, $3000 and that just made me a ton of money really, really quickly. That was in 2013, I got in at around $30 and then it went to $260 so it was quite a big rise and it sold really fast and that was quite an experience. So I made a lot of money and then I lost a lot.”\n\nWhen Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox was hacked in 2014, US$460 million was allegedly stolen by hackers. Mr Pollard, whose initial investment of a couple of thousand Australian dollars had risen in value to about AUS$200,000, lost everything.\n\n“It was pretty painful,” he said. “It was like you made it, awesome, and then you lost it all again.”\n\nUndeterred, he continued to invest in bitcoin and it has again paid dividends. He estimates in the years he has been trading in Bitcoin he would’ve invested between AUS$10,000 to AUS$15,000.\n\nHe has now relocated to South Korea, a country at the forefront of the bitcoin world, and has started a business, Hollapay.com, that does international currency transfers using bitcoin, eliminating the need for bank fees and bank-determined currency rates.\n\n“Bitcoin and all the crypto currencies are a bit difficult to use and hard to understand, what we’re doing is offering a service that builds on top of that technology and makes it a lot easier to use if you want to send money abroad,” he said.\n\nWhile the reasons for the recent surge in value remain obscure, investors say there are a number of factors at play.\n\n“There is considerable interest in China, that’s one of the driving factors,” Bret Treasure said of the surge. The convener of the Perth Bitcoin MeetUp group and former chair of the Australian Web Industry Association said he does not trade Bitcoin himself, but does own some of the currency.\n\n“It’s become recognised as a very good store of value,” he said. “When you compare it to gold it doesn’t require you to collect the gold from a particular place, it’s not a physical object and it’s superlatively transferable.”\n\nDr David Glance from the centre of software practise at UWA said investors should be wary about the currency which has little regulation.\n\n“It’s not stable at all, the fact that it suddenly shot up in value just goes to show that,” he said.\n\n“There is nothing fundamental that is actually behind the currency. Normally currencies will be dependent on the well-being of a country…with bitcoin there is absolutely nothing behind it other than pure speculation and that’s why it’s very close to being a Ponzi scheme. It works as long as there are people around to pile into it, but as soon as that floor goes there is nothing substantive to hold it up.”', 'Note: This analysis does not attempt to speculate on the market implications of news events. This is a pure analysis of the market data.\n\n\n\nThe unprecedented rise in the BTC-USD market to near $3,000 even caught many of the more bullish traders by surprise. However, this quick rise in value did not come cheaply: once BTC finally ran out of steam, the market correction not only affected BTC-USD prices, but it was felt throughout the entire crypto-space as entire market cap took a massive plunge from $49B to $36B over the course of three days.\n\nFigure 1: Market Cap Pre–Bitcoin Price Correction\n\nFigure 2: Market Cap Post–Bitcoin Price Correction\n\nWhy Did This Massive Price Correction Happen and Where Are We Heading?\n\nThere are two ways of viewing the BTC-USD run to near $3,000 levels:\n\nThe top can be viewed as the absolute top of the market ($2,948) The top can viewed as the peak at $2,726.50 with a healthy 127 percent Fibonacci Extension\n\nI’m going to analyze the market from the view of option 2 because I feel this provides a more sober outlook on the direction of the BTC-USD market. In strong Bull Runs, it is very common for markets to take a 50 percent correction; a 100 percent Retracement of the initial downward move (if it’s a very strong Bull Run), followed by a 127 percent Fibonacci Extension will provide another test to see how the market feels in the new market highs. In our case, we didn’t quite make it to the 127 percent Extension (shown in orange in Figures 3 and 4).\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, GDAX, 6-hr Candles, the Relative Market Top With Accompanying Extension\n\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, GDAX, 2-hr Candles, Failed 127 Percent Fibonacci Extension\n\nCurrently, BTC-USD is finding support on the 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement of the Bear Run from $3,000 (labeled in green). It made a test of the 61 percent line (labeled in red) and it was ultimately rejected. This rejection and subsequent support test of the 50 percent line coincides with a decrease in volume and a near flip of the four-hour MACD from Bullish to Bearish (labeled in yellow). These market moves show that, unless significant volume hits the BTC-USD markets, there is a likely test of the lower Fibonacci Retracement Lines in its future.\n\nFigure 5: BTC-USD, GDAX, 4-hr Candles, Fibonacci Retracement of Bear Run\n\nAfter our initial market high around $2,700, multiple momentum indicators began to reveal that, although the price was increasing, the market was beginning to lose upward momentum — this type of price activity is called “Divergence” and can be seen across the RSI, MACD and Volume. The long-term outlook for BTC-USD indicates a possibility of lower lows in its future. On the higher time-scales (refer to Figure 3), the momentum indicators are pointing toward more downward movement as the price is currently failing to make a new high and seeing decreased market volume. It’s totally possible that the market could move sideways or even see price growth on decreasing volume — markets aren’t always rational. However, if you want to know whether the price growth is sustainable and reliable, keep an eye on the momentum indicators and watch for volume to accompany price growth in the coming days. For the time being, I find it very unlikely that BTC-USD will see any significant price growth. But, after all, this is cryptocurrency; anything is possible.\n\nSummary:\n\nShort-term indicators are showing a possible move to the lower Fibonacci Retracement values ($2,500, $2,400, $2,280). Long-term indicators are showing a loss of upward momentum. Until more volume hits the markets, very little price growth is likely.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

As reported by Financial News London, Woolard specifically underlined the significant gains made by the likes of bitcoin in recent times. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $3,000 last week. The regulator underlined digital currencies’ volatility, referring to bitcoin’s value being less than a third of the all-time high in June last year.\n\nSuch gains have seen digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, take the mainstream spotlight. Woolard acknowledged the soaring increase in trading due to investors’ interest, while adding “that’s not to say that we don’t see risks.” Specifically, the regulator pointed to their lack of consumer protection due to an absence of regulation, claiming that consumers and novice investors could be mistaken into thinking they are safeguarded akin to investments in traditional financial instruments.\n\nAccording to the publication, he stated:\n\nWe don’t prohibit regulated firms from engaging in digital currency trading, nor do we prohibit banks from offering banking services to deal with currency firms that use [blockchain technology]. I am not saying that we view digital currencies as an inherently bad thing…but we do have to exercise a degree of caution.\n\nThe FCA is notably among the more FinTech-forward regulators in the world, often seen as setting the precedent by its counterparts.

(AMD) GPUs that were well-suited for cryptocurrency mining. Stories abounded that year about large-scale mining operations, and the big profits that some of them were racking up.\n\nBut the party didn\'t last long. After peaking in December 2013, Bitcoin shed over 80% of its value over the following 13 months, and didn\'t really begin staging a recovery until late 2015. The GPU shortages, needless to say, soon disappeared. And with Bitcoin\'s architecture making mining less and less lucrative for small-scale participants over time, interest in the activity gradually diminished.\n\nToday, to paraphrase an old saying, history isn\'t repeating, but it is rhyming. Bitcoin mining has made a bit of a comeback as the cryptocurrency\'s price soars to more than twice its 2013 peak and leads speculators to predict further massive gains are in store. But there\'s much greater mining interest in a rival currency known as Ether, whose price has risen by more than a factor of 40 since the start of 2017.\n\nEther\'s current total value of $33 billion is within striking distance of Bitcoin\'s $44 billion, and well above Bitcoin\'s value two months ago. And importantly, whereas Bitcoin mining is now largely done via expensive hardware rigs running specialized ASICs, Ether was designed to only be effectively mined via GPUs. That has opened the door for miners with limited computing budgets to join the fray.\n\nThanks to these miners, shortages have been reported in recent weeks for mid-range and high-end desktop GPUs based on AMD\'s power-efficient Polaris architecture. And on Tuesday, Pacific Crest upgraded Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) to Sector Weight after talks with Asian graphics card makers pointed to ""surging demand from cryptocurrency miners in China and Eastern Europe since early May.""\n\nPac Crest now expects desktop graphics card shipments to be up 10% to 20% sequentially in Q2, after previously forecasting a 10% to 15% decline due to lower gaming-related demand during the seasonally weak quarter. Both AMD and Nvidia cards are said to be on allocation due to plummeting inventory levels.', 'BTW\n\nErik Finman, who dropped out of high school at the age of 15, made a bet with his parents that they wouldn’t make him go to college if he became a millionaire by the time he was 18. As such the young entrepreneur has confirmed he will not be getting his degree thanks to his investments in Bitcoin, which have seen all-time high valuations in the last few months.\n\nCNBC reports Finman owns 403 Bitcoin each valued at $2,700 a coin for a total value of $1.09 million. He also invests in other smaller cryptocurrency like Ethereum.\n\n“Personally I think Bitcoin is going to be worth a couple hundred thousand to a million dollars a coin,” Finman told CNBC.\n\nFinman started investing in the popular cryptocurrency when he was 12 years old after he received a $1,000 gift from his grandmother. He scored $100,000 for selling his first lump of Bitcoin in late 2013. Displeased with his education, the then 15-year-old created an online education company called Botangle a year later.\n\n“[High school] was pretty low quality,” he told CNBC. “I had these teachers that were all kind of negative. One teacher told me to drop out and work at McDonald’s because that was all I would amount to for the rest of my life. I guess I did the dropout part.”\n\nIn 2015 Finman found a buyer for the company, which offered either $100,000 or the lower offer of 300 Bitcoin, only worth $200 at the time.\n\nFinman took the riskier option, and it certainly paid off.\n\nH/T CNBC', 'Bitcoin is down from the all-time high but not really down significantly. In an article on CNBC, we read:\n\nBitcoin quickly bounced back from the lows of June, amid improved sentiment about the future of the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin traded higher Saturday near $2,680, up more than 20 percent from a June low of $2,185.96 hit Thursday that had erased gains for the month, according to CoinDesk.\n\nWorries about overexuberance in digital currencies overall and heated debate among developers about how to upgrade bitcoin’s technology weighed on its price.\n\n“A proposal was accepted to merge the two upgrade methods, making them compatible,” Brian Kelly, a CNBC contributor and founder of BKCM, which runs a digital assets strategy, said Friday. “So we have seen a relief rally on this progress.”\n\nThe mainstream media are now running even more stories on Bitcoin than was the case at the all-time high. This is a very clear indication that the public is now becoming increasingly aware of the appreciation of the digital currency. This is not yet a screaming indication of the final top of the move but it certainly seems we’re getting there. It might even be the case that the appreciation is already over. There’s no way to know whether this is true. What we might infer here, however, is that we are definitely in a time where the market is to be watched very closely.\n\nBitcoin Appreciates Again\n\nOn BitStamp, we see that the period of depreciation was followed by a rebound. In our previous alert, we wrote:\n\nBitcoin has gone up some more since our previous alert was posted but the move was not on huge volume. The cloudiness of the picture remains in place since the currency reached yet another all-time high, just below $3,000 but the move today has been mostly to the downside and on strong volume (…). Even though all this has “bearish” written all over it, there’s still more to the situation.\n\nWe saw more depreciation following the publication of our alert. Bitcoin went down to around $2,100 and the move took place on elevated volume levels. Bitcoin came below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level (around $2,500) and even below the 38.2% level (around $2,200) based on the rally to the all-time high. This, however, is not necessarily bearish as the currency quickly returned back above both these levels. It can be argued that we’re seeing a downward correction within a strong move up. This is not necessarily the outlook toward which we would tilt, but the indications cannot be ignored.\n\nMove to Upside\n\nOn the long-term BTC-e chart, we see the move to the all-time high was followed by a serious correction and right now we’re seeing yet another rebound to the upside. In our previous commentary, we read:\n\nWe’re up from where we were a couple of days ago and the situation is more extreme in terms of the price, and possibly volume, but the move down today has not been enough to turn the situation around and we might still see a rebound to the upside. If this doesn’t materialize soon enough, we might consider shorts without an additional move up. (…)\n\nSince we have seen a rebound to the upside on high volume, the situation is not really clearly bearish for the short term. It is even more so because of the fact that the recent move below the 23.6% retracement level was denied. The outlook for the next couple of weeks is still more bearish than not, however, a move above the recent all-time high is still possible. Right now, we would prefer to wait for a move below the 38.2% retracement level before considering shorts.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike McAra\n\nBitcoin Trading Strategist\n\nSunshine Profits: Gold & Silver, Forex, Bitcoin, Crude Oil & Stocks\n\nStay updated: sign up for our free mailing list today\n\n* * * * *\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAll essays, research and information found above represent analyses and opinions of Mike McAra and Sunshine Profits’ associates only.

Charles has said that Bitcoin payment channels will only be competitive with a block size increase of “ideally 1000x.”\n\nIn a post on the Yours site on Tuesday, Charles further calculated the value of a payment channel would likely need to be $150 “in order to be competitive with Stripe and PayPal.”\n\n“We demonstrate that payment channels on bitcoin funded with $44 or less are not economically viable if they are used predominantly for payments in one direction,” he wrote.\n\n“In order to be competitive with Stripe and PayPal, channels on bitcoin need to be funded with more than $150.”\n\nBeen wanting to get this out of my system for a while now: The Economics of Payment Channels https://t.co/cVTLCdMwDo — Ryan X. Charles (@ryanxcharles) June 19, 2017\n\nCharles’ calculations refer specifically to Yours’ in-house payment channels. However, during the research, it became apparent that the figures would likely apply to Lightning Network channels as well, these potentially becoming a future feature of the Bitcoin network.\n\n“[...T]he differences are subtle and do not significantly alter the on-chain transaction fees, so the conclusions apply to both networks,” he continued.\n\nCosts associated with micropayments and lower-level payments have becoming a bone of contention for some Bitcoin users as transaction costs have continued to spiral.\n\nMerchant service BitPay even raised its minimum invoice amount from 4 cents to $1 several months ago as a direct result of the costs incurred sending Bitcoins through the network.\n\nYours concluded that a vast block size increase would be the only solution “if the bitcoin community wishes to be competitive on a transaction fee basis with [...] traditional payment processors and altcoins.”\n\n“[...T]he maximum block size should be increased at least 100-fold, and ideally 1000-fold,” Charles said.', ""As of today, over 80 percent of miners (by hash power) are including the letters “NYA” in the blocks they mine. This follows the publication of letters (translation) in which a group of Chinese Bitcoin companies — notably including most mining pool operators — announced that they would signal support for “the New York Agreement.”\n\n\n\nHere’s what this means in the context of Bitcoin Core’s scaling roadmap, the upcoming BIP148 user activated soft fork (UASF) on August 1, 2017, and Bitcoin’s broader scaling debate.\n\nThe New York Agreement\n\nThe New York Agreement, sometimes referred to as “the Silbert Accord” or “SegWit2x,” is a scaling agreement forged within a significant group of international Bitcoin companies and published just before the Consensus 2017 conference in New York last May. Based on this agreement, a fork of the Bitcoin Core software client is being developed under the name “BTC1.” BTC1 developer Jeff Garzik announced the alpha release of this software last week.\n\nWhile technical specifics for BTC1 are still being worked out, it seems that rollout of the New York Agreement essentially consists of two stages.\n\nThe first stage regards deployment of Segregated Witness (SegWit), the backwards compatible protocol upgrade originally proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. With 80 percent has power support, BTC1 should actually trigger activation of the SegWit implementation embedded in Bitcoin Core clients and should also be compatible with BIP148 clients as long as activation happens before August 1st. With BTC1’s “official” release date set for July 21st, this should be possible.\n\nThe second stage concerns the deployment of the hard fork itself, which is not backwards compatible with older Bitcoin clients. This hard fork would double Bitcoin’s “base block size limit” to two megabytes, which combined with the block size limit increase brought by Segregated Witness should make for a total maximum of eight megabytes of block space. This is scheduled for exactly three months after activation of the first stage. So if the “BIP148 deadline” of August 1st is met, the second stage should go into effect before November 1, 2017.\n\nThrough letters published shortly after the announcement of the BTC1 alpha software, Chinese mining pool operators confirmed their intent to honor the New York Agreement. Additionally, they announced to include the letters “NYA” in their “coinbase strings.” That’s what we’ve been seeing today.\n\nSo what does this “NYA” string actually mean?\n\nSignaling and Signaling\n\nFor each block miners mine, they get to send themselves one transaction that includes brand new bitcoins. This is called the “coinbase transaction.” (Not to be confused with the company “Coinbase.”) Like all transactions, this transaction can include a little bit of extra data that actually has nothing to do with the transaction itself. This is what miners sometimes use to “signal” information to the rest of the world.\n\nBut broadly speaking, there are really two types of “signaling.”\n\nThe first type is signaling support. This requires that actual Bitcoin software has been written to monitor the signals and, once these signals reach some kind of threshold, something actually activates in all of these Bitcoin clients. For example, code for the Segregated Witness soft fork as included in Bitcoin Core clients, will enforce the Segregated Witness rules once 95 percent of newly mined blocks include a specific piece of data in the coinbase strings. If that happens, all these nodes will actually reject transactions and blocks that break the SegWit rules. (Edit: It should be noted that SegWit signaling doesn't use the coinbase transaction for signaling, but the block header.)\n\nThe second type is signaling intent. As opposed to signaling support, signaling intent doesn’t actually do anything on a technical level. Rather, it's literally miners sending a message to the world, which has in the past, for example, been used to state a preference for a potential scaling solution. (While miners can also do this through letters or blog posts, coinbase signaling cannot possibly be faked, so it’s a bit more reliable.)\n\nThe recent “NYA” signaling is of the second type. It doesn’t actually trigger any code, but it instead lets the world know that the miners intend to support the New York Agreement. Specifically, they seem to indicate that they will be signaling support for the New York Agreement once the BTC1 client is officially released: presumably by July 21st, or at least in time for August 1st. (Though earlier is possible, too.)\n\nBut notably, most miners are not signaling support yet — even though it’d be possible to activate SegWit through existing activation methods implemented in Bitcoin Core or BIP148 clients straight away.\n\nHard Fork\n\nThe technical specifics for BTC1 are still being worked out, and that’s especially true for the hard fork part of it.\n\nRight now, it seems that signaling support for SegWit2x should also trigger the hard fork code to be implemented in all BTC1 clients — but only three months down the road. So if SegWit activates before August, BTC1 users should start accepting, and potentially mining, “base blocks” larger than one megabyte by November. In fact, the first base block on the BTC1-chain, the “cut-off block,” will likely even have to be bigger than one megabyte.\n\nBut it’s far from certain that most non-BTC1 clients will follow this chain. Most notably, the odds of Bitcoin Core — currently the dominant client on the network — adopting the SegWit2x hard fork seem slim. None of the regular Bitcoin Core contributors were part of the New York Agreement, none of them support it, and contentious hard forks have so far not been implemented by the Bitcoin Core development team, more or less as a matter of policy. And even if the Bitcoin Core development team does merge the hard fork code, it would require all users to upgrade to this new version, which is probably even less likely.\n\nAs such, if BTC1 users — such as the New York Agreement signatories — follow through and actually run the software three months after the soft fork, there will likely be a split in the Bitcoin network. Some nodes will follow a chain with bigger blocks, some will stick to smaller blocks, and there would effectively be two different coins with a shared history.\n\nBut it is too soon to say how such a scenario will play out exactly — or if it will happen in the first place. Three months is a long time in Bitcoin terms and, in the end, neither written agreements, nor signaling intent are binding on a Bitcoin protocol level."", 'JOHANNESBURG — Along with Elon Musk, South African-born Vinny Lingham is currently South Africa’s other major technology entrepreneur export to the famous Silicon Vally in San Francisco. His previous business Gyft, which sold electronic gift vouchers, shot to fame after it started to accept Bitcoins. After California-based First Data acquired Gyft in 2014 , reportedly for over $50m, Lingham – a serial entrepreneur – has since also become well known as the ‘Bitcoin Oracle’ for his accurate forecasts of movements in the cryptocurrency’s price. I first met Vinny in early 2016 when he was on a short visit to the country. Since then, he’s launched a business called Civic.com, which taps blockchain technology to protect people’s identities. Civic is also looking to kill the need for usernames and passwords. I had the chance this week to chat to Vinny again about the recent launch of Civic and about his latest views on the Bitcoin price. Interestingly, he says a big event on August 1 lies in store for Bitcoin. Reports indicate that, on this date, Bitcoin miners plan to implement a protocol upgrade proposal called BIP148 in a bid to end a stalemate among various parties regarding the block size debate – a wide-ranging debate which also includes calls to increase transactions and speed up their completion times on the network. Subsequently, transaction fees for Bitcoin are currently high amid the risk of a possible chain split or fork. A chain split, in turn, could result in Bitcoin Wallets emptying overnight on August 1 because some providers may not be on the new chain. (You can learn more about this issue by clicking here and here.) This is an important risk to consider, especially as the Bitcoin price has been on a tear this year, surging well past the $2000 mark. – Gareth van Zyl\n\nVinny, thanks for chatting to me today. Many of our readers would know some of your background with Gyft and, of course, the Shark Tank in South Africa. But it looks like today you’re being kept busy in San Francisco with a new venture of yours called Civic.com, which plans to protect people’s identities by using the blockchain. Can you tell us a little bit more about it?\n\nSure, Civic is basically a decentralised identity system. We’re trying to build it as a global platform for identity where people around the world can use their identity information on their devices with companies that are willing to accept it. So, think of it as a digital passport, a digital ID and what makes it different is it’s very much divorced from the notion of having a server that stores all your information. So, what happens is Civic verifies your information from third-party sources. So, for example, in South Africa we could use bank records, we could use the department of transportation, and once we verify all the information, we put special cryptographic keys on the devices and lock it up using touch ID or facial recognition or voice or whatever method we can use with the device that you have. And when you present those credentials to somebody else, they don’t have to go and re-verify it, they can just trust that we did correctly and that the issuing party, whether it was a government agency or a company is a trusted issuing party and so that ID credential is valid. And because we don’t store the information on our servers, we can’t get hacked and lose your information – it’s only on the device. The receiving party – they receive your information and they know it’s secure, and the costs involved are less and they can trust that it’s you. You can then prevent the situation where someone walks into a bank branch and with a utility bill and an ID and opens an account in your name because if you were registered using Civic, they would detect that and say, “Well, where’s your Civic information, where are your credentials”. You can prevent identity theft, you can open up accounts online, you can start taking out things on mobile phones, this can effectively replace the RICA, FICA process in South Africa. The idea is making ID credentials reusable on a device level, and so if we have everybody in the world’s information, you have 7 billion people with different information on all the devices and therefore the network is secure because it’s not all in one place, it’s all just spread across (on the blockchain) and we use a network of validators and verifiers that can attest to the fact that you are who you say you are. And so, yeah, could you have a situation where somebody steals your phone and cuts off your finger, yeah, yeah (laughs) that’s a gun to your head scenario that happens. But the chances of that happening is way less than the chance of somebody forging a document and that’s the way we look at it…. And so this is a way more safe and secure system than what’s out there today.\n\nSo, it’s just launched – I’ve tried the app and downloaded it. What I’ve realised is that it’s quite a simple, easy to use interface but it looks like you’ve partnered with a few companies, is that correct? So, basically, you would scan a QR code and that would then be stored in the app.\n\nYeah, exactly. But we’ve only launched with two partners so far, with BNKtotheFuture and TokenMarket…there’s a whole bunch in the works now, we only launched two weeks ago, three weeks ago. This has been a very busy time for us, and we’re just onboarding this with very large partners right now and (looking to) a global expansion. The most important thing to make sure is that the system works, people can onboard. We’re in a little bit of a beta phase right now where we have limited partners using us, but have had so much interest from worldwide, I mean we’re going to have hundreds of partners by the end of the year without a doubt and probably even thousands. And so this becomes hopefully the standard for logging into websites. So when you log into websites (using Civic) you don’t need a username and password, you don’t need to have a two-factor authentication tool or a YubiKey or one of those devices to confirm a different code every second – it’s all linked to your device (ie your smartphone) and we have Bitcoin and blockchain technology and wallets built into the device to make sure your device is unique and fingerprinted and, so, again just a very safe and secure way of doing it. And by the way, this is available to all South African companies right now, anyone can go to docs.civic.com, look at the API information. If you’re running, for example, a forum and you want to get rid of people who are spamming the forum with comments spam etc., you can just make them have a Civic account because the way our system works is that you have two levels of accounts. You have basic accounts which is just email and password, so email and mobile phone. And then you have verified accounts which are email, mobile phone number and your social security number or your ID number, plus home address and a whole bunch of other information. With verified accounts, you’re basically going to have zero spam, because if you block someone they can never come back with that same verified account because the way it works is you, as an individual, will only ever have one account with the Civic network ever and, so, you have to be very careful using that. You wouldn’t engage in bad activity knowing that if somebody blocks you, you could never come back, through Civic, to that company. So, we want to move to a world where you can also protect your identity, so that you don’t have to log into a forum or website or anything, giving up your name or anything like that. For example, if you’re on a dating website, which we’re looking to as an industry pretty heavily right now, you can verify that you’re 27-years-old, and you live in Johannesburg and you’re male, but you don’t have to put your name in there and you don’t have to put in any of your information and Civic will validate that information to the receiving party and they don’t have to know anything else about you, but they can trust that you are a real person. And that’s really what Civic is about. So we give you levels of privacy and control that you want, around your personal data and we have a very long roadmap as to how we improve this in the future.\n\nIt looks like you could have a whole range of implementations. I was watching a video on your website where there was a lady who was booking a flight ticket, and she did it without usernames, passwords. She simply rocked up at the airport and used her mobile phone to get her boarding pass.\n\nYeah, that’s the dream and so, right now, we’re just driving for partner adoption, which is looking really strong. Yeah, and eventually, you should just be able to use your phone for everything and not have to ever have to pull out an ID card, ID document or even a passport one day.\n\nThis could ultimately completely kill usernames and passwords, as you’ve said?\n\nFor the partners who are using us right now, it already has.\n\nIf South African businesses want to get involved, they can just visit your site and work out the APIs and connect from there?\n\nExactly, every business should be using Civic as an option. You already have other two-factor authentication options like Google Authenticator or YubiKeys. SMS is the worst two-factor authentication because it’s easily hacked. It’s very clear that SMS is a very bad way of doing two-factor authentication. So, just because you have access to a phone number and SMS, it doesn’t mean that it is the person because the SIM card can be swapped etc. So, two-factor authentication is moving quickly towards projects like Civic. You can have the hardware tokens because people have like YubiKeys and that sort of thing, but it’s not as secure as having someone use their fingerprint on their iPhone and verify that that’s them before logging in. We see a lot of demand, especially with Bitcoin wallets right now to use Civic as a two-factor authentication method. So, you can keep you can keep your user and password for those services but then, as an extra method, once you log in with a username and password, it says please scan this code or use your Civic ID on your app to let you into the app, and then you always know it’s you. This is something which banks, financial services, any company that has sensitive information or access to protocols can use Civic to validate the person logging in, and we’ve got some companies looking to do this at a corporate level where to do, for example, a wire transfer or a payment, you can get people to verify their Civic IDs in order to have their payment go through. The implementations of this are pretty profound. You can do it so many different ways, but it’s going to change the world, the fact that you can now use the hardware on a phone, the camera, the microphone, the fingerprint scanner to validate an identity of somebody before a transaction or a login is attempted or performed.\n\nAnd what do you make of the hype around blockchain because obviously, you’ve used blockchain with Civic. There’s a lot of hype around it at the moment. Do you think it’s over-hyped?\n\nLook, it’s definitely over-hyped. What we’ve been doing for the past two years is building a Bitcoin blockchain based solution which really one of the key and first major use cases for blockchain technologies. It’s decentralising identity stores – so not having everyone’s ID information in one service and making sure you can trust that when that digital information is transferred from one place to another. There is a lot of hype; there will be a bit of a bubble, there will be a crash. It’s the usual cycle for technology and it will repeat itself over and over, but I think what you’ll find is that in this cycle, you’ll find real use cases coming to the fore and companies like Civic producing products that people can use. The best thing about civic is that most people who use the product will not even know that they’re using Bitcoin blockchain on the back-end. Bitcoin blockchain becomes like TCP/IP, it’s just a protocol and its super secure and guarantees privacy. Another important note is that your information never sits on the Bitcoin blockchain – we’re just using that as a public key infrastructure for cryptography. All the information only sits on your device – we can’t have access to it. So, any government in the world who sends us a subpoena, we’ll have to ask them to bring their best cryptographers to prove to them that we don’t have the information – because we just don’t have it. So, we can’t give your information out without your express permission.\n\nSo, you haven’t built your own blockchain as such – you’re leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain?\n\nIt’s the most secure blockchain in the world so, for now, we think that’s the best way to go.\n\nYou’ve become known as the Bitcoin Oracle. Last year, you forecast that Bitcoin would hit $1000 and it did. Can you tell our audience why the price went to $1000 and how did you get that right?\n\nWell, I think it’s actually, the reason they call me the Bitcoin Oracle is that I’ve had accurate predictions for like 4-5 years in a row. I even predicted $3000 this year and we already hit it. I had a good sense of the market, the psychology, the supply and demand curve, the network activity. It’s not so much guessing as much as it is more like predictive analytics around behaviour and adoption usage. Now, I would say that right now we got to $3000 a bit too soon, so it will probably fall back a bit. At one point, I predicted that it would go down to $850 and it hit $880, from $1250. It should have stayed down there a lot longer and the reason for that is that there are some technical limitations in Bitcoin around scaling, which is coming to the fore now on 1 August. So, 1 August you’re potentially going to have a chain split and a hard fork and a couple other technical nightmares that may happen on that day, or in that week, which would make it … you know, you don’t want to spend Bitcoins that week at all, otherwise, you’d lose. There are some very bad outcomes that are forecast. I don’t know how bad it could be; I’m hoping that it blows over ok. But the current price is not factoring in all downsides that could happen on 1 August – it’s a pretty big technical change. So, I’m very, very cautious. So, I sold my Bitcoins. Right now, I’m waiting for this to be resolved because I think a lot can go wrong and I think as move closer to the time, people are going to start panicking a bit more and the price still going to tank further. After this is resolved, I will be a lot more bullish again on Bitcoin, but until the technical scaling issue is resolved, I’m a bit more bearish for a while.\n\nFor some of our listeners out there who might not be familiar with that, the technical scaling, if you can just briefly explain what that means exactly. Because I know that there’s quite a lot of debate around the speed of transactions as well, right. So does that tie into that?\n\nYes, it’s a topic which I don’t want to open for discussion right now – it would take us an hour just to get up to speed with what’s going on. But let’s just say that around about the last week of July and the first week of August, until things have calmed down, don’t spend any Bitcoins. Just sit on your Bitcoin, don’t spend them. If you’re worried about the price dropping and whatever else, then sell then beforehand, now would be a good time. I could be wrong – it could go up further, but the market is not pricing in all the downside that could happen and the risk that could happen. I don’t like the kind of risk profile that I’m seeing.\n\nWhat are the chances of the Bitcoin price going past the $3000 mark then again, do you think then that those chances are slim considering that 1st of August date?\n\nAfter August 1, I think it’s very likely that if we get to the point where the issues have resolved and there’s one unified Bitcoin going forward. But if there are two camps and one creating two Bitcoins and other bad things could happen, then I don’t see it going there (the $3000 mark) at all. So, I’m sceptical with regards to that. I’m sceptical of $3000 again right now, I think it’s a very tough target, even at $2500 a hit, given this scaling issue and technical challenge. The smart money wouldn’t be buying right now, in my opinion. Look, if this thing dips, people may buy because they think it’s cheap, but I still think until you’ve actually got past the point of resolving this impasse, it’s risky. I mean risk-reward right? So, let’s see how it goes.\n\nWhy have people been buying so much Bitcoin to date, regardless of this. It seems like it would be madness then right?\n\nWell, the promise of Bitcoin is really strong. It’s got all the ability to change the world and a global store of value and it’s hedging into emerging market currency deflation. Lots of good reasons to buy Bitcoin. The reality is that’s the promise, and unfortunately, most people don’t understand the technical limitations and reality on the ground. I guarantee you, 95% of people out there buying Bitcoin have no idea about this 1st of August chain split risk and whatever else. And so, they will just keep buying and the price will go up because of supply and demand, but the moment this happens and people start realising what’s going on, I think it’s going to dip because it’s going to kill demand for a while. And it’s one of those things where we just don’t know what’s going to happen. I mean, we’ve got a lot of predictions, we’ve got a lot of technical analysis, and literally, all the scenarios look bad. There’s only one or two that look good and those two are very unlikely in my estimation – we’ll see.\n\nAnd what about this rise in other cryptocurrencies? There’s been a lot of attention around Ethereum, as one alternative cryptocurrency. I guess Ethereum also works on the whole Blockchain concept but it has smart contracts etc. What is your take on the surge in some of those other cryptocurrencies?\n\nOverall, I think we’re in a bit of an inflated bubble – there’s a lot of froth in the market. People are getting ahead of themselves. The technologies are fantastic but the use cases in commercial terms and ability to generate revenue and whatever else is lacking. Now, some of these things you have to suspend belief, otherwise you will miss out on an opportunity on what part of the future is from a self-fulfilling prophecy perspective. The thing is something like this grows up in terms of price and gains value and then starts working, but it wouldn’t have worked if no-one believed in it in the first place. I call it faith-based currency. So, in some cases, you have to suspend belief in order to make it successful. In other cases, I’ll look at it and say, look, there’s an oversupply in these things, which one doesn’t take off, I don’t know, but maybe you should have a diversified portfolio and you see which one takes off. Now, I think that the trend is very clear that cryptos are the future. What their value is in the future and whether there is one domineering, it’s early days. I think there’s, again, risk and rewards and opportunities. There’s money to be mad and money to be lost. I do think that you will see, with Ethereum and others, that in a couple of years time that the prices of today may look cheap in respect of where they are. But if that’s three years or five years from now, whether there is a bubble and a crash, I can’t predict that. It’s human behaviour – a lot of this depends on where things go on a global scale. I can say that if Bitcoin survives -— whatever survives in August — it’s going to become the backbone of this entire world permanently because it’s such a massive fundamental change that happens in August. And then the price may spike to $10 000 – you just don’t know. But right now, it’s in a spot where it’s precarious and I think other cryptos are all trying to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance and we’ll see.\n\nVinny, it’s been an absolute pleasure talking to you today – thanks for chatting to me.\n\nThanks Gareth']"
06/21/2017,"['', 'Despite its price volatility, Bitcoin is likely to make more millionaires.\n\nPanos Mourdoukoutas, chair of the department of economics at LIU Post in New York City, whose works are published by Forbes and The New York Times, thinks Bitcoin is likely to turn more individuals into millionaires before its price dives again.\n\nBitcoin recently reached an all-time high of $3,000 this June after a huge correction to $2,682 from $2,957 in the period of two days. This is after tech billionaire Mark Cuban reportedly called Bitcoin\'s recent price surge a bubble.\n\nHowever, this is not the case since the cryptocurrency is showing an uptrend, based on its recent price of $2,831 and its continuing upward trend.\n\nMourdoukoutas shared a partially similar viewpoint to Cuban\'s. Both had similar claims that Bitcoin\'s price would drop after a substantial surge, however, he stopped short of calling Bitcoin a bubble.\n\nMaking more millionaires before it crashes again\n\nMourdoukoutas mentioned that the digital currency made many ""overnight millionaires"" - individuals who invested into BTC when it was worth just a portion of its current rate.\n\nHe also mentioned that Bitcoin will reach new highs, making more millionaires in the course of the action, before ""returning down to earth.""\n\nMourdoukoutas added that one of the reasons for the increased investment in the cryptocurrency is the ""ultra-low” rate of interest environment, makings the trade of Bitcoin an enticing proposition.\n\nIn addition, there is a growing mistrust in the currencies of several nations, following government policies that have pushed more investors into the cryptocurrency.\n\nPrice restricted by policies and supply\n\nMourdoukoutas said that one of these policies is the act by federal governments to provide new treasury bonds at record low rates to cover the old financial obligations with brand-new ones.\n\nFor instance, Japan sells treasuries that yield nearly absolutely nothing for the state, however, the nation\'s debts amount to approximately 250 percent of the country’s GDP. The teacher mentioned that China\'s treasury yields ""something,"" however, no one knows the specific quantity of the ""informal financial obligation"".\n\nThe fact that there is a substantial quantity of financial obligations linked to the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen diminishes the confidence of investors. Given that there is Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that has increased its worth by 125 percent in 2016, investors in Asia have taken advantage of the possibility to invest more into the digital currency.\n\nThe economics professor also highlighted another government policy which might decrease trust in a country\'s nationwide currency. This relocation is when governments wish to eliminate the old currency notes, as held true in India and Venezuela. Such incidents, according to Mourdoukoutas, is one of the reasons why Bitcoin price has risen.\n\nStill better hedge fund than traditional ones\n\nMourdoukoutas further commented that there are particular advantages which make Bitcoin a much better hedge than traditional ones, such as gold. He added that the millennial generation is one of the greatest supporters of the cryptocurrency as they understand BTC much better than the ""baby-boomer generation.”\n\nMourdoukoutas shared:\n\n""Unlike gold, for instance, Bitcoin is a hassle-free medium of payment around the globe.”\n\nThe economics professor expounded that Bitcoin\'s supply is anticipated to be restricted to 21 mln. Compared to gold, there is no deficiency of the mineral considering that when the rate of gold rises, it supplies more incentive for gold miners to mine for gold.\n\nFinally, Mourdoukoutas specified that the financier buzz around Bitcoin continuously helps the cryptocurrency to go upwards, as a growing number of financiers are becoming familiar with the digital currency, and can utilize ETFs (exchange-traded funds) to ""conveniently participate in the market.""', 'The Unicode Consortium on Tuesday announced the launch of Unicode 10 that brings a bunch of new emojis, a new Bitcoin sign, and a set of Typicon symbols. With the Unicode 10, 56 new emojis have been released along with a major addition of 8,518 characters bringing the total number of characters to 136,690. Originally unveiled in March this year, the new emoji characters are likely to debut with the iOS 11 slated to roll out later this year.\n\nThe new Unicode 10 includes a plethora under the hood updates and improvements such as some new scripts that add support for lesser-used languages, integration of core specification and data files under the same date, and some Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm & UAX modifications, in addition to new emojis. The new 56 new emoji figures include some of the highly demanded emojis like Hijab, Zombie, \'Colbert Emoji\', Scarf among others. A new Bitcoin symbol and Typicon characters are the notable ones in the new update. The entire list of 56 new emojis is available on Unicode\'s own emoji chart and Emojipedia.\n\n""The Unicode Standard is the foundation for all modern software and communications around the world, including all modern operating systems, browsers, laptops, and smartphones-plus the Internet and Web (URLs, HTML, XML, CSS, JSON, etc.),"" notes Unicode Consortium\'s blog post, emphasising on the future availability of Unicode 10 on Internet browsers as well as other supported platforms and devices.\n\nAs we said, the Unicode 10\'s new emoji set is reportedly expected to roll out with iOS 11 this fall - however, Apple may choose to push it to a smaller update like iOS 11.1 or so, reports 9to5Mac. Having said that, there is no information available as of now for other major platforms like Android and Windows.', 'Erik Finman has a fascinating life story. He grew up in Idaho, and was reportedly frustrated with his high school teachers – so much so he begged his parents to drop out. According to reports, one of his teachers even told him to drop out and work at McDonald’s, because that’s all he would be doing for the rest of his life.\n\nWhen he was only 12 years old, in May 2011, his older brother Scott introduced him to bitcoin when one coin was worth about $12 by sending him 0.2 bitcoins so he could use the cryptocurrency.\n\nLater on, his grandmother gave him $1,000 as a gift in Easter and, instead of buying tons of toys or putting it all in a savings account, Erik bought himself some bitcoins. A few years later, in late 2013, when one bitcoin was worth $1,2000, Erik decided it was time to sell, and turned his $1,000 gift into $100,000.\n\nAccording to Mashable, then 15-year-old Erik used his earnings to launch an online tutoring service dubbed Botangle. At the time Mashable caught up with him, his business had 20 employees and over 100 active users who were presumably part of his target audience: frustrated students to find teachers to video chat with.\n\nAt the time, Erik Finman made it clear he wasn’t planning on going to college by betting with his parents:\n\nI actually have a deal with my parents that if I make a million dollars before I turn 18, I don’t have to go to college. I’m going to do it or die trying\n\nAs reported by CNBC, he also used part of his money to move to Silicon Valley. There, he met interesting people including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, was mugged at gunpoint and got away thanks to an emergency button he created for his Android phone, and met an unnamed Uber executive who discouraged him and told him he was going to lose his bet.\n\nEventually, the young entrepreneur sold Botangle’s technology in early 2015. The investor gave him two options: 300 bitcoins (each worth little over $200 at the time) or $100,000 in fiat. Erik took bitcoin because he believed in its future. From that point on, most of what Erik has been doing is managing his bitcoin investments and working on various projects, such as NASA’s ELaNa project.\n\nFinman managed to win the bet with his parents, as he now owns 403 bitcoins (worth about $1.09 million), and has small investments in other cryptocurrencies, including litecoin and ethereum. The young entrepreneur believes bitcoin’s best days are still to come. He stated:\n\nPersonally I think bitcoin is going to be worth a couple hundred thousand to a million dollars a coin.\n\nCollege No Go\n\nErik Finman dropped out and never got his GED. According to his own statements, he doesn’t see any value in it as its purpose would be to later on get a job. He learned how to run a business on his own, and was quoted as saying: “Instead of writing essays for English class, I had to write emails to important people”.\n\nHis brother Scott, who introduced him to bitcoin when he was 12, now has an enterprise software company, after going to Johns Hopkins Universty at 16. His other brother Ross, who went to Carnegie Melon for robotics, is now pursuing a Ph.D. at MIT.\n\nNevertheless, Erik doesn’t see a lot of value in the current educational system.\n\nThe way the education system is structured now, I wouldn’t recommend it. It doesn’t work for anyone. I would recommend the internet, which is all free. You can learn a million times more off YouTube and Wikipedia.\n\nFeatured image from Erik Finman/Twitter.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin, it seems, has one of two futures.\n\nEither the $40bn economic network that still defies scientists is on the verge of the biggest change in the network\'s history, or the most advanced of its many long-theorized scaling compromises is headed toward its biggest political failure.\n\nIn recent weeks and months, the likely outcome has shifted quickly, often daily, as the varying stakeholders and competing proposals have jockeyed for position, media attention, and in some cases, actual headspace in the form of creative political attire.\n\nWhat has been less visible, however, is that, in the midst of the chaos, bitcoin has been progressing, slowly and messily, to the point where some sort of action in the years-long effort to increase its transaction capacity seems likely to be taken.\n\nThis is partly because of a key proposal that emerged last month.\n\nAfter convening in a meeting in May, a group of entrepreneurs and miners put forward Segwit2x, certainly not the first, but arguably the most advanced alternative to the roadmap long advocated by Bitcoin Core, the network\'s open-source developer group.\n\nArmed with the commitments from the majority of bitcoin\'s mining pools, the group, comprising more than 50 startups and organized by investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group, now has enough influence to push through at least the first portion of the agreement, though it\'s not without its dissenters.\n\nCome August, a number of outcomes are plausible. Some are more likely than others. Bitcoin could be upgraded smoothly, or not. But, the big conclusion could play out in many different ways.\n\nThe SegWit split\n\nFor the moment, the most important takeaway may be that every group is pushing for a change known as Segregated Witness. Bitcoin Core\'s original roadmap, the Segwit2x plan and users rallying around a change known as a \'user-activated soft fork\' (UASF), all call for the upgrade.\n\nIntroduced already to no ill effect on the litecoin network, SegWit could provide a boost to bitcoin\'s transaction capacity among other enhancements. But it has yet to activate on its own. (Some mining pool operators and mining hardware companies have long pushed back against the proposal, though the motivations here are varied.)\n\nBut as all the proposals now ultimately support SegWit on different terms, many in the community see this as a sign that SegWit is finally going to activate this summer.\n\nThe question is whether it could ultimately lead to a split into two bitcoins, due to how the upgrades are set up.\n\nFor one, some mining pools are showing signs that they want to take aggressive measures to hard fork bitcoin to a 2MB block-size parameter. If that happens, it\'s possible that bitcoin could split into two competing assets later in the summer.\n\nThe tricky part is that the debate is constantly shifting.\n\nBut, to help understand the current state, here\'s a timeline of what could happen:\n\nSegwit2x soft fork: 21st July\n\nDescribed formally in BIP 141, SegWit was first released last November. Today, as many as 80% of bitcoin nodes are running it.\n\nAnd though it has grown contentious, it\'s important to note SegWit was originally billed as a \'compromise\', since it increases the block size (though not in a way that changes the hard-coded \'block size\').\n\nPartly because of this, the idea did not please everyone. Namely, most mining pools did not upgrade their software in support of SegWit, either because they did not agree with the change or because they were indifferent.\n\nBecause of the contention around SegWit, others have been looking for a way to boost capacity that aligns with more stakeholders.\n\nSegwit2x is one alternative proposal that combines SegWit with an increase to a 2MB block-size parameter. Most major bitcoin companies and mining pools representing 80% of the hashrate signed the proposal.\n\nAs noted earlier, the compromise might be working. As of Monday, the majority of the bitcoin mining hashrate is signaling support for Segwit2x.\n\nThis is a non-binding show of support. But the code is set to be officially released by 21st July, according to the technical working group timelines. Once that happens, mining pools can run and signal support for the change.\n\nIf 80% of mining pools run the code for 672 blocks, over a period of four to five days, then SegWit will lock in. Although it\'s non-binding, it\'s notable that the mining pools plan to lock-in SegWit the day before 1st August (more on that below).\n\nThree months later, the second portion of the agreement, the 2MB block-size increase, is supposed to kick in. The problem is that if not all users upgrade, this could lead bitcoin to split into two assets. At least some users have said that they don\'t plan to.\n\nTimeline: Signaling for the change begins on 21st July. Three months after SegWit is activated, users will need to upgrade their software if they want to support the 2MB block-size parameter increase.\n\nWho supports it? Most major companies and mining pools.\n\nIf mining pools lock in Segwit2x by 31st July, then that might be it. Otherwise the following events could unravel.\n\nBIP 148 UASF: 1st August\n\nBIP 148 UASF also aims to activate SegWit, but it takes a different approach.\n\nIt rekindles an older way of making consensus upgrades to bitcoin, one that doesn\'t explicitly ask mining pools for support before pushing through a code change. (Some in the community are calling it bitcoin\'s \'Independence Day\' for that reason.)\n\nMany users and some companies are already running code that could trigger this type of soft fork. At this point, nodes will start rejecting blocks that do not signal support for SegWit.\n\nThat\'s why the idea is controversial. As these nodes reject the blocks, they\'re effectively pushing them to a different network. It\'s a controversial idea because, like the above hard fork, it could lead bitcoin to split into two competing cryptocurrencies, both called bitcoin.\n\nBut, some argue that it has more of a psychological affect. For example, some believe that mining pools rallied around Segwit2x on Monday in response to growing support for BIP 148. The idea is that, if they don\'t want bitcoin to split, SegWit needs to be activated somehow prior to that date.\n\nTimeline: On 1st August, nodes that are running BIP 148 will start rejecting blocks from miners that do not support SegWit.\n\nWho supports it? Some users, some businesses, some miners and some developers, but like the other proposals, support is split.\n\nUAHF: 12 hours after BIP148\n\nIf BIP 148 gets off the ground on 1st August, mining firm Bitmain plans to roll out a ""user-activated hard fork"" (UAHF) in response.\n\nThis could potentially protect users\' money in the event of a split, according to the company, by making the split more permanent. In theory, a bitcoin hard fork could provide protection from a \'wipe out\', where transactions on one version of the blockchain might accidentally be erased.\n\nStill, mining pools might lose money if they end up mining a competing fork. So, some are calling the the Bitmain UAHF a bluff.\n\nAnother mining firm, ViaBTC, unveiled a related plan on Monday to guard against the prospect that some in the community may not uphold the 2MB increase portion of the Segwit2x agreement.\n\nThe far-fetched goal is to incentivize the creation of a bitcoin with bigger blocks by raising the funds to do so via an initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nTimeline: If BIP 148 triggers, Bitmain will start mining a private chain and open it up to more bitcoin users if there’s enough support.\n\nWho supports it? Two mining firms, Bitmain and ViaBTC.\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nStill, it\'s possible that all these scaling efforts will become obsolete once mining pools lock in Segwit2x. If not, though, there is the more complex timeline to keep in mind.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other complexities to the argument, not the least of which is that it can seem like bitcoin users are voiceless in the middle of all this in-fighting.\n\nThis was the highlight of a debate between Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Peter Smith, CEO of bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain, on a mailing list last week. There, Back argued that users don\'t want a small group of entities dictating the rules of what\'s supposed to be a decentralized currency, while Smith asserted that its wallet users want cheaper fees.\n\nGiven the complexities of the outcomes above, bitcoin\'s biggest question now may not be whether it will upgrade, but whose vision for the network will win out when it does (or doesn\'t).\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which helped organize Segwit2x and has an ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nMysterious chest image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He pled guilty earlier this year and asked for “ dramatically less ” than the eight years behind bars that probation officials have recommended.However, government lawyers Tuesday urged the court to stick to the range of 121 to 151 months recommended in sentencing guidelines, saying Murgio’s attempt to portray himself as a good-hearted entrepreneur who made a few wrong turns “blinks reality.” From start to finish, prosecutors said, Murgio moved his enterprise forward by lying to financial institutions, the National Credit Union Administration and customers.“Murgio — while fully cognizant of the laws and regulations governing Coin.mx and [the credit union] — put his own ambition and greed above all else in order to make money,” prosecutors said. “In the process, Murgio took advantage of the trust and loyalty of individuals closest to him, made corrupt payments to a pastor, repeatedly lied to banks and the NCUA, and ultimately contributed to the collapse of a federal credit union. Such blatant criminal conduct cannot be condoned or dismissed as the work of an overzealous and misguided entrepreneur.”The U.S. Department of Justice said that Murgio unabashedly and knowingly helped hackers and other cyber crooks turn the anonymous digital currency into cash, and two co-defendants described him as a “smooth-talking, charismatic hustler” who really ran things. His lawyers have said he was just a forward-thinking entrepreneur who made some big mistakes, cut too many legal corners and remains “a quintessential American businessman.” But federal prosecutors sought to swat that logic down Tuesday.Far from being a classic American striver, Murgio has consistently lacked respect for the law, they argued. Although an unrelated tax evasion charge against him ended without a conviction, prosecutors said, he began working on Coin.mx while he was out on bail in that case and should have been staying out of trouble. They also unearthed a bankruptcy judge’s 2013 conclusion that he lied about his income and tried to have tenants of condominiums he owned cut their checks to a company he owned.“A guidelines sentence would do what these prior brushes with the law failed to do — deter Murgio from committing crimes again in the future and instill in him an appropriate respect for the law,” the government’s sentencing memorandum said.Murgio’s father was sentenced to probation earlier this year. Two other co-defendants were convicted by a jury in March.Three men, including former Coin.mx owner Gery Shalon, have been separately charged with a gargantuan cybercrime featuring a pump-and-dump securities fraud augmented by an unprecedented hack of 83 million JPMorgan Chase & Co . customers. Plea negotiations are ongoing in that case.A lawyer for Murgio did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.The prosecution is represented by Eun Young Choi, Daniel S. Noble and Won S. Shin of the U.S. Department of Justice.Murgio is represented by Brian E. Klein of Baker Marquart LLP and Robert A. Soloway of Rothman Schneider Soloway & Stern LLP.The case is U.S. v.

Data from the professional networking site LinkedIn has shown that blockchain related job postings have tripled in the last 12 months. This shows that there is a high demand for blockchain experts as the potential and applicability of blockchain technology becomes more apparent to corporations. Recognizing this opportunity, several universities have added blockchain studies to their fields of study to tailor their educational offerings to these new developments in the job market.\n\n\n\nThe University of Edinburgh, for example, has recently announced the launch of a blockchain technology laboratory within its School of Informatics through a collaboration with technology startup Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). The new lab will focus primarily on blockchain studies. However, related interdisciplinary research will be also encouraged.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the blockchain technology lab, IOHK Co-Founder, Jeremy Wood stated: “IOHK’s partnership with the University of Edinburgh provides unique opportunities for current students to become the next generation of blockchain and cryptography leaders. As a headquarters for IOHK’s international academic research community, we expect to see the university facilitate innovative projects that drive how businesses and governments approach blockchain and cryptocurrencies.”\n\nThe University of Edinburgh now joins a small but growing list of educational institutions that are including courses on blockchain technology in their curricula.\n\nThough the University of Edinburgh is the first to offer a blockchain course of this kind in the United Kingdom, universities in the U.S. have already been doing so for a while. Stanford University began offering a course on cryptocurrencies, blockchains and smart contracts two years ago, while the University of California, Berkeley also offers a blockchain course.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is in the process of developing a course on the subject matter, while the University of Nicosia in Cyprus is offering the world’s first MSc in Digital Currency. The master's degree covers all key areas of digital currencies such as regulation, cryptography and blockchain technology applications. Students can even pay the tuition fees for the degree in bitcoin.\n\nThere are also a number of online courses created to cater to the rising demand for blockchain expertise. Princeton University has partnered with online learning platform Coursera to provide an intensive 11-week course on bitcoin and cryptocurrency technology.\n\nThe Blockchain University and the B9lab also offer blockchain and cryptocurrency courses designed to cater to professionals who are seeking to improve their knowledge and have a competitive edge in the industry.\n\nThe CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4) includes Andreas Antonopoulos, Vitalik Buterin, Pamela Morgan, Josh McDougall and Michael Perklin on its board of directors. It offers cryptocurrency courses and provides participants with professional certificates upon completion. Certified Bitcoin Professional (CBP), Certified Bitcoin Expert (CBE), and Certified Ethereum Developer (CED) are the three professional certifications available.\n\nThe rise in blockchain related courses both online and in leading educational institutions is a testament to growing confidence in the technology's ability to disrupt industry in the future. Blockchain technology is now being recognized as an applicable solution to real world business challenges and that is reflected in both the job market as well as in educational courses on offer."", 'Things are starting to get interesting again in the bitcoin price. After what turned out to be a pretty heavy correction, we had a pretty solid bounce at the start of this week, and this bounce now looks to have turned into a full-blown recovery. The correction has been on our minds for quite some time now, with financial assets generally unable to avoid some degree of a downturn on the back of an upside one; especially one to the degree with which Bitcoin moved over the last couple of months. We did not expect the correction to be quite so severe, however (but, then again, we didn’t really know what to expect), and we have had to use our breakout strategy as a sort of hedge strategy (as opposed to a pure profit strategy) whilst the correction matured. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it could be worse, after all. However, it is good to get a return to the upside action and, with it, the ability to draw profit both from a long-term holding and a short-term momentum perspective.\n\nWith all that said, here is a look at what we are focusing on in the bitcoin price this morning and where we intend to get in and out of the markets according to the rules of our intraday strategy. As ever, take a quick look at the chart below before we get started.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range we are focusing on for this morning’s session is defined by support to the downside at 2723 and resistance to the upside at 2750. Standard breakout rules apply today, so we will initially look for a close above resistance to validate an immediate upside target of 2780. Conversely, a close below support will have us in short towards a downside target of 2700 flat. Stop losses on both positions will ensure we are taken out of the trades in the event of a bias reversal.\n\nCharts courtesy of Trading View\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Only from 2009-2010 did virtual currency stage some form of a win, in the form of a still-nascent Bitcoin increase of around 4,000 percent.\n\n“Amazon rose more than 6,000% in its first two years after its public offering,” the publication reflects, noting nonetheless that “18 years later the peak price from back then looks cheap by comparison today.”\n\n“Surprisingly, Bitcoin’s performance in its first two years only achieved two-thirds of Amazon’s original run-up,” it continues.\n\n“The recent price appreciation of Bitcoin over the last two years and the price of Etherium (sic) since its initial coin offering have both made dramatic gains, but have yet to match Amazon’s meteoric rise.”\n\nThe global giant has, meanwhile, begun working with Blockchain startups, collaborating with Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group as a member of DCG Connect “dedicated to helping enterprises accelerate from blockchain exploration to production.”', 'Blockchain, the London-based bitcoin currency service provider, has raised $40 million of fresh funding, representing one of the largest investment rounds in the financial technology sector since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.\n\nNew investors in the company, which provides technology such as virtual bitcoin wallets and analytical tools for the digital currency’s underlying system, include Google’s GV, which led the funding with Lakestar. Existing investors, including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sir Richard Branson, provided new financing.\n\n“The pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched,” said Tom Hulme, a partner at GV. “We were impressed by Blockchain’s consistent market traction and dedication to building secure financial products for an increasing number of users.”\n\nBitcoin, and the blockchain system that powers it, is one of several virtual currencies and the value of one bitcoin skyrocketed more than 300 percent in the last year. A competing currency, Ether, based on the ethereum blockchain, reached a record $402 earlier this month.\n\nBlockchain Chief Executive Officer and co-Founder Peter Smith said his company’s new funding was raised before bitcoin and ether’s recent run up. ""We did it a few months ago,"" he told Caroline Hyde in an interview on Bloomberg Television Thursday.\n\nWhile it has been accepted for legitimate transactions by companies such as Microsoft Corp., Expedia Inc. and social media platform Reddit, it is also a favorite tool for criminals seeking ways of anonymously sending and receiving money, such as during the May WannaCry ransomware attack that affected countless businesses and hospitals worldwide.\n\nIn a press release, Blockchain said its new investment will support a wider global expansion and related localization efforts, as well as further research and development for its product.\n\n“The 14 trillion dollar financial services industry hasn’t meaningfully changed in over a century,” said Smith in the release. “Blockchain is on a mission to create a financial system that is faster, more inclusive, and radically different than the status quo.”\n\nBlockchain had previously raised $30.5 million in 2014.', 'Bitcoin has been making its way into the news and into legal discussion for the past couple years and more so now as its value continues to rise. Bitcoin is a decentralized, virtual, form of currency, created in 2009. Bitcoin is decentralized because it is not monitored, controlled, or administered by any legal or governmental entity. Over the past six months the price of Bitcoin has tripled in value despite daily fluctuations of up to $300.\n\nA recent news article, You can’t hold a bitcoin, but the web currency’s value has skyrocketed. Why?, states:\n\nThe rise comes in spite of headwinds. U.S. regulators have sent confusing signals about their views on bitcoin. The Internal Revenue Service sees bitcoin as a form of property, while the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the Treasury Department views it as a virtual currency that is a gift to money launderers. Adding to the confusion, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has ruled that bitcoins and other digital currencies are commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected two different exchange traded funds based on bitcoin in March, asserting that bitcoin markets are largely unregulated and thus subject to fraud and manipulation.\n\nIn 2014, the IRS made the decision to classify Bitcoin and virtual currencies as a form of property. The IRS stated, “For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.” And, in response to a whether a taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must include, in computing gross income, the fair-market value of the virtual currency, the IRS stated: “Yes. A taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must, in computing gross income, include the fair market value of the virtual currency, measured in U.S. dollars, as of the date that the virtual currency was received. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on miscellaneous income from exchanges involving property or services.” Further remarks in response to frequently asked questions can be found here.\n\nIn addition to the above cited agencies’ treatment of virtual currency and bitcoin, many other areas of the law still need to assess how to treat this virtual currency – one of which is Bankruptcy. In an article from the Emory Bankruptcy Developments Journal, Chelsea Deppert addresses the need for bankruptcy courts to decide what to do with Bitcoins:\n\nBecause the Code affords different protections to assets classified as a currency and assets classified as a commodity, the determination of whether bitcoin is a currency or a commodity will dictate bitcoins’ treatment in bankruptcy. If bitcoins were classified as currency, bitcoin transactions would receive greater protections, including certain immunities from both the automatic stay and being deemed a constructive fraudulent transfer. On the other hand, if bitcoins were classified as a commodity, the Code would not automatically afford such protections, generally only extending substantial protections to those bitcoin transactions that constitute a ‘forward contract.’ A ‘forward contract’ is made in the limited circumstances when the parties to a bitcoin transaction contractually agree that the bitcoins will be delivered at least two days before their payment is due.\n\nTo date, there has not been a bankruptcy case clearly and definitively classifying Bitcoin as either currency or commodity.\n\nWatching the development of Bitcoin in various legal fields will be both a necessary and fruitful endeavor as it continues to gain popularity and value.\n\nNot a Westlaw subscriber? Sign-up for a free trial today.\n\nImage credit: REUTERS/Benoit Tessier', 'Amid what appears to be widespread fatigue among traditional investors, excitement is booming in the wild, wild west of cybercurrencies right now.\n\nOver on Reddit, one forum dweller said they were ready to drop $20,000 into bitcoin BTCUSD, +5.40% — after doing some research and concluding the only way was up for the crypto cash. It beats “$20k sitting in a safe-deposit box,” the poster said.\n\n“Only invest what you are willing to lose,” was one response.\n\nFor those who are willing, Rupert Hargreaves, blogging for ValueWalk, offers up a “less volatile way” to bet on cryptocurrencies over just buying bitcoin or ethereum -- though there’s still plenty of risk involved. He says there’s big money being made on cybercurrencies... and where there’s an opportunity, there are hedge funds.\n\nHargreaves took a deep dive into the Crypto-Currency Fund Index from Eurekahedge. The data firm uses the index to track the performance of five actively managed hedge funds with holdings in bitcoin, ethereum and other digital cash.\n\nHis findings? The Eurekahedge index not only beat traditional hedge funds, it even blew bitcoin itself out of the water.\n\nBetween June 2013 and April this year, the index shows eye-popping cumulative returns of 2,152.32%, versus 1,408.11% for the Bitcoin Price Index. Looked at annually, that’s a return of 125.35%, compared with 102.96%.\n\nIt should be noted that while “less volatile” than a straight play on bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, the level of volatility for the index itself “is off the chart,” Hargreaves notes in his blog post.\n\nIn its report on performance, Eurekahedge said that “over a period of 14 months between December 2013 and January 2015, the Eurekahedge Crypto-Currency Fund Index lost almost 73% of its value from its 2013 high. In contrast, the Bitcoin Price Index lost almost 81% of its value,” according to Hargreaves.\n\nWhether we’re on the edge of a South Sea Bubble or greatness for the cybercurrency faithful, bitcoin and its pals have been bringing the drama.\n\nPopular rival ethereum suffered a flash crash Wednesday, plunging from more than $317 to briefly trade as low as 10 cents in a flash cash on the GDAX exchange before rebounding. In a post, GDAX Vice President Adam White said a “multimillion-dollar market sell” order was placed on GDAX’s ETH-USD [ethereum-U.S. dollar] order book, which resulted in orders being filled from $317.81 to $224.48—for a slippage of 29.4%. That, in turn, began a cascade of around 800 stop-loss orders and margin-funding liquidations, which sent the price temporarily as low as a dime, he explained.\n\nJust a day in the life of a brave new world.\n\nCheck out: How big is bitcoin, really? This chart puts it all in perspective', 'Bitcoin price completed its correction to the channel support and bulls are now setting their sights back on resistance.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price retreated to the ascending channel support and area of interest marked in the previous article.\n\nThis support held as expected, allowing bitcoin to rebound to the 38.2% Fibonacci extension level.\n\nThe next extension levels give an idea of how high price could go if the uptrend carries on.\n\nBitcoin price completed its correction to the channel support and bulls are now setting their sights back on resistance.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA on the 1-hour time frame so the path of least resistance is to the upside. In addition, the short-term moving average lined up with the channel support, adding to its strength as a floor in the event of another dip.\n\nThe Fibonacci extension tool reveals that the next ceiling could be around the $2800 mark or the previous highs. A larger rally could last until the channel resistance around $2850 or to the full extension just slightly above the $2900 mark.\n\nHowever, stochastic is already turning lower from the overbought zone to indicate a return in selling momentum. RSI also seems to be heading south as well, so bitcoin price might follow suit, even without indicating overbought conditions. Still, the gap between the moving averages is getting wider to reflect a buildup in bullish momentum.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nThe Ethereum flash crash in GDAX may have sparked some jitters in the cryptocurrency market but this seems to have shored up demand for other competitors like bitcoin. Uncertainties related to Brexit are also encouraging European traders to put funds in bitcoin to pursue higher returns outside of traditional stocks or commodities.\n\nMeanwhile, news that India is moving closer to regulating Bitcoin has been positive for startups and investors in the country. This was also supported by news that a Bitcoin wallet startup called Blockchain has received $40 million in funding to expand its operations to more countries.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

However, Ayre also noted that monopolies “are also not the best at delivering product to consumers,” and thus there will always be a role for other operators, including internationally licensed online gambling sites, in the Canadian market.\n\nAyre believes international gambling sites subject to external regulatory oversight can actually offer Canadian gamblers a greater degree of security than provincial monopoly sites like BCLC’s PlayNow.com, because the monopolies have a contradictory dual role as both operator and regulator.\n\nProvincial gambling monopoly execs love to tag international gambling sites with the pejorative ‘unregulated’ tag, but Ayre says the monopolies’ inherent conflict of interest between regulatory oversight and the need to produce profits for government coffers means BCLC better fits the definition of an “unregulated operator.”\n\nAyre, who has always approached the gambling business from the point of view of the consumer, believes that when governments decide to create a gaming industry, they also need to decide “whether they’re doing it for their interest or for the needs of consumers.” Ayre says there is “consistent” evidence across all business sectors that government monopolies “do not deliver value to consumers.”\n\nAyre suggests a better way forward would be for governments to allow proper third-party regulation of their own operations, then open up their markets to private sector operators to ensure consumers derive the benefits of a truly competitive marketplace. Ayre doesn’t believe governments would be foregoing any revenue by taking this path as taxes on private operator gaming would provide an additional revenue stream.\n\nAyre is also a staunch advocate for the online gambling industry’s adoption of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and the Blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin use, and he views the “trustless” nature of Bitcoin Blockchain transactions leading to significant changes ahead for gaming regulators like BCLC.\n\nWhile Ayre insists there will always be a role for gaming regulators, Ayre sees them becoming “less relevant” as Bitcoin continues to “eat the online gaming industry.”\n\nComments', 'A bitcoin-focused pyramid scheme may have targeted Buddhist meditation practitioners in Thailand, according to a local news outlet.\n\nIn a report from English-language media source The Nation, members of a Buddhist temple in the town of Uttaradit were said to have been approached with offers to invest in bitcoin. The temple-goers were allegedly promised handsome profits if they invested ""at least 38,000 baht"" (an amount worth roughly $1,100 at press time), including a doubling of that return if they attracted other investors.\n\nA representative of the group filed a report with Thailand\'s Department of Special Investigation (DSI), prompting the first stages of an investigation over concerns it might be a pyramid scheme, in which early investors are paid out with the proceeds from new ones.\n\nAs many as 800 practitioners from Uttaradit, Pathum Thani and Chiang Mai have contributed to the fund, the report said. While no one from the group has confirmed any loss so far, the DSI said the promise was ""too good to be true"" and that it will investigate to ""check whether the operation is illegal"".\n\nThe case is not the first possible digital currency-based scam to emerge in Thailand.

But there is currently no timetable for this, and the bank seems to be proceeding cautiously.\n\nNonetheless the test is a significant step. It shows that China is seriously exploring the technical, logistical, and economic challenges involved in deploying digital money, something that could ultimately have broad implications for its economy and for the global financial system.\n\nA digital fiat currency—one backed by the central bank and with the same legal status as a banknote—would lower the cost of financial transactions, thereby helping to make financial services more widely available. This could be especially significant in China, where millions of people still lack access to conventional banks. A digital currency should also be cheaper to operate, and ought to reduce fraud and counterfeiting.\n\nEven more significantly, a digital currency would give the Chinese government greater oversight of digital transactions, which are already booming. And by making transactions more traceable, this could also help reduce corruption, which is a key government priority. Such a currency could even offer real-time economic insights, which would be enormously valuable to policymakers. And finally, it might facilitate cross-border transactions, as well as the use of the renminbi outside of China because the currency would be so easy to obtain.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads Our guide to stories in the archives that put technology in perspective.

Bitcoin’s distributed ledger of transactions, known as a blockchain, makes it possible for it to operate without any central authority.\n\nChina is not the only country interested in overhauling its currency. This year India eliminated some banknotes in an effort to reduce tax evasion and illegal income. And while some other central banks, including the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bundesbank, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, are studying digital fiat currencies, China’s test appears to be the first of its kind anywhere in the world.\n\nOne of the main concerns voiced by other central banks looking at digital fiat currencies is that they could undermine the commercial banking system by making it possible for anyone to have an account with the central bank.\n\nChina’s digital currency is designed to avoid this problem. In a paper published in Tsinghua Financial Review, an academic journal, and posted online recently, Yao Qian, deputy director of the Technology Department of the People’s Bank of China, wrote that a digital currency could be integrated into the existing banking system, with commercial banks operating digital wallets for the central bank’s currency.\n\nAnd while other countries have proposed following Bitcoin’s architecture and many of the largest banks in the world are experimenting with it, the currency developed by the People’s Bank of China is also different in design.\n\nYao writes that the currency would only use a distributed ledger in a limited way. A blockchain might not be used to process transactions, as this could prove an insurmountable bottleneck for a currency with such a huge transaction volume as the renminbi. But such a distributed ledger might be used to periodically check who owns what. “The ownership of digital currency can be verified directly by the issuing bank, so as to realize peer-to-peer cash transaction[s],” Yao writes.\n\nOfficials from the People’s Bank of China declined to provide any official comment on the development of the digital currency or plans for its use.\n\nThere may be good reason to proceed slowly. For all the excitement over digital currencies, Bitcoin is experiencing technical problems as it grows more popular, and the community of developers behind the currency is beset by infighting over its future direction. Bitcoin’s value has also oscillated wildly in recent years (as of writing, the value of a bitcoin is $2,662, more than double its value in March). A number of other cryptocurrencies have emerged, and blockchain technology is being explored as a way to track all sorts of different things.\n\nStill, a less decentralized currency under the control of the central bank has significant appeal. “In a place like China, they may see an opportunity to catch up with other countries; to adopt new technology; and maybe even overtake people,” says Simon Johnson, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management who studies monetary innovation and who previously served as the chief economist for the International Monetary Fund.\n\nJohnson notes that China is already at the vanguard of experimentation in mobile payments and digital money, which has driven economic growth. “There’s a lot of innovation in the private sector with things like Alipay,” he says. “And China is also the biggest user of Bitcoin, as far as we can determine.”\n\nJohnson adds that China may be the right place for an official digital currency to take off. “There’s this confluence of being at the front of the technology, getting some advantages for their payments system, and developing some jobs,” he says."", 'The United States Senate has introduced a bill that would require all travelers entering the U.S. to declare digital currency holdings in excess of $10,000. Despite concerns raised by the invasive nature of the bill, the likelihood of it being passed is extremely low simply due to the incredibly challenging infrastructure that would be required.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the new bill is actually a reintroduction of an older bill that was originally introduced in 2011. The 2011 bill never made it out of sub-committee deliberation.\n\nSpeaking about the recent legislation development, David Siegel, founder of Twenty Thirty AG and Bitcoin enthusiast, tells Bitcoin Magazine, “It’s disappointing. It’s a step back toward 1934.”\n\nThe bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Secretary and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner to submit a joint report to Congress withinthat meets the following two conditions over 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act:\n\n“(1) detailing a strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States; and;\n\n(2) that includes an assessment of infrastructure needed to carry out the strategy ...”\n\nThe amount of technology that would have to be developed in order to enforce this law is incredible. How could they detect these crypto assets? The infrastructure investment that would be needed would be quite prodigious.\n\n“My position on regulation is that there should be strong evidence supporting its effectiveness,” says Siegel. “I don’t see declaring moving money as a transparency issue, so I would say it’s a strong step in the wrong direction. I think regulation should be scaled way back to the point where we can show it’s actually better than no regulation.”\n\nThe bill, S.1241, would add “prepaid access devices” under the definition of U.S. monetary instruments in section 5312, title 31, of the U.S. Code. Specifically, a “‘prepaid access device’ means an electronic device or vehicle, such as a card, plate, code, number, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number, or other instrument, that provides a portal to funds or the value of funds that have been paid in advance and can be retrievable and transferable at some point in the future.”\n\nThese prepaid access devices, in theory, could extend to include electronic ledgers, cryptocurrency wallets and even private keys. These are all portals where individuals can gain access to their private funds. Thus, individuals with more than $10,000 worth of crypto assets tied up on the blockchain would have to declare their crypto net worth to the U.S. Government by filling out a Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments, often called the FinCEN105. This could have a serious impact on digital currency holders traveling to the United States. Punishment for not reporting could include up to five years of jail time and forfeiture of those funds in the form of criminal and civilian penalties.\n\nFormally known as the “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017,” the bill was introduced on May 25, 2017, by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and is co-sponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). It has been referred to the Committee on the Judiciary for further deliberation, but has a tremendous number of obstacles that must be overcome before reaching the President’s desk for final approval.', 'The global remittance industry’s blockchain-based startups got a boost recently at the Remittance Technology (RemTECH) awards held at the United Nations in New York, from June 16 to 18 as part of the UN Global Forum on Remittances, Investment and Development.\n\n\n\nOf the 11 award-winning remittance companies, five startups built on the blockchain were winners. The entries were judged on price, speed, the onboarding of enterprise clients (for white label solutions) and seamless delivery.\n\nThe aim of the RemTECH awards is to showcase the most innovative and outstanding ideas, models and projects designed to improve remittance services worldwide by improving transparency, speed, cost and reliability for companies and end-users that send and receive remittances.\n\nHugo Cuevas-Mohr, Director of the RemTECH Awards, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“Even though large money transfer companies still don’t see the importance of the breakthroughs of blockchain-based and Bitcoin remittance startups, the RemTECH Judging Panel was impressed by some of the solutions presented by companies like Bitso and Everex, just to name two of them.”\n\n“The Awards gave new blockchain startups a chance to shine in the spotlight of the United Nations Forum where the public and private sector met to discuss the challenges of the remittance industry. At IMTC (International Money Transfer Conferences) we are striving to create this dialog of incumbents and fintech firms to work together and create win-win partnerships. It’s not easy but it is happening,” added Cuevas-Mohr.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain services AirPocket, Bitso, Everex, Moneytis and Trulioo took home the following awards:\n\nRemittances and Financial Inclusion: AirPocket\n\nAirPocket, built on the Bitcoin blockchain, serves Latin America with tens of thousands of payout locations and is supported by the top banks in each country.\n\nPioneering Spirit: Bitso\n\nMexican bitcoin exchange Bitso, which raised $2.5 million last September, has been working with Canadian payments startup Paycase to create a new remittance corridor between the two countries and send funds from bank accounts in Canada to Mexico.\n\nMost Innovative Service: Moneytis\n\nBitcoin blockchain-based Moneytis aims to offer the lowest possible fees to help empower unbanked groups in the developing world. They also have a notification service that monitors all exchange rates in real-time and sends alerts when a significant change happens.\n\nPotential for Growth: Trulioo\n\nTrulioo is a Canadian blockchain-based financial technology company that in addition to remittance services, offers identity verification services for businesses and organizations worldwide using government and private databases.\n\nService Originality: Everex\n\nEverex was the only Ethereum-based platform nominated. In addition to its contributions to remittance services, Everex has also developed a system for placing national currencies on the blockchain. By doing so, Everex allows people living in cash-based societies to earn a public financial reputation.\n\n“The judges knew about Ethereum, and were excited by the ongoing experiments taking place on the network by individual users, small businesses and multinational corporations,” said Alexi Lane, CEO of Everex, in a statement. “This technology will transform the remittance industry and increase financial inclusion everywhere.”\n\nGreta Geankoplis, a CEO and IMTC (International Money Transfer & Payments Conferences) advisor and entrepreneur who has developed blockchain systems and technology, co-chaired the judges panel. She told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“Blockchain (and some Bitcoin specifically) platform-based companies competed shoulder to shoulder with older technology for delivering cross-border value to diverse customers in widely varying environments.\n\nBut this is just the beginning. Blockchain platforms in the $700 billion remittance industry holds the promise of leveraging many other needed services in the fastest growing markets: mobile based, micro insurance, loans, education, and remote healthcare to name a few.”\n\nOther blockchain-based companies that were nominated for a RemTECH award included Bitex, Cashaa, DigitalX and OKLink.']"
06/23/2017,"['To some people, Bitcoin is an experiment that can end in one of two ways: it will either fulfill its promise to become the “Internet of Money” or it will die a fiery death at the hands of regulators.\n\nBut what about a third option, in which a rival like Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin?\n\nThe rise and rise of Ether\n\nEther, the native coin of Ethereum, has risen more than 5,000 percent in 2017. It peaked at $396.40. Investors first attributed the surge in the Ethereum price to its faster platform, which processes transactions more quickly than Bitcoin’s. But it turns out that transaction times are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nSmart contracts, initial coin offerings (ICOs), variable block sizes - the evidence is overwhelmingly in Ethereum’s corner, regardless of what you might hear from so-called purists within the Bitcoin community. Even major institutions are siding with Ethereum. For instance, the Central Bank of Russia is currently testing an Ethereum fork for its own monetary system. This will effectively create the world’s first national cryptocurrency, a service that Bitcoin is incapable of providing.\n\nSome in the community argue this unchangeability is precisely what protects Bitcoin price. To them, Blockchain technology only exists in service to Bitcoin to the singular vision of a decentralized currency.\n\nCan Bitcoin emerge as a global digital currency?\n\nThis question is hotly contested, even by futurists like Ray Kurzweil. The famous head of Google’s engineering lab recently said that Bitcoin’s instability is a serious threat to its monetary ambitions.\n\n“Currencies like the dollar have provided reasonable stability,” said Kurzweil. “Bitcoin has not. And it’s not clear to me that the whole mining paradigm can provide that type of stability.”\n\nWhen he talks about stability, Kurzweil is referring to the kind of short-term volatility that is associated with risky investments. Currencies are not supposed to follow these roller coaster-like patterns. They are not supposed to lose 10 percent of their value in a day, as Bitcoin has done on a regular basis. They should, instead, keep fairly steady for a long while. Put another way, today’s price should be tomorrow’s.\n\nThat is how currencies establish credibility and secure buy-in from the population at large. If the general public believes that tomorrow’s price is going to be drastically different, it can lose faith in the currency and that would be disastrous.\n\nWhatever existential criticisms that might exist of the US dollar, few people would argue that tomorrow is a concern for the Greenback. Bitcoin cannot boast similar reliability. Its price is an open question from one day to the next.\n\nEthereum casts a wider net than just money\n\nWhat happens if we shelve this idea of a global digital currency? Does Blockchain technology become irrelevant? Of course not. It actually becomes far more relevant.\n\nTake, for instance, a study from the Energy Web Foundation (EWF) in partnership with a Blockchain startup called Grid Singularity. The study shows 200 use cases for Blockchain technology in the energy sector, including ones for renewable energy certificates, peer-to-peer energy sharing networks and customer billing.\n\n10 major energy firms have joined the EWF in order to take advantage of these applications. However, none of them can be executed on Bitcoin’s platform. The EWF had to turn to Ethereum’s smart contracts for these particular services, which speaks to my earlier point: Ethereum casts a wider net than Bitcoin.\n\nIt fulfills the true potential of Blockchain technology by expanding beyond money, beyond Bitcoin, into everything else. More and more innovators will be drawn to Ethereum’s smart contracts, ICOs and faster transaction speeds. As a natural result, they have to use Ether tokens on the platform, suggesting that ETH prices will continue to skyrocket.\n\nBy Gaurav S.

However, it appears that the evolving stance of regulators globally prompted the Indian government to act in this regard.\n\nIn April 2017, the Ministry of Finance had constituted a committee to examine the existing framework around Virtual Currencies (VCs). The committee will not just examine the present status of VCs in India and around the globe, but will also suggest measures to deal with consumer protection and money laundering. The panel will make its recommendations by the end of next month. The government even welcomed public opinion on the issue, and received 3,889 comments. (See also: More Billionaires Are Buying Cryptocurrencies)\n\nNow an official speaking with Moneycontrol has said that a ban on Bitcoin is a remote possibility, because of the lack of data on traders, but legalizing the currency seems equally unlikely. Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of India’s leading Bitcoin exchange Zebpay, told Investopedia, “We are cautious but optimistic that the government recognizes the need to regulate bitcoins and virtual currencies. We recognize that it’s a challenging task for any government. We look forward to engaging with the task force setup to give our recommendations.”\n\nBumpy Road\n\nBitcoin hasn't seen much acceptance from officials in India so far. The Reserve Bank of India touched upon virtual currencies back in June 2013 in a report on financial sector regulation and infrastructure. It said, “Globally, the use of online and mobile technologies is driving the proliferation of virtual banks, virtual currencies and provision of banking and payment services by unlicensed entities. While leveraging on technology has resulted in many benefits, especially, in extending the reach of the financial services, these developments pose challenges in the form of regulatory, legal and operational risks.”\n\nWith time, its stance firmer as six months later in December it issued an advisory which read, “RBI cautions users of Virtual Currencies against Risks.” Things got worse when a raid was carried out by a team of Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials just a couple of days after RBI’s advisory. The raid was carried on BuySellBitcoin on the pretext that Bitcoin trading practices were violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) rules.\n\nBitcoin bounced back with self-regulated trading platforms. Today, Zebpay, Unocoin and Coinsecure operate in India by implementing and following Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) guidelines. One very important part of this movement is no-cash transactions for Bitcoin. This has helped these platforms ensure that money is coming into the cryptocurrency only via totally transparent mechanisms (such as bank transfers). RBI repeated its warning in February 2017. (See also: Fundraising By Bitcoin Startups in India)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile the submission of the report is a month away, we're bound to see more speculation about its contents in the weeks to come. Considering the potential benefits that these cryptocurrencies bring, such as financial inclusion, remittance transfers, blockchain\u200b technology, at a time when the government is providing a boost to the digital payment network in the country, an adverse scenario for VCs in India seems unlikely. However, the need to combat terrorism and concern regarding AML practices may prevent regulators from giving it a legal status. Going forward, the committee may monitor the developments in the cryptocurrency\u200b space before adopting a definitive stance. Meanwhile, more compliance requirements for entities acting an exchanges or using bitcoin may emerge."", 'There has been a lot of speculation in cryptocurrencies so far in 2017, that much is for sure.\n\nBitcoin, the most popular, is already up almost 200% in 2017 alone. Others, like Ethereum, have also been catching fire this year.\n\nBut it\'s not just cryptocurrencies on the run. Stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are finding momentum too, TheStreet\'s founder Jim Cramer, who also manages the Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust portfolio, said on CNBC\'s ""Mad Dash"" segment.\n\nThese companies make the chips that are necessary to ""mine"" cryptocurrencies. For now, both companies are receiving big orders for more chips. Knowing that demand is strong for AMD and Nvidia chips because of cryptocurrencies, investors are gobbling up the stocks, Cramer said.\n\nInvestors shouldn\'t buy Nvidia and AMD for this reason, but that\'s not stopping people from doing it, Cramer reasoned.\n\nFor those that want to buy, there are reasons beside cryptocurrency madness to own them, he added. Nvidia is doing great work in self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and GPU sales. AMD is the top pick in gaming chips.\n\nThe rally in cryptocurrencies is breathtaking, but it\'s not sustainable, Cramer concluded.\n\nAMD rose 1.3% to $14.35 on Monday morning, and Nvidia was up 1.2% to $155.61.\n\nVisit here for the latest business headlines.\n\nDon\'t miss these top stories from TheStreet:\n\nEditors\' pick: Originally published June 23.', 'MGT Capital, the company run by John McAfee, said it would start to mine Ethereum — the bitcoin rival that has surged nearly 4,000% this year — in its latest bid to turn a profit.\n\n\n\nMGT, which is publicly traded over the counter, has pitched itself to investors mostly as a cybersecurity company. Cybersecurity is where McAfee made his mark as the founder of the antivirus company that bears his name.\n\n\n\nBut McAfee has more recently started to tout cryptocurrencies. He said last month that investments in bitcoin would help put MGT back in the black by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nEthereum is like bitcoin in that it can be ""mined"" by computers that solve complex computations. MGT said Friday that it reached an agreement with Bit5ive LLC to buy up to 60 graphics-processor-based mining computers to help mine for ether.\n\n""We are more convinced each day of the growth and value of digital currencies, and our company is uniquely positioned to be a leading provider of processing power to relevant blockchains,"" McAfee said in the statement.\n\nMcAfee\'s foray into the cryptocurrency space comes when others have been sounding the alarm after a huge run-up in prices.\n\n\n\nIn early June, billionaire Mark Cuban said it was evident that bitcoin was a bubble, tweeting, ""When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $=bubble.""\n\nDays later, Goldman Sachs warned that bitcoin was looking ""heavy"" and that a drop to between $2,330 and $1,915 a coin was looking likely. Bitcoin put in a low of $2,076 just a day later after the scaling debate came back into focus as the bitcoin-mining firm Bitmain outlined its ""contingency plan"" for if a hard fork were to occur. Bitcoin has recouped those losses and now trades at $2,708.\n\nEthereum is up by 3,964% in 2017. As for MGT, its stock is up by 42% year-to-date.', 'Erik Finman made a bet with his parents that if he turned 18 and was a millionaire, they wouldn\'t force him to go to college. Thanks to his savvy investments in bitcoin and the current all-time high valuation, he won\'t have to get his degree.\n\n""I can proudly say I made it, and I\'m not going to college,"" Finman said.\n\nHe currently owns 403 bitcoins, which at the current $2,700 a coin puts his bitcoin value at $1.09 million. He also has smaller investments in other cryptocurrencies, including litecoin and ethereum.\n\nRead more from CNBC News.', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

The space is giddy right now.”\n\nLast month, a small team of computer engineers in Lithuania raised $14 million in 45 minutes by selling a coin, known as Mysterium, that is intended to give access to an encrypted online data service that is still being built.\n\nThe next day, a group of coders in the Bay Area pulled in $35 million in under 30 seconds of online fund-raising. The coders were offering Basic Attention Tokens, which will one day work on a new kind of ad-free web browser.\n\nThen this week, a team in Switzerland raised around $100 million for a coin that will be used on an online chat program that has not yet been released, known as Status.\n\nProponents of initial coin offerings hail them as a financial innovation that empowers developers and gives early investors a chance to share in the profits of a successful new enterprise. But where some see a new method of crowdfunding online projects, critics say the phenomenon is ripe for abuse and, in many cases, a violation of American securities law.\n\n“It’s exploitative and abusive of the investing public,” Preston Byrne, a technology lawyer specializing in virtual currencies, said about the offerings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast year, the first blockbuster coin offering, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, quickly raised more than $150 million. But the project blew up after a hacker manipulated the code and stole more than $50 million worth of digital currency. A number of other projects since then have been labeled scams.\n\nEven among supporters, many say there has been too much money pouring into unproven projects in recent months.\n\nFred Wilson, a founder of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, said he was “long term very bullish” on these new digital currencies. But he said, “We see many reasons to be cautious right now.”\n\n“There is a gold rush mentality in the sector right now and many people are doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons,” he said.\n\nUnderpinning the surge in initial coin offerings is a broader boom in digital money. Bitcoin and Ether, two of the most popular virtual currencies, have soared in value in recent months. And when entrepreneurs sell new coins, they are asking for payment in Bitcoin or Ether, not United States dollars.\n\nThis means that conventional banks and financial institutions are essentially shut out, allowing initial coin offerings to take place beyond the control of regulators.\n\nAmong the people tossing their money into the pot is Pete Sussman, 27, a software developer at a St. Louis company called Fusion Marketing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He used his Bitcoin first to invest in a project called BitShares. Then he bought into the Ethereum virtual currency, Ether. As the value of Ether soared over the last year, Mr. Sussman got a return of 1,000 percent on his original money.\n\nIn March, he used his Ether to buy a new virtual currency known as GNT, which was created as part of a project known as Golem, based in Poland. The value of GNT has jumped 3,000 percent in recent months, pushing the value of Mr. Sussman’s digital currency to over $200,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlong with GNT, other new tokens including Ark, Antshares and Spectrecoin have appreciated by more than 6,000 percent since they were issued.\n\nMr. Sussman has also had some bad moments along the way, such as the time that he sent what would now be $100,000 worth of Ether to a scammer who put up a fake digital address for another coin offering.\n\n“I was at work. I went to the bathroom and I tried to throw up but nothing came out,” Mr. Sussman said. “Then after a little bit, I went home and sulked.”\n\nWhen he told his co-workers about the experience, they did not warn him off the investments. Instead, they became excited about the trend. Now, half a dozen of his colleagues, including his boss, have a chat room where they discuss potential coin investments.\n\nThe projects selling coins come in several forms. Some are straightforward start-ups that design their coins like stock, with promised dividend payments if the company does well. Others are Bitcoin or Ethereum knockoffs, which the inventors sell in advance before launching to the public.\n\nBut most of the prominent projects are not traditional start-ups. Instead, the programmers are building online services similar to Wikipedia, which are intended to be open source and owned by no one.\n\nThe coins will become the internal payment method on these services once they are built — paying for computing power in the case of Golem, or file storage with a project called Storj. The sale of the coins will be used to compensate the programmers.\n\nEven some well-established Silicon Valley names are using coins to raise funds. Brendan Eich, a co-founder of the Mozilla web browser project, is developing a new browser called Brave.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was Mr. Eich who raised $35 million in just 30 seconds by selling millions of Basic Attention Tokens, or BAT, in late May. People using the Brave browser will be able to use their BAT to view web pages ad-free, and companies will be able to pay viewers for looking at ads. (The New York Times and other publishers have called Brave’s ad-blocking technology illegal.)\n\nThe hope with a token like BAT is that as more people use the browser and more advertisers want the coins, the coins will become more sought after and the users will benefit from the rising price. These so-called network effects can also encourage users to get their friends to use a service.\n\nMr. Eich said he was anticipating that all the people holding tokens “will drive millions of users to join our ecosystem.”\n\nThat is the dream. For now, several projects are raising millions without even having any computer code to test. And because of the lack of investor protections, the projects remain vulnerable to the whims of entrepreneurs, who could run away with their quick hauls of digital currency.\n\nThe most immediate problems could arise if regulators decide that the tokens being sold are unregistered securities, a violation of the law. An official with the Securities and Exchange Commission suggested at a conference last month that the agency was aware of the potential for problems and was looking at the market.\n\nFor at least some investors, such as Mr. Sussman, the possibility of big losses is the flip side of the big gains, and part of the allure.\n\n“It’s very Wild West,” he said. “It’s very easy to get into a situation where you can send things to a scammer very easily, and there is no recourse for it. That’s kind of the beauty of it, too.”"", 'Bitcoin has been soaring to new heights, and now folks on Change.org are calling on e-commerce juggernaut Amazon to accept the cryptocurrency as payment ""ASAP.""\n\nSince March 23, bitcoin has increased 159%, from a little over $1,000 to $2,700.\n\nAt least 2,100 petitioners on Change.org want Amazon to join companies such as Microsoft and Overstock in accepting bitcoin as a form of payment. They also want the company to accept litecoin, another cryptocurrency.\n\nThe petition cites the following reasons as to why it would be a good idea for Amazon to accept the two cryptocurrencies:\n\n""Low transaction costs""\n\n""Decentralized currency""\n\n""Low Inflation (Because of the finite supply of Bitcoins (this mostly benefits the consumer)""\n\n""Bitcoin is accessible to any person of any age, sex, demographic, etc. (it is extremely advantageous to citizens of crisis countries)""\n\n""Non-reversible payments (Extremely beneficial to reputable companies such as Amazon.com)""\n\n""Bitcoins are extremely secure (Bitcoins reside in an encrypted format on the wallet they are kept in)""\n\nBut Amazon might be skeptical about bitcoin, and for good reason. For starters, cryptocurrencies are known for their constant fluctuations in price. Ethereum, another cryptocurrency, flash crashed on Wednesday. It tumbled from about $296 to a low of $13 in a matter of minutes.\n\nMany people think a price correction is on the horizon for bitcoin. Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor, took to twitter on June 6 to say he thought there is a bitcoin ""bubble.""\n\nI think it\'s in a bubble. I just don\'t know when or how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $=bubble https://t.co/hTrV5DeWNd — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) June 6, 2017\n\nAdditionally, some don\'t view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as viable. Morgan Stanley, for instance, recently said that merchants don\'t think cryptocurrencies have a bright future. Here\'s Morgan Stanley:\n\nMost regulators and investors view cryptocurrencies more as assets than actual currencies. Their values are too volatile and too hard to actually use for payment for most to consider them currencies. Our conversations with some merchants indicate that, while cryptocurrencies might actually be attractive for them to operate their businesses, they find that the cryptocurrencies are far too volatile to be used.\n\nOther obstacles to bitcoin\'s future, according to the bank, include the Chinese crackdown on mining bitcoin and declining trading volumes.', 'We have come to the end of another week in our bitcoin price trading efforts and it is time to put together some levels with which we can get ahead of the markets during the early morning session out of Europe on Friday.\n\nThings have been pretty interesting this week.\n\nWe have seen some up and down action and – towards the end of the week – a reversal of the correction that we saw on the overarching upside bias that dominated across the last couple of months. Overnight last night, price did take a dip, and – while we said yesterday evening that we thought the correction had probably come to an end – chances are we are going to see this sort of jagged action temporarily as markets rebalance. As long as the troughs and dips come at us with a reasonable amount of sustained momentum, it doesn’t really matter. We can get in and out as and when price turns around, trade breakouts, and profit from the volatility. If things get choppy, we will have to bring our intrarange strategy to the table, but for now, we’re going to stick with breakout only.\n\nSo, with this noted, let’s get some key levels outlined for the session.\n\nTake a look at the chart below to get an idea of what is on and where we’re looking to get in and out of the markets according to the rules of our intraday strategy. It is a five-minute candlestick chart and it has our key range overlaid in blue.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range we are looking at for the session this morning is defined by support to the downside at 2688 and resistance to the upside at 2714.

06/24/2017,"['\'P4man\' is an active bitcoin miner and investor with an academic background in economy and IT. He has been a member of the online discussion forum Bitcoin Talk since September, 2011.\n\nIn this opinion piece, P4man looks at the cryptocurrency market to see if there is a credible alternative to bitcoin. Can ethereum cut the mustard?\n\nI\'ve been following (and holding) bitcoin since 2012. I admit that until recently, I\'ve largely ignored altcoins because none of the early cryptocurrencies offered any substantial advantage over bitcoin. At best, they were clones with a few minor tweaks, at worst, heavily pre-mined ""scamcoins"" primarily designed as a money grab scheme for developers and a few promoters.\n\nAfter seeing a few dozen of those, I had seen enough.\n\nBut today, due to the scaling issue, bitcoin is in a crisis, and altcoins have overtaken bitcoin in market cap. While many will consider me a lucky early bitcoin adopter, clearly, I\'m late to the altcoin party. So, it was long overdue that I took another look at this market to see if perhaps today there is a credible alternative to bitcoin or some promising coins to help me diversify my crypto investment.\n\nSo, I dove in, started reading and talking to people, to see what the buzz was about.\n\nLet me be clear, I don\'t claim to be an overnight expert in any of these coins now. I may have gotten some facts wrong, but I\'m going to give you my impressions. Take them for what they are worth.\n\nRepeating bitcoin\'s miracle growth\n\nFirst, a general observation. Many people I talked to say they invest in altcoins and ICOs because they feel they missed the boat with bitcoin and presume newly launched coins offer them a similar opportunity. This is a fallacy.\n\nWhen bitcoin was launched, no one knew for sure if cryptocurrency would even work at all. Few people believed it would ever gain traction and be understood and trusted by millions of people, let alone, become a multibillion-dollar phenomena. Even though I held bitcoin, you may count me among those early doubters. But that doubt was priced in.\n\nThat uncertainty over the core concept itself was the main reason that a pizza once cost 10,000 BTC.\n\nNow that the protocol itself has worked flawlessly for eight years, and the blockchain market as a whole achieved the recognition, penetration and value that it has, most of that doubt has evaporated. It\'s still early, but cryptographic blockchain technology has proven itself, and most people now believe it has significant potential.\n\nA new coin today may be unproven, but the concepts it is based on, are not.\n\nThat part of bitcoin\'s early and exponential value growth, which represents a shift from initial ridicule to increasing trust and understanding of blockchain technology, can never be repeated. You cannot turn back that clock and un-invent blockchain technology.\n\nMoreover, bitcoin wasn\'t launched through an ICO like almost altcoins these days. Bitcoin started off with a valuation of approximately zero. It took 4–5 years of proving itself, building trust and adoption for it to grow by dozens of thousands of percent, and only then reach the market cap of a typical ICO launch today.\n\nSo, a new coin today, simply cannot have the growth potential that bitcoin had in its earliest days, and you can\'t even get in at the same bottom price. If that is why you are investing in ICOs, then don\'t.\n\nOf course, that doesn\'t mean they can\'t substantially grow in value, so let\'s take a look at that.\n\nValuing cryptocurrencies\n\nThe overall crypto market has exploded this year, breaching $100bn recently.\n\nLet me be the first to freely admit I have no idea if this is a low or high valuation for current blockchain implementations. Good arguments can be made to value existing cryptocurrencies anywhere from a tiny fraction of their current market cap, to trillions of dollars.\n\nI\'m not even going to attempt to make a fiat-denominated value estimation. Your guess is as good mine. However, I do feel it\'s reasonable to make value comparisons between blockchains.\n\nTo do that, first we need to understand what functions give a cryptographic token value.\n\nHere are the functions I look at, in no particular order:\n\nValue as a transactional currency: To make or receive payments. Let\'s call this its \'PayPal\' function\n\nTo make or receive payments. Let\'s call this its \'PayPal\' function Value as a secure store of wealth: The ""electronic gold"" function\n\nThe ""electronic gold"" function Derived value: The value created indirectly by enabling certain functionality that can be external to the blockchain, like executing contracts or storing data.\n\nWeighing ether\n\nSpeculative value, isn\'t value. It\'s just speculation on future value. With that in mind, let\'s take a look at the most popular altcoin currently: ethereum.\n\nDespite a market cap that is almost on par with bitcoin, as a transactional currency, ethereum has not achieved much, if anything yet – I\'m ignoring ICOs for now. I will consider that as part of its derived value.\n\nCompared to the hundreds of thousands of online shops that accept bitcoin, ethereum is hardly used at all for online purchases, there is no merchant infrastructure, there are no payment providers like BitPay that I\'ve found and I see little evidence it\'s used for remittance or other transactional purposes.\n\nI’m also not convinced ethereum is well suited for this purpose. While bitcoin has an urgent scaling problem, making it currently less than ideal for (micro) transactions, the fix for this is relatively simple from a technological point of view – the problem is mostly political.\n\nDespite hearing many claims to the contrary, ethereum with its vastly more complex blockchain, has a much bigger scaling problem than bitcoin, that is yet to be solved, even in theory. Concepts exist to address this problem (""sharding"" etc), but those do not exist yet and may not even work.\n\nSo, in its current form, ethereum is not a viable alternative to bitcoin as a transactional currency, and it remains to be seen if it ever can be and will be.\n\nAs a store of wealth, ether faces even larger problems.\n\nDue to its complexity and by allowing code to run inside the blockchain, it creates a lot of potential for bugs and opens up attack vectors. This has already caused at least five hard forks and one blockchain split.\n\nFundamental properties are still being worked on, not just from an implementation perspective but conceptually. For instance, it\'s currently unknown what the future inflation rate will be, or even how the network will be protected (whether via proof-of-work or proof-of-stake).\n\nEverything seems to be in flux and under development. It\'s also difficult to trust a blockchain that has proven not to be immutable and rolls back transactions that are considered ""unfair"". All this just adds to the sense of uncertainty. For a store of wealth, nothing is more important than trust and predictability, and ethereum currently offers neither.\n\nEven if these major issues get resolved and clarified eventually, I\'m not convinced ethereum is even the right concept for a store of wealth. Intertwining store of value and such broad functionality in one complex, ever-changing blockchain, just doesn\'t make much sense to me.\n\nThat\'s no criticism of the project, as I don\'t believe ethereum was designed for this, nor do I see core developers make such claims.\n\nKing of functionality\n\nOn the contrary, it should be clear by now that ethereum\'s major appeal, and the only possible reasonable ground for its current valuation, should lie in its derived value. By focusing on smart contract functionality, ethereum does allow a wealth of functionality to run inside its blockchain, in a way that\'s currently very difficult or impossible to do with bitcoin or other blockchains.\n\nICOs are by far the most popular use case for this, and to its credit, ethereum has enabled hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of funding via this method. It\'s probably fair to say the ethereum\'s technology is what enabled most of the recent altcoin market explosion. This is indeed, quite an impressive achievement.\n\nThese ICOs drive demand for ether in two ways: First, most of the ICOs are priced in ether, so investors wanting to participate usually have to buy ether first. You could say ether does function as a transactional currency here, be it for a very specific application.\n\nSecondly, processing of smart contracts and private tokens on its blockchain have to be paid for in ""gas"", which really is just ether. This creates some demand for ether, even when projects implemented on ethereum use a private token, and only allow funding of that token with fiat money, as is the case, for instance, with the often referenced RWE electric vehicle charge station project.\n\nFirst, let\'s take a look at the gas. At the time of writing, the average daily use of gas was roughly 12bn and the average gas price was 0.000000022 ether. That means a total daily average of 260 ether (or around $100,000).\n\nFor comparison sake, bitcoin, which no sane person will claim derives its value primarily from transaction fees, averaged 400 BTC in daily transaction fees (or around $1m). If you think gas usage justifies ethereum\'s market cap, then bitcoin ought to be worth 10 times more, based on its arguably least-desirable metric alone.\n\nThat leaves us with the one remaining rational price driver that I can see for ethereum: financing ICOs. Clearly, this is a huge market. It\'s hard to fathom how large this market has become virtually overnight. The amount of capital being raised through ICOs is now roughly on par with Kickstarter!\n\nBut as basis for its current valuation, even that doesn\'t quite make sense, given that ethereum’s own current market cap is many times larger than all the ICOs it has ever helped finance.\n\nMoreover, the companies that launched ether-denominated ICOs are not likely to hold onto most of their ether for a very long time – they raised the money to finance their own development (of potentially competing tokens, no less). They will need to spend substantial portions of their ICO money to pay for services, salaries, offices, promotion, etc, and virtually none of that can be paid for in ether. So, they will need to sell their ether again.\n\nDanger ahead?\n\nThen there is the legal aspect: ethereum is breaking new ground.\n\nBy providing a platform for private tokens and smart contracts, it\'s blurring the line between virtual currencies and securities. In a way, this is exciting and certainly innovative. But, it\'s hard to see how at least some private tokens issued on the ethereum blockchain, could be considered anything other than unregistered securities that violate regulation in virtually every country.\n\nThis gives me a déjà vu, as I argued the same many years ago when bitcoin stock exchanges like GLBSE where all the rage.\n\nThose exchanges allowed the issuing and trading of unregistered, bitcoin-denominated securities (company stocks, mining and other bonds, loans), no different than some private tokens on ethereum today. IPOs of virtual companies were as much a hype back then as ICOs of virtual currencies today.\n\nAnd one more parallel I find difficult to ignore: Virtually all assets that were traded on these exchanges, even the ones that weren\'t plain scams and Ponzi schemes, were hopelessly overvalued. They were bought because prices were expected to go up. Even when the prices exceeded any remotely rational valuation of the underlying assets, including mining bonds, simple arithmetic would prove beyond a doubt that they could never return a profit.\n\nThose ""stock exchanges"" were eventually all closed by authorities, and some of the issuers of securities got in serious legal trouble. I don\'t know what, if anything will happen with ethereum-based ICOs, or how it might affect ethereum, but it is a concern one should not ignore.\n\nEspecially not when ICOs appear to be by far the primary driver of ether value.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nIn short, ethereum is, without a doubt, a much more exciting blockchain than bitcoin. It\'s like comparing an operating system to a paper ledger. But that doesn\'t make it a better investment.\n\nSo, what is ether\'s value proposition today?\n\nIt\'s unused (and arguably not quite usable yet) as a general transaction currency; it\'s too uncertain to be trusted as a secure store of wealth; and it has a derived value that appears almost entirely dependent on legally dubious ICOs that can’t go on forever. Ether as a currency, I fear, is misunderstood by many, and compared to bitcoin at least, substantially more risky and overvalued.\n\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'For bitcoin to gain mainstream acceptance as a currency, it is vital that cryptocurrency advocates convince retailers to begin accepting bitcoin payments. It is also necessary that people begin making bitcoin payments at those businesses, lest they drop bitcoin as a payment option.\n\nThankfully, many retailers have demonstrated openness to accepting cryptocurrency payments. TigerDirect, Newegg, Overstock, and Dish Network are just a few of the household names who accept bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin acceptance has also progressed rapidly outside the United States. Japanese bitcoin marketplace bitFlyer estimates as many as 300,000 Japanese businesses could adopt bitcoin payments by the end of 2017. This summer, Russian e-commerce giant Ulmart plans to accept bitcoin as well.\n\nNow, a new Change.org petition seeks to land the “white whale” of cryptocurrency payments, Amazon. The petition, which is addressed to Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, urges the digital conglomerate to accept bitcoin and litecoin payments.\n\nThe petition says that by accepting cryptocurrency Amazon would increase their customers’ quality of life:\n\nAcceptance and intelligent integration of these efficient and groundbreaking payment methods will lead to more streamlined commerce and an improvement in the purchasing experience for the many millions who shop Amazon. This logical expansion in the payment options for Amazon’s customers would help to proactively modernize the purchasing process and ultimately improve quality of life by bringing together the most efficient distribution systems with the most efficient and convenient payment systems available.\n\nAlthough customers can use third-party services such as Purse.io to use bitcoin to buy products on Amazon, the company does not accept bitcoin payments directly; thus consumers must do extra work in order to pay for their Amazon orders with bitcoin.\n\nThis is not the first time the cryptocurrency community has tried to use a petition to convince a retailer to accept bitcoin payments. Last year, a Change.org petition asking Walmart to accept bitcoin only garnered 280 signatures. Walmart has begun experimenting with blockchain technology to track delivery drone shipments, but the mega-retailer has yet to adopt bitcoin payment integration.\n\nIf Amazon did decide to accept bitcoin, it would go a long way toward making bitcoin a mainstream payment option. It would assuredly gain international press coverage, and Amazon purchases are ubiquitous enough that it is very likely people in the cryptocurrency community would begin making purchases with bitcoin. Finally, bitcoin evangelists might have an easier time convincing skeptical friends to try bitcoin if they could tell them that Amazon accepts bitcoin payments.\n\nThat said, the quest to convince Amazon to accept bitcoin is a long shot–at least right now. The petition had 1400 signatures at the time of writing. With online petitions regularly garnering hundreds of thousands of signatures, supporters have a lot of work to do if they hope to capture the attention of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The teenager’s story has captivated America, delighting people with its mix of childhood ambition, entrepreneurial skills and hard work.

It is the last hope for Bitcoin to scale unitedly in face of the BIP148 threat. We will try our best to deploy and activate it as soon as possible.

The UAHF chain will protect the economic transactions that are under risk of reorganization because of UASF,” read Bitmain’s blog post.\n\nCoincidentally, almost immediately after the release of Bitmain’s blog post which the vast majority of the community accepted as a hard fork threat to Segwit supporters, bitcoin price fell amidst uncertainty surrounding chain split.\n\nTwo bitcoins expectations\n\nIf a hard fork as explained by Bitmain’s blog post is executed, it will undoubtedly be a contentious hard fork that will ultimately lead to two persistent bitcoin blockchains. Due to this uncertainty and a minor market correction, bitcoin price fell.\n\nHowever, analysts including Vays are optimistic in regard to bitcoin’s recent price trend and are expecting a breakout.\n\nCointelegraph emphasized in several extensive coverage of bitcoin price that bitcoin’s value has had always bounced back beyond its previous all-time highs and peaks after a major market correction. Based on the current upward momentum, it is possible that the same trend will apply and bitcoin price will hit a new all-time high in the upcoming weeks.', ""According to Panos Mourdoukoutas, Professor and Chair of the Department of Economics at LIU Post in New York who is also contributing to several professional journals and magazines, such as Forbes and The New York Times, when the bitcoin bubble will burst, there will be a final stage, which he calls “mania”.\n\nThe professor explained that every bubble has the same attributes, which is often confused with healthy bull markets. The pattern starts with investor hype over a popular topic. This theme can be an exotic product or an emerging industry, which promises a major change to the world while making the investors rich during the process, Mourdoukoutas wrote.\n\nComparing the 12-month performance of Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares (GBTC) and SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), we will see a major difference. While GLD increased its value by 3.93 percent in one year, bitcoin surged by 390 percent in the same period of time.\n\nAccording to the professor, accommodative central banks often finance the bubbles to grow bigger. In addition, market experts can also help prices double or triple by posting their predictions on social media creating buzz for the bubble. This phase of the bubble is called mania. Mourdoukoutas explained that, at this point, the theme reaches a cascade where no investor wants to be left behind.\n\nThe burst of the bubble can be expected when the early investors have already cashed out, and there are no new investors joining the club, the professor said.\n\nMourdoukoutas stated that the current run up of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has mostly the same as a bubble. He described BTC as an exotic asset, which has great and unique advantages. One of the most important is the attribute of bitcoin, which makes it a better hedge against global uncertainties than conventional hedges, such as gold. In addition, the cryptocurrency is a convenient form of payment, which can be used globally, however, has a limited supply of 21 million, the professor explained.\n\nAccording to the economics professor, there is investor hype surrounding bitcoin. Many investors had become familiar with the cryptocurrency, who can use investment trusts, such as GBTC, to participate in the market holding a good position. In addition, there is an “ultra-low interest rate environment” associated with bitcoin, the professor states.\n\nHowever, Mourdoukoutas explained that only one thing is missing from bitcoin’s transformation from bubble to mania: “a broad participation beyond the ‘pioneers’ and the ‘early adopters,’ to ‘early majority'”. That’s the point where the demand for bitcoin “reaches a cascade” and the mania starts. At this phase, according to the professor, the key majority of the investors rush to invest in the cryptocurrency for the “promise it holds, rather than the fundamentals it displays.”\n\nIf investment promises are not met with the end of bubbles and manias, money will be lost faster than it was made, according to Mourdoukoutas.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:"", 'If you\'re reading this article, you probably already know that bitcoin has been on fire lately. The price of the world\'s largest and most popular cryptocurrency has skyrocketed 162% in 2017.\n\nOnce a buzzword that was understood by few and used by even fewer, bitcoin has come to dominate this year\'s financial media headlines. In addition to attracting more of our collective attention, bitcoin is also beginning to create actual business value.\n\nSeveral of the world\'s largest companies are already deploying bitcoin or other blockchains as a way to improve internal transparency and efficiency. But what are we to do as investors?\n\nThere are surprisingly few choices today for those eager to gain exposure to this fledgling technology that many believe could change the world. You can buy bitcoin directly on a variety of new exchanges, like Coinbase or Bitstamp, but many of these charge elevated transaction fees. You can buy into the publicly traded Bitcoin Investment Trust (NASDAQOTH:GBTC), but as my Foolish colleagues Matt Frankel and Jordan Wathen recently pointed out, this comes with its share of risks, as well.\n\nHowever, the options available to investors are expanding quickly. As bitcoin and blockchains continue to steamroll forward in popularity and utility, here are two ideas and one warning that I believe Foolish investors should know about and prepare for before buying bitcoin.\n\nIdea No. 1: It\'s not just all about bitcoin\n\nThe anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto introduced bitcoin in 2008 as the world\'s first digital-ledger technology. That digital ledger is now commonly referred to as a ""blockchain,"" where all transactions are recorded and are transparently available for everyone else on the network to see. And because peers on the network were the ones verifying the transactions rather than centralized clearinghouses, blockchains could bypass the costs related to traditional middlemen required for bank withdrawals or credit card networks.\n\nThe novelty of bitcoin\'s design attracted a ton of imitators, who modified its original codebase to create new blockchains with slightly different properties. Without the middlemen administering the transactions, blockchains run off of consensus properties, which are the set of algorithmic rules that govern how the network will behave, and how transactions get fulfilled.\n\nThere are now more than 870 publicly available cryptocurrencies, which altogether are worth around $111 billion. Even though cryptocurrencies have been around for less than a decade, they already collectively command a greater market capitalization than Mastercard (NYSE:MA). The growth rate of the industry has been truly exponential.\n\nAt this point, Ethereum appears to be bitcoin\'s most formidable competitor. Ethereum enables the development of Smart Contracts, which automatically execute legally binding contracts between parties from anywhere on the globe. Though demand for Ethereum is surging, supply remains constrained -- which manifests in its significantly rising price. Ethereum\'s price is up 40-fold during just the past 150 days.\n\nThere are many cryptocurrencies now available. But it will be the creation of business utility that will ultimately decide which of them remain relevant and sustainable.\n\nIdea No. 2: Find companies actually using blockchains\n\nUtility means different things to different people. But to make things more down-to-earth and understandable, here are a few real-world use cases of how blockchains are already being used.\n\nIn the global shipping industry, each shipment of goods involves transactions between an average of 30 unique organizations. There are a significant number of agreements, currency fluctuations, and regulations at play, which cause 20% of the goods shipped around the world today to suffer some form of delay. Maersk is using blockchains to optimize logistics planning -- replacing the signing of manual paperwork with Smart Contracts -- which they believe will save them millions of dollars of efficiency in their supply chain.\n\nis using blockchains to optimize logistics planning -- replacing the signing of manual paperwork with Smart Contracts -- which they believe will save them millions of dollars of efficiency in their supply chain. In financial services, more than $11 trillion of credit derivatives are traded among 2,500 trade firms in 70 different countries (read that last sentence again, just to let those numbers sink in). DTCC is implementing blockchains for transparency into credit default swaps, which could help investors better understand what financial assets are worth and their risk profiles. Blockchains allow collaboration and streamlined automation between parties, eliminating the need for redundancies between proprietary ledgers.\n\nis implementing blockchains for transparency into credit default swaps, which could help investors better understand what financial assets are worth and their risk profiles. Blockchains allow collaboration and streamlined automation between parties, eliminating the need for redundancies between proprietary ledgers. In the energy industry, ConsenSys is building a consumer energy platform based upon blockchains. Customers can sell the power they generate from solar panels back to the grid and get paid in Ethereum, based on current rates. Fifty percent of electricity providers\' costs are related to billing, administrative, and marketing expenses -- and a collaborative platform would eliminate many of these costs and more efficiently match supply and demand within communities.\n\nThere are $600 million of transactions done every day using bitcoin. Developers are frantically deploying and improving blockchain networks, which will save billions of dollars for enterprises with large supply chains, like Starbucks, or for companies that need a collaborative network to do business with multiple counterparties, like Bank of America.\n\nThe warning: Beware speculation\n\nEven with companies deploying blockchains to drive tangible enterprise value, there\'s still a significant amount of speculation built into the price of cryptocurrencies right now. There\'s a huge amount of uncertainty surrounding how blockchains can and/or will be used in the future, and what that will be worth for consumers and businesses.\n\nThese huge uncertainties lead to a wide range of outcomes in fundamental analysis, which is meant to define the intrinsic value of what cryptocurrencies are actually worth. Without that publicly agreed upon fundamental analysis -- similar to discounted cash flows for equity analysis -- the price of cryptocurrencies will boil down to market speculation.\n\nAs an example, a recent CoinDesk study showed that Ethereum\'s price was highly correlated simply to its Google search interest. Largely to see what the process was like from a user\'s perspective, I recently bought a single Ethereum. Before my funds had even cleared the bank, its price had risen 40%. Amazing.\n\nOf course, the Dutch Tulipmania story teaches us that asset prices can\'t rise forever. Many experts believe the token economy is entering ""bubble"" territory, where many of the publicly traded cryptocurrencies will ultimately collapse and be worth absolutely nothing. It\'s already being compared to the 2000 dot-com correction, so investors should proceed with extreme caution.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin appears to be at an impasse. Bulls argue that blockchains will unlock enormous future value for businesses and that their fixed supply will replace gold as an inflation-proof store of value. Bears argue that speculators have driven the pricing up to unsustainable levels and that a necessary correction is soon to come. While we can\'t offer personalized advice, we can certainly stress the importance of know thyself.\n\nThe safest way to invest in the rapidly changing payments space is in large enterprises that can save billions in efficiency and share those savings with shareholders. Think of large organizations that could benefit from reducing transaction, inventory, or processing costs.\n\nFor those comfortable with a bit more risk, I expect we will see a few natural winners emerge in the coming years. The world doesn\'t need 870 digital currencies, but it could certainly use four or five. Similar to how the flood of early worldwide web browsers eventually settled down to Netscape and AOL, we\'ll likely see a few public blockchains rise as the winners-take-all of digital ledger technology.\n\nWe also believe there are four companies that are extremely well positioned to benefit from the developing future of digital payments.\n\nMotley Fool Explorer is taking a deep dive into ""Bitcoin and the Future of Payments"" this month.

Long-term solutions have yet to be looked at, but certain individual ICOs (such as iDice) have decided to tell users to increase the “gas” they use to propel their investments.\n\nWhile this may work for the ICOs, ultimately the network is congested, and a long-term solution will have to be worked out by the DAO and Ethereum developers at large.\n\nWhile the status quo exists, it’s worthwhile for developers and other parts of the community to look at alternative platforms for ICO launches, as there are several. As earlier reported here at CCN, Ethereum Classic is aware that ICOs will increase on their platform over time. At around $20 per token and otherwise equal level of development, Ethereum Classic is an obvious way to go – there is a lot of untapped, unused capital in that market, and eager start-ups might be wise to tap into it rather than compete in the horde of Ethereum-based ICOs.\n\nAnother Western alternative is the Waves platform, which works differently but would allow for much of the same functionality as a given smart contract on Ethereum or Ethereum Classic. Waves are in the sub-$10 range per token and have a market cap of around half a billion dollars – projects with smaller funding goals might consider using this option.\n\nNetwork Effect Merely An Affectation?\n\nAt a currency and investment level, it’s obvious that the network effect proves true for monetary systems. Yet, when it comes to killer applications, does it actually matter what network the project is making use of? Sure, Ethereum-based ICOs have the potential attract the most funding as well as to operate on a stable (if increasingly overcrowded) network. But if a great application chose to go with Waves or Ethereum Classic, but still allowed to fund with Ethereum and Bitcoin as well, would its usage and adoption actually be held back by virtue of that?\n\nThe drumbeat of progress and innovation isn’t going to slow down any time soon. The crowdfunding model is now the premier way for crypto entrepreneurs to get going, and so it stands to reason that they will over time give more consideration to alternative platforms and that more such platforms will be born to serve the need. In all likelihood, more local plays like NEO (formerly Antshares) will crop in non-Anglophonic regions.\n\nThere are those who will decry this future development as problematic, discordant, and too complex. Instead, to this author, it seems that the more variety and choices there are, the more price points that people can enter the crypto economy at, and the more ways which developers can deploy new usages of cryptocurrencies, the more promising the future of the whole crypto economy looks.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The recent rapid increase in the price of cryptocurrencies has resulted in many experts calling it a bubble and advising caution while investing. Aberdeen Asset Management is the latest to do so, arguing that like all bubbles, the virtual currency bubble will eventually burst too.\n\nBubble-like Characteristics\n\nThe growth in the valuation of cryptocurrencies in 2017 has been unprecedented. Bitcoin price has more than tripled in value, going from $900 in Jan 2017, to over $2,700 as of now.\n\nThis pales in comparison to Ethereum’s gains. Ether price has risen from ~$8 in January 2017, to $350 currently, a gain of over 4000 percent. Other cryptocurrencies too have risen multifold in value, leading to natural apprehensions of a cryptocurrency bubble.\n\nGold Rush Mindset\n\nAberdeen believes that we are currently in the midst of a cryptocurrency bubble and its bursting is inevitable. Speaking to Bloomberg, Peter Denious, head of global venture capital at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, said:\n\n“Prices right now aren’t being driven by network usage, they’re being driven by speculation that tokens are going to appreciate. It’s a gold-rush mentality.”\n\nThe proliferation of ICOs and the rapid increase in the price of tokens upon listing is one of the indicators of a bubble. Companies in the Blockchain space seem to have no difficulties in raising money quickly through ICOs, even if they do not have a proven or unique idea behind their token.\n\nOther Assets at Record Levels\n\nWhile the returns on cryptocurrencies in 2017 is unparalleled, other asset classes have risen too. Equity indices like Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at record levels, in spite of the uncertainty in global markets. Housing prices have largely recovered from the previous burst.\n\nOne reason for the increase in prices is the ample liquidity in global markets, caused by quantitative easing by various central banks.\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency bubble may burst, it might not be the only one to do so. Past global crises have shown that the effect of a real estate or widespread equity bust can have long-lasting effects on the economy.', ""News\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is all around us, and has been for many years. I recall the juxtaposition of the Robotic Manufacturing Plant in Tomahawk, WI, for Harley Davidson where robotic arms spit out windshields at a rapid pace, while down the road Harley had an antiquated plant where managers had to deal with the humans. I worked in the server rooms for both, covering desktop support (humans) at the old plant, and supporting the robots (AI) at the new plant. The robots rarely broke down and the production was predictable, compared to the drama of human workers who would create mistakes so they could take a break from the hot production line. It was here I learned that AI was coming, and coming for everything soon.\n\nThat was 10 years ago, and in June 2017, we stand at the dawn of a new age where Watson and Alexa will be solving your problems and helping with your life. Robots and computers already do nearly everything better than humans do, and they should drive our cars and operate on our brain in surgery, cut our hair and organize our files. They will also keep track of our money, and have a simple and easy way (Blockchain) to transparently see who is on the other side of our transactions.\n\nMake the assumption that AI is here and it is poking you in the form of new currencies, and a new way for you to spend money. In fact, it is a new way for the global consumer to spend money outside of using the government currency. It is a form of barter that does not need to be cash or accredited by your bank. It is supported by the crowd, by the greater good. You must accept that or stop reading. Cash is dead. If you don’t believe me, look in your wallet and grab some paper. You won't be grabbing much, because you stopped using it years ago.\n\nElon Musk and Peter Thiel sold PayPal 15 years ago. Now they are going to Mars, inventing tubes to carry you across the country, and creating cities and a society that do not revolve around government-issued currency. They saw this long, long ago. I am always amazed how long it really takes for full adoption of a new paradigm, and what that looks like as it it happening. Digital Instruments like Bitcoin, Ethereum and the other 800 digital currencies are about to explode, changing the way we pay for products and services, and it has to do with pressing buttons, not counting cash.\n\nThe confirmation of Artificial Intelligence is here in the form of Digital Currency. The clearing mechanism (Blockchain) needs to be tested for the global consumer, and this only happens through word of mouth. When someone explains you can use Venmo to pay with your cell phone vs a slow bank wire or money order, know that these are the first steps in the paradigm shift. The evolution is here, and Digital Trading Instruments (DTI) will lead the adoption of AI, self driving cars, and a robot serving you at McDonalds. The currency must develop first in order to drive adoption of the rest. It is only logical.\n\nThat time is here, and I suggest as part of an ongoing test you start asking any and all retailers if they take Bitcoin. Just ask that simple question over the next 12 months. As more people start to say yes, go and buy yourself a Digital Coin you can afford, and do this as an investment you save for a rainy day. This is a good way to test the adoption rate yourself, and by reviewing the maze of digital currencies you will keep up with the day to day value of a few you are watching or own. You can buy different digital currencies (and there are hundreds) ranging from Bitcoin at $2600 per coin down to BitShares at 32 cents. You do not need to spend these coins, just keep them in your digital wallet for next year.\n\nMy suggestion is do not let this pass you by, unless of course you are still using AOL email, have a landline to call a taxi cab so you can get to a hotel. Know that you can Uber to your AirnBnb and pay for it with Bitcoin. The world is changing and it can be hard to see because we are standing in the eye of the storm, this does not mean Bitcoin and the other digital currencies will not go up and down, they certainly will. But you must keep in mind, they can go much,much higher from these levels. They have not become part of the mainstream, and it is certain they will, and you will use them each day, and it is hard to imagine with a global demand, why these currencies would go down, they are designed to go up and become a unit of trade. This day is coming much faster than we think, but by 2020 everyone will have a digital coin in a phone, tablet or PC. I suggest you look into digital currency and learn all you can learn about pricing, mining and where they started. Long live Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nYou can email Steve at content@equities.com, and sign up for the Newsletter in the article below.

06/25/2017,"['The Bitcoin price this year has climbed to unprecedented levels.\n\nFor newcomers to the market looking to make a quick win, the rollercoaster of a year has probably been a time of scratching heads and possibly a few tears shed. For the long-term investor, however, these periods are part of the journey and opportune times to snap up some more coins when the price takes a dip.\n\nDespite the precautionary cries of ‘bursting bubbles’, these market corrections are an anticipated occurrence.\n\nThese short-lived ‘crashes’ are momentary.\n\nHere at Bitstocks, we maintain our prediction of a $3,000(+) Bitcoin by the end of the year.\n\n6 Factors Pushing Bitcoin Prices Higher in 2017\n\nLegislative Changes for Cryptos\n\nEarlier this year, Japan announced that as of 1 April 2017, the country would recognise bitcoin as legal tender and make the provisions for administrative and accounting systems to be enhanced for cryptocurrency transactions to take place seamlessly. This was undoubtedly the major contributing factor to an initial surge in the price as Japanese individuals and corporations alike scrambled on exchanges to secure bitcoin for future purchases. Hundreds of thousands of retailers in the area are said to be equipping themselves to accept bitcoin payments, with a low cost airline, Peach, becoming the first commercial carrier to directly offer consumers tickets paid in bitcoin.\n\nAustralia quickly followed suit, announcing accelerated amendments to legislation that eliminated the incumbent double taxation on digital currency transactions. As it stands, Australians using bitcoin for transactions are liable for the 10% goods and services tax (GST) plus a further 10% tax for using ‘intangible property’ as a payment medium. Come 1 July 2017, these transactions will only attract GST, and be exempt from further taxation, no doubt fuelling a greater adoption of digital currency transactions.\n\nThe proactive progression by these countries certainly paves the way for others to learn from their integration and regulatory practices, empowering mainstream bitcoin adoption, which naturally pushes the price higher as demand increases.\n\nScaling Debate Resolution\n\nThe scaling debate has been a long-standing hurdle for Bitcoin growth. The decentralised nature of bitcoin, which naturally is one of its most appealing qualities, presents some challenges when it comes to governance of remedial action. In an ecosystem where no single entity can dictate changes to the framework, a majority consensus must be reached.\n\nThe fact remains that Bitcoin needs to scale from its current transactional capacity in order to meet the demands placed on the network in terms of the growing number of transactions, as the current block size is impeding quick and cost-effective transactions.\n\nWhilst several proposals have been put forward, the Bitcoin community have yet to come to agreement on a viable solution that satisfies the majority, while at the same time doing what is best for the wider user base.\n\nIn May 2017, at the annual Consensus conference, held in New York, an agreement has been signed by a ‘critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem’ that set out a plan for the adoption of SegWit with a planned hard fork to a 2MB blocksize within six months.\n\nWhile further clarity is needed, it would appear that we may finally come to a point of breaking the stalemate, which will contributing factor in Bitcoin being able to advance and reach its full potential.\n\nEconomic and Political Uncertainty\n\nOne of Bitcoin’s undeniable drivers of growth are citizens who have lost confidence in their country’s ability to maintain sound economic and political policies, and desperately seek to establish their own sense of financial freedom outside the manipulation of governments.\n\nVenezuela\n\nTake Venezuela for example. An overly aggressive expansionary monetary policy has resulted in hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects to reach an explosive 1,660% this year. This has led to an unparalleled economic and social crisis. The removal of the 100 Bolivar note (the largest denomination and still worth only a few US cents) from circulation in December 2016 alongside the lack of availability of the planned 500 to 20,000 Bolivar notes, led to widespread chaos and violent protests amongst Venezuelans, who for the most part were heavily reliant on cash but were effectively left without money for weeks on end.\n\nIt is reported that the minimum wage is around 200,000 Bolivars, yet a single basket of groceries costs in the region of 770,000 Bolivars, nearly 4 times the minimum monthly wage. Whilst the government provide some subsidised basic goods, the ‘outlets’ have become hotspots for vicious crime and citizens have to weigh up the risks of cheaper food against the dangers that face them in the queues. This is what happens when people reach such levels of despair to survive. The alarming surge in crimes such as kidnapping and murder leave most Venezuelans living in fear for their lives on a daily basis, with little in the way of respite.\n\nIndia\n\nIndia is another prime example, where the most recent, and possibly most extreme case of a modern-day war on cash occurred in December 2016. Under the pretence of curbing criminal action and tax evasion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi effectively wiped out 86% of notes in circulation overnight, when he announced the demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 Rupee notes with immediate effect. Exchange was possible, but within a limited time frame and only up to a certain amount, the rest having to be processed via a bank account. This, in a country where almost half its population has no access to formal banking, let alone a bank account.\n\nThis is just one of the reasons bitcoin holds such appeal in tempestuous economic climates. With Bitcoin, you are assured a level of financial security your money is removed from the coercion of the centralised system, therefore protecting your wealth from political agendas, damaging inflation and capital controls.\n\nIncreased Inflow of Institutional Money\n\nFinancial institutions, who are historically wary about Bitcoin are increasingly showing signs of interest in the digital asset. When compared to the performance of stock markets and fiat currencies, combined with more and more regulatory structure coming into place, it is unsurprising that institutional money has started flow into the crypto-economy.\n\nRegulation is arguably one of the largest barriers to cryptocurrency investment for institutions. Two nations, in particular, have been influential in this regard; Sweden and Japan.\n\nSweden was one of the first movers in terms of a regulated Bitcoin investment. Back in May 2015, the KnC Group launched the world’s first ‘Bitcoin Tracker’ known as an exchange-traded note (ETN), which is publicly traded on a regulated exchange. This represented massive progress for Bitcoin at the time and essentially opened the market for institutions and private individuals to gain a regulated exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nThe ETN is designed to mirror the price movements of the underlying asset being USD/BTC. The company offering the ETN, XBT Provider, is required to hold the equivalent number of bitcoins as the number of ETN’s issued. In other words, when a financial institution or private investor purchases, XBT Provider has to purchase the same amount of bitcoins to back up the note. Earlier this month, Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK’s largest brokerage, announced that their clients would be able to access the ETN via their SIPP and brokerage accounts. This has opened the doors for retail and institutional investors to gain a regulated Bitcoin exposure in the UK.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Japan has played a crucial role in moving bitcoin into the mainstream. This move has provided institutional players with the much-needed vote of confidence required before they got on board. Russia and India are looking likely to be the next countries to announce positive legislation after an increase in interest within the regions. This will further stimulate institutional investment into Bitcoin, leading to a stronger and more prosperous market for all.\n\nMainstream Momentum\n\nPerhaps this can be linked back to the fact that with growing interest, and impressive growth, the media have been covering Bitcoin more and more frequently, exposing it to a wider audience. Personally, I have had more and more dinner table discussions about Bitcoin with friends, family, ex-colleagues and acquaintances, outside of the ‘cryptocurrency world’, all now showing interest in Bitcoin.\n\nIt was this month that the Wall Street Journal mentioned Bitcoin on its front page, highlighting that Bitcoin has had a strong 2017. This mainstream recognition for Bitcoin’s performance has been long awaited and will be a stimulus for continual momentum.\n\nIt was only 2 years ago that most of the mainstream news stations were reporting Bitcoin’s demise. What a turn of events it has been.\n\nThe factors I have outlined above are merely a few of the positive fundamentals Bitcoin has going for it. Driving demand, expanding its utility and subsequently, increasing its value and price. So yes, I am confident when I say that Bitcoin will continue to break through all time highs and find favour above the $3,000 mark before the bells ring in 2018.\n\nDisclaimer: Although I am employed by Bitstocks, a cryptocurrency market investment advisory and trading firm, no part of this article should be construed as financial advice. Cryptocurrency is highly volatile and you should never invest money that you cannot afford to lose. I hold bitcoin in my personal capacity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The rags-to-riches stories about Bitcoin investors are a consistent theme with the rise in the value of Bitcoin over the past six months.\n\nThe most recent is Erik Finman, who invested $1,000 in Bitcoin in 2011 when it was valued at $12. His parents had made an agreement with him that if he were a millionaire by 18, he wouldn’t have to attend college. A child of two Stanford Ph.D. holders, Finman was willing to take the bet.\n\nHe now holds 403 Bitcoins, which, at their current valuation of $2,700, represent $1.09 mln. He also manages investments for the rest of his family, who have begun looking into Bitcoin as an investment vehicle.\n\nAt one point, an investor offered him either 300 Bitcoins or $100,000. At the time, Bitcoin was worth $200. He took the coins over the cash, much to the chagrin of his parents.\n\nWill he return to college? ""I never got my GED, and I don\'t see the value in it,"" Finman said. ""The purpose of that would be to get another education level and get a job. I had to learn through running a business. Instead of writing essays for English class, I had to write emails to important people.”', 'CNBC’s U.S. investment commentator Jim Cramer, who in the past stated that bitcoin could hit $1 million thanks to companies stockpiling the cryptocurrency to pay off ransomware, recently stated that investors shouldn’t buy Nvidia and AMD shares becuase of the cryptocurrency mining trend. The TV commentator claimed cryptocurrency growth isn’t currently sustainable and loathed bitcoin and ethereum for boosting these companies’ stocks due to an increase in demand.\n\nCNBC’s article cites the incredible growth both bitcoin and ethereum had in the last 12 months. According to data from CoinMarketCap, on June 24, 2016, one bitcoin was worth about $650, while now it’s at $2,682.65. Ethereum, on the other hand, went from about $14.1 to a whopping $334.79, at press time.\n\nAs reported by CryptoCoinsNews, these currencies’ price boom led to a shortage of AMD and Nvidia GPUs earlier this month, as new small-scale cryptocurrency mining operations have been surging, according to AMD.\n\nThe growing cryptocurrency mining market, according to a report from RBC Capital Markets, has contributed $100 million worth of GPU sales for Nvidia alone, in the past 11 days. The report added that AMD chips are the best for mining Ethereum, which hints that AMD’s sales numbers are probably more impressive.\n\nThese sales helped investors get in on the Nvidia / AMD craze, so much so that both companies recently saw their value surge. AMD, a manufacturer whose GPU chips are usually cheaper than those of Nvidia, saw its shares soar by 33 percent in the last 30 days.\n\nNvidia, likely due to the higher price of its units, saw its shares rise by 15 percent in the last 30 days – which is still impressive.\n\nEarlier this month, demand was so high these GPUs were sold out at major US retailers and, as such, vendors who id sell them did so at an inflated price. Nevertheless, even though Jim Cramer disapproves of investors buying AMD or Nvidia shares because of the cryptocurrency mining trend, he stated that buying Nvidia and AMD shares for their role in areas such as gaming, artificial intelligence, or autonomous cars makes sense. He stated:\n\nYou play Nvidia for artificial intelligence, for GPUs, for autonomous cars, and for gaming. You play AMD for gaming and they have a faster chip than Intel.\n\nCompanies Met Miners’ Needs\n\nBack in 2013, when both bitcoin and litecoin miners started driving demand, there was a similar GPU chip shortage in the market caused by the huge demand. This time, responding to miners’ needs, and given this wasn’t the first time these companies saw a similar swell in demand, both Nvidia and AMD started creating cheaper, stripped-down versions of their graphics cards, even though both hardware manufacturers still see the gaming market as a priority.\n\nThe GPUs specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining were to be released at a lower cost when compared to gaming GPUs, due to their lower specifications. According to reports, manufacturers removed display ports, and reduced their warranty to 90 days due to the intensive 24-hour operations these graphics cards are likely to face.\n\nAs far as mining goes, one analyst, who compared Nvidia and AMD GPUs, for bitcoin and ethereum mining stated:\n\nIn a small-scale environment (mining Ethereum) the profitability is higher given that the Network rate is materially lower at ~38K GH/s when compared to Bitcoin at 4.858 billion GH/s.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'MGT Capital Investments, a New York-based investment firm whose CEO is John McAfee, announced the company will start mining Ethereum.\n\nMGT already started mining bitcoin in July 2016 with the firm reporting in September 2016 that they are mining approximately 90 bitcoins per month. At the time, the company said that the bitcoin they mined in a month held a value of $55,000, however, since the price of the cryptocurrency surged up, 90 BTC has a value of about $236,000.\n\nThe publicly traded company pitched itself to investors mostly as a cybersecurity company, according to Business Insider. This industry is where John McAfee got his name with the antivirus product of McAfee LLC.\n\nMcAfee recently started to turn a major focus on cryptocurrencies. Last month, the cybersecurity guru said that the MGT will turn profitable with bitcoin mining in the center of activities of the firm, and have a goal of becoming the biggest in the world.\n\n“We will definitely be profitable before the end of the year,” McAfee said in a phone interview to Bloomberg. “From bitcoin mining, we will get the experience and expertise to apply the blockchain to our security products.”\n\nJust after McAfee was named the CEO of the company, MGT’s stocks rose by 63 percent in one day. The cybersecurity expert is confident of his role in MGT:\n\n“I don’t know anyone more capable than me,” said McAfee. “I have never lost in terms of business and I certainly don’t intend to start now.”\n\nEthereum can also be mined like bitcoin by computers that solve complex computations. On June 23, MGT announced that the company reached an agreement with Bit5ive LLC to purchase 60 graphics-processor-based mining computers, which will be used by the firm to mine for ether.\n\n“We are more convinced each day of the growth and value of digital currencies, and our company is uniquely positioned to be a leading provider of processing power to relevant blockchains,” McAfee said in a statement.\n\nMcAfee is among the minority who predicts that cryptocurrencies will rise. In early June, billionaire Marc Cuban called bitcoin’s recent price surge a bubble. In addition, Panos Mourdoukoutas, Professor and Chair of the Department of Economics at LIU Post in New York, also foresaw that the “bitcoin bubble will burst.”\n\nOn the contrary, McAfee stated earlier:\n\nNo matter how much government and regulators may scream and complain, there will be a world standard alternative currency. Bitcoin appears to be the one… It cannot possibly be a bubble.\n\nFeatured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'By: DailyForex.com\n\nAs the crypto-currency Bitcoin reaches spectacular new highs on dramatically increased levels of volatility, traders and investors alike are questioning whether it’s a good idea to trade this asset or whether now is the time to stay to the side before it devalues. Most of the debate is focused on whether Bitcoin is in a bubble, and whether it is viable as a long-term investment. I ask whether it is possible to put a fair value on Bitcoin, what factors will affect its market price, and what traders should be looking at before they decide to get involved in trading Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is a Bubble?\n\nMy preferred term for what is often known as an “asset bubble”, “price bubble”, or “investment bubble” is “speculative bubble”, because invariably, the peaks of these bubbles are caused by very intense speculative activity. A speculative bubble occurs when an asset is far, far above anything close to what its real (it might be better to say “sustainable”) value might be. A better way of describing it might be to note that because all speculative bubbles burst, a bubble can be defined as an asset rising exponentially to extremely inflated prices and then crashing down and settling at a level which is far less than its original price (typically a fall of 75% or more). A speculative bubble is characterized by both the rise and fall, particularly the fall, taking place over brief time periods.\n\nThe economist Dr. John Paul Rodrigue produced an excellent diagram (shown below) illustrating the typical progress of a speculative bubble, not only by time and value, but in terms of the psychological state of actual and potential market participants.\n\nLet’s compare the above diagram to a current daily price chart of Bitcoin in U.S. Dollars:\n\nA case can be made that, at the time this article was written, Bitcoin is somewhere around the “Denial” stage just after “New Paradigm” from Dr. Rodrigue’s diagram, which the chart seems to match closely. It is a case worth considering, as if incorrect, Bitcoin might still be worth buying, while if it is true, a short sell could be a great trade. Of course, a better option for you might to be not to trade Bitcoin at all, but what Bitcoin is and how it works is something that must be fully considered before any call can be made on whether it is in a bubble.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency which may be freely purchased. The hallmark of a currency is whether it is considered legal tender. Bitcoin is not there yet by a long way, but is being accepted by more and more nodes within the global economic matrix, including major companies such as Microsoft, Bloomberg and Virgin. Most currencies are backed by the central banks of nation states, who have the power to determine supply to some extent, and therefore can affect the exchange rates of their currency. Bitcoin is backed by no central authority. More importantly, new Bitcoins can only be created by computers after they have probabilistically spent a similar amount to the “real value” of a bitcoin. Creating a Bitcoin requires creating and running computer hardware with an internet connection. If it can be calculated how much it costs on average to generate a Bitcoin, that value to may be used to estimate Bitcoin’s “fair value”.\n\n”Fair Value” of Bitcoin\n\nIt is known that Bitcoin’s generation software, worldwide, allocates a block of 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes on average. An academic study conducted in 2016 estimated that approximately $8,333 is expended on electricity alone by Bitcoin miners every 10 minutes, which suggests that the opportunity cost of a Bitcoin is at least $667. Factoring in the amortized value of all the hardware and software used in Bitcoin mining is a more challenging estimation, but the same academic study found these costs bring the total amount expended per new bitcoin to $800. The Bitcoin generation process has another feature which makes it impossible to call $800 a “fair price”, though: after a certain number of Bitcoins are generated, the number of bitcoins awarded per block will halve, doubling the “fair value” per new bitcoin. It is expected with a high degree of confidence that this halving will occur in 2021, and that the last bitcoin will be mined in the year 2140. This means that the “fair value” of a new Bitcoin will double to approximately $1,600, and as interest rates are very low and are expected to remain so, the discounted future value of a new bitcoin is arguably about the same amount today. When the study quoted was conducted, the price of Bitcoin was well below $1,600, and at a current price of $2,265 would be about 42% overvalued. Interestingly, the chart shows a clear pivotal point which has acted as resistance and support at $1,600 which might not be a coincidence, as the study I have quoted is probably the most publicized credible attempt at calculating a “fair value” for Bitcoin.\n\nMonetarism, Bitcoin, and the Dream of the Gold Standard\n\nOnce 21 million Bitcoins have been created (“mined”), it will become impossible to create new Bitcoins. Bitcoins may be destroyed when owners of bitcoin misplace their passwords, but bitcoin, if it becomes de facto legal tender throughout most of the global economy and remains under the same decentralized and fixed regime, will be a currency that the world has never seen: one that will be completely impervious to inflation, and whose supply will remain forever finite. Bitcoin is often compared to gold and silver, which have historically acted as the primary stores of value, and are cited now by monetarist and libertarian economists as an eternal answer to the endless debasement of fiat currencies. In fact, Bitcoin will be firmer: gold and silver can be mined and hoarded, and their relative values in real terms sometimes fluctuate. In theory, bitcoin will not suffer from this problem.\n\nThe Bitcoin Bubble Answered\n\nIt seems logical to assume that provided Bitcoin survives in its present uncontrolled and fixed state, it will inevitably appreciate against all fiat currencies, with the only discounting arising from the question of whether it will become fully accepted as a convenient, usable legal tender. A factor within this is whether other crypto-currencies could eventually usurp Bitcoin’s leading role: it is worth noting that the capitalization of other crypto-currencies has begun to exceed Bitcoin’s capitalization. If you believe that Bitcoin will maintain its dominance over other individual crypto-currencies and eventually become widely accepted, then there is every reason to believe that a Bitcoin is worth at least $1,600 right now. If this is true, then Bitcoin might be overbought and due a substantial correction, but it could not be said to be in a bubble comparable to Tulip Mania or the first British joint stock companies of the 17th century. This case also supports Bitcoin as an attractive medium to long-term investment.\n\nUnfortunately, I see a dangerous overreach in assuming that Bitcoin is going to be a freely convertible and fungible currency, i.e. that it will be available to everyone who wants it and will be generally accepted as payment. This is far from assured, and with governments finding considerable value in maintaining fiat currency systems which may be inflated to write off debt, why would they sit back and allow bitcoin to usurp national currencies as a medium of exchange? If Bitcoin is going to remain the preserve of bohemian tech enthusiasts, much as it is today with less than 6 million individual users, then it is in a bubble and is enormously overvalued.\n\nTrading Bitcoin\n\nIf you are trading Bitcoin with a short-term time horizon, keep position sizing very small, as volatility is dramatically high. The 30-day ATR (Average True Range) has more than tripled over the past 6 weeks. Although the chart still looks quite bullish technically, we might already see the beginning of a major first lower high just above $2,600. It can also be expected that there will be support at $2,000 and within the area just below that price. A major correction should be expected, as in a huge appreciation of any asset when people who know nothing about it are starting to buy it. Long-term investors would probably do well to wait a while before buying at least part of their intended position, ideally to a level below $2,000 or, even better, $1,600.', 'One of the largest Bitcoin payment processors, BitPay, has launched an all-new app for those in the Windows ecosystem. Building on its long-term partnership with Microsoft, that has seen its Bitcore Bitcoin technology integrated into Azure, as well as the acceptance of Bitcoin payments in the Windows Store, BitPay is now bringing a new Bitcoin Wallet app to Windows phone devices.\n\nThe app, available now in the Windows Store, is compatible with Windows phone devices.\n\nPreviously known for its Copay wallet app on Windows phone, this new app brings in the new branding of BitPay, as well as the addition of new features and improved security.\n\nHere are the features of the app:\n\nMultiple bitcoin wallet creation and management in-app\n\nIntegration for loading, managing, and spending the BitPay Visa Card.\n\nIntegration for buying and selling bitcoin.\n\nIntegration for buying Amazon.com gift cards.\n\nIntuitive multisignature security for personal or shared wallets\n\nDevice-based security: all private keys are stored locally, not in the cloud\n\nHierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and wallet backups\n\nPayment protocol (BIP70-BIP73) support: easily-identifiable payment requests and verifiably secure bitcoin payments\n\nSupport for 150+ currency pricing options and unit denomination in BTC or bits\n\nEmail and push notifications for payments and transfers\n\nEasy spending proposal flow for shared wallets and group payments – Integrates with hardware wallets like Ledger and TREZOR.\n\nSupport for Bitcoin testnet wallets\n\nCustomizable wallet naming and background colors\n\nThe app is available now in the Windows Store.\n\nFurther reading: Bitcoin', 'A major issue hindering Bitcoin is uncertainty about its future. The debate is over whether Bitcoin will be a successful long run innovation or fizzle out like so many prior innovations.\n\nIt is possible to make a relatively accurate prediction about the future of Bitcoin by analyzing five factors successfully used by technology adoption experts for decades: relative advantage, compatibility with other innovations, experience through trialability, complexity and observability.\n\nThese factors, derived from the classic work of innovation diffusion theorist Everett Rogers, when combined with features unique to Bitcoin, suggest that Bitcoin is here to stay..\n\nRelative advantage\n\nRelative advantage in the field of innovation is defined as the improvements of a product as compared to its predecessors. Improvements include, but are not limited to, economic or social advantages measured in time, convenience, satisfaction or monetary benefits.\n\nSpecific examples could be better service, consolidation of multiple functions into one tool, empowerment of users, improved interface, increased productivity, reduced user effort, saving money, saving space or storage and saving time.\n\nA major advantage Bitcoin has over other payment systems is that Bitcoin has a decentralized ledger. A decentralized ledger means that a single party is no longer in control of the records of previous transactions. A centralized ledger has vulnerabilities that a decentralized ledger doesn’t have.\n\nAnother advantage Bitcoin has over its predecessors is lower transaction costs. Other payment systems have to go through a third-party as previously mentioned. Bitcoin is decentralized so there are no third-party transaction costs, meaning lower costs to merchants and less expensive remittances sent abroad. Global users without access to traditional bank accounts may also benefit.\n\nBitcoin users, unlike users of more traditional currencies, do not have to be concerned about inflation eroding the value of their currency as Bitcoin will only ever issue 21 mln coins. Inflation is created when the central bank issues more paper money usually in an effort to combat recessions. Offsetting these advantages is a current lack of ease of use, as Bitcoin transactions in payment systems are limited in many regions.\n\nCompatibility\n\nCompatibility is defined as an innovation that requires an adopter to make few, if any, alterations in their lives in order to use the innovation.\n\nA compatible innovation is consistent with past experiences and needs of adopters. For example, one reason the iPhone was a success was that customers had many devices that performed the same functions as the iPhone. The iPhone just incorporated all of those functions.\n\nIt appears that Bitcoin is a compatible innovation. An adopter only requires the use of a cell phone with Internet service in order to gain access to Bitcoin. An adopter doesn’t require any alterations in his or her life in order to use Bitcoin.\n\nTrialability\n\nThis characteristic refers to the degree in which the innovation can be experienced firsthand on a limited basis. Bitcoin access has rapidly evolved since the original Nakamoto paper.\n\nToday, digital currency ATMs are rapidly expanding in many locations, offering novice users the option to buy and sell small amounts of Bitcoin and other currencies at a user-friendly ATM.\n\nExchanges are also more numerous and allow users to participate in the digital currency arena with small investments often using a credit card. Direct purchases using Bitcoin are less common but are increasing in many countries.\n\nComplexity\n\nRogers’ research indicated that innovations that were simpler in nature had a greater chance of success than more complex innovations. This does not necessarily mean that an innovation has a simplistic underpinning, but rather that an innovation can be readily understood and is user-friendly for the target audience.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the underlying Blockchain programming is very sophisticated, but consumers who are familiar with the Internet, graphical user interfaces and mobile banking can easily grasp the consumer end of the Bitcoin transactions.\n\nA combination of technologies makes the Bitcoin transactions less intimidating for even novice users. Still, some users may be reluctant to adopt Bitcoin without understanding the underlying framework.\n\nObservability\n\nObservability is defined as an innovation whose benefits are apparently obvious to non-users of the innovation, for example, the vacuum cleaner versus the broom.\n\nThe observability factor in relation to Bitcoin is less clear. In the United States, Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange in limited places making it hard to be observed.\n\nHowever, there are countries such as Japan where Bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange more easily and has more opportunity to be observed.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin has been discussed more and more often in the news, leading to more information about benefits to potential users.\n\nOther factors\n\nEmerging Competitors\n\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency on the market. Other imitators such as Ethereum have appeared and corporate interest in digital currencies has increased. It could be argued that the imitators might ultimately outcompete Bitcoin and render it irrelevant. This happens when an imitator is clearly superior. However, the emergence of imitators is an indication competitors believe that cryptocurrency is here to stay.\n\nRegulation\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency and existing monetary regulations haven’t quite caught up to it. More and more countries are applying previous regulation to Bitcoin or creating new regulations specifically for Bitcoin. This is another sign that digital currency is more than a passing fad.\n\nGlobal expansion\n\nIn some areas, Bitcoin could replace real currency for several reasons. There are areas in Africa where the banking system is not well developed. Bitcoin just requires a cell phone and Internet access and it could easily become a de facto banking service. In addition, in many countries, citizens generally view the government backed currency as unreliable for various reasons, such as corruption or a poor economy. They may turn to Bitcoin because due to its decentralized nature, it isn’t subject to the effects of corruption or a poorly managed economy.\n\nSo yes, Bitcoin is here to stay\n\nIt seems likely that Bitcoin is an innovation that is here to stay rather than just a fad. Factors such as relative advantage, compatibility and trialability argue strongly in favor of Bitcoin adoption.\n\nComplexity and observability factors offer weaker support at the present time, but as digital currencies continue to attract attention, these factors should more strongly favor Bitcoin adoption. Based on these five factors, it seems that Bitcoin is probably here to stay.\n\nIf other factors such as emerging competitors, regulation and global expansion are also considered, then Bitcoin is still more likely than not to be a lasting innovation.\n\nBy Jennifer Moffitt.\n\nDisclaimer: Jennifer Moffitt is a privately practicing attorney located in Cheyenne, Wyoming specializing in regulation and compliance with respect to digital currency.

But that includes money in the bank. In physical coins and notes, the total global money supply is only $31 trillion. See the problem? Hence the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency that refuses to die. Its demise has been predicted numerous times, and one expert calculated that its value is eighteen times more volatile than the U.S. dollar. Yet the virtual money keeps going from strength to strength.\n\nLast year, Bitcoin became more stable than gold, and earlier this year, the price of a Bitcoin surpassed that of an ounce of gold for the first time. Currently, all the bitcoin in the world is worth $41 billion. If that amount is hard to grasp, just think of it as one Larry Page – because $41 billion also happens to be the net worth of the guy who co-founded Google with Sergey Brin.\n\nYou'll find both fortunes at the right side, and the lower end, of this graph, which gives you an idea of all the money in the world. You and I don't figure on it unless you're Larry Page. Or Bill Gates. The richest man in the world is worth $86 billion, or the net worth of Larry Page and Bitcoin combined – with enough change to buy the L.A. Lakers, the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Chicago Cubs and the Solomon Islands (not a sports team, but an entire country).\n\nBitcoin is the Uber of cryptocurrencies: the biggest, baddest and best-known, but not the only one. Add it up to Litecoin, Monero and all the others, and the total volume of virtual money floating around the internet, out of the reach of governments and banks, is a whopping $100 billion. That is about as much as the current GDP of Morocco – the 60th-largest economy in the world.\n\nThe monetary value of tech giants like Amazon ($402 billion) and (Apple $730 billion) is equivalent to the GDP of much bigger economies (Nigeria and the Netherlands, respectively). In fact, you would only need a little more than two Apples to equate the amount of actual money in dollar notes and coins in circulation around the world today - $1.5 trillion.\n\nMoney, of course, is fiduciary, which means it only has as much value as the trust we place in it. The same goes for gold: it derives its value solely from its rarity, combined with its desirability. The current world supply of mined gold is around 171,300 metric tonnes, which could be molded into a cube with sides of about 68 feet (20.7m). Its total value? Currently around $8.2 trillion. Or about 200 times the total value of Bitcoin (or Larry Page).\n\nJust to give you an idea: unless you own at least $205 million (i.e. 1/200th of $41 billion), the monetary distance between the net value of Larry Page and the world's entire supply of gold is smaller than the distance between Mr. Page's fortune and your own. If your head is not spinning already, consider the amount of narrow money that is held in banks and wallets, under mattresses and in piggy-banks around the world: $31 trillion. 'Narrow' money is defined as physical money: the coins and notes that used to be the standard form of currency before the rise of more derivative forms of payment, such as checks and electronic forms of money.\n\n'Broad' money also includes the deposits in easily accessible bank accounts that can be converted into cash relatively quickly. The sum of money under this definition is $83.6 trillion. You will have spotted a flaw in the system: if the amount of money that can be easily converted into cash is almost three times the volume of the actual worldwide supply of cash, we would have a problem if we would all want to empty our accounts at the same time. Or we could all buy shares. The total market value of publicly traded shares at stock exchanges around the world is $66.8 trillion. Not only is that a fabulously large amount of money, it is also subject to the laws of supply and demand, and highly fiduciary. A run towards or away from stocks would thoroughly deregulate the global economy, and nothing more dramatic than a minus sign in front of that amount would lead to the collapse of global civilization.\n\nDoes that sound overly dramatic? If the see-sawing rise of Bitcoin tells us anything, it is that people are losing their trust in money, and other traditional measures of wealth. Let's talk again when the total value of all cryptocurrencies surpasses that of the world's supply of gold...\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\n\nRead the original article on Howmuch.net.

Thus, data scientists that are actively developing an AI-based system to optimize trades have access to the numbers but can’t comprehend or link the numbers to actual trades.\n\nCraib said:\n\n""We give away all our data.

06/26/2017,"['2.\n\nHow did Bitcoin price develop?\n\nBitcoin price has its own wild road.\n\nIn 2009, the year Bitcoin was created, nobody could have thought it would gain such popularity. The initial price was about $0.001. Over the next five years there were no significant events, so the price rose slowly with little fluctuations.\n\nIn 2013, Bitcoin attracted a lot of attention because of the Cyprus banking crisis. In November 2013, the Chinese started to buy BTC in large quantities and the price increased by 1000 percent. However, it didn’t last long.\n\nIn February 2014, there was a DDoS attack on the servers of the exchange Mt. Gox. At that time, it controlled about 60 percent of Bitcoin transactions. This occasion struck Bitcoin hard and the price fell by 40 percent. Throughout the year, until January 2015, the price continued to fall down.\n\nDuring 2015, Bitcoin gained popularity slowly but firmly and during that year, the price began to rise little by little.\n\nSince May 2016, Bitcoin has earned the trust of more and more people, and its price has continued to rise.\n\nIn June 2017, the market saw a dramatic fall and the price decreased by 14 percent. Nowadays, Bitcoin is taking back its positions.', ""London is one of the top financial capitals of the world and London's unique position gives Britain a stakeholder seat in the global financial markets.\n\nLondon is one of the top financial capitals of the world and London’s unique position gives Britain a stakeholder seat in the global financial markets. Breaking news suggests that Britain might soon be warming up to the idea of having Bitcoin run side by side with the Pound Sterling as a means of exchange and store of value in the country.\n\nIt sounds surreal that Britain might start pushing for increased adoption of Bitcoin. For one, Bitcoin has the potential to sidetrack fiat currencies; yet, financial powerhouses in Britain are starting to give thought to the idea that Bitcoin is the future of money.\n\nBarclays’ executive thinks Bitcoin is the future of money\n\nBarclays is already in talks with fintech firms and regulators of financial services on the need to create a framework for bringing Bitcoin to the mainstream market, Barclay’s UK CEO, Ashok Vaswani while speaking at the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Copenhagen, Denmark revealed the plans of the firm.\n\nMr Vaswani revealed that Barclays is already in talks with UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on finding ways to make Bitcoin safe and stable enough for the mainstream. In his words, “obviously (it’s) a new area, obviously an area we’ve got to be careful with. We are working our way through it.”\n\nHe also revealed that the Bank is keen on working Fintech companies to find ways to demystify Bitcoin and make it more readily accessible to everyday users who are not necessarily tech-savvy. In his words, “we have been talking to a couple of fintechs and have actually gone with the fintechs to the FCA to talk about how we could bring, the equivalent of bitcoin, not necessarily Bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies into play.”\n\nBritain is home to many of the world’s biggest traditional financial institutions. Albert Pittman, a Saxon Trade market analyst observes that “the country’s economy is seriously interwoven with the fates of these traditional financial firms that calls Britain home”. Hence, it is unlikely that Britain will spearhead any innovation that could threaten the long-term profitability of traditional financial institutions.\n\nCan Bitcoin thrive alongside fiat currencies\n\nFiat currencies have done a great job of displacing gold as a means of exchange; yet, gold still occupies a significant place in the economy as a safe-haven asset. Fiat currencies have been able to thrive alongside gold because it became increasingly impractical to conduct smaller transactions with gold. Yet, gold price forecasts indicate that the yellow metal will continue to hold a place in the economy.\n\nInterestingly, it appears that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies might be gearing up to sweep fiat currencies out of the economic scene – or last least, thrive alongside fiat currencies sometime in the future. Apart from Barclays’ obvious interest in Bitcoin, the UK government has started creating some initiatives designed to make the Bitcoin ecosystem more stable. For instance, the U.K Treasury wants more oversight on Bitcoin exchanges to guide against use of Bitcoin to launder money.\n\nAnother factor that supports the possibility that Bitcoin is here to stay is the fact that VCs are starting to show increased interest in cryprocurrencies. VC investment for Bitcoin companies surged 51% from the end of 2014 to a total of $676 million at the end of 2015."", 'Bitcoin declined as much as 17 percent, while smaller competitor ether continued to slide after experiencing a “flash crash” last week, raising concern about mainstream acceptance of the digital currencies.\n\nBitcoin slumped to as low as $2,255.44 in intraday trading, the least since June 15. Ether, the virtual currency based on the ethereum blockchain, plunged 26 percent to $221.45, according to data compiled by Coindesk.com. And ripple, the third largest digital currency based on market cap, has dropped about 13 percent to around 26 cents, according to prices compiled by CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nEther slumped June 21 after congestion on its network slowed transactions, causing some cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitfinex and ShapeShift to halt transactions. Coinbase’s GDAX exchange experience a ""flash crash,"" as price slippage sent ether to trade around 10 cents, said GDAX Vice President Adam White, who on Monday decided to reverse an earlier decision not to refund flash-crash victims. He said the crash on GDAX was instigated by a multimillion-dollar market sell order.\n\nThe two biggest digital currencies have still surged in value this year. Ether started the year around $8, meaning even with its current drop, the price has doubled many times over. Bitcoin has advanced about 150 percent year to date.\n\n""When people fixate on price movements over a single day, my recommendation is zoom out of the price chart and look at the broader trend,"" said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a Washington-based nonprofit research firm focusing on cryptocurrencies. ""Blockchain could either catch on as the rails for global finance, or not, so valuations for a digital currency like bitcoin can either go to zero or be worth much more than it is today, so these assets are bound to be very volatile as people’s calculations of what they are worth can be all over the map.""\n\nCoinbase was down earlier Monday, according to online forums on ether, which could explain some of the losses, as this comes after other exchanges temporarily suspended trading last week due to a bottleneck on ether orders.\n\nRead more on the recent volatility in tech shares\n\nThe steeper decline in ether than bitcoin means ether’s market cap at $25 billion is now just about 60 percent of bitcoin’s, down from about 80 percent, when ether climbed over $400 two weeks ago. The rapid growth of the ethereum network had prompted speculation that ether would overtake bitcoin to become the biggest cryptocurrency as soon as this year, a phenomenon known as the flippening.\n\nChipmakers that had benefited from cryptocoin miners last week are now giving up some of those gains. Nvidia Corp. dropped for the third consecutive day, slumping 1.1 percent to $152.15 per share. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. dropped 0.6 percent to $14.08.', 'Terrorists are beginning to appreciate how useful bitcoin can be for quick, cheap and near-anonymous money transfers across the world. The cryptocurrency has been used by the Islamic State and jihadists in the Gaza Strip, according to a recent report by the Center for New American Security (CNAS).\n\nTo fight this threat – along with drug trafficking, money laundering and other illicit uses of cryptocurrencies – Senator Chuck Grassley introduced the ""Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017"" in May. According to a statement, he hopes the bill will ""update our money laundering laws for the 21st century."" The bill could allow for civil asset forfeitures of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and require users to declare cryptocurrency assets exceeding $10,000 whenever they cross a U.S. border.\n\nThe Iowa Republican has been joined by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, Texas Republican John Cornyn and Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse. Welcome as such bipartisan cooperation is, however, questions remain about whether Senate Bill 1241 is necessary or even productive.\n\nThe Wrong Approach?\n\nAccording to the CNAS report, ""there is no more than anecdotal evidence that terrorist groups have used virtual currencies to support themselves."" For the time being, established systems of money transfer such as hawala networks suffice. In order to curtail a potential threat, experts argue, the government risks stifling innovation that is actually underway.\n\nTestifying before the House Financial Services Committee on June 8, Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito said that blockchain\u200b technology – the cryptographic innovation that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – is ""perhaps as important as the web,"" while acknowledging that ""like the web, illicit actors are attracted to it."" For Brito, however, the way to combat those actors is to reduce – not add to – the regulatory burden on cryptocurrency companies. Quoting the CNAS report, he told lawmakers:\n\n""One particular challenge in this area is the requirement for a virtual currency firm to obtain licenses in all states in which it operates and maintain compliance consistent with both federal and applicable state standards where they are licensed to operate. With only a single federal registration for virtual currency firms, compliance costs would be more manageable for smaller firms, and regulators would be better able to oversee firms.""\n\nKathryn Haun, a lecturer at Stanford Law School, also told the committee that a federal compliance standard would help. She said that digital currency companies in the U.S. are some of the most cooperative financial services firms around, producing better Suspicious Activity Reports than big banks – despite having much less in the way of compliance resources. In her decade working as a federal prosecutor, the best turnaround she ever saw on a subpoena was from a digital currency company. Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, pointed out that cryptocurrency intermediaries already register with FinCEN, the Treasury Department\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\n\nWhen digital currencies become a problem, the culprits almost always use unregistered, overseas exchanges, where Haun said ""nearly 100% of ransomware and hacking campaigns take place."" She argued that law enforcement needs ""more statutory authority to go after uncooperative entities overseas."" (See also, Bitcoin Price Drops After ""WannaCry"" Ransomware Taint.)\n\n""FULL 1984""\n\nGrassley\'s bill would not do what those experts suggest. S. 1241 would include digital currencies under the legal definition of monetary instruments and the companies that deal with them under the definition of financial institutions, which could result in anti-money laundering reporting requirements for those transporting more than $10,000 in digital currency across the U.S. border.\n\nThe problem, as Blockchain Alliance counsel Alan Cohn points out, is that it\'s difficult to distinguish between owning and transporting digital currency. ""In theory, a person always carries their digital currency—or the ability to transact their digital currency—with them, including as they cross a border,"" he wrote recently, adding that this is also the case with mobile banking and credit cards. (See also, How to Buy Bitcoin.)\n\nThe bill may also open cryptocurrencies up to civil asset forefeiture, meaning that law enforcement could seize funds suspected of being tied to criminal activity.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts are not, by and large, pleased. A Reddit post accusing Congress of ""GOING FULL 1984 ON BITCOIN"" and calling the bill\'s sponsors ""certifiably insane"" garnered 5,427 points in 11 days, with 90% upvotes. Cohn, in a more measured assessment, wrote, ""Congress should consider the impacts of singling out virtual currency users, the majority of whom are not using virtual currency for illicit purposes. A better and more risk-based approach should strike a balance between discouraging illicit use while still encouraging innovation.""\n\nWhat\'s a ""Digital Currency""?\n\nAccording to Brito, the Senate\'s bill is being misinterpreted. It would not in fact require cryptocurrency users to declare assets at the border, Brito wrote recently; rather it would require Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection to submit a report to Congress ""detailing a strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States."" Depending on the contents of that report, the ultimate result could be the same, but commissioning a report may fall short of ""full 1984."" Brito does not address the potential for civil asset forfeitures.\n\nThat\'s not to say he loves the bill. Rather, he sees it as a potential headache for those seeking a stable regulatory environment. The bill is not in fact new, but was introduced in ""essentially identical form"" in 2011. Two years after that, FinCEN\'s regulations made clear what cryptocurrency businesses qualify as money service businesses. Much of the vocabulary around cryptocurrency regulation has also been established since 2011: ""virtual currency,"" ""convertible virtual currency,"" ""centralized virtual currency"" and ""decentralized virtual currency"" are well understood. ""Digital currency,"" the term S. 1241 uses, is not. If the bill were to become law, in other words, it might not change much – just confuse people.', 'The $1 million ransom payment paid last week by South Korean web hosting company Nayana has sparked new extortion attempts on South Korean companies.\n\nAccording to local media, seven banks have received emails that asked the organizations to pay ransoms of nearly $315,000 or suffer downtime via DDoS attacks.\n\nOnly five of the seven targets are publicly known, which are also the country\'s biggest financial institutions: KB Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank, KEB Hana Bank, and NH Bank.\n\nRansom demands made by Armada Collective\n\nThe ransom demands were signed by a group of ""Armada Collective,"" a name that has a long history behind it.\n\nThe group first appeared in 2015, and they are considered one of the hacker groups that popularized ransom DDoS (RDoS) attacks alongside another group known as DD4BC (DDoS-for-Bitcoin).\n\nWhile Europol apprehended suspects behind the DD4BC group, the people behind Armada Collective were never caught, and their tactics seem to have evolved across time.\n\nArmada Collective and RDoS attacks over time\n\nRadware, a cyber-security company that tracks RDoS attacks on a consistent basis, says the group has gone through two main stages.\n\nIn the beginning, the group targeted a small number of targets, all from the same industry, and launched demo DDoS attacks to prove their claims and force the hand of victims into paying the ransom.\n\nAfter a successful extortion of the ProtonMail secure email service in late 2015 that got a lot of media attention, the group appeared to have gone into hiding, but then returned in 2016.\n\nThis time around, the group\'s tactics changed, and Armada Collective — or impostors posing as the group — only made empty threats, targeting a large number of companies, all at the same time, from different sectors, and rarely launched any DDoS attacks to prove their claims.\n\nArmada Collective\'s RDoS attacks in 2016 were hardly noticed. Because of the group and DD4BC\'s success, numerous other actors entered the DDoS ransom market niche, such as New World Hackers, Lizard Squad (copycats), Kadyrovtsy, RedDoor, ezBTC, Borya Collective, and others.\n\nMost of these groups issued empty threats, a common theme with RDoS groups in 2016, also continued in 2017, with new groups such as Stealth Ravens, XMR Squad, ZZb00t, Meridian Collective, Xball Team, and Collective Amadeus. Furthermore, empty DDoS threats from groups posing as Anonymous have been the norm for the past two years, with the most recent wave being detected just last week.\n\nNayana\'s payment may lead to more attacks on South Korea\n\nLast week, Armada Collective\'s name resurfaced after a long period of silence. The ransom demands were sent — not surprisingly — just two days after news broke in the international press that a South Korean web hosting company paid over $1 million in a ransomware demand.\n\nNayana\'s payment was the largest ransomware payment ever made and may have involuntarily put a giant bullseye on the backs of all South Korean businesses, now considered more willing to pay outrageous ransom demands to be left alone.\n\nThe Armada Collective ransom letters sent last week to South Korean banks said the group would launch DDoS attacks on the targeted banks today, June 26, and double their ransom demand.\n\nAt the time of writing, the attacks didn\'t take place, based on evidence available in the public domain. Nonetheless, the attackers won\'t be discouraged by this initial refusal, and if they truly have the ability to launch crippling DDoS attacks like the ones that targeted ProtonMail, then South Korean banks and other businesses are in for a long summer.', 'Over the weekend, BTC-USD market cap dropped from $45 billion to a current (and still falling) market cap of $39 billion. BTC-USD brought the entire crypto market to a screeching halt as traders continued to see devaluations in nearly every tradable coin on the market. So, let’s take a look at what has happened and see just how bad this dive will be for BTC-USD and the other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nOn a macro scale, BTC-USD has been in the process of making a massive Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) pattern on the 6-hour candles:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, GDAX\n\nHead and Shoulders are common, highly predictable market reversal patterns. They have well-defined criteria for price movement and price projections once the pattern breaks to the bottom. A H&S pattern is characterized by the following, illustrated above:\n\nThere is typically an ascending trend line; A left shoulder that is smaller than a central peak (head) and a right shoulder that is smaller than the central peak; The two shoulders are connected by the “Neck Line” of the Head and Shoulders. There is first a test of the ascending trendline. A test and rejection of the ascending trend line’s support will bring us to the test of the neck line. A test of the neck line is usually the ultimate deciding condition for whether or not the pattern will continue downward.\n\nAt the time of this article, BTC-USD has broken the ascending trend line and is in the process of testing the Neck Line of the H&S pattern. If condition #5 is broken, the price projections are calculated in the figure below:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, GDAX, Price Target for Head and Shoulders\n\nPrice targets are not guarantees of price movement. Rather, a price target should be used as more of a target “zone” rather than a discrete point in the price-space. In our case, BTC-USD happens to have a price target with a very reliable, major support line in the $1800s. Whether BTC-USD drops that far down remains to be seen. However, it is important to note the following in the figure below:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, GDAX, Steady Downward Momentum\n\nThe momentum indicators, RSI and MACD, are showing no sign of downward momentum loss; The steady downward momentum is coupled with very little relative buy-back volume.\n\nDuring previous bearish periods, there was a significant increase in buy volume. However, something we are not seeing in this current bear run is a volume increase. The market could reverse at any point (after all this is crypto!), but on all major long-term scales, the momentum indicators show no sign of slowing down.\n\nIf we break the Neck Line of the Head and Shoulders, below are the major support lines you can expect BTC-USD to rest on during its downward spiral:\n\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, GDAX, Fibonacci Retracement Levels\n\nAt the time of this article, the market is testing the 38% Fibonacci Retracement Level, but the market doesn’t appear to be interested in buying at these values. If the BTC markets don’t see an increase in volume, BTC-USD will continue to hemorrhage in value — as will the entire crypto-market.\n\nSummary:', 'Bitpay has released an official Bitcoin wallet app for Windows Phone into the Windows Store.\n\nThe app joins the Copay bitcoin wallet app in the store, but improves on that app with better integration with BitPay’s consumer payments ecosystem, especially their prepaid Visa debit card for bitcoin users.\n\nThe open source app lets users store and send funds anywhere, buy and sell bitcoin, and turn bitcoin into dollars with the BitPay Visa Debit Card.\n\nIt features:\n\nMultiple bitcoin wallet creation and management in-app\n\nIntegration for loading, managing, and spending the BitPay Visa Card.\n\nIntegration for buying and selling bitcoin.\n\nIntegration for buying Amazon.com gift cards.\n\nIntuitive multisignature security for personal or shared wallets\n\nDevice-based security: all private keys are stored locally, not in the cloud\n\nHierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and wallet backups\n\nPayment protocol (BIP70-BIP73) support: easily-identifiable payment requests and verifiably secure bitcoin payments\n\nSupport for 150+ currency pricing options and unit denomination in BTC or bits\n\nEmail and push notifications for payments and transfers\n\nEasy spending proposal flow for shared wallets and group payments\n\nIntegrates with hardware wallets like Ledger and TREZOR.\n\nSupport for Bitcoin testnet wallets\n\nCustomizable wallet naming and background colors\n\nSee screen shots of the app below:\n\nGallery : Bitpay screen shots\n\nThe app is currently available for Windows 10 Mobile, and will also be coming to Windows 10.\n\nFind it in the Windows Store here.', 'Ethereum Goes Up\n\nMGT Capital, the company run by John McAfee, said it would start to mine Ethereum — the bitcoin rival that has surged nearly 4,000% this year — in its latest bid to turn a profit. Although ethereum has since dropped in value, it’s an alteration that was predicted by experts, given its unprecedentedly excessive rise. And as this latest announcement highlights, tech experts and investors alike are confident that its price will soon surge again.\n\nMGT, which is publicly traded over the counter, has pitched itself to investors mostly as a cybersecurity company. Cybersecurity is where McAfee made his mark as the founder of the antivirus company that bears his name.\n\nBut McAfee has more recently started to tout cryptocurrencies. He said last month that investments in bitcoin would help put MGT back in the black by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum is like bitcoin in that it can be “mined” by computers that solve complex computations.

Bitcoin put in a low of $2,076 just a day later after the scaling debate came back into focus as the bitcoin-mining firm Bitmain outlined its “contingency plan” for if a hard fork were to occur.

He plans to vigorously defend himself against the charges, and he is confident that when all the facts are known, he will be vindicated.\n\nSee the unsealed indictment below:', 'Almost a year on from our look into why graphics card prices often seem to be higher than their manufacturer suggested retail pricing (MSRP), it’s happening again in much more dramatic fashion. Once again availability and the ever-present fluctuations of supply and demand are the cause, but this time demand has skyrocketed because of graphics card-powered cryptocurrency mining.\n\nIt’s been years since graphics cards were used en masse for Bitcoin mining because the hardware arms race meant that specialized application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) mining hardware quickly overtook them. Ethereum mining, however, as with other digital currencies, doesn’t benefit in the same way from specialized hardware, so graphics cards are a great solution for mining them, and that’s leading to stock shortages and price hikes.\n\nHere are a current list of graphics card prices at a few different retailers. These are the lowest prices we could find for these cards which are in stock and ready to ship, but many go for substantially more.\n\nMSRP prices are for non-Founders Edition, stock cards.\n\nMSRP Newegg Amazon Tiger Direct Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti $700 $700 $700 $762 Nvidia GTX 1080 $550 $530 $500 $582 Nvidia GTX 1070 $380 $658 $700 $500 Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB $250 $400 $400 $375 Nvidia GTX 1060 3GB $200 $357 $243 $230 AMD RX 580 $230 $600 $700 Out of Stock AMD RX 570 $170 $500 $650 No listing AMD RX 560 $100 $100 $110 $117\n\nIt’s important to point out that not all of the price rises you see are because of unscrupulous gouging. Supplies of base-model cards are almost nonexistent, so only the superclocked, water-cooled, fancy RGB lighting versions of these cards are still available. The cheapest GTX 1070 at Newegg, for example, was the MSI Sea Hawk version that ships from Canada. Other, much cheaper versions just weren’t in stock.\n\nBut these were still the cheapest versions we could find. Some stretched even further. We saw one GTX 1070 selling for as much as $850, which would be enough to buy you a far more powerful (for gaming) 1080 Ti and still save money. Miners have wrecked the pricing on the GTX 1060 too, making an extra $100 for the GTX 1080 seem like a far more reasonable purchase.\n\nAMD’s cards were hit far worse, however. Following increased knowledge that they were some of the best cards for GPU mining, their prices have been steadily rising over the past few months, culminating in stock problems around the world. Those show no signs of abating, though we may have finally reached a point where people aren’t willing to pay three times the MSRP for them.\n\nIt’s reached such ridiculous heights that the current price for the RX 580 on Newegg is identical to the same card bundled with an AMD Ryzen 7 1700X CPU.\n\nIn some cases this price explosion has only been stopped by the cards being out of stock entirely. Tiger Direct has no AMD RX 580s available despite the cards only debuting a few months ago, and doesn’t even have a listing for the RX 570.\n\nWhile this problem doesn’t appear to have extended to the very top-end cards, that’s more of a problem than it might seem, because most people can’t afford those cards. While it now seems like you can get a “better” deal by opting for a high-end graphics card than one of the more midrange options, that’s not how it’s supposed to be. The middle-of-the-road cards are supposed to offer the most bang for buck, but in a market accosted by mining rig builders, that’s no longer the case.\n\nIt’s not clear what can solve this problem, though increasing the number of cards manufactured would be a good place to start. Perhaps we’ll see purchasing limits introduced, as Nvidia does with some of its high-end graphics cards, but it would be a surprise to see either AMD or Nvidia look to clamp down on purchases. Ultimately, a sale is a sale, whether the cards are rendering pixels or crunching cryptocurrency algorithms.\n\nThe big rumor is that both companies are working on releasing mining-focused graphics cards which would ship with a slightly lower price tag and no video connectors. That would make them useless for running a gaming PC, but perfect for mining rigs, and could go some way to stem this tide of GPU purchasing that is leaving hardware enthusiasts and gamers with few options when it comes to their next upgrade.']"
06/27/2017,"[""The former operator of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Coin.mx has been sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison.\n\nThe sentencing of Anthony Murgio comes months after he plead guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmission business in January. Murgio, along with alleged co-conspirator Yuri Lebedev, was first arrested and charged in the summer of 2015. Federal prosecutors later unveiled new charges against Murgio in November of that year\n\nCoin.mx was a Florida-based bitcoin exchange that federal prosecutors alleged acted as a financial conduit for the laundered proceeds of online criminal activity. The government sought as many as 10 years in jail for Murgio, a figure that the defense pushed back against earlier this month.\n\nUltimately, US District Judge Alison Nathan opted for a sentencing term of roughly half that amount.\n\nBrian Klein of law firm Baker Marquart, one of the attorneys who represented Murgio, told CoinDesk in a statement:\n\n“The judge dramatically departed from the government's requested sentence of over 10 years of prison time. Although we had hoped for an even lower sentence, we are pleased she made such a dramatic departure, and in so doing, we believe she validated points we raised in our sentencing submission and at the hearing today.”\n\nThe exchange was tied to a broader cybercrime scheme that infamously targeted companies like JPMorgan Chase, resulting in the theft of data from tens of millions of the bank's customers.\n\nAnother element of the case involved a New Jersey-based credit union, which prosecutors argued in court was used to transmit cybercrime-related funds overseas. That credit union was later shut down and its former chief executive was charged with aiding Coin.mx in exchange for accepting bribes.\n\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, a follow-up hearing is set for 1st September, with Murgio remaining out on bail.\n\nJustice image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

ASUS isn\'t making any further optimization claims about the RX 470 variant (the tuner software is the same as for its regular cards), but it claims that the P106 is up to 36 percent faster than an unoptimized card at churning through cryptocurrency hashes.\n\nNeither AMD nor NVIDIA is confirming the cards, including whether or not companies beyond ASUS will be selling mining-optimized models. A CNBC source is backing the existence of the NVIDIA board, though, and AMD would be a logical fit when it recently credited the ""resurgent"" digital currency market for a jump in GPU sales. And there\'s clearly a strong incentive for the companies to hop aboard the mining bandwagon. It gives them a customer base full of frequent upgraders, of course, but it also reduces the chances that avid miners will cut into GPU shipments intended for gamers.', ""Barclays has been talking to the Financial Regulators about how to bring cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into play. Does this signify a sea change in the attitude of banks towards cryptocurrencies?\n\nTraditional resistance towards cryptocurrencies\n\nBanks are subject to strict Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines. Hence they usually shy away from being associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, given Bitcoin’s reputation as a pseudonymous currency used in drug trades. In the past, banks have shut down accounts of Bitcoin-related companies, as these would involve enhanced monitoring and higher associated costs.\n\nTalks with the FCA\n\nIn a refreshing change, Barclays has spoken to financial regulators, including Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), about how cryptocurrencies can play a role in the existing system. Ashok Vaswani, the CEO of Barclays UK, told CNBC\n\n“We have been talking to a couple of fintechs and have actually gone with the fintechs to the FCA to talk about how we could bring, the equivalent of Bitcoin, not necessarily Bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies into play.”\n\nWhile regulators are open to suggestions, they are usually conservative on innovations like cryptocurrencies. As such, the opinions of existing established players like banks weigh heavily on their decisions.\n\nAssociation with fintech firms\n\nBanks have been associated with fintech firms and have looked at adopting Blockchain technology to cut costs. In April 2016, Barclays partnered with Circle when it launched its services in the UK. Circle, which is a social payment network backed by Goldman Sachs, received an e-money license in the UK. Banks and financial institutions across the world have come across to form the R3 consortium, to collaborate on Blockchain applications. It is only the association with Bitcoin that has been taboo for banks until now.\n\nThe way forward\n\nWith Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies still at a nascent growth stage, banks can afford to ignore Bitcoin-based businesses now. Banks have blacklisted certain businesses like recreational marijuana, gambling and pornography, due to the reputational risks involved. Doing the same to Bitcoin-based companies would only shut banks out from business opportunities and make these companies self-reliant. They may even challenge the business models of banks in the future."", 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nOn Tuesday, a new, worldwide ransomware outbreak took off, infecting targets in Ukraine, France, Spain, and elsewhere. The hackers hit everything from international law firms to media companies. The ransom note demands victims send bitcoin to a predefined address and contact the hacker via email to allegedly have their files decrypted.\n\nBut the email company the hacker happened to use, Posteo, says it has decided to block the attacker\'s account, leaving victims with no obvious way to unlock their files.\n\n""If you see this text, then your files are no longer accessible, because they are encrypted,"" the ransom text reads. ""Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don\'t waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service.""\n\nFrom here, the hacker tells victims to send $300 worth of bitcoin. But to determine who exactly has paid, the hacker also instructs people to email their bitcoin wallet ID, and their ""personal installation key.""\n\nThis is a 60 character code made up of letters and digits generated by the malware, which is presumably unique to each infection of the ransomware. That way, the hacker can release the specific key needed to unlock that individual victim\'s files.\n\nThat process is not possible now, though.\n\n""Midway through today (CEST) we became aware that ransomware blackmailers are currently using a Posteo address as a means of contact,"" Posteo, the German email provider the hacker had an account with, wrote in a blog post. ""Our anti-abuse team checked this immediately – and blocked the account straight away. We do not tolerate the misuse of our platform: The immediate blocking of misused email accounts is the necessary approach by providers in such cases.""\n\nJust to be super-clear, Posteo clarified, ""Since midday it is no longer possible for the blackmailers to access the email account or send emails,"" and ""Sending emails to the account is no longer possible either.""\n\nIn other words, victims allegedly cannot contact the hacker by email, nor send the details necessary to unlock their files.\n\nIn an email to Motherboard, Posteo said, ""Please make no speculations about how high the chances are to decrypt files locked by ransomware if you pay a criminal.""

With their decentralized nature meaning no single entity responsible for issuing the coins, while regulators can only go after its third-party service providers which include wallet providers and Bitcoin exchange platforms.\n\nAnother problem for the regulators is how to treat this coins: tokens or securities?\n\nIn 2014, Janet Yellen, Chair, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System clarified that Fed has no jurisdiction for Bitcoins.\n\n""“[T]he Federal Reserve simply does not have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way. . . . [T]o the best of my knowledge, there is no intersection at all in any way between Bitcoin and banks that the Federal Reserve has the ability to supervise and regulate.”\n\nSEC still unsure how to treat Blockchain and ICOs\n\nThe Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 broadly define the scope of “securities” to encompass any stock, bond, future, swap, investment contract, and more. Since there are no regulatory guidelines on how to treat Bitcoin or Blockchain, SEC has decided that companies using Blockchain technology for the purpose of trading securities would need to register as an exchange, Alternative Trading System (ATS), or broker/dealer.\n\nSection 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as:\n\n“any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.”\n\nExchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) interprets the definition to mean any organization, association, or group of persons that: (1) brings together the orders of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, nondiscretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of a trade.\n\nTherefore, if a Blockchain technology platform brings together several buyers and sellers of digital assets that are deemed as securities, the platform could be required to register as a Securities exchange unless it falls within an exclusion from registration.\n\nTo be classified as securities, the company owning cryptocurrencies would need to provide shares. For instance, SEC held in the matter of BTC Trading, Corp. and Ethan Burnside, specifically because when the company allowed users to purchase stock in virtual currency, they violated Sections 5 and 15(a) of the Exchange Act for not registering as a broker/dealer, or as a national securities exchange.\n\nFortune staff writer Jeff John Roberts says:\n\n“Even the most legitimate and fiscally sound ICOs pose a potential threat for their issuers. “Coins” or tokens can look a lot like traditional securities, because they enable companies to take investors’ cash while holding out the potential for profit. And selling securities without SEC approval violates federal law”.\n\nWhile ICO tokens continue to be traded without government regulations, it’s only a matter of time until SEC would come up with some form of regulation that may ultimately cause a setback to many Blockchain companies and their ICOs.', 'Finace minister Arun Jaitley.

The links directed individuals to a fake login page that looked like the real login pages for the various online marketplaces. When individuals attempted to log in, Richo stole his or her username and password.\n\nOnce he had an individual’s username and password, Richo monitored the individual’s bitcoin balance at the real marketplace. If the individual later deposited bitcoins with the real marketplace, Richo withdrew the bitcoins before the individual could spend them and caused the stolen bitcoins to be deposited into his own bitcoin wallet.\n\nRicho then sold the stolen bitcoins to others in exchange for U.S. currency, which was deposited into bank accounts that he controlled or was provided to him through Green Dot Cards, Western Union transfers, and MoneyGram transfers.']"

The attack takes the form of ransomware, malicious software that encrypts a user\'s files, then demands a payment in Bitcoin in exchange for decryption.\n\nVictims posted screenshots of messages showing up on their computer screens, instructing them to send $300 worth of Bitcoin to a Bitcoin wallet address.

Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies, also recorded substantial decline in value.\n\nBitcoin’s drop in value\n\nAs demonstrated by previous cryptocurrency market corrections, the decline in Bitcoin price has always led to the correction of the entire market.\n\nThus, when Bitcoin price fell from around $2,700 to $2,370, the cryptocurrency market underwent a major correction, with Ethereum falling from around $30 bln to $22 bln in market cap.\n\nWhen evaluating the short-term fall of Bitcoin price, it is important to consider the analysis of two financial and security experts, Max Keiser and Andreas Antonopoulos.\n\nOn June 15, after a minor correction, in response to the inquiries of investors and traders regarding the fall of cryptocurrencies in value, Antonopoulos wrote:\n\n“Some of you are wondering ""why are cryptos crashing like crazy?"" Yet you didn\'t ask ""why are cryptos climbing like crazy?"" That\'s why.”\n\nThe value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are solely based on the demand of the market. Hence, like any other market, the value of cryptocurrencies alter based on the rise and decline of demand from the market. Therefore, if investors can’t justify the increase in the value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, it is likely that a market correction is imminent.\n\nNew peaks after corrections\n\nMax Keiser, an American broadcaster and the host of RT’s Keiser Report, previously emphasized that Bitcoin has always had recovered beyond the previous peak in all of its previous market corrections. For instance, when Bitcoin price fell from $2,400 to $1,900 earlier this month, Bitcoin price hit new all-time high at $3,000.\n\nFor this reason, on June 20, Max Keiser noted that a new Bitcoin price all-time high of $5,000 is in sight. Especially since scaling issues will be addressed shortly and Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness (SegWit) can be activated without the execution of a hard fork that could lead to a split chain.\n\n“New all-time high for Bitcoin in sight.

If you really want to boost that hash rate you need a good graphics card. Or, a bunch of them.\n\nBut traditional graphics cards are not especially well-suited to the cryptocurrency mining gold rush. They\'re not made with the sort of reliable cooling and power regulators and so forth to run 24/7 at near peak capacity in a box with a bunch of other graphics cards. And gamers are frustrated by miners who buy up lots of stock, making the cards with the best price/performance ratio hard to find and inflating prices.\n\nThe solution may well be on the way, in the form of graphics cards made specifically for cryptocurrency miners. There are now two such cards listed on the website of PC component maker ASUS: the MINING GP106-6G and the MINING RX470-4G.\n\nThe latter card seems like a pretty basic Radeon RX 470 card. ASUS equips it with dual ball-bearing fans made to be dust resistant and run 24/7. Otherwise, it seems like any other RX 470 card. The product page lists a single DVI port for output, though the picture on the site shows a back panel that also includes DisplayPort and HDMI.\n\nThe GP106-6G carries specs identical to a standard non-overclocked GeForce GTX 1060, again with the fans made for operation in mining rigs, only it features no display outputs at all. When your graphics card is only used as a cryptocurrency processor, after all, you don\'t need to hook it up to a display.\n\nThe product page claims that the GP106-6G, ""enhances the megahash rate by up to 36% compared cards in the same segment that are not tailored for mining."" That\'s a difficult statement to qualify—what\'s the ""segment"" they\'re talking about? What cards are they comparing it to? It seems difficult to believe it is in any way faster than a regular GeForce GTX 1060 at mining, and if ASUS\' own RX470-4G is just like a Radeon RX470 then it should be faster.\n\nAMD\'s graphics cards have long been the preferred choice for cryptocurrency miners. When it comes to the particular operations used most often in mining, the architecture of AMD\'s graphics chips seem to hold a distinct advantage over Nvidia\'s. Each company\'s graphics chips have changed a lot over the years, and Nvidia\'s compute capabilities can sometimes equal or exceed AMD\'s in other areas, but when it comes to mining AMD holds the price/performance and power/performance crown.\n\nImage: wccftech.com\n\nWe still don\'t know if these new mining-targeted cards, and perhaps others like them from other vendors, will ease supply constraints that have been frustrating PC gamers. We don\'t know their price yet, and in order for miners to gravitate toward mining-specific cards, they need to have a better cost/benefit ratio. Either they must be cheaper than regular gaming cards with the same hashing performance, or they must hash faster than similarly-priced gaming cards.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.', 'It is human nature to construct narratives around the most recent event, be it yesterday’s closing value of the S&P 500 or the score of last weekend’s football game.

We should be very skeptical of those pronouncements.\n\nIn the past four days (since Saturday, June 24), the market price of a bitcoin has fallen from about $2,750 to just over $2,500, reaching a low near $2,350 yesterday. The fall looks more dramatic if we zoom out a bit to the all-time high of almost $3,000 just over two weeks ago. What has happened?\n\nFirst, let’s put this recent price drop in perspective. A year ago, a bitcoin’s price was around $650. Three months ago, it was still below $1,100. Most observers attribute the run-up in price to increased demand for bitcoins in China. But no matter what anyone thinks of the overall surge in price, the recent drop is a relative blip on the radar screen.\n\nHas any fundamental change in market demand or supply precipitated this recent price drop? It’s hard to find many close observers who think so. Instead, articles about the price in recent days focus on mathematics useful only to speculators, picking apart various trend lines and finding the “neck line” in “head and shoulders” patterns. (I don’t know what finding a neck line means either.)\n\nThis type of analysis indicates that the BTC-USD market has not reached a level of maturity where significant swings in price are generally driven by the revelation of important new information. We don’t have any more inkling about Bitcoin’s viability as a major global currency in the future than we did this weekend (and likely almost no more information since the run-up began a few months ago What seems to be mostly going on is speculation.\n\nLet’s take a look a few decades into the future. If bitcoin were to become a widely used global digital currency, it would have to command far more purchasing power than it does today with a market cap around $40 billion. To make that possible, you might be looking at bitcoin prices in the millions in today’s dollars. My own view, and I could be wrong, is largely the opposite: in the time it would truly take for the world to adopt a cryptocurrency, new competitors to bitcoin will come along with innovations we haven’t even thought of yet (some argue that with Ethereum and others, such competitors have already arrived). In this future world, bitcoins would lose virtually all their value. They should be nothing more than a short-term speculative bet in anyone’s portfolio. Far too much uncertainty about the future exists to learn much of anything from current swings in Bitcoin’s price.', 'In our previous BTC-USD analysis, there was a fear of a massive Head and Shoulders pattern that had very low price projections for the entire crypto market. In a turn of events, when BTC-USD made its test of the Head and Shoulders neckline, it actually responded in a market reversal.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Head and Shoulders Rejection\n\nYesterday, the crypto market took a turn upward as the market leader made a Double Bottom Reversal pattern that sent a market-wide bear run into an immediate bull run. As the BTC-USD market made an attempt to test the boundaries of the lower prices of the bear run, volume began to pick up and sent us into a market reversal. How does one spot this pattern and where are we headed in the next few days?\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 30-min. Candles, GDAX\n\nCharacteristics of a Double Bottom Reversal pattern include the following:\n\nA descending trendline within an established bear trend (shown in white) An initial bottom that temporarily reverses before retesting the established low (basically forming a “W” pattern) After a test of the previously established low, the test is rejected It is important to note that in order to confirm the reversal pattern, typically you want to see consistent increased volume at the lower values (shown in dark pink) After the low is rejected a second time, it continues upward and breaks the descending trendline established in step 1 (shown in yellow) After breaking the descending trendline, the price then forms a “neckline” with the rest of the pattern (shown in light pink) From there, to confirm the trend reversal, we would want to see a break of the neckline followed by a retest of the neckline (shown in light blue)\n\nAll the above characteristics are very strong indicators of a complete bear market reversal into a bull market. As mentioned in the previous BTC-USD analysis, the bear run would continue the trend downward until significant volume picked up. In our case, the volume picked up very strongly and made a complete market reversal. Much like BTC-USD, this pattern is seen throughout several major players in the crypto market: ETH-USD, LTC-USD, ETH-BTC, etc.\n\nIt is unclear where the top of the bull run will lead us, but what is clear is that volume has dramatically picked up, indicating market interest in the higher prices. Until the volume begins to die down, the price will continue to push higher.\n\nSummary:\n\nHead and Shoulders pattern was strongly rejected in the form of a Double Bottom Reversal Bearish trend has ended in a strong bull trend\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He has not since provided proof to satisfy the claim.\n\nTechnological underpinnings\n\nOne of the core critiques of the piece, however, pertains to its understanding of how the network would handle ""witness data"", or the cryptography that proves unspent bitcoins are able to be sent to another party.\n\nAt issue is that under Segregated Witness, nodes running this version of the software would send transactions and blocks in a new format, meaning transactions would be cryptographically linked differently than they are today. One merkle tree would be used to record the data, while another would include data and a signature. Nodes receiving blocks in the older format, by not upgrading to Segregated Witness, would not receive the witness data.\n\nBut even without receiving this data, technologists argue users would still be able to prove that the transactions were confirmed, and that they contained the correct signatures, if desired. Should they require it for business reasons, the argument is that not running a SegWit-enabled node would be impractical.\n\nEven assuming the argument that digital signatures need to be stored by the network itself to prove the legal validity of the transfer, technologists argued this could be satisfied by other means – namely, the proper storage of this data by the companies involved.\n\n""There are other ways to cryptographically prove a transaction is correctly signed other than having a full node,"" said BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp. ""The assumption that if a transaction is in the blockchain, it\'s probably valid, is a fairly good guarantee.""\n\nLegal experts asserted that, because of this design, it\'s possible to prove that the transaction occurred between parties, even if those involved did not store signatures.\n\nFor this reason, Coin Center director Jerry Brito argued that nChain is overstating the issues that would arise from the absence of this data.\n\n""If you have one-time proof that you have the bitcoin, if you don\'t have it and I have it, logically it was signed over to me. As long as somebody in the world keeps the signature data and it\'s accessible, it\'s fine,"" he said.\n\nFlorida lawyer Drew Hinkes went so far as to call the argument ""sound and fury"" that would have limited impact on the network, even if bitcoin transactions were applied to contracts.\n\n""If the transaction made it on the blockchain, didn\'t it already have provably correct enforceable signatures that the two transacting parties can both keep?"" he asked.\n\nQuestion of intent\n\nIn remarks on Twitter, bitcoin legal specialist Patrick Murck expanded on the argument, honing in on nChain\'s claims this would be a problem perhaps only in instances where parties used the bitcoin blockchain as a way to establish legal contracts.\n\nThe nChain article states: ""Years later, if you want to prove that you signed (or did not sign) a specific contract, you could find the signature block identifier, but you may not able to retrieve the physical signature block itself.""\n\nHere, Murck argued that, discounting the technical reasoning, the claim conflates bitcoin\'s signatures with the legal intent to execute a contract, which he argued isn\'t true.\n\nSantori went on to suggest that the technological change wouldn\'t have any impact on startups seeking to use the blockchain to prove that something occurred for this reason.\n\n""E-sign law is talking about human assent to particular contractual terms. Just because cryptographers call this a signature, doesn\'t mean it\'s an assent to terms,"" he said.\n\nLawyers queried also stressed that just because the word ""signature"" is used to define this process, that shouldn\'t mean it is captured under related law. As such, they pointed to a larger problem in the blockchain industry in which newcomers may equate the words used to express a concept incorrectly with other ideas.\n\n""Calling something signature data, and assuming because it\'s signature data, it\'s a legal signature,"" Palley said. ""That may be the logical flaw here.""\n\nRepresentatives for nChain in response indicated that they ""stand by"" the article and welcome the debate that it has created.\n\n""[We feel] this opinion piece is reasonable and it certainly does not misconstrue the law in any way,"" the company said, though it declined further engagement.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which helped organize the SegWit2x proposal, which would include the SegWit upgrade.

The following year, authorities reported raiding his West Haven home, seizing computers, hard drives and other storage devices.\n\nAgreeing to speak to agents, Richo admitted at the time that would grab the username and passwords for people\'s dark web accounts, the complaint said. Once he had access to these accounts, he would use a program to see if the user would deposit bitcoin, a cryptocurrency used on the darkweb.\n\nHe told authorities that he would snatch the bitcoin from the accounts before the user could get to it, and using another password, he would mask his trail, the complaint said. Once he had the bitcoin, he would sell them for cash deposits, prepaid debit cards and money transfers, the complaint said.\n\nRicho told investigators that he had amassed roughly 10,000 logins, which he then used to steal ""six figures"" worth of bitcoin, the complaint said.\n\nAll told, federal authorities said, he stole $365,000 worth of bitcoin before he was charged.\n\nHe was arrested in October 2016 on charges that included access device fraud and money laundering. He was scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 28, the U.S. Attorney\'s office said.\n\nRicho has been released on bond since his arrest in 2016, but under conditions of computer monitoring, officials said.\n\nAs part of his plea agreement, Richo forfeited some electronic devices and return roughly $365,000, the U.S. Attorney\'s office said.']"
06/29/2017,"['About two months ago, hedge fund billionaire Michael Novogratz made a bold announcement: He’d put 10% of his net worth into digital currencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum. But a lot can happen in a couple of months. Specifically, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled, and the Ethereum price has multiplied six-fold.\n\nSo around the time the cryptocurrencies reached all-time highs earlier in June, with the Bitcoin price hitting $3,000 and Ethereum breaking $400 the following day, Novogratz thought the current crypto boom had topped out. He sold “a bunch” of his digital coins.\n\n“I think the market had a spectacular run, and trees don’t grow to the sky,” Novogratz said this week, speaking at CBInsights’ Future of Fintech conference in New York. “So I probably still have roughly 10% of my net worth in crypto, but it’s been scaled way back.”\n\n“I own a lot less coins, they’re just worth more,” Novogratz added.\n\nHis call turned out to be well-timed. Just days after setting record prices, Bitcoin and Ethereum crashed as much as 25% in just 24 hours. Ethereum kept right on falling, at one point trading 46% off its high — and that’s not even counting last week’s flash crash in which the price briefly plummeted to just 10 cents.\n\nCryptocurrency traders have become accustomed to their prices violently whipsawing up and down in waves — a 30% drop in the Bitcoin price in May preceded its recent peak by about two weeks — but the current downdraft appears more sustained. Though the cryptocurrencies, rooted in a technology system known as the blockchain, have each since recovered some of their losses, they have yet to come anywhere close to their highs.\n\nNow, Novogratz, who formerly ran a hedge fund at Fortress Investment Group and now invests in blockchain companies, thinks the cryptocurrencies have peaked for the time being, and it could be a while before they return to record levels. “I think we may have put the highs in for the year in Ethereum, and you’re going to slowly consolidate,” he said at the conference.\n\nTo be sure, the billionaire is still bullish on digital currency over the longer term — he’s just waiting for the right time to buy again. And he has a pretty good idea of when that is.\n\nIf Bitcoin fell back down to $1600, he said, he’d “be buying a lot of it.” And if the Ethereum price retreated to between $150 and $200, it would be cheap enough to merit buying more, he added.\n\nThose prices would give Ethereum a total market value of about $20 billion, which “sounds about right for where we are” in the evolution of the technology, Novogratz said.\n\nAfter all, even if you believe, as he does, that the cryptocurrencies have much further to run — he compares the current phase of the industry to the third inning of a baseball game — investors who bought in amid crescendoing hype have still gotten burned in the meantime. “If you buy Ether at $400 and it goes to $200, I don’t care what inning you think it is, it feels really shitty,” Novogratz said. “You’ve got to be pretty careful when you enter these things.”\n\n(Lest anyone doubt the present frenzy among cryptocurrency traders, a popular Reddit thread points to a newly created website shouldisellmybitcoins.com, which generates a “No” response in the form of a different amusing Gif image each time anyone clicks on it.)\n\nEventually, however, Novogratz believes there will come a time when investors are better off getting out of cryptocurrency entirely — though it’s likely still a long way off. “I sense that this blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, ICO revolution is going to be the single greatest bubble of our lifetime,” he predicted. Of course, when that bubble pops, it’s probably a perfect time to buy back in.', '', 'Andy wants to know how to invest a few hundred pounds in bitcoin. It’s not hard to buy bitcoins, but whether they are an investment or a gamble is another matter ...\n\nHow can I invest in bitcoin? I’d like to invest a few hundred pounds. Andy\n\nThere are at least three ways, though only one of them looks rational today. First, you could mine your own bitcoins. Second, you could buy some from an exchange. Third, you could buy shares in a fund that has invested in bitcoins.\n\nPlease note that answering your question is not a recommendation, and I am not qualified to give advice on investments. However, as electronic payments expert Dave Birch put it to me on Twitter: “one doesn’t invest in bitcoin, one gambles on bitcoin”.\n\nThe problem is that people can make money by buying things that are essentially worthless, such as used postage stamps, Beanie Babies, and (historically) tulip bulbs. Tulipmania operated on the “bigger fool” theory, also known among stock traders as “momentum investing”. For example, tulip bulb prices may be insane but they keep going up. I may be a fool to buy them, but I expect a bigger fool to buy them from me. Simply replace “buy low, sell high” with “buy high, sell higher”. This works until you run out of fools.\n\nHowever, you can buy things that don’t depend on bigger fools appearing, such as land and gold. Their prices may vary dramatically, but over the long term, they retain real value. When tulip bulb prices were tumbling, everyone wanted to sell. When gold prices tumble, people with money look forward to an “investment opportunity”.\n\nDoes Bitcoin have value?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency. If you want to buy a camera for £250, then you need a way to transfer £250 to the seller. In theory, it doesn’t matter if you pay cash, write a cheque, email the money via PayPal or use bitcoin. In reality, you have to balance a range of factors including convenience, security and transaction costs. I’d use a credit card, if possible, because bitcoin payments are not reversible and offer no consumer protection.\n\nBut if you are investing, does bitcoin have an intrinsic value, like gold? To me, bitcoins look more like tulip bulbs.\n\nThe price of a bitcoin may increase because, for example, it is attractive to technology enthusiasts, and because we are all reading stories about how people made – or failed to make – fortunes. But, like tulip bulbs, bitcoins could be worthless when the bubble bursts.\n\nAs Henry Blodget told CNBC: “Look, this is a perfect asset for a speculative bubble. There is a finite supply. There is no intrinsic value. If anybody is persuading you that it should somehow be related to some GDP or gold … put down the Kool-Aid and back away.”\n\nYou could argue that banknotes don’t have any intrinsic value either. However, banknotes are backed by governments that have a strong interest in keeping their value relatively stable. Governments don’t (yet) care what happens to bitcoins.\n\nMining for money\n\nBitcoins are “mined” by people solving problems with computers. In the beginning, the best way to make money from bitcoins was to mine them with a home PC. However, bitcoin mining becomes more difficult the more miners there are. Today, you need specialised hardware, and you need to join a “mining pool” where large numbers of miners work together and share the results. Coins are not pure profit because of the cost of the hardware and the electricity consumed when mining. Also, you don’t know what bitcoins will be worth when you start mining them.\n\nHowever, there must be dozens of digital currencies besides bitcoin, and the CoinChoose website lists a Top 20. Well known alternatives include Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Bytecoin. You might find one that is still worth mining, or that might represent a better gamble than bitcoin. CryptoCompare is another useful website.\n\nEthereum is interesting because it’s backed by an alliance that includes JP Morgan, Microsoft, Intel, Banco Santander, Credit Suisse Group, UBS and BP. It’s designed to perform transactions very much faster than bitcoin, and its hashing system is decentralised by design. It favours individuals, not mining pools.\n\nBuying bitcoins\n\nYou can buy bitcoins from a bitcoin exchange or online broker, directly from another individual, or from an ATM. Coin ATM Radar lists about 50 bitcoin ATMs in London, many of them in convenience stores. As when buying foreign currencies, there’s a fee, which can range from 3.1% to 17.6%. The website covers 56 countries and you can search for an ATM near you.\n\nA bitcoin ATM usually takes cash from your bank card, though some only accept banknotes. It sends your digital currency (bitcoin, litecoin etc) to your wallet, which could be a smartphone app, or to your email address. Some ATMs can print “paper wallets” that you can scan later.\n\nIf you buy a digital currency from an exchange, it may well offer you an online wallet, but your money is at risk unless you have the keys. When the Mt Gox bitcoin exchange was hacked, around 850,000 bitcoins went missing. It was a $450m loss at the time, but at today’s exchange rate, it would be $2bn.\n\nWallets\n\nThere are dozens of different wallets for different purposes, with “hot” wallets on smartphones and “cold storage” wallets held offline on paper, on hardware devices (cards, thumbdrives etc) or on separate PCs. These are equivalent to your spending money and your savings account respectively.\n\nYou will need to research wallets. However, We Use Coins has a decent guide, and it recommends BitPay’s Copay to beginners. It’s easy to use and it runs on iOS, Android, Windows and Windows Phone, MacOS and Linux. It can also handle shared accounts.\n\nI used my Android phone to search for “bitcoin wallet” on Google Play, and gave up when it produced around 200 results. Copay was near the top. It only took two minutes to create a wallet, and it prompted me to make a backup: “Watch out! If this device is replaced or this app is deleted, neither you nor BitPay can recover your funds without a backup.”\n\nIt also warned me that “Anyone with your backup phrase can access or spend your bitcoin”. I dutifully wrote it down.\n\nOnce the wallet is set up, you can use the app to buy bitcoins from Coinbase in 33 countries, and from Glidera in the USA. It can take several days to buy or sell bitcoins via Coinbase.\n\nAlternative strategies\n\nSome investors – presumably ones who do not have teenage children – think bitcoin is “for the tech-savvy, difficult to buy and perhaps even harder to store safely”. This has given rise to funds that buy bitcoins or related assets such as mining companies. Last month, The Motley Fool described one ETF as The Worst Way to Buy Bitcoin. At the time, the story said, shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust cost about twice as much as the bitcoins it owned, but typically they “have traded at an average premium of 39% to underlying value of the bitcoin”.\n\nYou could buy dollar bills for $1 each, so why would anyone pay $1.39 to invest in a $1 bill … which is actually worth less than $1, because of the 2% annual management fee? Answer: “the laws of supply and demand”.\n\nOther American investors were conned by a Ponzi scheme that offered shares in bitcoin mining machinery.\n\nStories like that could be signs of a bubble market, but if so, when and how it will end is impossible to say.\n\nHave you got another question for Jack? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com', 'There’s volatility. And then there’s bitcoin volatility.\n\nWith virtual currency flash crashes and a recent string of ransomware attacks all but obliterating bitcoin’s incremental stability, it’s become hard to find a comparable asset. Indeed, the closest match is an exchange-traded fund on leverage steroids that’s supposed to be highly volatile.\n\nBitcoin now swings more than the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3x Share, or JNUG, an ETF that uses borrowed funds to deliver three times the return on an index tracking small-cap mining companies. And the volatility spread between bitcoin and the inverse short version of the fund, JDST, is the smallest in more than three years.\n\nThe uptick in volatility looms over the bitcoin market’s legitimization. Since a bubble burst in 2014, the cryptocurrency had become more stable, with two-month realized volatility reaching it’s lowest level in April 2016. But the recent price swings are a painful reminder that bitcoin has a long way to go before it behaves like a mainstream currency, if it ever does, said Dave Nadig, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based research firm ETF.com.\n\n“There have been a lot of advances and it’s been taken more seriously by investors and institutions,” Nadig said. “But there are all sorts of small steps that start legitimizing a market, and by design bitcoin is inherently unregulated. Part of the reason you end up with volatility is because of the lack of market structure.”\n\nConsidering some high profile investors have pinned their hopes on bitcoin’s stabilization, the resurgence of wild swings isn’t a great look. Former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz has 10 percent of his capital invested in cryptocurrencies, which he said could become a $5 trillion industry, and is looking to add more bitcoin if it falls below $2,000. It’s currently trading for more than $2,500.\n\nBitcoin has enjoyed a 167 percent advance so far this year, but has become increasingly correlated to a smaller but growing virtual currency based on the ethereum blockchain. Known as ether, that cryptocurrency quickly plunged from more than $300 to 10 cents last week on Coinbase’s GDAX exchange before snapping back. It’s currently trading for around $309, according to prices compiled by CoinMarketCap.com.\n\n“Over the last two and a half years to mid-last year, volatility had been trending way down and compared to roughly that of small-caps,” Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital LLC, said by phone.“Some of the major drivers now have been bitcoin trading with other cryptocurrencies, and when you have these big run ups, it increases the chances you’ll have a large drop.”\n\nTo be sure, precious metal markets have been seen low volatility recently, helping bitcoin jump above the miners index. The CBOE/COMEX Gold Volatility Index has fallen 25 percent this year, reaching an all-time low last month. Even so, JDST and JNUG are still the third and fourth most volatile ETFs out of the more than 2,000 in the U.S.\n\nGold and cryptocurrencies are often considered related in the financial markets because of their standing as alternatives to cash. However the precious metal, which has been used in this way for ages, is typically more stable than bitcoin, which started in 2009.\n\nJNUG’s realized volatility is nearly one point lower than bitcoin, according to 25-day data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the first time bitcoin jumped above the ETF since early 2014, when the cryptocurrency plunged 44 percent in two months following a surge in prices from $13 to $746 in just one year.\n\n“The broad arc is that there has been an increase in acceptance of bitcoin among various pools of capital,” Bogart said. “The volatility of it in some ways could be turning away some traditional larger investors who say, ‘I can’t touch this, it’s too volatile.’”', 'Fidelity Charitable, the donor fund connected to mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, raised nearly $9m in bitcoin during the first half of this year, according to its annual report.\n\nAfter raising $7m in bitcoin during 2016, Fidelity Charitable recently experienced a marked uptick in donations, bagging roughly $2m more than that figure in the last six months alone. The annual report further revealed that ""nearly $2bn"" has been committed by all funding methods since the start of the year.\n\n""This is more money given to charities over the first half of the year than ever before in the organization’s 26-year history,"" the organization said in the report.\n\nThe disclosure comes weeks after Fidelity\'s CEO took the stage at CoinDesk\'s Consensus 2017 blockchain conference to discuss the firm\'s deep interest in the technology, particularly in public blockchains and cryptocurrencies.\n\nFidelity\'s charity effort first began accepting bitcoin in late 2015, pitching the concept as a way to expand the possible donor pool by opening up to less traditional assets.\n\nDonations jar image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Police arrested Murgio and a co-conspirator in 2015.\n\nProfiting From Ransomware\n\nProcesutors said Coin.mx did a lot of bitcoin transactions for victims of ransomware who are often required to pay a ransom in bitcoin to unlock their computers.\n\nMurgio and his co-conspirators were also involved in a scheme to take control of a New Jersey credit union in 2014 to shield their activities. Judge Nathan said Murgio led an effort based on greed and ambition that was built on a “pyramid of lies.” When Murgio expressed regret for his crime, the judge said it was genuine. Murgio said he is now wiser than when the case began and he was sorry for the damage he caused.\n\nJudge Shows Leniency\n\nNathan noted Murgio’s generosity to friends and support to his family in deciding to reduce the term from the 10 to 12 and a half years that prosecutors recommended. Brian Klein, Murgio’s lawyer, said he was glad about the reduced sentence.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Eun Choi said Murgio exploited the desperation of ransomware victims. Murgio and others in 2014 acquired an organization called Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, N.J. and bribed its pastor, Trevon Gross, to evade scrutiny of Coin.mx, prosecutors said.\n\nMichael Murgio, Anthony’s father, pleaded guilty in October to an obstruction charge connected to the credit union.\n\nAlso read: Murgio pleads guilty for operating illegal bitcoin exchange\n\nCo-conspirators Await Sentencing\n\nA Manhattan jury convicted Yuri Lebedev, a Florida software engineer, and pastor Gross in scheming to shield Coin.mx’s activities from regulators and banks. They have not yet been sentenced.\n\nProsecutors said Gery Shalon, an Israeli who pleaded not guilty after being extradited from Israel last June, owned Coin.mx. Prosecutors also said Shalon oversaw the 2014 JP Morgan hacking scheme that stole information from more than 100 million people.\n\nNeither Murgio was charged in the hacking case, in which records of more than 83 million accounts were breached, including JPMorgan. The massive bank hack marked one of the biggest thefts of customer data ever.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A lot of countries are looking at regulating Bitcoin. That is no surprise since Bitcoin will not go away anytime soon. This situation is rather complicated in a lot of regions right now, though. Colombia is one of those regions where cryptocurrency is not legal tender, nor is it illegal to use. A government official clarified the situation earlier this week.\n\nA lot of consumers shy away from Bitcoin due to a lack of regulation. For a currency not issued by a bank or the government, that is not surprising. The legal status of Bitcoin is a big question in nearly every country around the world. Colombia is one of those countries, although one of its officials recently clarified a few things. The positive news is how Colombia has no plans to make Bitcoin illegal anytime soon. Nor could they do so, to begin with, since governments can control or prohibit cryptocurrency.\n\nColombia Doesn’t see Bitcoin as A Currency\n\nHowever, we do know Bitcoin is not a currency in Colombia. According to Jorge Gutierrez, that situation will not change anytime soon. The local Financial Superintendency has no plans to recognize cryptocurrencies right now. The only monetary unit of the country is issued by the central bank. Bitcoin can’t be considered a currency of Colombia, but it is not illegal to use either. This won’t help clarify things all that much for the average person on the street, though.\n\nDigital currencies are not securities in Colombia either. The existing regulation confirms cryptocurrencies have no value under Law 964. In a way, this makes Bitcoin and consorts “invalid” investments. This could become a problem for cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Colombia, though. Then again, those operations are allowed, for the time being, without a requirement for specific licenses.\n\nSimilar to most countries, Colombia feels Bitcoin is an unauthorized form of money. Unauthorized is not the same as illegal, though. Anyone getting involved with cryptocurrency can’t rely on help from the government if things go awry. This warning has more to do with the growing number of Bitcoin scams in the country. It is evident the government wants to warn people about the risks. It would be nice to see them recognize Bitcoin as legal tender, but that won’t happen anytime soon.', 'Courtney Goldsmith\n\nIn a UK first, a London art gallery will soon accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment for works of art.\n\nDadiani Fine Art, a gallery in Mayfair, will take any of the six leading digital currencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and others.\n\n“We are combining old world business ethics and practice with the new world of technology – the current system is becoming stale and needs to be disrupted,"" said Eleesa Dadiani, the gallery\'s owner, who is leading the charge.\n\n""Cryptocurrencies will provide a bridge from the elitist, centralist fine art market to a decentralised open source world where many more will be able to become a part of this exhilarating market.""\n\nDadiani said this could be a turning point for the cryptocurrency market, which has been sidelined by traditional businesses, like art galleries, for many years.\n\nIt will also open the market to a new type of buyer, she said.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be accepted at Dadiani Fine Art\'s new exhibition, which opens on 14 July. The sculptures, which will be made from the exhausts of Formula One cars, are expected to sell for around £25,000 to £30,000.\n\nDadiani also plans to launch its own cryptocurrency in the near future, which will be called DadiCoin.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin explained: What is it?

Price hasn’t moved too much, and we haven’t had too much by way of opportunities to get in and out of the markets as per the rules we outlined this morning, but we did manage to jump into a quick turnaround trade, and we are heading into this evening’s session in a relatively decent position. That is, we are not down on the day, and so long as we keep things sensible this evening, we should be able to maintain this net profitability throughout the remainder of Thursday’s trading.\n\nAs we move into the US afternoon, then, and into the Asian session beyond, here is a look at what we’re going for tonight and where we intend to get in and out of the markets according to the rules of our strategy.\n\nAs ever, take a quick look at the chart below before we get started to get an idea of what is on.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range we are going for this evening is defined by support to the downside at 2507 and resistance to the upside at 2543. This is just about wide enough for an intrarange approach, so long on a bounce from support and short on a correction from resistance, targeting the opposing levels.\n\nLooking at things from a breakout perspective, if we see price close above resistance, we will enter long towards an upside target of 2570.

06/30/2017,"['Prominent venture capitalist and investment firm co-founder Fred Wilson shares investment tips for Bitcoin and Ethereum traders in a blog post entitled “The Selloff.”\n\nHis investment firm Union Square Ventures is based in New York.\n\nRollercoaster\n\nSince the beginning of January, the cryptocurrency market and leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced corrections. Some market corrections saw Bitcoin and Ethereum falling by as much as 30 percent, although the two cryptocurrencies recovered relatively quickly after their initial decline.\n\nIn a blog post, Wilson noted that as he told his daughter who has also been an early investor in Bitcoin and Ethereum, he encourages traders and investors to consider what the price trend and value of Bitcoin and Ethereum will be in five to 10 years, not in the short-term.\n\nLong-term\n\nAdmittedly, the majority of traders within the cryptocurrency market are looking to profit off minor corrections and rallies of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hence, when the price of the two cryptocurrencies achieve new all-time highs or are in a position to sustain an upward momentum, traders tend to sell off and cause a price correction.\n\nHowever, like many early-stage investors, Wilson, who has invested in Bitcoin since 2013 and Ethereum since its launch in 2015, explained that most market corrections don’t hold much significance for his portfolio. Wilson is considering Bitcoin and Ethereum as long-term investments and is taking its long-term price trend into consideration.\n\nWilson writes:\n\n“I have been buying Bitcoin since early 2013 and Ethereum since last year. I keep buying but never that much at one time. Just a little bit every week. You can build a pretty big position that way, but you have to be patient, and you have to keep at it.”\n\nMore importantly, Wilson emphasized that he doesn’t attempt to predict price corrections and market bottoms even though his predictions turned out to be accurate often. Because Wilson is maintaining a cryptocurrency portfolio as a long-term investment, he explained that he doesn’t focus on evaluating short-term price development of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWilson adds:\n\n“I don’t try to time market bottoms and market tops, even though I can sense when they are happening. I don’t try to predict where these assets are going in the near term and I just believe they will be a lot more valuable in five or ten years than they are now.”\n\nMany analysts within the cryptocurrency sector have also stated in the past that most traders will earn a profit if they only trade a monthly basis. Over the past few years, Bitcoin has consistently made gains on a monthly basis as it always bounced back from market corrections.\n\n“I am wrong a lot. But honestly, I don’t really care. I will keep buying into this correction or rally, whatever it turns out to be. Because the more important question is where these assets will be in five or ten years,” said Wilson.', 'Over the past few weeks, the size of the Bitcoin mempool, the holding area for unconfirmed transactions waiting to be picked up by miners, significantly decreased by around 90 percent.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin fees significantly declined and the recommended Bitcoin transaction fee calculated by Bitcoin fee estimators integrated into widely utilized wallet platforms such as Blockchain substantially dropped. Now, fees below $1 have become sufficient to obtain first confirmation within 10 minutes.\n\nIn fact, Blockchain’s newly deployed Bitcoin fee estimator, which has received praise from the community for utilizing a satoshis per byte basis to establish recommended fees for users more accurately, has been recommending a $0.19 fee for regular transactions with an estimated confirmation time of one hour.\n\nOn June 29, Bitcoin pioneer and cryptocurrency wallet platform operator Jaxx COO Charlie Shrem revealed that a personal $2,000 Bitcoin transaction was confirmed within the first six minutes with a $0.25 fee.\n\nSent $2000 in #Bitcoin, paid $0.25, confirmed in 6 minutes #Working — Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) June 29, 2017\n\nWhy did fees become cheaper?\n\nIn late May, the size of the Bitcoin mempool reached an all-time high at around 120 GB. The large pool of unconfirmed transactions within the network led to the congestion of the entire Bitcoin Blockchain and the delay of transactions that had attached appropriate and proportional fees.\n\nFor over a month from May 1 to June 15, the Bitcoin mempool remained unreasonably large as the mempool failed to clear transactions during the weekend. Previously, the Bitcoin mempool had always cleared the majority of its unconfirmed transactions during the weekend when substantially fewer transactions were being settled on the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nHowever, the failure to clear transactions during relatively inactive periods led the Bitcoin mempool to expand and store even more transactions.\n\nAbruptly, the size of the mempool decreased within a matter of weeks and within 21 days starting early June, the size of the mempool declined from 120 GB to 20 GB.\n\nOn May 12, Cointelegraph reported that the activation of a viable scaling solution is urgently needed due to the abnormally large size of the Bitcoin mempool.\n\nSeveral analysts including Bitcoin researcher Ben Verret suggested that the sudden decline in the size of the Bitcoin mempool is a direct result of the termination of network spam and that because the activation of segregated witness (SegWit) is getting closer, spam transactions have stopped targeting the Bitcoin Blockchain.', 'Renwick Haddow created ‘trendy’ companies and duped investors into thinking they were big successes, authorities in New York allege\n\nUS authorities on Friday charged a British businessman with securities fraud, accusing him of deceiving investors over what turned out to be a fake trading platform for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged “the clandestine” Renwick Haddow, a UK citizen living in New York, diverted funds invested in a phoney Bitcoin site as well as from a flexible workspace firm Bar Works into accounts in Mauritius and Morocco, totalling $5m.\n\nIt said he touted experienced senior executives as behind the operations who turned out to be phantoms, and misrepresented the details and success of both companies.\n\nAndrew Calamari, director of the SEC’s New York office, said: “Haddow created two trendy companies and misled investors into believing that highly qualified executives were leading them to quick profitability.”\n\n“In reality, Haddow controlled the companies from behind the scenes and they were far from profitable.”\n\nBitcoin Store claimed to be “an easy-to-use and secure way of holding and trading Bitcoin” that had generated several million dollars in gross sales. The SEC alleged that in fact it never had any operations nor generated the gross sales it touted.\n\nIn 2015, Bitcoin Store’s bank accounts allegedly received less than $250,000 in incoming transfers, none of which appear to reflect revenue from customers, the SEC said.\n\nHaddow’s investors pumped more than $37m into Bar Works, which claimed to provide workspaces in old bars and restaurants, but in fact “primarily sold leases coupled with sub-leases that together functioned like investment notes”, the SEC said in a statement.\n\nThe commission alleged that throughout Haddow was “hiding his connection” to the companies “given his checkered past with regulators in the UK”, where he has faced similar charges for investment schemes.\n\nAccording to a report in Crain’s, 27 investors from China filed suit in the state supreme court on 16 June seeking repayment of more than $3m invested in Bar Works, which they called a Ponzi scheme.\n\nAnother investment group filed a similar case against Bar Works in Florida in recent weeks.', 'Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban plans to participate in an initial coin offering (ICO), according to digital currency news website CoinDesk, just weeks after tweeting that bitcoin is in a “bubble”.\n\nCuban’s decision came after one of the companies he is invested in, e-sports betting platform Unikrn, announced plans to raise funds for a new online coin, commonly referred to as cryptocurrencies, to rival bitcoin. CoinDesk reports that Cuban, who previously acknowledged that there is value in blockchain, the underlying technology behind digital currencies, intends to participate. (See also: Initial Coin Offering)\n\nIn an email to CNBC, Cuban confirmed his intentions to back Unikrn’s ICO. ""I want to learn more about them,"" he said. “[I] haven\'t signed the paperwork yet. But it\'s likely it will happen."" In a separate interview with CoinDesk, Cuban described ICOs as ""High risk, high reward,"" adding that Unikrn is better positioned that its gambling peers to take advantage of the blockchain trend.\n\nSeattle-based Unikrn is scheduled to launch a sale of tokens based on ethereum, a rival of bitcoin, in September. According to CoinDesk, $10 million has already been raised from investors, including actor Ashton Kutcher and Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth Murdoch.\n\nIn 2015, Unikrn introduced Unikoin, a digital currency that players can use on on its betting website. The company’s founder Rahul Sood told Coindesk that Unikoin has been used in over 250 million transactions, prompting it to launch its own digital currency called UnikoinGold.\n\nUnikoinGold will become the exclusive token for Unikrn’s betting platform and, because it is designed as a decentralized ERC20 token on the ethereum blockchain, can also be bought, sold and traded on digital currency exchanges.\n\nICOs have emerged as the easiest way for startup firms to raise capital for cryptocurrency ventures because they are unregulated and, therefore, face less rigorous obstacles than other fundraising methods. ICOs have managed to bring in about $327 million this year, according to a report by Quartz, representing slightly more than the $295 million that has been raised through traditional venture capital sources for blockchain-related tech startups.\n\nEarlier this month, a project called Bancor raised the equivalent of about $150 million within two hours. However, there’s also been plenty of controversy surrounding ethereum. Last week, high demand for ICOs reportedly clogged ethereum’s network, causing prices to briefly fall from above $300 to 10 cents on one exchange.

The exchange was used to launder more than $10 million worth of funds, authorities reported.\n\n\n\nBoth Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, 39, of St. John’s, Florida, operated Coin.mx through a fraudulent company called “Collectables Club.” According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the illegal Bitcoin exchange used the firm’s misleading name to open financial accounts at banks pretending to be a “members-only association of individuals who discussed, bought, and sold collectible items and memorabilia.” Murgio and Lebedev, along with other co-conspirators, violated bank and credit card company rules and regulations by “deliberately misidentifying and miscoding Coin.mx customers’ credit and debit card transactions.”\n\n“Lies conceived and deployed by Murgio permeated every aspect of Coin.mx’s operation, including its use of front companies, like Collectables Club and Currency Enthusiasts, to try to conceal the illicit nature of the operation,” the Department of Justice stated in its sentencing submission.\n\nOn January 9, Murgio pled guilty to three counts regarding operating Coin.mx, which processed over $10 million worth of illegal Bitcoin transactions. Murgio ran the Bitcoin exchange between October 2013 and July 2015 for Gery Shalon, 33, an Israeli citizen who was responsible for hacking at least nine companies, including JPMorgan Chase, E-Trade Financial Corporation and Dow Jones. Coin.mx sold bitcoins that came from illegal online transactions, such as victim payments to ransomware attackers who sought to launder the cryptocurrencies clean.\n\n“I screwed up badly and made serious mistakes and misjudgments,” Murgio said, showing remorse, to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan at his sentencing.\n\nShalon, along with Ziv Orenstein, 42, compromised data on approximately 76 million household customers and 7 million businesses by hacking the nine companies. U.S. officials described their operation as a “diversified criminal conglomerate” responsible for the largest theft of valuable information from a U.S. bank. The compromised data included the names of customers, along with email addresses and phone numbers. Authorities collected evidence stating that Murgio exchanged cash for the bitcoins of Shalon’s criminal gang. Israeli police arrested Shalon and Orenstein in July 2015, and they were extradited to the United States in June 2016. Both are facing serious charges, including aggravated identity theft, wire fraud and money laundering.\n\n“Mr. Murgio led an effort based on ambition and greed,” and constructed on a “pyramid of lies,” Judge Nathan said during the sentencing hearing at the Manhattan federal court.\n\nOn March 17, a Manhattan jury found Lebedev and his co-conspirator Trevon Gross, 52, of New Jersey, guilty of charges connected to a bribery scheme in an attempt to hide the illegal activities of Coin.mx from financial institutes and regulators. Both of the defendants are facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Judge Nathan scheduled the sentencing hearing of Lebedev and Gross for July 20, 2017.\n\nMurgio’s father, Michael Murgio, 66, was also involved in the Coin.mx case. In October, the father plead guilty to “making a false statement to the National Credit Union Administration on behalf of his son.” By making a plea deal, Michael Murgio managed to avoid additional charges in the case, including “conspiracy to make corrupt payments with intent to influence an officer of a financial institution and making corrupt payments.” Judge Nathan sentenced the elder Murgio to one year of probation along with a $12,000 fine.\n\nThe FBI arrested both Lebedev and Murgio on July 23, 2015, for “running an unlicensed bitcoin exchange with the goal of helping individuals launder money.”\n\nDespite the prosecution’s request for 10 to 12 years and seven months behind bars, the Manhattan federal court sentenced Murgio to five and a half years in prison. According to Reuters, Judge Nathan considered Murgio’s “generosity to friends and support to his family” and imposed a prison sentence half as long as the prosecutor recommended.\n\nJudge Nathan has scheduled a hearing on September 1 to decide on the amount of fines, forfeiture and restitution Murgio has to pay to the state. The operator of the illegal Bitcoin exchange remains free on bail.', 'The process by which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have crept out of the digital landscape and into the real world has been a slow one, and there have been times when it has also seemed somewhat arbitrary. Just days ago, Burger King franchises in Russia announced plans to accept cryptocurrency payments. ATMs and debit cards linked to cryptocurrencies of various types are quickly gaining in popularity, although few have actually been released to consumers so far. And now, for some parents in New York City, paying for preschool may be possible using Bitcoin.\n\nMontessori Schools Accept Cryptocurrency Payments\n\nAccording to Coindesk, Montessori Schools, with locations in the neighborhoods of SoHo and the Flatiron in Manhattan, have started to accept payments via cryptocurrencies for their preschool tuition. Specifically, parents have been able to pay for their students to attend the schools since earlier in June and via Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin. The schools have reportedly partnered with digital currency startup Coinbase. Coinbase will act as the intermediary, automatically converting the cryptocurrency payments into U.S. dollars.\n\nCoindesk\'s report suggests that tuition at the schools may cost as much as $30,950 per year. This breaks down to just over 12 Bitcoin based on current prices.\n\nParent Requests Guided the Shift\n\nAccording to Marco Ciocco, co-founder and chairman of the Montessori Schools in New York, the decision to begin accepting digital currency payments began about a year ago and was due to requests from parents. ""Parents who were early adopters are now able to take advantage of the appreciation of their digital assets and use them to pay for their children\'s education, something that will ultimately have a lifetime impact on their families,"" he explained. Ciocco himself indicated that he had personally followed the cryptocurrency field for many years and that the option has already been a popular one amongst ""many"" families. He expects that more and more Montessori Schools prents will take advantage of the opportunity to pay with digital currencies in the years to come.\n\n""As a forward-thinking administration, we like to stay ahead of the curve and would not be surprised if the percentage of tuition paid in digital currencies continues to grow every year and becomes a substantial portion of our payments,"" he said.\n\nEven as more and more payments using Bitcoin and other top digital currencies are making it into the non-digital world, there is persistent concern among some financial analysts that the cryptocurrency space could be a bubble. Aberdeen Asset Management, for instance, recently indicated its opinion that cryptocurrency trends have been fueled by speculation and that a bubble burst is likely to happen at some point in the future. In the meantime, Montessori Schools and many other businesses will likely continue to integrate digital currencies into everyday life.', 'A couple’s year living off Bitcoin which became a movie has debuted on controversial US network VidAngel.\n\nFollowing newlyweds Beccy and Austin Craig, ""Life On Bitcoin"" has received the go-ahead after it was first conceived in 2013.\n\nThe Craigs spent 100 days living completely free of the US dollar, something since echoed by other US projects for longer or shorter periods.\n\nVidAngel is an interesting portal for the movie, the service known for filtering out allegedly non-family-friendly content from mainstream movies.\n\nThe service has also branched out into its own homegrown content, however, and will premier Life On Bitcoin privately before moving to YouTube, iTunes and Amazon.com, CEO Neal Harmon told Hollywood Reporter in exclusive comments.\n\n""The more filtering the audiences do, the lower the royalties, so we have comedians from New York and Los Angeles bending over backwards to be family friendly,” he said.\n\nThe move appears not to be entirely random; Harmon is a fan of Bitcoin over the movie itself, he says, even admitting he pays his children in the virtual currency for domestic chores.\n\n""My 14-year-old son mows the lawn, and he\'d rather be paid in Bitcoin,"" he added. ""It\'s a system you can predict. You know the rules, and the rules won\'t change.""', 'Despite previous criticism of the Bitcoin “bubble,” Mark Cuban has announced that he will be picking up tokens in an upcoming eSports ICO, Unikrn. Cuban had previously claimed to have only picked up about $20 in Bitcoin, but it would be no surprise if he had greater confidence in Ethereum and Ethereum-based platforms. Many investors have, and so a lot of money has flowed into that economy. Nevertheless, when famous billionaires throw their money in a given direction, markets take notice. The success of the Unikrn ICO is probably leagues ahead of where it would have been before such news.\n\nCuban has already previously invested $7 million in the company behind the ICO, which enables people to bet on electronic sporting matches, in first-person shooter and other types of online games. Such a market will only grow, and Cuban correctly believes as much as well. As such, in any case, it’s no surprise he’s supporting the ICO in the press, with outlets now covering the Unikrn ICO favorably as a result of Cuban’s support.\n\nFor its part, Unikrn represents a way into a growing market – eSports gambling. Those who get the token are likely to profit, and that Cuban is involved and that the ICO will likely be successful means that a further round of good news will ring out about ICOs. The ICO bubble may only continue to grow. The irony of this is that Cuban himself declared the Bitcoin bubble not long before a rise and then decline of around $500, but now he is himself participating in the prolonging of the ICO bubble through his participation in Unikrn.\n\nUnikrn is the worldwide leader in esports betting. You can bet legally, for free, anywhere in the world using Unikoins, our virtual tokens. We also offer real money betting in Australia and the UK. Back your picks with Unikoins or real money and feel the rush when you watch the next big match.\n\nIn addition to standard betting, Unikrn has giveaways and the like. The company really manages to cater to gamers of a certain age, probably 17 through 35. That is the ideal gamer to appeal to, as it is the gamer who will actually have money to spend. That there are gamers in the higher age brackets is no myth – these are the people who fund the development of each new generation of gaming platform. PC gamers remain dedicated to their platform, despite what new platforms come out in the console variety. Both can be catered to with a gambling platform, because both have elements that can be bet on.\n\nThe bottom line is that gambling is one of the first needs that cryptocurrency, especially token-based cryptocurrency, can solve. Betting on sports and eSports can be done as well, and Unikrn is one of many plays in that space to come.\n\nFeatured image from Brian Solls/Flickr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A recent wave of high-profile ransomware attacks has swept the globe and brought with it attention to Bitcoin. It’s not surprising that if a person’s first exposure to cryptocurrency is a screen warning them that their files are inaccessible and demanding a ransom be paid in bitcoin, they will associate this technology with criminal hackers.\n\nHowever, that’s far from the full picture. There is a vibrant developer community that is using open blockchain networks like Bitcoin to build out the future of Internet infrastructure and fundamentally improve the way we transact online. To allow a few bad actors to tarnish this innovative technology would be a mistake.\n\nRansomware long predates the invention of Bitcoin. Some of the first ransomware involved victims sending cash in the mail to a post office box in Panama. Every existing method of online payment, be it mailing cash or PayPal, has been abused by criminals in some way. Bitcoin, like its predecessors, is simply a better way to transact online. It’s fast, reliable, verifiable, and does not need any kind of permission to be used. And that’s why criminals like it.\n\nUsing a better means of payment, however, does not put criminals out of law enforcement’s reach. Cooperation with bitcoin businesses and a growing forensic toolkit for bitcoin transaction analysis have made it harder than ever to get away with using Bitcoin for criminal activities like ransomware.\n\nFor one thing, bitcoin exchanges that service the U.S. are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act. This means that they must collect detailed identifying information on their users. Any time an illicit actor converts their bitcoins into their local currency through one of these exchanges, they can be identified. Further, suspicious activities such as large transactions or deposits from known bad actor Bitcoin wallets are flagged and automatically investigated. Exchanges are required by law to provide these records to law enforcement when appropriate.\n\nBitcoins can also be perfectly tracked within the Bitcoin system itself. The Bitcoin blockchain is a publicly available ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made. Anyone can download and analyze it, and free online tools exist to help with that. Several companies have also developed sophisticated tracking tools specifically designed to help law enforcement and compliance professionals follow the movement of bitcoins, such as those paid to a ransomware address. This is how the the corrupt DEA and Secret Service agents that stole money during the investigation of the Silk Road darknet market were caught. Through pattern recognition and other advanced techniques, these tools make it much more difficult to get away with criminal use of the bitcoin network.\n\nIndustry has also been helpful to law enforcement with its participation in the Blockchain Alliance, a public-private forum between companies in the space and dozens of U.S. and global law enforcement agencies. The alliance is a resource for law enforcement, where agents can feel comfortable asking technical questions to some of the brightest minds in this space. It’s also a resource for the blockchain community to understand the interests and concerns of law enforcement and regulators about the blockchain and its applications.\n\nThe Internet was once a haven for criminals. They adopted it before law enforcement had time to get its bearings, understand the technology, and develop techniques for combating its illicit use. Now it’s universally considered a neutral, purpose-agnostic tool that can be used for any purpose, be it good or bad. Bitcoin will likely undergo the same evolution as law enforcement adapts to the technology with the help of some of the very businesses that want to see it grow.\n\nJerry Brito is executive director of Coin Center.', 'PRESS RELEASES\n\nOn Thursday, 22nd June, St. Petersburg hosted a large conference dedicated to blockchain and cryptocurrencies – Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference St. Petersburg. The event tickets to which were sold out one week prior to the end of registration featured 18 speakers from Russia and other countries. They focused on blockchain development in banking, regulation issues as well as a popular topic – ICO realization by blockchain startups.\n\nOver half a thousand people took part in a conference and a demo zone.\n\nWhat were speakers talking about?\n\n\n\nArtem Tolkachev, the director at Deloitte CIS, dedicated his presentation to the world practice of technology regulations related to blockchain. He believes that ICO’s popularity will disappear maximum in a year because law doesn’t protect investors and startups raising money have no obligations. Investors need protection from “sheer lunacy” which is, actually, ICO, claims the jurist.\n\nDmitry Ermolaev, the project developer at Erachain, talked about difficulties connected to blockchain legalization in Russia. He thinks that blockchain startups getting million investments in a couple of minutes have troubles collaborating with traditional business in view of anonymity. Dmitry is confident that a smart contract cannot be signed without identification. That’s why Erachain has developed a special personal authorization which is personal data included in blockchain and bound to keys.\n\nICO was also criticized by Waves creator Alexander Ivanov. In his opinion, the community has to prevent “a too painful bubble collapse” which can lead to critical consequences for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe founder of Waves claims he worked with ICO long before it became mainstream, “when the majority didn’t know such a word”.\n\n“The current situation surprises me: people are raising crazy amounts of money. But they need to understand that if nothing changes, the bubble will deflate”, announced Alexander. In his judgement, the community needs to create a legal mechanism for ICO’s development and opportunities to protect investors in court.\n\nThe head of the department of innovative activity at NRU HSE and an active participant of sector conferences Marina Guryeva presented an update on trends and forecasts within blockchain economy. She paid her attention to collaboration of blockchain solutions and artificial intelligence. According to Marina Guryeva, robots are becoming subjects of economy establishing goods/money relationship without a human factor. “It’s cool when a fridge can order and pay for pizza delivery,” the speaker gave an example.\n\n“Blockchain will have the bright future. Talking about long-term prospects, it refers to artificial intelligence and relationship between robots. We are moving into the world where robots will represent subjects of economy able to buy or sell something to each other within one system,” said the speaker.\n\nThe topic of successful cryptocurrency regulation was covered by the vice president at Wirex Alena Korotaeva. She compared approaches to regulation and investments in Russian and Japan, the country where bitcoin is legal.\n\nThe speaker demonstrated the statistics according to which an average age of a Russian bitcoin investor doesn’t exceed 30 years while in Japan cryptocurrencies are the subject of interest of people 10 years older and with considerable assets. For example, a Russian businessman often invests in the cryptocurrency sphere without reliable money reserves because he/she hopes to have profit from volatility. A Japanese entrepreneur invests only a part of his/her assets and relies on the practical use of bitcoin.\n\nA representative of Solvena Company Lev Leiman gave practical advice to beginners. In his opinion, bitcoin’s price can grow by 1 000 percent and, besides, new digital currencies appear on the market all the time. The expert also recommended Twitter as a source of information about relevant events in the sphere.\n\nIn three years, business has started to understand blockchain much better – an optimistic thought from the director at “Sberbank-Technologies” Danil Kabanov. The reason is efficiency of blockchain in the process of communications and elimination of the loyalty problem.\n\n“Business signs agreements in the world where there is no trust”, said Danil. According to his forecasts, massive transition of business to blockchain will happen by 2020. One of the reasons is development of consortiums like HyperLedger.\n\nMaxim Azrilian, the chief technical architect at “Alfa-Bank”, told listeners about a joint case study of the bank and S7. Companies wanted to understand how blockchain is used in issuing of letters of credit. As a result, developers understood that time of signing the agreement decreased from 10 days to four hours.\n\nAccording to the speaker, companies are involved in creating a platform for using blockchain in trade financing, factoring and letters of credit.\n\nNevertheless, companies need to specify the use of blockchain, believes the technical evangelist at Microsoft Konstantin Goldstein. “90% ICOs are bullshit” – such a wording perfectly reproduces opinions of Microsoft specialists.\n\nAs announced by the organizer of the conference – Smile-Expo Company – the issue of blockchain is entering the phase of popularity and is discussed even on federal TV channels.\n\nApart from working on traditional platforms (in Russia, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Ukraine), Smile-Expo is planning to organize similar blockchain conferences in Sweden and other countries.\n\nComments']"
