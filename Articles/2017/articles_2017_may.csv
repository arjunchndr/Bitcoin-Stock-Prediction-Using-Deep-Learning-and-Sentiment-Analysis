05/01/2017,"[""Bitcoin price in 2017 has exhibited very dynamic behavior. Ever since conquering the $1,000 mark at the turn of the New Year, the volatility in the price of the cryptocurrency has increased significantly as represented by the huge swings being noticed very often.\n\nFactors affecting Bitcoin\n\nIncidentally, external factors which includes government intervention, industry competition, internal community disagreements among others have been responsible for both the rise and fall in Bitcoin price.\n\nCertain developments which were expected to affect Bitcoin negatively have turned out to become catalysts in the propagation of the cryptocurrency. Some of these factors include actions by governments, criticism by acclaimed competitors, internal community debates among others.\n\nTrading around $1,330 at the time of writing, certain predictions have surfaced which expect Bitcoin to hit the $2,000 mark in 2017.\n\nAdvantages\n\nMatthew Thompson of Coinigy thinks that there is a 50-50 chance of Bitcoin hitting the $2,000 mark in 2017. However, in his opinion, this depends on how the community shifts around it. He notes that while it is not a lie that Bitcoin along with the cryptocurrency market, in general, is steadily growing more popular, it has been plagued with a few issues that have hampered its usability as a currency.\n\nAccording to Thompson, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies/projects have slowly started to take away Bitcoin's majority market capitalization compared to the crypto market as a whole. He also notes that while Bitcoin has first mover advantage by a long shot, it has first mover disadvantage as well as it is relatively simple compared to newer projects.\n\nThompson also says:\n\n“Bitcoin is suffering from a substantial amount of infighting in its community. Especially over the block size increase debate, supporters of potential solutions like Core and Unlimited are at a standstill for the time being.”\n\nHe adds: “With this conflict, Bitcoin is suffering from a lack of innovation which relates back to it losing its day-to-day usability as a legitimate currency and not just a store of a value. On top of this, whichever side does end up coming through, it is unsure as to how Bitcoin's price will be affected”.\n\nThe counteractive effect of ETF\n\nThompson continues by noting that Bitcoin has definitely gained more of a legitimate status as an investment. He says that traditional investment funds are starting to see it as a potential investment, and though the ETFs were rejected, the fact that they were even proposed says a lot about the space.\n\nHowever, he reiterates that $2,000 price for Bitcoin in 2017 is 50-50 shot on whether Bitcoin goes beyond just the volatility seen in it. Bitcoin has very major things happening on both the positive and negative side."", 'By Kurt Marko\n\nBitcoin became something of a sensation in 2013 when the value of the digital currency spiked from $13 in January to $1,128 in November. In March of this year, one Bitcoin was running about $1,100, despite possessing no intrinsic value, corporeal form or backing by any sovereign government. Thank ransomware rings, drug dealers and wealthy Chinese businessmen seeking to circumvent government capital controls by secretly exfiltrating cash.\n\nBitcoin’s most valuable payoff, however, may be in popularizing digital ledger technology using cryptographically secure blockchains. If that mouthful of jargon looks like a foreign language, don’t worry. The technical sophistication belies a simple foundation.\n\nIn fact, the concepts behind blockchain are as old as accounting itself, which explains why the world’s largest financial institutions have poured significant money into development efforts for blockchain-based services. They’re not alone, though. A recent report from McKinsey & Company says the technology is poised to disrupt a range of industries by the end of the decade. After surveying 200 companies currently using blockchains, the consultancy determined that the tech could help move $80 billion to $110 billion annually, with the bulk coming from business-to-business (B2B) payments.{ad}\n\nYou needn’t be a high-dollar consultant to spot opportunity, or to engage customers. Anyone who’s balanced a checkbook understands the basics of a ledger: It’s simply a list of account transactions, itemizing debits and credits. The foundation of blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that can be shared by all stakeholders to a transaction. According to KPMG, distributed ledgers like those used in blockchains have six elements. They are:\n\nDistributed: Every stakeholder has access to a complete copy of the ledger and full visibility into new transactions.\n\nEvery stakeholder has access to a complete copy of the ledger and full visibility into new transactions. Time-stamped: Every transaction includes the exact date and time it was made.\n\nEvery transaction includes the exact date and time it was made. Secure: All transactions are digitally signed with a secure hash function.\n\nAll transactions are digitally signed with a secure hash function. Immutable: Validated entries to the ledger cannot be reversed or changed.\n\nValidated entries to the ledger cannot be reversed or changed. Unanimous: Participants in the digital ledger all agree to its validity and accuracy.\n\nParticipants in the digital ledger all agree to its validity and accuracy. Programmable: The digital ledger system exposes APIs that allow for automatic settlement of transactions, creation of self-executing contracts and other complex process flows using business logic.\n\nBlockchains achieve these attributes through the use of public-key cryptography, one-way hashing algorithms and the ability to easily create distributed copies of digital ledgers. Every transaction in a blockchain is signed by the originator using its private key and the recipient’s …\n\n{vpipagebreak}\n\n… public key. The recipient verifies with the originator’s public key and a private key-based digital signature. Other parties in the blockchain can validate the authenticity of the recipient by decrypting the signed transaction with the recipient’s public key. This process repeats for every transaction in a blockchain as illustrated in the (somewhat technical) video below.\n\n{video}\n\nBlockchain transactions resist tampering by also using a one-way hash to sign every transaction and include its sequence number in the chain. Thus, changing any signed transaction invalidates all subsequent transactions by altering the hash values. You can try out different hashing algorithms using this site, and this video provides a useful visualization of the process.\n\nThe implications have Wall Street and other businesses excited.{ad}\n\nWilliam Mougayar, a venture capitalist and author of a book on the topic, noted in a recent interview that blockchain has ramifications across technical, business and legal domains. The technology promises to disrupt business by creating a digital exchange network enabling peer-to-peer, B2B transfers. Their cryptographic, time-stamped security and immutability can also serve as the basis for legally binding digital transactions that don’t require being certified by a middleman, like a notary or escrow agent.\n\nEarly use cases are for financial services — peer-to-peer payments, lending and microtransactions. However, just about every vertical has the potential to be disrupted. Governments could use digital ledgers for land and auto deeds and titles, along with all forms of registrations. As the energy grid becomes decentralized, blockchains will support distributed sales using microtransactions. Real estate firms could simplify title searches, insurance and escrow.\n\nIn health care, ledgers will make it easier to securely share medical records. Transportation and logistics firms can enhance trust among customers with no prior relationships and improve the …\n\n{vpipagebreak}\n\n… accuracy, security and validity of documentation related to shipments and deliveries. The Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative is piloting uses including streamlining paperwork and reconciliations while improving auditability.\n\nAnywhere you can imagine bookkeeping and accounting improvements, think blockchain.\n\nBirds & Worms\n\nAlthough blockchain technology is rapidly advancing, turning it into useful business applications is still as much art as science. As Mougayar points out, blockchain platforms are immature and difficult to use, reminiscent of the early days of the web, when publishing a page required HTML coding. However, he expects the usability and maturity situation to dramatically improve over the next two years. While that means partners have time to be deliberative, first movers frequently get a business edge. By establishing a blockchain advisory service early, your firm can start building a reputation as the go-to source for advice and ideas.\n\nReady?\n\nFirst, get to know the popular blockchain and distributed ledger frameworks, such as Ethereum, Hyperledger, Quorum and Ripple, and related blockchain cloud services, including those from Microsoft Azure, IBM and AWS/Digital Currency Group.\n\nA number of channel-focused suppliers want to help you get started. Microsoft has advocated using blockchain to register and track products from manufacture to sale or placement in a composite SKU, and IBM and Cisco see blockchain as a natural way to securely share IoT data. At a recent conference, Dell said it has set up a dedicated blockchain practice and an innovation lab to prototype uses for smart buildings. Verizon sees uses around digital rights management.{ad}\n\nTalk with customers about business problems that may be amenable to smart contracts and digital transactions. These discussions should suggest service opportunities. Options include blockchain training, setup, and infrastructure and application administration, but be creative. Investigate partner opportunities with strategic vendors, such as the IBM blockchain ecosystem, and talk to retail customers about blockchain financial services from Visa and MasterCard.\n\nWhen considering opportunities, don’t limit yourself by merely using blockchain to streamline existing processes. Instead, consider how it might enable new services that weren’t previously possible. In other words, don’t only think about how to improve the bottom line, but also ways to increase the top one.\n\nKurt Marko is an IT industry analyst, consultant and regular contributor to a number of technology publications.\n\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/krmarko\n\nTwitter: @krmarko', 'Another billionaire has come out after Mike Novogratz to indicate he’s put some money into digital currencies, particularly in Bitcoin. His name is Mike Cannon-Brookes and he is co-founder of the collaboration software firm Atlassian based in Sydney, Australia.\n\nAccording to Forbes, his real time net worth as at May 1 stands at $2.4 bln. Cannon-Brookes’ business partner is billionaire co-founder, Scott Farquhar, who recently bought Australia\'s most expensive house - the $70 mln Point Piper estate Elaine. They are the only individuals under the age of 40 on Forbes list of Australia’s richest people.\n\nBetting on Bitcoin much like a horse racing\n\nCannon-Brookes made a tweet last week to confirm his bet on Bitcoin and how it has turned out well. Unlike Novogratz, who disclosed that he has 10 percent of his net worth in the cryptocurrency space and described it as the ""best investment of my life"", Cannon-Brookes doesn’t seem to consider his as an investment.\n\nThe tweet says:\n\nYup, my BTC bet is paying out well. Theory? “It will be worth a lot, or zero”. Much like a horse racing. Not like investing. https://t.co/VrGz6JzWoQ — Mike Cannon-Brookes (@mcannonbrookes) April 30, 2017\n\nHe did not say in any of his tweets about the digital currency how much he put into Bitcoin or whether he is holding other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Morning Herald, Cannon-Brookes, whose firm has no sales team but boasts NASA, Tesla and SpaceX as customers, is understood to have a number of public bets in the cryptocurrency space via tech investor Blackbird Ventures and bank disrupter Tyro. He is currently working with Elon Musk to bring Musk\'s battery technology to Southern Australia.\n\nWhat fraction of wealthy people could have Bitcoins?\n\nThough it is unclear what the fraction of wealthy people who are presently owning some Bitcoins could be, disclosures of this nature show that the belief that those who own the digital currency are mostly minions is not completely true.\n\nIt also, in a way, confirms the view that main investors have started getting involved in Bitcoin by investing a part of their money.\n\nThis could be in line with the advice of billionaire bond manager Bill Gross who in his investment outlook letter last year picked Bitcoin as an attractive storage of wealth for investors.\n\nAccording to Bitinfochart.com, less than 150,000 Bitcoin wallet addresses - about one percent of the total addresses available - have 10 or more Bitcoins each and they keep almost 90 percent of the total Bitcoin currently in supply.\n\nWhile individual owners may not be identified, some of the wallets could be for cryptocurrency exchanges or other businesses.\n\nRead more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, Tips', 'The price of tokens sold as part of a fundraiser for the decentralized prediction market project Gnosis is on the rise following their release to auction participants today.\n\nAt the time of writing, GNO tokens were trading for over 0.0455 BTC ($64) on the cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, a move that represents a more than doubling in value over just a few hours of live trading.\n\nThe increased activity appears so far driven by the quick actions taken by major exchanges to list the cryptographically secure asset. GNO holders, for example, can now trade the token on San Francisco-based Kraken, with trading pairs denominated in bitcoin, ether, US dollars and the euro.\n\nKraken was swiftly followed by Poloniex today, which announced support for GNO/BTC and GNO/ETH trading pairs. (Poloniex does not offer fiat trading).\n\nHowever, at press time, it seems that GNO tokens were having trouble finding demand at current prices, with well over 1,000 BTC of unfulfilled buy orders at time of writing.\n\nMuted reaction\n\nStill, the release today follows a controversial sale in which the mechanisms used to incentivize buyers pushed the total valuation of the token supply to $300m even though only 4% of the tokens were sold.\n\nIn a statement following the conclusion of the auction, Gnosis founder Martin Köppelmann said that the team was ""humbled"" by the community\'s support, and outlined a roadmap for the coming months and years.\n\n""We strongly believe that this distribution will benefit all token holders by ensuring we have sufficient tokens to incentivize ecosystem growth,"" he wrote in response to concerns about the lopsided initial distribution.\n\nCurrently, 99% of the tokens held by Gnosis have been locked for a period of a year.\n\n""These tokens are held for the purposes of incentivizing projects building on top of Gnosis and to bring in additional funding or token distribution for the project if necessary,"" Köppelmann wrote.\n\nAfter the initial boost in trading, eyes are now likely to fall on upcoming announcements concerning the remaining 95% of tokens currently held by the Gnosis team.\n\nTwins image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Jihan Wu is the co-founder of BITMAIN, one of most recognized and valuable bitcoin companies, and has come into limelight as a supporter of Bitcoin Unlimited, a solution to solve Bitcoin’s scalability issue. Jihan Wu founded Bitmain maintains AntPool which holds the largest hashrate distribution amongst mining pools; currently AntPool mines 16.4% of all blocks. This makes Jihan Wu highly influential in the Bitcoin community.\n\nBitmain\n\nBitmain was established in 2013 to develop and sell the world’s leading bitcoin miners using Bitmain's ASIC chip technology. Its initial bitcoin miner was Antminer S1 which was upgraded over time to match up to bitcoin’s “difficulty level.” In May of 2016, Antminer S9, the world’s first consumer-grade bitcoin and most power-efficient miner based on a 16nm process ASIC chip was released by Bitmain. The company is the proud owner of several brands, including Antminer, Antpool, and Hashnest, which are ranked number one in their respective fields. Bitmain is headquartered in Beijing, with offices in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Qingdao, Chengdu and Shenzhen. (Related reading, see: Bitmain's Data Center for Bitcoin Mining Is Nearing Completion)\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\n\nBitcoin blocks have a limited ‘storage’ capacity of 1MB since the beginning and under the current popular system of Bitcoin Core. However, Bitcoin Unlimited argues that the size of these blocks should be increased as it would enable smoother running by decongesting the blocks. Unlike the present rigid size of 1MB, Bitcoin Unlimited advocates complete freedom and flexibility to increase the size of blockchain and this will be done by miners. So, if there is a consensus on this, we will have a new bitcoin blockchain with large-sized blocks.\n\nOpponents of Bitcoin Unlimited feel that increasing the size of blocks can result in a hard fork in the code which would split the network. They also believe that such flexibility can result in miners opting for bigger and bigger blocks – making it harder for miners with limited resources to mine, thereby concentrating the ‘mining power’ in the hands of few miners. Such concentration will essentially result in centralization which is opposite to the idea of decentralization which is core to bitcoin. (Related reading, see: What Is Bitcoin Unlimited?)\n\nJihan Wu has been aggressively pushing a hard fork and adoption of Bitcoin Unlimited but hasn't gathered enough support yet. The alternate solution to the problem, called SegWit or Segregated Witness, which doesn't require a hard fork is equally debated and no consensus has emerged. The mining pool support by proposal shows that Bitcoin Unlimited has about 40% support, followed by SegWit at 34% while the rest support BIP100 and 8MB Blocks."", 'Word in China is out about blockchain technology, as the government made clear in an Informatization Strategy published in December of 2016. The strategy states, “The internet, cloud computing, large data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain … will drive the evolution of everything — digital, network and intelligent services will be everywhere.”\n\nIt was an official endorsement for the new digital age and a big boost for blockchain technology.\n\nIn a country with $5.5 trillion in digital payments last year (50 times that of the U.S.), ""blockchain"" is now a buzzword among the titans of industry. And in the race to participate, Chinese banks, builders, suppliers and retailers are pumping out blockchain solutions.\n\nSurvival of the Fittest\n\nEven with millions of dollars, many of these new blockchains may not make it very far. In a recent WeChat post, Antshares executive Erik Zhang stated that 90 percent of the enterprise blockchains we are seeing are doomed to fail. Without an open-source code that anyone can build upon, Zhang argues, private solutions will not see the network effect of a healthy ledger.\n\n\n\nThe big question for China, however, is whether a country known for its centralized authority, and a penchant for all things made-in-China, will allow an open-source, global standard solution to sit on its internet. With Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger vying for dominance, there are big names within China making moves into the space.\n\nA few of these big names include:\n\nThe People’s Bank of China (PBOC) — The PBOC is reportedly close to the release of a government-backed digital RMB currency, which would put China at the frontier of digital currency adoption. And there are whispers within China that Shenzhen will be ground zero for the new digital economy.\n\nIn September, Bloomberg reported that PBOC Vice Governor Fan Yifei wrote: “[T]he conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications.”\n\nThis would pave the way for blockchain startups in China to move forward in digital banking, finance, record-keeping, supply chains, IoT, AI and more.\n\nWanxiang Blockchain Labs — Working with Ethereum, Wanxiang is the largest blockchain development backer in China. After purchasing 500,000 ETH tokens last year, it pledged $30 billion for the development of a smart city in Hangzhou. It offers open-source platforms for anyone to build upon, and launched an accelerator fund for developers, intending to put money into promising projects and integrate digital apps into China’s 21st-century cities.\n\nAt a recent fintech summit in Hangzhou, Dr. Xiao Feng, GM of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, said, “The first generation of internet technology has brought great changes to society. In China great companies like Alibaba, Tencent and Ant Financial have emerged. The blockchain represents the second generation of the internet,” adding that big changes will come with artificial intelligence, encryption, decentralization, finance and the transfer of value.\n\n', 'Bitcoin price is currently enjoying strong support, but a pullback could be needed before more buyers join in on the action.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has been on a tear, moving inside an ascending channel on the long-term chart and above a rising trend line on the short-term time frames.\n\nPrice has recently bounced off the trend line support and is gunning for the channel resistance.\n\nProfit-taking seems highly probable at this point, possibly allowing bitcoin price to make a quick correction.\n\nBitcoin price is currently enjoying strong support, but a pullback could be needed before more buyers join in on the action.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA, still indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. In other words, the uptrend is more likely to continue than to reverse. However, it’s also worth noting that the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to suggest a possible slowdown in bullish momentum.\n\nStochastic is also turning lower from the overbought region, hinting that selling pressure could kick in soon. In that case, a pullback to the trend line support around $1350 could be seen before the rally resumes. RSI is also indicating overbought conditions and appears to be turning south so bitcoin price might follow suit.\n\nMarket Events\n\nUS economic data turned out mostly weaker than expected in the latest New York session, hinting at a possible slowdown in the consumer sector on weak personal income and spending figures. Also, the ISM manufacturing PMI posted a steeper than expected decline, also suggesting a potential downside NFP surprise later on this week.\n\nIf so, this would pile on the latest set of downbeat data from the US, casting more doubt on the Fed’s ability to hike interest rates two more times this year. Note that the earlier NFP reading already came in way below expectations at 98K in March and analysts are expecting a bit of a pickup in April to 194K. As for bitcoin, the lack of negative news has allowed the cryptocurrency to keep advancing on rising demand from Japan.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Price towards the end of last week brought things to trade at fresh highs, and we were looking for these highs to give us something to go at over the weekend. As it turned out, we got plenty of action throughout the Saturday and Sunday session, and we’re heading into this week with some nice solid key levels to go at.\n\nHow things play out this week is anybody’s guess – though we’re hoping that we’ll see some of the same sort of action that brought us to trade at current levels in and around 1361. That said, there’s always the potential for a correction, and that might bring with it a bit of near term weakness. If things turn out that way, then we’ll be ready to get in as and when the markets signal entry.\n\nAnyway, let’s get to today’s action. Before we get started, take a quick look at the chart below. It’s a five-minute candlestick chart and it’s got our key range overlaid in green.\n\nAs the chart shows, then, the range we are going at during the session today is defined by support to the downside at 1346 and resistance to the upside at 1367. There’s plenty of room for an intrarange strategy here, so if we see a bounce from support we’ll be in long towards resistance, and similarly, we’ll be in short towards support on a correction from resistance.\n\nLooking at breakout, if we see a close above resistance, we can get in long towards an upside target of 1380. Looking the other way, a close below resistance will signal an entry towards 1330. Stops on both positions just the other side of the entry will ensure we’re taken out of the trade in the event of a bias reversal.\n\nCharts courtesy of TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

On the latest episode of “The Bitcoin Game,” Blockstack Co-founder Ryan Shea explained how this new ecosystem of dapps works and why it’s important.\n\n\n\n“We’re taking a look at how the internet has become so consolidated,” said Shea. “We’re so reliant upon a very small set of companies, and there are so many external dependencies. We essentially are reliant upon Facebook, Google and Amazon just to use the internet. In a sense, they are the internet.\n\n“They are the lords, and we are the serfs,” Shea added.\n\nAccording to Shea, the original vision of the internet was much more decentralized than how it is structured today. Instead of everyone hosting their own servers, merchants sell their products on Amazon and individuals post their social updates to Facebook. According to some polls, many Facebook users don’t even realize they’re using the internet.\n\nWith so much internet traffic going through a few major portals, Shea said there are a number of concerns related to security, monopoly power and innovation that can arise. In his view, it is important for everyone to control their own safety and freedom on the internet.\n\n“At the end of the day, each of us want to be able to control our own experiences, we want to know that we’re safe and in control and free — whether it’s on the internet or any aspect of our lives,” said Shea.\n\nBlockstack’s ecosystem of dapps is an attempt to redecentralize the internet and bring it back to its roots.\n\nThe Concept of Decentralized Applications\n\nDapps built on top of Blockstack essentially put users in control of their own data and force them to take responsibility for their own security instead of outsourcing it to a third party.\n\n“[Applications run] locally,” said Shea. “If you do that, I do that, and we’re friends with each other on this application, then I can send you a message and it will get sent directly to you and won’t require any other third parties for the message to go through.”\n\nBlockstack uses a new domain name system (DNS) built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain as the basis for these dapps. The DNS allows users to attach information to identities stored on the blockchain. The decentralized DNS allows users to communicate and connect with one another in a direct, secure and encrypted manner.\n\nThe heavy reliance on this new, decentralized DNS means users will need to be able to protect their own private keys. According to Shea, Blockstack is working on a variety of user-friendly key management solutions involving multifactor authentication and hardware wallets.\n\nIn addition to storing data locally, Blockstack users can also back up their encrypted application data on any cloud storage provider, from traditional solutions like Dropbox to new alternatives such as Storj.\n\nSpecifics Examples of Decentralized Applications\n\nAccording to Shea, developers are building a variety of applications on top of Blockstack right now, including a decentralized alternative to Twitter.\n\n“A P2P social network can exist, and the key to that is allowing each user to control their experience on their own local device and then helping users connect to one another so they can discover each other’s content,” said Shea.\n\nShea also had high praise for OpenBazaar, which is a decentralized e-commerce platform that uses Blockstack’s DNS for user names and bitcoin for payments.\n\n“They are the future of commerce,” Shea said of OpenBazaar.\n\nShea is also of the belief that some method of indexing and parsing data on Blockstack’s new, decentralized version of the internet will emerge, which would be similar to what Google has done on the traditional internet.\n\n“Some decentralized network will grow to compete in some way with Google; that’s my prediction,” said Shea.\n\nThoughts on Ethereum\n\nRight now, the dapps that are gaining the most attention are the ones launching initial coin offerings (ICOs) on top of Ethereum rather than building on top of Blockstack.\n\nShea claimed he is “really intrigued” by Ethereum and thinks “very interesting things are being built on top of it,” but he’s also concerned with some of the issues they’ll face over the long term. “I’m concerned about remote code execution,” he said. “I’m concerned about the general philosophy of putting a large amount of logic on the chain, but I think it’s been a great platform where there’s been a lot of prototyping going on.”\n\nIn contrast to most dapps built on Ethereum, Blockstack dapps only utilize a blockchain for the naming layer. “Everything else is off the blockchain,” said Shea.\n\n“Blockstack is blockchain agnostic,” Shea clarified. “Our philosophy is to operate on as many blockchains as possible but, whenever we can, rely upon the most secure and stable blockchain platform. Right now, that’s the Bitcoin blockchain.”', 'Atlanta-based BitPay, a bitcoin payment, and fintech provider announced they’ve released an updated version of the BitPay wallet which adds PIN and fingerprint screen locking, a much user-requested security and privacy feature for wallets on shared devices. The company also added new options for sending bitcoin to other bitcoin addresses and the BitPay Card.\n\nHere are some more details on a couple of the major changes in the v3.1 release:\n\nOptional Fingerprint and PIN screen locks\n\nIf sharing a mobile device with friends, family, co-workers, or kids, a user might not want them poking around in their bitcoin wallet. The new optional fingerprint and PIN screen locks protect the wallet app from unwanted or accidental intrusion and give it additional privacy protection.\n\nThe BitPay team said:\n\n“A PIN alone won’t provide full security for the bitcoin private keys required to spend your bitcoin. If you want serious security for your funds, we strongly recommend creating a multi-signature, called a “shared” wallet in the BitPay app.” “You can share a multi-signature wallet with trusted friends or split the private keys required to move funds between 2 or 3 of your own devices. This makes it almost impossible for even the most determined attacker to gain access to your funds.”\n\nLow-fee delay warning for transactions\n\nIf you receive a transaction with a low miner fee, BitPay now lets you know to expect longer confirmation times on the Bitcoin network.\n\nIf a user is the one sending transactions and wants to change their wallet’s miner fee policy to increase confirmation speed, they can do so in your wallet settings under “Bitcoin Network Fee Policy.”']"
05/02/2017,"['LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin surged to an all-time high above $1,400 on Tuesday, after more than tripling in value over the past year, with its most recent rise attributed to strong demand in Japan, where the digital currency has been deemed a legal means of payment.\n\nCryptocompare, a data website that analyses bitcoin trading across dozens of exchanges globally, said around 50 percent of trading volume over the past 24 hours had been on the bitcoin/Japanese yen exchange rate.\n\n“The Japanese have recently warmed their approach towards bitcoin by treating it legally as a form of payment - a ratification and bringing into the regulatory fold,” said Charles Hayter, the website’s founder.\n\n“China’s clampdown on exchanges can also be seen as a positive move for the industry too,” he added.\n\nChinese authorities have increased scrutiny of exchanges this year and have forced them to start charging trading fees, after becoming concerned about bitcoin speculation and its potential use in money laundering.\n\nBitcoin surged as much as 3 percent on Tuesday on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, where trading is dollar-denominated, to hit $1,437 BTC=BTSP, its highest since its 2008 launch. That marked a more than 200 percent increase from its price in early May last year.\n\nIts current levels put the total value of all bitcoins in circulation - the so-called “market cap” - close to $25 billion, putting its worth on a par with a large-cap company.\n\nBitcoin analysts said the price had also been boosted by a request by the BATS exchange that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission review its March decision not to approve a bitcoin-tracking ETF set up by the Winklevoss brothers.', 'The price of Bitcoin went up by over 210% during the past year, trading from about $450 in mid-2016 to record-breaking levels of $1,400 in May 2017. In the eight years since its founding, Bitcoin has braved skepticism, rejection, and experienced volatility, to the present day, when it’s slowly being recognized by governments and even dubbed as an emerging asset class. Here’s a look at the dynamics behind Bitcoin’s rising price.\n\nBitcoin was created in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis to operate outside of central governments, banks and financial institutions. Over these years, Bitcoin’s framework has challenged regulators, as most of them struggled to find ways to bring it under control. This led to some countries banning it or making it illegal, while some others remained observant and the rest worked out ways to tax and regulate its operations. However, the ‘uncertainty’ angle remained in sight. Although there still isn’t a very clear stance by many countries, a number of nations are coming out in support of the cryptocurrency.\n\nJapan has recently recognized Bitcoin as a legal method of payment, although it continues to be treated as an asset, and not as a currency. In India, the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has constituted a committee to examine the existing framework around Virtual Currencies (VCs). The committee will not just examine the present status of VCs in India and around the globe, but will also suggest measures to deal with consumer protection and money laundering. The committee will be submitting its report by July.\n\nAt the same time, Russia, a staunch opponent of cryptocurrencies, has taken a U-turn. In an interview to Bloomberg, Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said that in an attempt to combat money laundering, the Russian authorities hope to legalize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument in 2018. He further stated, “The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain. If there’s a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.” While, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the central bank of the Republic of the Philippines, issued a guideline recognizing Bitcoin as a legal payment method.\n\nThe legitimacy of Bitcoin’s existence doesn’t just come in direct ways; approvals of investment products based on Bitcoin indicate what regulators think - the reason why Bitcoin prices tanked to about $900 levels from $1300 when SEC disapproved of the Bitcoin ETF by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Nevertheless, the SEC was positive for the future, as the document read, “The Commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop. Should such markets develop, the Commission could consider whether a bitcoin ETP would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.” Interestingly, SEC has now granted a request for review of its decision of disapproval.\n\nThe efforts to bring Bitcoin-linked products are a direct result of its growing demand as more and more people are looking to invest in cryptocurrencies. Although there are products such as Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which is traded OTC (filed with SEC for a NYSE listing) and exchange-traded funds from ARK Investment Management, they offer limited exposure and opportunity to invest in Bitcoins. While the former is meant only for accredited investors, the latter have a very small holding in Bitcoins.\n\nHowever, there is an option to invest for the long-term in Bitcoins for retirement by opening a self-directed Bitcoin IRA account, approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The scheme has been welcomed warmly and has gathered around $10 million till date, which reflects the underlying confidence of investors. (Related reading, see: This is the First Bitcoin IRA Approved by the IRS)\n\nBitcoin start-ups have attracted huge investments in Bitcoin and blockchain companies with a total funding of $550 million in 2016, as per a report. Additionally, many prominent investors have been raising direct stakes in Bitcoin, thus suggesting an optimistic future for cryptocurrencies. Billionaire Mike Novogratz recently revealed that he holds 10% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum . He now predicts Bitcoin to go past $2,000. (Related Reading, see: More Billionaires Are Buying Cryptocurrencies)\n\n“Today Bitcoins have a market capitalization of $23 billion, if two years from now that number is $100 billion, I would not be surprised,” says Amith Nirgunarthy, CEO, BlockStreet.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile the above seem to the most evident reasons, there are many geopolitical and economic reasons lying underneath, including Trump’s presidency, rising debt levels in some of the prominent economies around the world, rate hike by the Federal Reserve and, to some extent, exhausted monetary policy options available with central banks. A report by Saxo Bank predicts that Bitcoin could cross the $2,000 mark, “If the banking system as well as sovereigns such as Russia and China move to accept Bitcoin as a partial alternative to the USD and the traditional banking and payment system.” With multiple factors at play, the outlook looks bright. Having said that, as an investor, don’t jump to grab it at its peak. Bitcoin is still reactive to news and will give an opportunity to buy or invest at more reasonable levels.', 'Former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis doesn\'t waste any time asserting that his new employer is seeking to disrupt bitcoin\'s established development process.\n\nMatonis, who joined the secretive startup nChain today, is quick to state that this is the ambition of the London and Vancouver-based operation he now claims has 60 full-time employees, including infamous developer Craig Wright.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, nChain was started by Wright, the 46-year-old computer scientist who claims to be bitcoin\'s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto (though he hasn\'t offered much evidence). To date, nChain hasn\'t offered much to support its assertions that it\'s now the industry\'s best-funded startup either, hinting only that it has received more than $100m from Malta-based high-tech private equity fund SICAV plc as part of an acquisition.\n\nYet, it\'s a different company that Matonis has in mind in conversation – San Francisco-based blockchain services firm Blockstream.\n\nLong the subject of criticism for the significant financial support it provides to developers working on bitcoin\'s open-source protocol and its primary implementation Bitcoin Core, Blockstream has been villainized for that group\'s roadmap for scaling bitcoin, specifically its decision to prioritize innovations that don\'t alter a hard-coded limit on block size.\n\nMatonis told CoinDesk:\n\n""I immediately recognized nChain would be an effective challenger to Blockstream, which is definitely needed in the space.""\n\nIn conversation, Matonis echoes a familiar refrain, that Blockstream and Bitcoin Core are too intertwined, and that Core\'s roadmap doesn\'t have broad community support.\n\nIn Matonis\'s view, bitcoin can once again return to the days when its blockchain was able to quickly clear its backlog of transactions with virtually no fees, while providing more advanced scripting languages – if only other software implementations gain transaction.\n\nYet, in conversation, Matonis backed away from the idea that nChain was ""taking aim"" at Blockstream, despite his frequent barbs aimed at the company.\n\nRather, Matonis spoke broadly of what he clarified is nChain\'s broader attempt to introduce choice into a bitcoin software market he described as in need of competition.\n\n""There\'s a lot of resistance to the Blockstream model of pushing everything to a second layer, pushing SegWit and Lightning as the only solutions,"" he said:\n\n""We don\'t have to settle for just one approach.""\n\nProduct strategy\n\nSuch comments come at time when alternative blockchain networks have come to show progress on flashier, more publicly popular updates to their technology, a development that stands in contrast to bitcoin\'s now years-long scaling debate and offers some weight to critiques of Core\'s model.\n\nFor example, ethereum is hard at work on innovations that would find it redefining how large blockchain networks reach consensus, while litecoin has more quickly adopted innovations originally intended for increasing bitcoin\'s transaction capacity. (Though it would be wrong to say Core developers aren\'t progressing).\n\nHowever, ethereum, which lacks a reference implementation, is seen as more welcoming to alternatives, as its parity and geth clients allow developers a choice between competing softwares. (The benefit, proponents say, is that in instances of attack, should one fail, the other could emerge unaffected).\n\nFormer Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik, for instance, are two voices that have supported the idea, the latter calling multiple implementations ""healthier than a homogeneous monoculture"" with one reference implementation.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, phase one of the nChain\'s action plan is to release a software development kit (SDK) that Matonis said will likely be given away for free as a means of proliferating alternatives to Bitcoin Core, used today by 85% of network nodes.\n\nMatonis said the SDK will offer users the ability to boot up ""specialized nodes"" that would enable faster block propagation, a feature he contends would make scaling the bitcoin blockchain through a block size increase easier while appealing to node operators.\n\n""The SDK is going to enable on-chain scaling for bitcoin without degrading decentralization,"" Matonis said.\n\nAlready, he said nChain has been in talks with miners about the idea. But, how does this work within bitcoin\'s existing architecture?\n\nAccording to Matonis, nChain\'s SDK will be different from newer Bitcoin Core competitors including Bitcoin Unlimited and Bcoin, which he framed as being more compatible with Core. Bitcoin Unlimited, for example, is a version of Bitcoin Core with new features added. Likewise, BCoin was built from scratch, but to be compatible with Bitcoin Core.\n\n""nChain allows for other developers to build their own implementations using the techniques and innovations that we\'ve tested here,"" Matonis continued.\n\nIn this way, Matonis suggested that nChain believes it could gain enough traction on the network to become a popular implementation for other developers, thereby getting rid of the notion that one implementation is big enough to be called a reference at all.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Our mission is to separate the protocol from its one true reference.""\n\nHard fork coming?\n\nAsked how the strategy would impact the bitcoin network, Matonis said that nChain\'s software will enable network stakeholders to choose between the two implementations, a development that he projects could spur a network split if successful.\n\nShould nChain launch its implementation to widespread adoption, Matonis suggested that miners and node operators could be forced to choose between two competing versions of bitcoin\'s blockchain history – one kept by Bitcoin Core and the other by nChain.\n\n""This is the governance model for bitcoin, there’s no other governance model. If you can\'t get traction with pull requests, you launch software propagation battles, and when one reference implementation has greater than 50% or 75%, you can attempt a fork of the network,"" Matonis explained.\n\nSuch a scenario has long been the subject of fears in the bitcoin development community. For example, the idea that a hard fork could possibly disrupt the validity of the bitcoin blockchain was factor cited by Bitcoin Core developers in their support for their proposed scaling solutions.\n\nBut, given the risk of creating two separate bitcoin assets in the process, why not build a competing blockchain network? According to Matonis, the answer is hashing power.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency markets such as ethereum and litecoin have recently hit notable highs, it\'s bitcoin\'s miners that Matonis believes makes it more valuable.\n\n\n\n""It will make bitcoin more competitive against altcoins,"" Matonis said of the implementation, invoking the idea that the design is similar to that seen in the open-source Linux project.\n\nStill, Matonis reports nChain is working on larger goals to make bitcoin useful beyond just being a store of value, one he suggested would have greater societal benefits.\n\n""I want to elevate the sector beyond fintech to a more general computation market for enterprise computing,"" he said, concluding:\n\n""We\'re still a small group fighting in the weeds. I’m looking beyond, there’s a much larger market across many verticals.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream and Purse, the creators of Bcoin.\n\nRobots fighting via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The cryptocurrency hit a record $1,484.68 before paring its gains. Now, it\'s trading up 2.65% at $1452.92 a coin as of 1:37 p.m. ET.\n\nTuesday\'s advance has the bitcoin on track for its 11th gain in the past 12 sessions, and marks a second straight day of record highs.\n\nBitcoin\'s latest streak comes after the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced last week that it will reconsider the Winklevoss ETF. The SEC will accept public comment on its previous decision until May 15.\n\nBack in March, the SEC rejected two bitcoin ETFs, saying it ""is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.""\n\nBitcoin gained 20% in the first week of 2017 before crashing 35% on fears China would crack down on trading. Since then, it has rallied 95% despite China restricting trade, the SEC rejecting two bitcoin ETFs, and threats from developers of creating a ""hard fork"" that would split the cryptocurrency in two.\n\nBitcoin has been the top-performing currency every year since 2010, aside from 2014.

""This is the first crypto-currency with a real value,"" R Fintech’s CEO, Ignacio M Ozcariz, told reporters in Geneva.\n\nTo start, the company has valued one bilur as equivalent to 6.5 barrels of Brent crude oil, making it an asset worth $356 (€326). Texas-based oil company Hockley has initially set aside 1-million barrels of crude as collateral to underpin the currency, but has told R Fintech it can ramp up if bilur becomes popular.\n\nLike bitcoin, bilur is run with so-called blockchain technology, in which encrypted digital coins are created by super-computers, regulated and controlled by a community of users who try to guard against counterfeiting.\n\nBitcoin was the world’s top performing currency in 2016 and continues to hover around record highs of $1,400, after being worth just a few cents when it launched in 2009. It has appealed to those interested in bank-free transactions and drawn to money not controlled by a government or central bank. But detractors have suggested that bitcoin could ultimately be undermined by its volatility, noting that the currency dramatically lost 75% of its value in 2013.\n\nBilur is targeting those who like aspects of virtual currency trading but would prefer funds supported by a fixed asset — similar to a gold standard for traditional currencies. ""We’re still a crypto-currency, we’re just backing it up with a real physical thing,"" said Usama al Ali, an IT specialist at R Fintech. With the project in its infancy, there are no merchants accepting bilur as a valid form of payment.\n\nBitcoin is, in contrast, increasingly accepted by merchants worldwide. R Fintech said it aims to make money through a small management fee, charging bilur holders roughly 3% per year. The name ""bilur"" is the Basque language word for ""chain"", a nod to blockchain technology.\n\nAFP', 'Software giant Atlassian’s co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes has hinted he has been a long-term holder of Bitcoin.\n\nIn a series of tweets Monday, the billionaire joint head of the Australian enterprise noted how $10,000 worth of BTC bought in 2010 was now worth around $146 mln.\n\nContrasted with gold or USD holdings, he suggests, Bitcoin is a clear winner.\n\n“...My BTC bet is paying out well. Theory? ‘It will be worth a lot, or zero.’ Much like horse racing. Not like investing,” he wrote.\n\nYup, my BTC bet is paying out well. Theory? “It will be worth a lot, or zero”. Much like a horse racing. Not like investing. https://t.co/VrGz6JzWoQ — Mike Cannon-Brookes (@mcannonbrookes) April 30, 2017\n\nCannon-Brookes’ “theory” is reminiscent of early Bitcoin days, when pioneering investors took on considerably higher risk when buying cryptocurrencies in bulk.\n\nAs local news source Sydney Morning Herald reports, it remains unknown what the entrepreneur’s holdings in Bitcoin are, how long he has held them and whether he is planning any uses for the funds other than storage as a personal investment.\n\nIn a further tweet, perhaps intended in an ironic light, Cannon-Brookes noted that an “ounce” of Bitcoin is worth more than an ounce of gold.\n\nAn ounce of Bitcoin is finally worth more than an ounce of gold. https://t.co/0NEa0Szq2z — Mike Cannon-Brookes (@mcannonbrookes) April 30, 2017\n\nThis news is not new, Cointelegraph having reported on the first time the Bitcoin gold barrier achieved parity earlier this year.\n\nWhat an “ounce” of Bitcoin would consist of meanwhile is open to interpretation.', 'A year and a half ago, the idea of buying the virtual currency bitcoin was laughable. After a rapid rise in value in 2013, the cryptocurrency\'s value more than halved by mid-2015. At its lowest point, one bitcoin was equal to about $230. But now Bitcoin is at an all-time high, and rising. Within the last month, the price of one bitcoin has climbed from $1,280 to around $1,480. Given the currency\'s covert nature, the average person still may not understand how buying and selling actually works. Using the app Coinbase, which lets anyone trade bitcoins for a small fee, we decided to find out. A brief warning: If you\'re going to do this, tell your bank you\'re about to buy bitcoin. More on that later. View As: One Page Slides\n\nThis is what the Coinbase app looks like on an iPhone.\n\nWhen you first open the app, you\'re presented with the latest price of bitcoin and its change within a certain period. You can see in the chart below how wild the latest moves have been.\n\nI happen to be one of the many who have never traded bitcoin before. There\'s a certain level of wariness in buying into the cryptocurrency world.\n\nHowever, Coinbase\'s interface makes it simple to enter the basic personal information it needs to create your account.\n\nUser-friendliness quickly hit a snag. When I put in my address, the app didn\'t recognize I had already selected it from the autofill menu. I couldn\'t proceed unless I switched to the desktop app.\n\nSo switch I did. From the desktop portal I could easily enter more identifying info.\n\nThe final step before entering my financial information was two-step verification for security, which Coinbase quickly sent to my phone.\n\nI decided to give the app another try and opted to use my debit card to buy the bitcoin.\n\nEntering all my information was just as straightforward as everything else. The problem was that I couldn\'t exit this screen. Neither the ""buy"" nor ""not now"" option registered. I had to press the X and start all over.\n\nUltimately, and frustratingly, it was back to the desktop. So far, the actual process of buying bitcoin was simple — the app itself was my only nemesis. My $50 ended up buying 0.0524 of one bitcoin.\n\nNo looking back! (Until I sell, of course.)\n\nOh. It appeared the price was falling pretty fast the morning I decided to buy. I went back to try again, doing my best to outrun the falling price.\n\nI own bitcoin! Well, a small fraction of a bitcoin. But now this means I could sit on my hypothetical tiny pile of cryptocurrency and hope it amasses value.\n\nInstead, I decide to sell off immediately. (But not before shedding a single tear for the 12 cents I\'ve already had to part with.)\n\nTo sell the bitcoin, Coinbase only allows users to pair their bank account with the app; a credit or debit card won\'t suffice.\n\nSo I scrolled through the options to pick my bank.\n\nAnd we\'re back to the desktop. When I tried to sell the bitcoin, the app told me either the amount was invalid or I couldn\'t pay with the given method. I didn\'t understand what that meant and didn\'t want to enter a wrong number.\n\nLuckily, the online experience is much smoother. My bank account showed up right where it should have, and I sold the bitcoin just like I bought it.\n\nSince Coinbase wasn\'t linked to my bank account, the transaction needs a few days to process before the money is transferred.\n\nA small hiccup: When I went to sell the bitcoin, I had to estimate the amount. The numbers were inconsistent in certain places depending on the bitcoin value or the dollar value. I ended up with one penny left over.', 'Online gambling is a multibillion dollar enterprise today with no dearth of options available to the customers. One of the biggest niche markets in the gambling industry is bitcoin gambling. The proliferation of the betting sites dealing in cryptocurrency is telling of the user base it has come to enjoy.\n\nIn the contemporary digital world, Bitcoin has been adopted by many businesses and people around the world, and among these businesses are the Bitcoin online casinos. The bitcoin casinos bring betting games, in traditional and new innovative forms to the customers dealing in cryptocurrency.\n\nGambling with Bitcoins is easier, faster and much more lucrative than with any other fiat currency. The deposits and withdrawal with Bitcoin are practically free at most of the casinos. The processing fee incurred on Bitcoin transaction is nominal when compared to credit card transactions. Bitcoin is also a safer alternative as chargebacks are almost impossible, and the speed with which payments are processed makes it even safer.\n\nMoreover, even though the system is completely transparent, the option to maintain anonymity and hence privacy on the user’s part, further helps the case for online bitcoin gambling.\n\nTherefore, it is not difficult to comprehend the reason for the kind of popularity bitcoin-based gambling has come to enjoy in the recent years. And due to the ever expanding customer base caused by an increase in bitcoin adopters around the world, the options for bitcoin gambling are only multiplying.\n\nThe options available to online bitcoin gamblers have expanded to include Bitcoin Live Casinos, Online Sportsbooks, casinos offering role playing games and many more, along with the traditional online casinos.\n\nBitcoin Live Casinos have gained popularity with an increased accessibility to improved network speeds and strengthened computer configurations. The wide range of casino games at live bitcoin casinos are broadcasted in real time with real dealers. The gaming options available at most of the live bitcoin casinos include live roulette, live blackjack, live baccarat, live lottery, live dice, live poker etc. Since, there are more than a handful of these live casinos, sites like LiveCasinos keep a tab of the best out of the lot.\n\nAnother option available to bitcoin gamblers is online sports betting. Online bitcoin sports betting conflates three of the major interests of the users: sports, gambling and bitcoin. There are many bitcoin sports betting sites in market today, and sites like Bitcoin Gambling Guide help the users to pick the best suited websites for them.\n\nWhile all the new options in online bitcoin gambling do attract a fair share of users, the traditional casinos still command a major share of the user base. And sites like Casinos Online help keep track of the best traditional online casinos on the block.\n\nIn a world with options galore, the decision to pick a few out of the many becomes extremely difficult. So, it is paramount that the gamblers have a clear understanding of the options available to them in order for them to make an informed choice every time without losing any real money.\n\nTherefore, it is advisable for the punters to first go through a few review websites before they select one of the many online bitcoin casinos in the market. Information regarding the features of the enlisted betting sites, promotions and bonus offers, and betting markets, everything is provided by the review sites to help punters pick the best suited option for them.', 'The Sovrin Foundation, a non-profit organization building online identity management tools with blockchain-inspired technologies, announced today that it will be taken on for incubation by Hyperledger Indy, a project run by the the Linux Foundation.\n\nThe problem of identity has attracted a whole flock of developers in the blockchain and distributed ledger space who see these technologies as a way to scoop up all the scraps of an individual’s online identity, consolidate them and put them under the individual’s control.\n\nToday, for the most part, we lack that control. We have surrendered ourselves to the likes of Facebook, Google, Twitter and Amazon, whose profiles on their customers are so extensive that they are now, themsleves, used as standard identity verifiers across most Internet domains. Want to leave a comment? Just sign in with Facebook. Trying to get into your Medium account? Just login with Twitter.\n\nAnd if those companies suddenly disappear, so too does your online identity.\n\nMeanwhile, asserting more important things about yourself online is just as difficult as ever. You can efile your taxes, but first you’ll need that PIN from the IRS that you set up a bajillion years ago that somehow proves you are who you say you are.\n\nIt’s a terrible mess. And according to Phil Windley, the chair of the Sovrin Foundation, the best way to fix it is to use distributed ledger technology to make something that looks more like what we have offline.\n\n“In the physical world I go to my pharmacy and they ask for my driver’s license to prove I’m over 18 and I supply it to them. They don’t have to have a direct connection to the Department of Motor Vehicles. They don’t have to have any kind of API integration to make that work. Because I am the conveyer of this verifiable claim called a driver’s license. That hasn’t been possible on the Internet and Sovrin makes that possible,” says Windley.\n\nIn this alternate view, it is the individual who possesses all the pieces of their identity, which ranges from mundane testimonials about what your favorite movie is, to critical information like age and date of birth.\n\nIn Sovrin, these facts about you (or pointers for where to find these facts) would all reside on a distributed public ledger which you alone had the authority to access and share. Other entities, however, could modify your claim by signing off on them with a cryptographic key, thereby adding weight and credibility to the pieces of your identity. For example, you may have an identity on the Sovrin network which specifies your driver’s license number and that information might be signed by your state’s DMV.\n\nThe technology has a slight whiff of blockchain, but doesn’t really have a blockchain. Rather, it is a ledger that is replicated over mulitple nodes that all coordinate to make updates and police the system and which together make up the Sovrin network. The nodes are invite-only, meaning that the ledger is public, but permissioned. As a result, Sovrin functions without the participation of miners, which makes it less expensive and less energy hungry than your typical open blockchain.\n\nWindley says that he envisions the first applications coming from the financial sector. Banks could participate as node operators to maintain the ledger and provide it as the repository for their customers’ identities. If given permission by the customer, multiple banks could access this information in a single place in order to comply with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations.\n\nIn joining Hyperledger Indy, Sovrin is donating all of its code and getting back developer power in return.\n\nThere are currently many other groups working in the blockchain and distributed ledger space to build self-sovereign identity systems. Bitnation began using the blockchain to issue its own nation state-independent version of a passport in 2014. That project now resides on the Ethereum network which also supports another identity management tool called uPort. And Civic is building out a similar project on Bitcoin.\n\nWindley doesn’t necessarily see them as competition. “I believe that there won’t be a single identity solution; there’s going to be multiples,” he says. “We’re going to live in a world with multiple identity systems because they have different properties and [meet] different needs.”', 'Nixa entrepreneur pleads guilty to illegal bitcoin exchange\n\nPosted online May 2, 2017 | 9:57 pm\n\nA Nixa entrepreneur behind multiple tech companies pleaded guilty in federal court today to conducting an illegal money transmitting business by exchanging bitcoin for cash without a license.\n\n\n\nJason Klein, 37, waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Rush to federal charges of conducting an unlicensed and unregistered money transmitting business, according to a news release from the office of Tom Larson, acting U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri.\n\n\n\nKlein is the founder of two technology-based companies: Logic Forte and Datality Networks and currently is president of the Association of Information Technology Professionals–Southwest Missouri.\n\n\n\nLogic Forte has taken part in multiple startup competitions in the Ozarks, including the 2016 Pitch Pit as part of the Spin 66 Innovation Summit and Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce’s Go Big Pitch Competition in 2015.\n\n\n\nBy pleading guilty today, Klein admitted he represented himself on the internet as a bitcoin exchanger, according to the release. However, Klein was not a licensed money transmitter with the state of Missouri or with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as required by federal and state laws.\n\n\n\nBitcoins are a decentralized form of electronic currency, existing entirely on the internet and not in any physical form. The currency is not issued by any government, bank or company, but rather is generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a peer-to-peer network.\n\n\n\nBetween Feb. 6, 2015, and July 27, 2016, Klein, acting with another unnamed person, met with two undercover federal agents on numerous occasions to exchange bitcoin for cash. Today’s plea agreement cites five separate transactions in which money – ranging from $1,000 to $15,000 – was exchanged in person for an electronic transfer of bitcoin. Each of the transactions included a fee that Klein or another person charged the undercover agents, for a total of $2,122 in fees, according to the release.\n\n\n\nIn one case, an agent responded to an online advertisement posted by Klein. Klein then told the agent his rate included a 10 percent commission “for an in-person $1,000 cash exchange.”\n\n\n\nUnder federal statutes, Klein is subject to a sentence of up to five years in federal prison without parole. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the U.S. Probation Office.\n\n\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Casey Clark. It was investigated by IRS Criminal Investigation.']"

For years, the question of who created bitcoin has been one of the biggest parlor games in some corners of cryptography and computer science, one that might not be over despite Craig Wright\x92s claim of authorship. But bitcoin sleuthing has never been easy. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File)\n\nIn this age of virtual reality and talk of space elevators and head transplants, it can be hard to know what is real versus “fake news.” But when you hear talk of Bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrency, believe it.\n\nIn fact, the phenomenon of “magic internet money” could very quickly change all of our lives forever. Bitcoin and blockchains stand to improve vastly access to financial services and sound money for people in countries that currently suffer from poor financial and monetary policies. And cryptocurrency may vastly increase financial privacy and freedom for law-abiding people worldwide.\n\nThe future of innovative virtual currency offers so much promise because the current system has big drawbacks.\n\nUnder the current system, national currencies such as the U.S. dollar are issued by central banks such as the Federal Reserve. Central banks control the money supply, but those quasi-government planners don’t always get it right. And the resulting unstable money supplies or high inflation rates make investment and financial planning difficult in many parts of the world. Perversely, central bank policies often seem to help insiders amass great wealth while sometimes producing economic shocks and financial calamity.\n\nThe current system is already mostly digital. Most of the new money entering the economy will never be minted in the form of bank notes and coins. According to some estimates, only 8 percent of the world’s currency now exists as physical cash. The rest is held electronically on private ledgers kept in computer hard drives at the world’s major financial institutions.\n\nBut the entire set-up relies on a complex network of trust and middlemen: Account holders trust their banks to keep an accurate record of their holdings and to have sufficient reserves to back them up. Banks similarly trust each other’s record-keeping in order to fulfill their customers’ transactions and transfers. And the whole world must trust central banks to respect their self-imposed inflation targets and guidelines.\n\nUnfortunately, this convoluted system can be error-prone, expensive and slow. A European bank may charge its clients $15 to send $100 to a U.S. bank account, only for the U.S. bank to charge its client an additional $30 international wire fee upon reception. And the whole process takes five business days. Banks and other financial institutions sometimes become insolvent, costing customers or taxpayers (in the case of “too-big-too-fail”) billions of dollars in bail-ins and bail-outs.\n\nThis is where blockchain technology comes in: It eliminates the need for government money and monetary systems.\n\nA blockchain is a decentralized public ledger showing financial transactions to all observers. Trades of digital currency are safeguarded using encryption (“cryptocurrency”) rather than the records of fallible banks and other institutions.\n\nBitcoin is currently the most popular and widely used blockchain money. With Bitcoin, everyone worldwide follows the same rules and knows exactly what to expect: The “inflation rate” is set in stone, as is the entire transaction history of the network. And the conditions for a user to be able to move “coins” or units from one account to another are the same for all users. A person who owns bitcoins can always verify or prove ownership to others using the information on the Bitcoin blockchain. That is better than holding assets in traditional banks, which are only promises appearing on a piece of paper or a website.\n\nAnother advantage to Bitcoin is that there is no risk of a bank run or hyper-inflation. Transactions are borderless: There are no extra fees or permissions needed to trade with someone in another country.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology could also have dramatic effects in countless other areas where the trustworthiness and verifiability of data (and data ownership) pose a problem, including financial/stock markets, intellectual property (like copyrights), and medical records.\n\nIt should be no surprise that all this change has regulatory agencies around the world feeling threatened. Just over the past month we have seen the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission strike down proposals for Bitcoin-based exchange traded funds (mutual funds that track indexes like the NASDAQ-100 Index and S&P 500). The Indian Ministry of Finance has created a special committee to study digital currencies and how they are regulated worldwide. And the People’s Bank of China has initiated a series of inquiries.\n\nOf course, there are various risks and business flops associated with this new technology, and those problems are getting extra hype and scrutiny from government and the news media. But government agencies and established leading financial institutions have no business holding back Bitcoin and blockchain technology that offers such great potential to help people gain better opportunities and financial security.', 'Aside from the longstanding conflicts in the Bitcoin community and the recent upsurge in the capital outflow to other cryptocurrencies, do you think $2000 seems a sure range that could have been reached by now?\n\nBitcoin’s eventful life\n\nThe price had almost closed in on $1,300 before the March 25 struggle over the scalability issue which dropped the price to $908. This is quite understandable as a factor to cause panic in the market and hinder the flow of interest.\n\nThe price regained its strength in the most part of April when the “altcoin bubble” was somewhat used frequently.\n\nNow, even when some of the suggested factors that are likely to affect the price in May are yet to come, the price hovers around $1,450. The French election, India’s decision on digital currencies, a review of the ETF decision by the SEC and we are not even sure of when the standoff between some banks and digital currency exchanges would end. Three major exchanges Bitfinex, OKCoin and BTC-e have separately reported that they’ve been unable to process transactions in dollars. None of these is certain to change anything in the price.\n\nThe bar is set\n\nWhat is clear is that Bitcoin isn’t getting any cheaper. The side view it’s been getting from a section of the market, particularly mainstream investors is gradually turning into a full glare.\n\nProbably this is because they are getting to realize that there is no other technology like it or because some of them have tried and had seen that it is really worth it.\n\nWith a meager $21 bln total market cap - or thereabout, the market potential for the digital currency which has been seen as the main backbone for others tends to be unveiling its huge opportunities. More digital currency-linked innovation are introduced day by day by shrewd minds who are bent on making its relevance known to our existence. It is paying off though.\n\nGradually, its market is setting off to rise from the $20 bln cap for the next $20 bln where it would likely get more serious investors involved. Yet, it is still appropriate to say that a lot of those who can afford a full unit of Bitcoin at its current rate are still not into it.\n\nOn the other hand, not all of the several people in developing countries who are getting introduced to it can afford to claim one. The interest Bitcoin has generated so far - the new all-time high set and the price rise over an ounce of gold - in the mainstream media is a catalyst that would bridge some of the gaps in due time.', 'I\'ll Say It Again: Ethereum Beats Bitcoin\n\nPeriodically, for the past three years, I\'ve written about the blockchain technologies of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The motivation for doing so was the conceptual introduction of the need for a blockchain technology other than Bitcoin; which I discussed in the column, ""Ethereum Is a True Game-Changer.""\n\nAs Ethereum moved from concept to development and application during the past few years, I intermittently wrote columns concerning its negative implications for the commercial viability of Bitcoin.\n\nThe 2016 columns ""Bitcoin Is Dead, Long Live the Blockchain"" and ""Performing an Autopsy on the Bitcoin"" elicited a lot of comments, mostly disagreeing with my belief that Ethereum would displace Bitcoin completely in the commercial space.\n\nEven though I haven\'t written about the subject in over a year, I still receive queries and challenges to those columns almost daily. When I\'m speaking at a conference, I am also asked about the issue even if it\'s not a part of the subject matter being presented.\n\nThe booleanized version of my response is to buy Ethereum-related technology and Ether, and avoid Bitcoin altogether.\n\nThat was my message three years ago and is still my message.\n\nAbout a year after I first wrote about the concept of Ethereum, its cryptocurrency, Ether, became available at $1.35 per Ether unit. It was about $8 at the beginning of this year and is now about $80.\n\nThat\'s a staggering performance for 19 months and naturally leads to questions about whether it\'s overdone.\n\nAlthough a correction is obviously possible for any number of reasons, I continue to believe the Ethereum technology will displace Bitcoin entirely and that it is still in the very early phases of its adoption, expansion and value increase.\n\nThe inertia behind the recent investor interest in Ethereum is due to the increased commercial application of the technology, especially by the financial sector, and the commensurate disinterest in pursuing Bitcoin.\n\nThis is evidenced in the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance just a few months ago, and the even more recent announcement by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) that it is going to terminate its relationship with the group that was pursuing Bitcoin technology as the principal commercial application technology.\n\nWhat\'s most interesting about this is that it is all occurring as Bitcoin continues to reach new record highs almost daily.\n\nThat increase has led many to tell me Bitcoin is still the preferred technology.\n\nSince Ether was introduced in September 2015, its price has increased about 6,000%. During the same time period, Bitcoin has increased by about 650%.\n\nAs good as Bitcoin\'s performance has been, the performance of Ether should give investors pause in considering the relative potential of the two.\n\nEarlier this year, the SEC decided not to allow a Bitcoin ETF to be listed. It is considering the same issue for Ether and I think there is a greater chance of it being approved than there was for Bitcoin.\n\nIf that happens, the inertia pushing Ethereum to displace Bitcoin will increase and accelerate.\n\nEven if it doesn\'t, though, I believe the shift by the largest technology and financial firms to Ethereum and away from Bitcoin will continue.\n\nThe safest way to speculate on the trajectory I\'ve written about playing out, beyond purchasing Ether, is to take positions in those firms participating in the Ethereum Alliance: Microsoft (MSFT) , Intel (INTC) , JPMorgan Chase and UBS Group (UBS) .', 'A LocalBitcoins user based in Missouri has plead guilty to running an unlicensed money transmission business.\n\nAccording to a statement from the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri, Jason Klein plead guilty to the charge yesterday after selling bitcoin to two undercover agents on five occasions between February 2015 and July 2016. Prosecutors argued that he failed to obtain approval from both the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as well as the Missouri government to operate a money transmission business.\n\nAll told, Klein sold roughly 98 bitcoins to the agents, according to court documents, accruing about $30,000 over that period and charging commission on top of those sales. An unnamed second individual took part in two of those transactions, the documents state, but the identity of that person was not included in the record.\n\nA LocalBitcoins account name identified in court documents shows that Klein has been selling bitcoins since at least 2013, with most of the publicly available feedback posted in that year. According to the site, he was last seen online eight months ago.\n\nKlein is being represented by Mark Milton of St Louis-based law firm Husch Blackwell, along with Baker Marquart\'s Brian Klein (the two are not related), who said in a statement:\n\n""Jason has accepted responsibility for his actions, and we intend to ask the Court to sentence him to probation (no prison time). We have no further comment at this time.""\n\nAccording to a copy of the plea agreement, Klein faces as many as five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. A sentencing date has not yet been set or publicly announced, the documents show.\n\nLatest case\n\nIt\'s the newest federal case involving a seller of bitcoins based in the US in recent weeks, a development that has prompted observers to decry a larger trend.\n\nLast week, Richard Petix of Rochester, New York, plead guilty to unlawful money transmission and lying to federal officials after he sold $13,000 worth of bitcoin to an undercover agent. And in late April, federal authorities raided the home of an Arizona bitcoin trader and advocate, who as of last week was being held pending trial.\n\nWhile it\'s not immediately clear what factors are driving the recent spate of cases, observers like Carol Van Cleef, financial technology lead for Washington, DC-based law firm BakerHostetler, argue that the case underscores the gray areas in which bitcoin sellers operate in the US today – and the need for more clarification from FinCEN, which released guidance on the issue in 2014.\n\n""I think it requires further explanation from policymakers as to where the lines are,"" she told CoinDesk.\n\nJustice statue image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

At the time, the reasoning was that Coinbase saw Ethereum’s focus on smart contracts as a tangible improvement over Bitcoin, and not just another alt-coin that doesn’t serve any real function.\n\nSo why Litecoin? Interestingly, Litecoin’s creator, Charlie Lee, has been director of engineering at Coinbase for nearly four years. And while there were always ongoing discussions about adding Litecoin to the platform, they didn’t really materialize until recently.\n\nLee explained that it’s been a slow few years for Litecoin. While the digital currency had a heyday in late 2013 with its price spiking to over $50 per coin and over $1 billion in total market cap, it quickly fell back to earth and basically remained flat for three years.\n\nSo why the sudden change?\n\nIf you’re familiar with Bitcoin you know that the community is facing an internal struggle with deciding how to scale the currency for the future. Essentially, Bitcoin’s original code wasn’t designed to process this many transactions on a daily basis, and now the network is charging too much per transaction, which takes too long to confirm.\n\nLuckily there are two main proposed solutions: Bitcoin Unlimited, which aims to get rid of the block size limit altogether, and Segregated Witness (SegWit), which wants to slightly increase the block size while also moving some non-essential data out of the transaction and off the blockchain.\n\nBoth solutions would require a “fork,” meaning the majority of miners would have to agree on the changes and signal to slightly alter the currency’s blockchain. So far the Bitcoin community has been unable to reach a consensus on how to fix the scaling issue.\n\nSegWit\n\nA few months ago Lee and the Litecoin community decided to work on implementing SegWit into Litecoin. And after heated discussions with the biggest players in the Litecoin mining community, the group reached consensus about a week ago to implement SegWit. Last week, miners “voted” with their hash power to signal for SegWit, and the actual code will be implemented next week.\n\nWhile Litecoin is still small enough that it’s not suffering from the same scaling issues as is Bitcoin, the team thought it’d be a good way to bring something exciting to Litecoin.\n\nPlus, SegWit has some other benefits besides just increasing network capacity. It prevents malleability, which is essentially the risk (that currently exists in Bitcoin) that third parties can alter transactions before they are confirmed by the network. Implementing SegWit will also allow Litecoin to experiment with something called Lightening Networks — which would essentially allow for instant Litecoin payments off the main blockchain, with transactions only settling on the chain when they need to.\n\nAnd perhaps best of all, these recent developments have rekindled interest in the Litecoin currency, sending the price (and more importantly, volume) skyrocketing. This increased trading volume is what finally allowed Coinbase to implement Litecoin, knowing they now have a liquid enough market (on the Coinbase-owned exchange GDAX) to supply user demand.\n\nLong-term Litecoin\n\nEssentially, Lee sees Litecoin’s long-term goal as being able to help Bitcoin alleviate some transactional volume by taking over smaller, less important transactions. So you could use Lightening Networks on Litecoin to buy a coffee with zero confirmation times or transaction fees. But if you’re wiring $50,000 to your bank, you could still use Bitcoin for the increased security that comes from a bigger network of decentralized miners.\n\nHe also sees Litecoin as a testing ground for future Bitcoin features. If Litecoin can successfully implement SegWit and Lightning Networks, it may show the Bitcoin community that these features are clearly the way to once and for all resolve the capacity issue.', ""'bilur' was create\xadd by London-based financ\xadial servic\xades compan\xady R Fintec\xadh\n\nGENEVA: A new virtual currency launched Tuesday aims to rival industry leader bitcoin by pegging its value to hard oil assets, a first in the rapidly growing digital money sector.\n\nThe currency called “bilur” and created by London-based financial services company R Fintech uses the technology pioneered by bitcoin, while trying to offer an alternative for those weary of the wild fluctuations that have plagued digital currencies.\n\n“This is the first crypto-currency with a real value”, R Fintech Ignacio M. Ozcariz chief executive told reporters in Geneva.\n\nBitcoin – more than what meets the eye\n\nTo start, the company has valued 1 bilur as equivalent to 6.5 barrels of brent crude oil, making it an asset worth $356 (326 euros).\n\nTexas-based oil company Hockley has initially set aside 1 million barrels of crude as collateral to underpin the currency but has told R Fintech it can ramp up if bilur becomes popular.\n\nLike bitcoin, bilur is run with so-called blockchain technology, where encrypted digital coins are created by supercomputers, regulated and controlled by a community of users who try to guard against counterfeiting.\n\nForget about Bitcoin. Invest in gold to stay financially secure\n\nBitcoin was the world’s top performing currency in 2016 and continues to hover around record highs of $1400, after being worth just a few cents when it launched in 2009.\n\nIt has appealed to those interested in bank-free transactions and to money not controlled by a government or central bank.\n\nBut detractors have suggested that bitcoin could ultimately be undermined by its volatility, noting that the currency dramatically lost 75 per cent of its value in 2013.\n\nBitcoin hits record high above $1,200 on talk of ETF approval\n\nBilur is targeting those who like aspects of virtual currency trading but would prefer funds supported by a fixed asset — similar to a gold standard for traditional currencies.\n\n“We’re still a crypto-currency, we’re just backing it up with a real physical thing”, said Usama al Ali, an IT specialist at R Fintech.\n\nWith the project in its infancy, there are no merchants accepting bilur as a valid form of payment.\n\nBitcoin is in contrast increasingly accepted by merchants worldwide.\n\nR Fintech said it aims to make money through a small management fee, charging bilur holders roughly three per cent per year.\n\nThe name “bilur” is the Basque language word for “chain”, a nod to blockchain technology, the company said.\n\nRead full story"", 'At a recent presentation at the Coinbase headquarters in San Francisco, Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell discussed the challenges of implementing privacy enhancements in Bitcoin, specifically in terms of the Confidential Transactions (CT) proposal.\n\nIn short, CT is a privacy solution for Bitcoin that blinds the amounts involved in transactions. When combined with CoinJoin, which is an attempt to disconnect the sender from a receiver in a transaction, both the amounts and participants in a bitcoin transaction can be obscured, which leaves much less data for an outside observer to collect.\n\nWhile Maxwell noted that it’s already possible to implement CT on sidechains, such as Blockstream’s own Liquid sidechain for exchanges, he claimed that bringing this sort of feature to Bitcoin’s main blockchain would involve some hurdles.\n\nEfficiency Costs of Confidential Transactions\n\nThe first key hurdle to the adoption of CT on Bitcoin mentioned by Maxwell during his recent talk had to do with the fact that CT transactions are less efficient when compared to traditional Bitcoin transactions. For example, Maxwell stated that CT transactions increase the bandwidth costs associated with transaction fifteenfold.\n\nHaving said that, Maxwell also noted there are some “cool, hacky tricks” that could be used to move these costs around the system. Specifically, Maxwell described a setup where miners would take on the responsibility of making sure a proof in a CT transaction was valid. In a situation where a user tried to cheat the system, the miner could broadcast a proof of the cheat and confiscate the coins as a reward.\n\n“There are some tradeoffs that can possibly be done to make it so not everyone needs to verify the CT stuff and make it cheaper,” said Maxwell.\n\nThe Politics of Better Privacy in Bitcoin\n\nAccording to Maxwell, another potential issue with bringing CT or any other privacy improvement to Bitcoin is that it will also come with a political battle. “Some people do not want bitcoin to gain stronger privacy for various reasons,” he said.\n\nHowever, Maxwell also noted that, in his view, the existence of various privacy enhancements, privacy-focused altcoins, and sidechains will alter these arguments. “I don’t think that, if CT is a really good thing that bitcoin should be using, people are going to stand by and not use it while competing systems do, at least not forever,” he said.\n\nMaxwell also noted that the chances of a CT deployment on Bitcoin may improve as the technology improves. For example, it would be easier to gain consensus for such a change if the increased bandwidth costs associated with CT were not as severe.\n\nCurrent Designs for Bringing Confidential Transactions to Bitcoin\n\nAccording to Maxwell, there are already designs available for implementing CT on Bitcoin in a backwards-compatible manner via a soft fork. Bitcoin developer Felix Weis made such a proposal on the Bitcoin development mailing list in January 2016.\n\nHowever, Maxwell himself is not exactly sold on these proposals quite yet.\n\n“Right now, they have severe limitations,” Maxwell said of the proposals to implement CT in Bitcoin via a soft fork. “In particular, if the chain reorganizes when coins have been moved out of CT back into non-CT transactions, the transactions around that reorganization won’t survive. So imagine you move some coins out of CT, you basically have to have a protocol rule that you can’t spend those coins for like a hundred blocks after they’ve been moved out of CT.”\n\nAccording to Maxwell, this same limitation is found with extension blocks, which is why he hasn’t been too excited about those sorts of past proposals either.\n\n“If it’s the only way to do it, then maybe it’s a viable way, but I’d really like to find something better,” Maxwell continued. “I haven’t yet, but there have been many things in Bitcoin that I’ve looked at and said, ‘Don’t know how to do it,’ and later it turned out that there were ways of doing it.”', 'Arena Music + Bitcoin We’re watching our local music scene build the foundation for an entirely new way of releasing single tracks and full albums that pay each writer, producer and featured artist their shares of the $0.01 per stream Arena offers in Bitcoin.\n\nArena Music has announced that it will begin offering royalty payouts for music streamed through the Arena platform in Bitcoin worldwide starting in June. The company has been testing the digital currency in Phoenix and Atlanta over the last 6 months. In March, Bitcoin reached parity with gold for the first time since its inception. It’s been deemed the “most exciting monetary experiment in modern times.”\n\nThe company is an on-demand merchandising storefront that leverages a free streaming service to help artists monetize their content in an industry where consumers no longer buy music to own. By using the music as a loss leader, Arena helps artists and labels redirect consumer attention to exclusive merchandise offerings.\n\nOffering payouts in the popular cryptocurrency highlights the company’s forward-thinking approach and alliance with independent content creators by offering them compensation with another form of capital or investment--one that can never be offered by any subscription-based streaming platform.\n\nAs the company is based in Phoenix, the first band to receive such a payout will be an independent punk band called Red Tank!, who released their third full-length album, “BIO/FEEDBACK” in collaboration with Arena Music in August of 2016. The band is known for their DIY ethos, energetic shows, and apocalyptic, dystopian, and existential lyricism.\n\nWhen asked about the announcement, frontman Clipper Arnold remarked, “I think it’s an interesting, forward-thinking approach and it’s something we’re excited to be a part of. I think we share in the idea of pushing the imaginary of ways in which art can be created and can flourish outside of conventional approaches and infrastructure. I think this is a prime example of that paradigm in action.”\n\nArena Music founder and CEO, Damon Evans adds, “Phoenix is seeing the impact of Arena Music payouts in Bitcoin. We’re watching our local music scene build the foundation for an entirely new way of releasing single tracks and full albums that pay each writer, producer and featured artist their shares of the $0.01 per stream Arena offers in Bitcoin. Now that we understand how essential this basic detail is in today’s music economy, we’re starting think that this level of transparency should accompany all royalty payment methods.”\n\nAbout Arena Music:\n\nFounded in Phoenix, Arena Music is an on-demand merchandise storefront that leverages a patent-pending streaming service to encourage musicians to promote merchandise sales while listeners stream exclusive content from established artists and well qualified independent acts without advertisements or a monthly subscription. To start streaming, visit http://www.arena.com or download the free Arena Music app on iOS and Android.\n\nFor press inquiries, contact: pr(at)arena(dot)com\n\nFor artist & label inquiries, contact: artistrelations(at)arena(dot)com', 'Bitcoin price is gaining more upside traction and could be poised to establish another set of record highs after a quick dip.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price hit another new high at the $1500 area as predicted in an earlier article.\n\nPrice is moving above a steep rising trend line visible on the short-term time frames.\n\nWith strong bullish pressure, it could be a good idea to keep buying on dips.\n\nBitcoin price is gaining more upside traction and could be poised to establish another set of record highs after a quick dip.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside.

And while the token, called OneGramCoin, is considered an Islamic financial product, its offering is open to all types of investors including non-Muslims, he added.\n\nThe tokens will be sold from May 21 to September 22.\n\nThe Dubai company has also teamed up with GoldGuard, a gold trading company, for the token offering, with one token backed by one gramme of gold held at a vault inside Dubai International Airport.\n\nOneGramCoin was created using blockchain technology, which has powered similar currencies such as bitcoin. Blockchain is the current rage in the financial and corporate world, being able to track and record assets across all industries. Nearly 50 per cent of the offering has been committed, Mohammed said. Tabarak Investment Bank, one of the largest in Dubai, will sell ?100 million to its clients, while a similar amount is expected to be taken up by seven high net worth individuals in OneGram\'s network.\n\nThe ultimate objective for the token is to create a payments solution around it.\n\n""We\'re creating a merchant service programme and we will offer these tokens to retailers for free,"" Mohammed said.\n\n""If you\'re paying with Mastercard or Visa, you have to pay 2-1/2 per cent as a retailer to Mastercard. We are creating a payment gateway where the retailer pays nothing.""\n\nIn return, Mohammed said the retailer will be accepting OneGramCoin as payment, as well as possibly bitcoin and two or three of the top coins.\n\nGlobally, Islamic finance assets total about $1.2 trillion and account for only 1.2 per cent of total global banking assets, according to data from PricewaterhouseCoopers. It is expected the Islamic finance industry will more than double to $2.6 trillion this year.\n\n""There is a shortage of Islamic products,"" said Mohammed. ""The market is big, but there is limited innovation coming in.""', 'Many people find cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin appealing because they aren’t attached to any government and are thus immune to inflation associated with fiat money. But governments will inevitably play a role in what the future of cryptocurrencies looks like through taxation and regulation. Since governments naturally fear what they can’t control, it is important to keep abreast of these issues. I’m planning a series of blog posts on this topic, starting today with the basics of cryptocurrency taxation.\n\nThe IRS made a critical distinction between property and currency and decided that cryptocurrencies are property. The 2014 decision was applauded by many prominent members of the Bitcoin community, who stand to financially benefit from this classification. Bitcoin investors and miners (who operate Bitcoin’s blockchain ledger of transactions and get paid in new Bitcoins) are taxed at the 15 percent capital gains rate rather than much higher income tax rates. However, this enthusiasm is short-sighted.\n\nBecause the IRS considers cryptocurrencies property for taxation purposes, it views every retail transaction as a taxable event. Suppose you went to the store and bought a quart of milk with U.S. dollars. You would pay a sales tax at the time of purchase, and that would be it. Now suppose you and the retailer wanted to transact in Bitcoin. Under current rules, you would have to record the value of Bitcoin when you acquired it, record the value of Bitcoin when you exchanged it for milk, and recognize the change as a gain or loss. The IRS doesn’t enforce the rules, but if it did, it would render cryptocurrencies inappropriate for everyday use.\n\nWhile these rules are difficult for the IRS to comprehensively enforce, authorities have begun taking a closer interest in Bitcoin. Last November, the IRS requested records of all Bitcoin transactions from Coinbase, the largest exchange in the United States, to look for tax evaders (Coinbase is still fighting the request). And the internet abounds with sites instructing users on the complex record keeping necessary to comply with current rules.\n\nAnyone who hopes Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies will become more than short-term speculative investments should support calls for changes to the current IRS position. Bitcoin miners and investors may be getting a sweet deal for the moment. But if Bitcoin never takes hold as an actual currency, all they’ll be left with is an asset that unlike gold or petroleum lacks any tangible value. Almost everyone agrees that mass adoption of cryptocurrencies will be slow, and speculative investments in BItcoin have certainly paid off in the short term. But if governments prevent it from ever being a viable currency, a bubble will eventually burst.', 'Bitcoin exchange markets of the US and Japan, which control over 66 percent of the global bitcoin exchange market with a combined daily trading volume of $246,7 million, have led bitcoin price to its new all-time high once again, at $1,567.\n\nAccording to various bitcoin exchange data market providers, with the exception of China, four of the five largest bitcoin exchange markets and their trading platforms have demonstrated a relatively stable trading value at around $1,560 in the past 24 hours.\n\nIn actuality, it can be argued that bitcoin price is currently being undervalued by the global exchange market due to the instability in the Chinese exchange market. Ever since local authorities and the People’s Bank of China significantly tightened Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC), traders moved away from regulated markets to over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Such major migration of users led to a decline in demand toward local exchanges and bitcoin price in the Chinese market hovered around the $1,200 since then.\n\nAs of today, bitcoin is being traded in the Chinese market at a value of $1,264, a price that is significantly lower than that of the Japanese and US exchange markets. In fact, the Chinese exchange market is demonstrating a trading value of bitcoin that is nearly 19 percent lower than Japan and the US. The issue with this instability in price is China’s presence in the global exchange market. It is the third largest market with 11 percent of the market share.\n\nStill, even with China’s market hindrance and under-performance, bitcoin price has managed to reach new all-time highs several times over the past week. With a 5.59 percent 24-hour increase, analysts believe the explosive growth of the bitcoin industry in Japan will stabilize bitcoin price at the $1,550 region.\n\nOn May 3, Brian Kelly, a financial analyst at CNBC and founder of Brian Kelly Capital, attributed the recent surge in bitcoin price to the rise in institutional investors within the bitcoin market. He stated that the demand from high profile investors, investment firms and institutional investors have led to a stable increase in bitcoin price.\n\n“The biggest driver right now is you’re starting to see institutional investors take a keen interest in the entire sector. I don’t think this is hot money. This is real money that’s going to sit around and build the new internet,” said Kelly.\n\nMore to that, local financial publications in Japan such as Nikkei reported that the bitcoin exchange market of Japan is experiencing a rapid growth due to the involvement of multi-billion dollar companies such as SBI Holdings and GMO Internet. According to Nikkei, SBI Holdings already established a digital currency exchange called SBI Virtual Currencies for local traders and the GMO Internet group is planning on launching a similar venture in the near future.\n\nOther countries in Asia including South Korea have also seen increasing interests from institutional investors and large-scale conglomerates. South Korea’s largest bitcoin exchange Korbit, for instance, is backed and funded by the country’s largest telecommunications company SK Telecom, which is valued at $16.5 billion.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The price of Ether is skyrocketing.\n\nInvestors who bought Ether at the start of the year are seeing 900% ROI. Since my previous blogpost, Ethereum had another leg up, sending the entire crypto market cap close to 40 billion.\n\nWhat are the factors behind the rise of this blockchain stock?\n\nWhere does it go from here?\n\nIn this post, we shall explore in depth the possible contributors to Ethereum’s success.\n\nDesigned for Something Greater\n\nBefore Ethereum even existed, there was Bitcoin. Bitcoin, since its inception in 2008, has been hailed as the most radical development in currency. On 2nd March 2017, and for the first time in history, a digital asset with no intrinsic value climbed above the price of gold. As Bitcoin’s price took the limelight over the years, it was easy to overlook Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology—blockchain as a tool of distributed consensus. Vitalik Buterin, however, was one of the early few who saw the potential of blockchain development, and thus Ethereum was born.\n\nEthereum was not made to compete with Bitcoin. For the most part, Ethereum is a blockchain-based decentralised platform for apps that run smart contracts, and is aimed at solving issues associated with censorship, fraud and third party interference. Ether, also known as ‘gas’, comes in as a necessary element for operating the distributed application distribution platform, Ethereum.\n\nIn short, Ethereum does everything that Bitcoin can do, and more. If Bitcoin warrants a market cap of 23.6 billion USD, how much further can the price of Ether go, with Ethereum market cap standing at a mere 7 billion USD?\n\nThe Bitcoin Hard Fork Contention\n\nPart of Ethereum’s rise in price and interest could be attributed to the instability of Bitcoin in March, which has quite a bit of a backstory. Due to increasing Bitcoin usage, an increasing number of transactions are getting backlogged. As Bitcoin scurries to resolve this, two solutions surfaced: activate Segregated Witness or increase the block size. Both options tackle the Bitcoin network congestion, but unfortunately, the bigger miners have an interest in the latter: increasing the block size makes it harder for smaller miners to run a node on the network, which encourages centralization. Till now, the Bitcoin scaling issue is still present without a clear plan. Investors who were unsure of Bitcoin’s direction would have hedged into Ethereum, driving up demand for Ether.\n\nThe DAO Attack\n\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency with issues; Ethereum has had its fair share of problems to deal with as well. ‘The DAO’ is a decentralized autonomous organization that raised over 150 million USD, making it the largest crowdfunding in history. On 18th June, a hacker managed to drain 3.6 million Ether from the fund into a ‘child DAO’ by exploiting a loop hole in smart contract terms. Following the incident, price of Ether dropped from 20 USD to 13 USD and below, reflecting the confidence of investors in the Ethereum network. That put the Ethereum Foundation in a tough spot. They do not wish for the smart contracts platform to be viewed as a failure, but if they do intervene to save the funds, they risk a possible reputation damage by not upholding their social contract with their network of independent nodes. In the end, the foundation handled the hack decisively with a swift and clean hard fork that created ETH (Ethereum) and ETC (Ethereum Classic). Nevertheless, the incident left a mark on Ethereum’s once untainted reputation.\n\nThe DAO hack might have set back the price of Ether a few months. The dent in the public’s confidence in Ethereum translated into a supressed Ether price much like a coiled spring, until the end of February when the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) was announced.\n\nForming of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance\n\nThe intense bull run of Ether in March is triggered by the announcement of EEA partners. The EEA initiative connects Fortune 500 enterprises and academics to support the development of enterprise-grade revolutionary software based on blockchain technology. The EEA launch saw big names such as Accenture, Microsoft, Intel, JP Morgan and UBS. It was jaw dropping; no one expected a cryptocurrency to receive that level of institutional support. Given that the companies were largely interested in Ethereum as a blockchain technology development platform and not Ether per se, this public display of confidence in Ethereum as the leading blockchain for future businesses was enough to send the price of Ether on a relentless climb.\n\nEmpowering Developers\n\nEthereum has built a community around developers who are devoted to bringing smart contracts mainstream. Ethereum has its very own language, Solidity, for writing smart contracts with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is the primary innovation of the Ethereum project and can run code in a quasi-Turing complete manner. The Learning resources and code repositories are well documented and easily available on the web. By encouraging knowledge exchange, Ethereum makes developing decentralized apps (Dapps) enjoyable and exciting.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum has a huge lead in blockchain development and innovation. With a fast expanding developer base, it is only a matter of time before Ethereum-based Dapps crowd the top crypto scene.\n\nEthereum-based Dapps\n\nUnlike that of Bitcoin and its clones, the relationship between Ethereum and its Dapps is symbiotic. Dapps such as Golem, which creates a decentralized sharing economy of computing power; Augur, which creates a decentralized prediction market; Melonport, which removes third parties and decentralizes asset management. Instead of in-fighting for a piece of market share in the crypto space, these Dapps seek to add value to our world by having real usage cases, expanding the Ethereum network and reach in the process. It is no wonder that the price of Ether, which acts as the fuel for the network, increases with the proliferation of its Dapps.\n\nAll the Pieces Coming Together\n\nIt is an exciting year to be holding Ether in your investments. On May 4th, we have Ethereum Naming Service coming online, which will let us bid for URL addresses ending with .eth soon. Next, we have the highly-anticipated EEA conference to announce new corporations coming on board. Then we have the Raiden release, which will make payment in Ethereum fast, scalable, confidential and interoperable. Lastly, we have Metropolis and Serenity updates, not forgetting the Casper update that will change Ethereum’s protocol from Proof of Work (Pow) to Proof of Stake (PoS) or hybrid PoS/PoW.\n\nIf the technical jargon is too much to handle at this point, just remember that lots of good news about Ethereum is coming, all of which will undoubtedly increase the value perception of Ether. Ultimately, remember that the crypto space is still predominantly running on speculation. Ethereum’s road map looks promising and personally, that is enough for me to take an interest in and invest in ETH.\n\nBe it up or down, the crypto investing journey has always been wild and violent.', 'Daniel Mercede was buying large quantities of bitcoin from legitimate foreign exchanges and then reselling the bitcoin himself at a premium, without having the necessary license.\n\n“I can get some crazy returns right now” was amid the promises that Daniel Mercede, of Chagrin Falls, used to give about his bitcoin business Cryptocoin Capital Management. The company, located in the United States, was operating without the necessary license that any US money transmitting business should have: these are issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\nDetective Sergeant Andy Capwill of the Chagrin Falls Police Department and special agents from the FBI’s Cleveland Field Office conducted an investigation into the business, prompted by another fraudulent scheme in which Mercede was implicated – using stolen credit card information to buy tickets to concerts and other events from a California-based ticket seller. The new investigation found Mercede was buying large quantities of bitcoin from legitimate foreign exchanges and was afterwards reselling the bitcoin himself at a premium.\n\nCryptocoin Capital Management had two advantages on the surface – its US location and that it did not require the same long waiting period for bitcoin trading as the legitimate exchanges.\n\n“A lot of the time, people who want bitcoin want it now, so they will go through more peer-to-peer transactions,” explained FBI Special Agent Gary Sukowatey. “He (Mercede – Ed.) was buying larger quantities and waiting whatever period was necessary to wait, then he would sell it to people that wanted bitcoin right away.” The problem is that these transactions are illegal if the business does not have a license.\n\nIn September 2014, Mercede claimed he might secure average returns of 8 to 15% per day by buying off Chinese exchanges and then selling locally. According to Court records, he wired funds to make daily purchases of $10,000 and $40,000 in bitcoin. Over six months starting in August 2014, Mercede illegally converted or transmitted $1.4 million.\n\nMr Mercede will spend more than six years in prison as a result of his illegal activities. The case represents one of the first convictions for what is seen as a spreading type of crime—operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nThe FBI agents noted that trading in virtual currencies like bitcoin is perfectly legal—with the proper registration, licensing, and compliance with record-keeping requirements. Lack of registration, as the case with Mercede shows, may lead to criminal charges.', 'Bitcoin has been the top-performing currency in the world in six of the past seven years, climbing from zero to a new high value of about $1,600.\n\nBut the cryptocurrency isn\'t anywhere close to its potential, according to Jeremy Liew, the first investor in Snapchat, and Peter Smith, the CEO and cofounder of Blockchain.\n\nIn a presentation sent to Business Insider, the duo laid out their case for bitcoin exploding to $500,000 by 2030.\n\nTheir argument is based on increased interest in bitcoin, thanks to:\n\nBitcoin-based remittances\n\nRemittance transfers, or electronic money transfers to foreign countries, have almost doubled over the past 15 years to 0.76% of gross world product, data from the World Bank shows.\n\n""Expats sending money home have found in bitcoin an inexpensive alternative, and we assume that the percentage of bitcoin-based remittances will sharply increase with greater bitcoin awareness,"" the two said.\n\nUncertainty\n\nLiew and Smith said increased political uncertainty in the UK, US, and developing nations would help elevate the level of interest in bitcoin.\n\n""We believe bitcoin awareness, high liquidity, ease of transport, and continued market outperformance as geopolitical risks mount will make bitcoin a strong contender for investment at a consumer and investor level,"" the two said.\n\nMobile penetration\n\nLiew and Smith said the percentage of noncash transactions would climb from 15% to 30% in the next 10 years as the world becomes more connected through smartphones.\n\nThe global smartphone penetration rate is 63%, and the total number of smartphone users is expected to increase by 1 billion by 2020. The GSMA, a trade body that represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, says 90% of these users will come from developing countries.\n\nThis would make it possible for nearly everyone to have a bank in their pocket, and that should provide a boost for bitcoin as well. Liew and Smith say bitcoin could account for 50% of all noncash transactions.\n\nHere are the basic model drivers Liew and Smith used:\n\nA bitcoin price of $1,000 in 2017. Network users will grow by a factor of 61 from now until 2030. ""Put another way, we need a population of bitcoin users around a quarter of the Chinese population (or 5% of the global population) in 2030 to see bitcoin at $500k,"" Liew and Smith told Business Insider.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\'s user network grew from 120,000 users in 2013 to 6.5 million users in 2017, or by a factor of about 54, and this could be just the beginning. Growth of that magnitude would mean 400 million users in 2030.\n\n\n\nThe average value of bitcoin held per user will hit $25,000. ""As institutional investor cash in bitcoin, sophisticated investors trading bitcoin, and bitcoin-based ETFs proliferate, we think the average bitcoin value held will increase to around $25k per Bitcoin holder,"" Liew and Smith said. Currently, with bitcoin\'s market cap of $16.4 billion, each of its 6.5 million users holds $2,515 worth of bitcoin on average. Bitcoin\'s 2030 market cap is decided by the number of bitcoin holders multiplied by the average bitcoin value held. Bitcoin\'s 2030 supply will be about 20 million. Bitcoin\'s 2030 price and user count will total $500,000 and 400 million, respectively. The price was found by taking the $10 trillion market cap and dividing it by the fixed supply of 20 million bitcoin.\n\nBut a lot could go wrong, too. News surrounding bitcoin has been rather negative as of late.\n\nChina, which is responsible for nearly 100% of trading in bitcoin, has been cracking down on trading. The three biggest exchanges recently announced a 0.2% fee on all transactions and blocked withdrawals from trading accounts.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission also rejected two bitcoin exchange-traded funds and will rule on another one in the future. It\'s not expected to be approved.\n\nHowever, Smith says bitcoin is still in its early stages.\n\n""The SEC\'s ruling wasn\'t a surprise to us,"" he told Business Insider. He said that ""getting that sort of approval"" could take a long time.\n\n""In the meantime, bitcoin is already simple to buy and hold, and as the asset continues to mature, we\'ll continue to see an increase in the development and deployment of surrounding products,"" he said.\n\nBitcoin More\n\nAnd while bitcoin hasn\'t been granted regulatory approval in the US, it is catching on elsewhere. On April 1, the cryptocurrency became a legal payment method in Japan.\n\nAnother threat to its future is developers who are threatening to set up a ""hard fork,"" or alternative marketplace for bitcoin. This would result in the split of into bitcoin and bitcoin unlimited. However, Smith isn\'t worried.\n\n""Bitcoin has strong economic incentives to prevent this,"" he said. ""If the last two years of healthy contention and debate lead to a conclusion, it\'s that bitcoin is incredibly resilient and stable. In fact, the bitcoin blockchain has operated for seven-plus years with no downtime, a feat no other back-end system operating at this scale can claim.""\n\nBut the cryptocurrency sees violent price swings uncommon among the more traditional currencies. Bitcoin rallied 20% in the first week of 2017 before crashing 35% on word that China was cracking down on trading.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has regained those losses and is trading up about 67% so far this year.\n\nNOW WATCH: People are outraged by a Pepsi ad starring Kendall Jenner — here\'s how the company responded\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From Business Insider\n\n']"
05/05/2017,"['Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, investor, trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nIn this guest feature, Woo breaks down recent developments in the bitcoin markets, arguing that with a trading band broken, the cryptocurrency could be entering a new phase of maturity.\n\nSomething interesting has been happening the last couple of weeks.\n\nI\'m pretty well connected to a lot of veterans in crypto, and independently, we\'ve all been fielding inquiries from smart money investors, the non-technical types who are now ready for a hedge instrument against global uncertainty.\n\nOur basic conclusion is that what we\'re seeing right now is a whole lot of new money coming into the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nSome have been perplexed with this unprecedented rise, and it\'s easy to see why. The total market cap of the space is now $46.5bn, a figure that\'s up roughly 50% over the last few weeks.\n\nDomino effect\n\nThat might seem simplistic, but it\'s also coinciding with a lot of uncertainty in Europe.\n\nOn Sunday, 7th May, we will see the outcome of elections in France. Of the two candidates, Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, Len Pen is for France leaving the European Union. Should this happen, it could signal the start of an EU breakup.\n\nNow, Le Pen is considered a long shot, similar to President Donald Trump in the US elections last year, but we know what happened there. Savvy investors have been looking for hedges, and now new money is moving into cryptocurrency. But, new money is also flowing from bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo-called ""altcoins"" are getting the benefits of bitcoin\'s two-year stalemate on scaling, so the amount of money falling out significant. Now, it\'s important to understand that altcoins markets, with the exception of ethereum\'s ether token, are thinly traded. This means that for every $1 going into altcoins, their markets rise disproportionally compared to bitcoin\'s deeply traded market.\n\nThis adds an amplifier to the altcoin market cap rise.\n\nReally, the big clue to this situation is bitcoin and ethereum are both rising at the same time when we typically see a see-saw action. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is evidence that new money is coming into the system.\n\nPrice Action\n\nAnother less-discussed development is that bitcoin broke out of its long-time trading channel yesterday.\n\nThis is significant, as the channel has held for a multi-year timeframe.\n\nIt\'s now carving out new all-time highs without a channel resistance to hold it down. In this situation, all bets are off.\n\nSince there are no historical resistance points, we default to Fibonacci levels, derived off the golden ratio numbers that traders use to find support and resistance levels. Our next Fibonacci level is $1,717, which will act as resistance. While it is entirely possible that we could see a run up to this price if the buying frenzy continues, we are seeing a dip as the market overheats.\n\nI suspect some of the current dip may have been from election speculators taking profits before the final outcome.\n\nSo, we are faced with a situation similar to our March ETF decision.\n\nIf Le Pen wins, bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets will have a very strong run ahead of it. On a Le Pen defeat, I suspect we may get a moderate retrace and consolidation before resuming its upward momentum. (I can\'t see the new influx of new money slowing down, a Le Pen defeat does not solve the EU\'s financial uncertainty.)\n\nFurther, looking back at Google search trends, we are not in a hype cycle as yet.\n\nThis further supports the notion that it\'s a moderate population of high net-worth investors entering with sufficient money to push these markets up significantly. I would say wave two of bitcoin has begun. In wave one, investors were technically proficient. In wave two, investors will be non-technical, but savvy in traditional markets. Wave three will be the general public. I\'ve estimated this will begin in two years when bitcoin\'s peak 60-day volatility dips below 5%. At this level, it will begin to compete with national currencies in price stability. And who wouldn\'t consider bitcoin as an alternative cash account that generates a relatively smooth return of 100% per annum? This is the long-term historical price trend driven by a doubling of users per year. So, despite the confusion, the fundamental drivers of this bitcoin rally are solid. Unlike in 2013, we may not see a pullback this time around.

And it’s time to get a MASSIVE market forecast in front of you. After all, I want YOU to be ahead of the big story before it shows up on the nightly news.\n\nMy publisher, Matt Insley — who rarely writes his own articles these days — felt that this story was too important not to be heard.\n\nThis is a story the mainstream media isn’t covering.\n\nAnd millennials aren’t going to get the memo either, before it’s too late.\n\nBut, mark my words…\n\nThis is the death of Bitcoin…\n\nThe Coming Deathblow…For Bitcoin\n\nOver the weekend we saw a random “pop culture”/news story hit the wire…\n\nThe world’s foremost TV/movie streaming company, Netflix, was hacked. And the trail of breadcrumbs leading away from the crime scene leads me to a shocking conclusion.\n\nThe hack was simple and deliberate. A hacker by the name of “thedarkoverlord” gained access to the upcoming season of a popular Netflix original series “Orange Is the New Black.”\n\nLong story short, the hacker stole TV content and threatened to give it away online before Netflix’s intended release date. Unless Netflix paid a “modest” ransom of around $50,000.\n\nAnother ho-hum hacking story, right? Not so fast. This is where the story takes a turn.\n\nAny good movie-watcher knows that when a ransom is demanded, it’s not the money that matters… it’s the getaway.\n\nAfter all, how are you supposed to ransom $1 Million (or in this case $50k) pick it up from a gas station trash can and actually GET AWAY with it?\n\nAh ha! That’s the hard part.\n\nYou see, the Netflix ransom was demanded in mysterious and untraceable Bitcoin.\n\nAnd it’s becoming more common practice to demand ransom in Bitcoin, too. This from the NYT:\n\n“Those threats have increased with the advent of ransomware, malicious software that encrypts victims’ data and prevents them from accessing it until they pay a ransom, often hundreds or thousands of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency.”\n\nIf you don’t know the story about Bitcoin I’ll get you caught up.\n\nWith my opinion of course…\n\nThe “cryptocurrency” holds a lot of technology. And to really understand it, you need to know about “blockchain.” (Keep up here. Times are changing and knowing about things like blockchain matter in today’s market, as you’ll see…)\n\nBlockchain is a “distributed database” that continuously evolves. Think of it as a growing list of records that can’t be tampered with. Or for a real world example, pretend for a second that every single U.S. dollar bill in America was catalogued electronically in an online database by serial number. From the second it comes off the printing press the bill’s “history” is on record. Every transaction, continuously updated.\n\nImportantly, blockchain doesn’t require anyone’s legal name or actual address, either – in that sense it’s anonymous.\n\nOkay. So that’s what blockchain brings to the table… solid technology that can track transactions and keep tabs on digital currency.\n\nAnd over the years the popularity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has gone through the roof…\n\nAll said, Bitcoin is impressively-encrypted, money-transferring technology. From my perch, calling it a “currency” is a little generous.\n\nLooking through the lens of a technology, that’s where things get interesting with this Netflix/Bitcoin story.\n\nHistory shows that with great technology comes great responsibility.\n\nThe revolver and semi-automatic weapons…\n\nAutomobiles…\n\nMilitary weaponry…\n\nEven the advent of the internet…\n\nWith each of these impressive technologies came a sinister downside…\n\nBitcoin is no different. If you look under the hood you’ll see that what really makes Bitcoin tick is less-talked-about, more sinister transaction record. Oh if that blockchain could talk!\n\nMoney laundering. Illegal transfers. Moving money outside of U.S. sanctions. Funding offshore accounts. Funding illegal online gambling… are just a few of the HUGE black-market forces that underpin bitcoin.\n\nSo, the Silicon Valley logic that bitcoin is free market technology and you can use it to protect against inflation… invest… pay friends… shop… etc… is NOT the whole picture. It’s also why I’m all puffed-up about Bitcoin.\n\nAnd mark my words, coming soon the script on Bitcoin is going to flip…\n\nSimilar to the disruptive technologies I listed above, Bitcoin will undergo the standard lifecycle of development… and I believe that will include swift, sweeping government regulation. Similar to gun control, car insurance, cyber regulation and more…\n\nHowever, unlike most of those other technologies, I don’t think Bitcoin will survive this deathblow of regulation.\n\nHere’s an example of what I mean…\n\nThe Netflix example above was, for all intents and purposes, harmless. Yes, hacking and demanding a ransom is illegal. But, the large scale ramifications aren’t that big.\n\nThat’s all going to change when the bad guys up the game.\n\nFor instance, what if someone hacks a more important/vital piece of U.S. infrastructure? Instead of the latest season of “Orange Is The New Black”?\n\nOr, worse…\n\nWhat if American lives are at stake. What if ransoms for high-value kidnappings come tethered to one nasty little reoccurring detail… “pay us in Bitcoin.”\n\nThat’s when the encrypted emperor will be stripped naked. Bitcoin will bear the full brunt of a media and government onslaught. It won’t be pretty.\n\nMind you, this could happen overnight. Just like the Netflix news a few days ago.\n\nAll it takes is large-scale ransom disaster… and swift action by congress. And that $30B in crypto-cash market cap could be wiped out.\n\nAfter all, we’ve seen this exact type of action before. Much like the sanctions against countries like Russia or Iran… or the financial regulation changes for say, online gambling.\n\nYou see, right now you can transfer money directly from U.S. bank accounts, through a third party, into Bitcoin.\n\nBut, like a sock puppet, the U.S. Government controls the banking system — as well as the credit system.\n\nAdd it all up and one single emotional, urgent, media-driven government regulation could destroy the financial transaction that funds cryptocurrency.\n\nIt’ll be the death blow to Bitcoin. And it’s not just me saying it either…\n\nI just heard an interview from Agora Financial’s Chief Technology Officer, Ray Blanco, who shares my same concerns about Bitcoin:\n\n“I look at bitcoin right now, I see huge risk. Blockchain advances all get figured out in the years ahead regardless. Bitcoin itself, it’s doomed. The end is near. Soon as Congress has a reason, they figure out how to shut it down. You mark my words. Too many banks have too much to lose. And if we know one thing, it’s that big banks and Congress are part of the same beast.”\n\nJust wait until the next hack comes to light — and the victim is a bit more important than a Netflix series.\n\nThis is a story you won’t find in the mainstream. And if you or any loved ones are playing around with Bitcoin accounts, this is your fair warning. This Bitcoin disaster could happen overnight. Any day.\n\nI bet it’s only a matter of time.\n\nHave a good weekend,\n\nMatt Insley\n\nPublisher, The Daily Edge\n\nEdgeFeedback@AgoraFinancial.com', 'It’s understandable to have questions about the legality of using Bitcoin. The platform introduced a brand new paradigm away from the traditional regulators and regulations that govern fiat currency. Unlike illegal, counterfeit money, which is a blatant example of a “currency” that misrepresents itself as legal tender, Bitcoin is entirely different. Nevertheless, it operates in a seemingly gray area when it comes to regulation. However, many of these concerns boil down to misunderstandings or a lack of concrete rules that govern Bitcoin, rather than overt violations of the law.\n\n\n\nThe question surrounding the relationship between Bitcoin and the law really depends on how the digital currency is being used.\n\nEver since the now-defunct Silk Road gained notoriety, regulators have been concerned about Bitcoin’s semi-anonymity and decentralized nature. In the U.S., as well as in other countries, authorities fear that the platform could be used for money laundering and the purchase of illicit goods without being traced.\n\nNot helping Bitcoin’s reputation with authorities was its prevalence as a payment service for the Silk Road, a digital marketplace where users could purchase illegal goods. Whether or not people use Bitcoin as a way to participate in expressly illegal activities doesn’t make the digital currency itself illegal. The illegality of the activity is the issue, whether it’s paid for in bitcoin, cash or gold. However, even when bitcoin is used for legitimate purposes, rules are a little more complex.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as of 2013, using bitcoin to purchase well-natured goods and services is not illegal. However, those who mine bitcoins and trade them for traditional currency or operate exchanges on which bitcoins are bought and sold are labeled “money transmitters” and could be subject to special laws that govern that type of activity. To date, those laws have rarely, if ever, been enforced to crackdown against bitcoin use.\n\nWhen it comes to taxation, the IRS views bitcoin and other virtual currencies as property for federal tax purposes, similar to stocks and bonds, and federal tax law dictates that purchasers and/or sellers must treat it as such.\n\nIn other places around the world, the legality of Bitcoin is viewed differently, but for the most part it remains relatively safe to use as long as it is not tied to illicit purchases or activities. Many countries have issued statements indicating that bitcoin and other digital currencies are not regulated and do not exist as officially sanctioned currencies: a status that could put users at risk but would not have them violating any laws. Bitcoin is outright illegal in some countries, such as Iceland.\n\nDepending on where and how you utilize bitcoin, it is important to remain up-to-date on the latest regulations concerning the digital currency. As laws change across borders, governing bodies and, increasingly, as the platform gains popularity, questions about bitcoin’s legality will continue to be raised.', ""Chamath Palihapitiya, the owner of the $2.6 bln NBA team Golden State Warriors, recently stated that Bitcoin is the ultimate insurance policy against autocracy and currency curbs.\n\nReiterating my belief about $BTC. It's the ultimate insurance policy against autocracy, currency curbs and other forms of value destruction. — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) May 4, 2017\n\nBitcoin is a unique store of value, settlement network and digital currency in the sense that it offers absolute financial freedom and independence to its users. Within Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network, users can send each other transactions or payments with the absence of intermediaries and third party service providers.\n\nPalihapitiya described Bitcoin as the insurance policy against autocracy, or a government with absolute power, and currency curbs because of its decentralized nature. Central entities or authorities can’t possibly censor, restrict, manipulate and control the Bitcoin network.\n\nFor this reason, to prevent Bitcoin moving over to the over-the-counter (OTC) market that is arguably much harder to oversee and surveil, governments were forced to adopt and regulate Bitcoin against their will. Regulated or not people will still use Bitcoin. With regulatory frameworks, however, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies can be used to the advantage of the government to identify Bitcoin users.\n\nHowever, the emergence of privacy-focused two layer solutions such as TumbleBit could potentially offer complete financial privacy to users because it can obscure both inputs and outputs to render Bitcoin transactions anonymous.\n\nBitcoin as insurance policy against currency curbs\n\nOver the past year and a half, since early 2016, high profile and institutional investors have begun to perceive Bitcoin as a safe haven asset or digital gold. Hence, investors in China, the US and Japan have begun to rely on Bitcoin to protect themselves against abrupt financial troubles or currency curbs, essentially using Bitcoin as a wealth management product (WMP).\n\nSuch reliance and dependence on Bitcoin has led to a surge in the demand for Bitcoin and granted Bitcoin another identity apart from its primary identity of digital currency and digital cash. This was outlined by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nPalihapitiya also commented on the comparison between digital asset Ethereum and Bitcoin, when he was asked why he personally prefers Bitcoin over Ethereum.\n\nHe responded:\n\n“Coke v Pepsi. Pick the more mainstream option that more people can easily consume. Both will make money but bigger is always better.”\n\nSimply put, Palihapitiya explained that Bitcoin has the resources and market to achieve mainstream adoption ahead of Ethereum."", 'Mainstream adoption of Bitcoin goes hand in hand with an increase in market capitalization as well as the price of Bitcoin and top altcoins.\n\nBob Wood of Nexxus University says:\n\n“Cryptocurrency is advancing rapidly with technology solutions that are far outpacing the marketplace development of the mainstream public.”\n\nStill, in the very early stages of development with a consistently growing density of adoption, certain factors are considered of utmost importance and fundamental to the development of the crypto industry in general.\n\nElements of adoption\n\nWood explains that the most important elements for mainstream adoption mirror those of previous new technologies like the personal computer and the Internet. They include public awareness and knowledge, a perceived user benefit sometimes referred to as the ""killer app,"" convenience and ease of use, safety and security.\n\nAccording to Wood, very little is currently being done to advance the benefits of cryptocurrency from the tech world to the mainstream public. As more business-oriented entrepreneurs develop cryptocurrency solutions, more thought will go into meeting the needs for mainstream adoption.\n\nHe notes that the prevailing rate of growth for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency will need to be accelerated to see acceptance rates similar to previous new technologies.\n\nWood says:\n\n“The personal computer was invented around 1975 but didn\'t see mainstream adoption until 1990 with the prevalence of the graphical user interface for usability. The Internet was commercially available around 1990 but didn\'t see mainstream adoption until after the turn of the century. Cryptocurrency is in the early stages of only eight years since its invention and is currently comparable to green screens and floppy drives of the personal computer era in the early 1980s. Based on these previous new technologies, cryptocurrency may not reach full mainstream adoption until after 2025.”\n\nNexxus is assisting non-tech mainstream public users in learning what cryptocurrency is and how it can benefit them. Wood says Nexxus is taking the technology to the people rather than trying to take the people to the technology:\n\n“We need to meet people where they are most comfortable and lead them to the virtues of cryptocurrency.”\n\nAdoption is subjective\n\nThe CEO of Netcoins, Michael Vogel, thinks that the idea of mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency is subjective:\n\n“Personally, I\'ve never seen Bitcoin as something that needs to be accepted by brick and mortar retailers in order to be considered mainstream.”\n\nHe continues by explaining that Bitcoin is a valuable tool for e-commerce, remittance, micropayments, peer to peer lending, store of value and many other applications.\n\nThe use cases continue to grow and Bitcoin is already being used in ways that cash, credit cards and gold simply cannot function.\n\nVogel also notes that there are major league American sports teams that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. “I would absolutely consider that mainstream adoption,” he says.\n\nInternet comparison\n\nAlso making particular reference to the early days of the Internet, Vogel notes that even though a lot of users were actively online by the late 1990s, the majority of the population simply had no Internet access (or perceived need for access), while some even shunned the idea of owning a computer.\n\nVogel explains that the Internet was not doomed to fail because it wasn\'t being used by everyone at that point in time.\n\nHe concludes by noting that he expects a similar trajectory with Bitcoin, except with Bitcoin serving as a behind the scenes backbone for consumers accustomed to fiat currency.', 'Marco Santori is a FinTech lawyer based in New York City where he leads the blockchain tech team at Cooley LLP.\n\nIn this latest edition of CoinDesk\'s ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Santori discusses the downfall of the notorious bitcoin-powered dark market Silk Road in fall 2013, and the lasting impact this had on the technology\'s perception and his practice.\n\nI still kick myself for failing to buy a single item on Silk Road.\n\nYes, I\'m a lawyer, and, yes, I\'m a square. Yes, most of its wares exceeded my risk tolerance. Still, the Silk Road era was a rarified moment in history, and I was too busy warning people about money transmission to even buy a pair of alpaca socks.\n\nIn fairness to myself, it was still the early days – the summer of 2013. A bitcoin could be had for about a hundred US dollars. Things were simpler then. Ethereum didn\'t exist. Nobody was talking about the legality of token sales.\n\nI had just returned from a trip to Washington, DC, where, together with other members of the Bitcoin Foundation, we had the first multilateral meetings with the federal government on cryptocurrency.\n\nIt had been quite a party. FinCEN, IRS, FBI, DEA, SEC, CFPB, CFTC… just about any agency with a potential interest in magical internet money was there to hear us explain it to them. None were believers. In fact, the vibe in the room was clear: bitcoin is for criminals, and these apologists think they\'re going to change our minds.\n\nThis \'bitcoin is for criminals\' narrative may not have started with the Silk Road, but it was certainly buoyed by it.\n\nThe marketplace was accessible only via the so-called \'dark web\', an anonymous network that required specialized software to use. Once accessed, you could buy anything. Drugs, porn, fake driver\'s licenses… so long as you paid in bitcoin.\n\nIt was the first, and, at the time, the only one of its kind. As the Silk Road grew in popularity, so did recognition that bitcoin could be used for illicit activity, and so did the government\'s interest in it.\n\nSo, the government shut Silk Road down.\n\nThe hammer\n\nIt happened in October of 2013, just a couple of months after our grand defense of bitcoin to the very federal agencies that gave the order.\n\nI can\'t say just where I heard the news first, but the reports hit almost at once: posts on social media, emails from clients, calls for comment from the press, communications from the Bitcoin Foundation\'s PR team.\n\nIn many of their voices, I heard an unmistakable tinge of panic – the kind of panic usually endemic to tense depositions or bet-the-company litigations – but the only bitcoiner arrested was Ross Ulbricht, the dark market\'s alleged (and convicted) operator.\n\nThe rest of the bitcoin citizenry was panicked because they were stakeholders in all of it.\n\nBitcoin was the lifeblood of the Silk Road.\n\nThe shock\n\nAt the Bitcoin Foundation, we scrambled to develop messaging. At my law practice, we worked to gauge client exposure and risk. Was crypto prohibition on the horizon? Would bitcoin be deemed contraband?\n\nWould the government classify our clients – bitcoin businesses – as entities of primary money laundering concern? If so, an entire industry would be blacklisted from the global financial system...\n\nOnce news broke, the media speculated widely that bitcoin transaction volumes would drop to near zero, and that bitcoin prices would do the same. After all, bitcoin was for criminals, the narrative went, and now that the greatest criminal use for bitcoins was gone, what was bitcoin good for?\n\nAt the time, we could only speculate. A systemic limitation of a permissionless, pseudonymous network is a lack of data on the intent of its users. We could only guess how much of bitcoin was tied to Silk Road.\n\nMany of us, even if privately, guessed that it was a lot.\n\nWe were wrong. When we finally looked back on the numbers, volume didn\'t drop. It soared. Price did fall, but almost immediately recovered and blew past its pre-Silk Road heights. It was astounding.\n\nDamage control\n\nOne of our public messaging points at the Bitcoin Foundation was the story that bitcoin was a currency with a heart of gold, now freed from unjust association with dark markets.\n\nIts value and its volume were now demonstrably independent from its greatest suspected criminal use, we said. From the beginning, the \'bitcoin is for criminals\' narrative had to be fiction.\n\nAnd we were right. Still, this wasn\'t the whole story. The whole story was a great deal more complex because, almost immediately, dozens of Silk Road copycats begun to spring up.\n\nWithin a year, there were plenty of dark markets using bitcoin. Some were even using new, more privacy-focused digital currencies that were opaque to forensics and post-hoc analysis.\n\nYet, we also started to see transaction volumes in developing countries start to climb significantly for the first time. People were using bitcoin to improve their lives. Word was getting out that there was an alternative to runaway inflation and fiscal mismanagement inherent in some government money.\n\nIt just so happened to get out to criminals quicker than it did to most everyone else.\n\nLasting impact\n\nStill, Silk Road showed us that bitcoin could be used for criminal transactions just as well as legitimate transactions.\n\nIts shuttering showed us the criminal uses of bitcoin were probably much more limited than anyone – even most bitcoiners – suspected. Silk Road changed the way we thought about money. It changed the way we thought about anonymity. It was a rarified moment in history, the effects of which transformed an industry.\n\nIt changed so much about my government outreach work and my practice of law. But at the time, I couldn\'t even work up the courage to log on and buy some alpaca socks.\n\nI still kick myself.\n\nFor more of Santori\'s writing, read his seminal series on Bitcoin Law, Parts 1, 2 and 3, which provide a basic primer on the state of US law as it relates to cryptocurrencies.\n\nSilk road image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

This was the era where Zimbabwe bank notes varied from 10 to 100 Billion Zimbabwean dollars.\n\nThe country had no other option but to abandon their currency and adopt the US Dollar in 2009. But the country run out of US dollars and withdrawal were limited to just $50 a day.\n\nWith the introduction of the bond notes pegged to the US dollar last year, the situation in terms of hyperinflation is quite better, but it is still awful trying to get money. Daily withdrawal limit is now set at $100 bond notes. However, some banks have even limited that to $30 whilst others have closed their ATMs.\n\nLong Queues\n\nWalking or driving through the streets of Harare, long queues at Banks and ATMs meandering its ways into the streets are a common sight these days. Banks no more cannot accommodate clients at bank halls, and they have to lined up to be served.\n\nOn Thursday, I joined a queue at the Ecobank branch at Borrowdale at 9:30 am to receive a Western Union transfer. I had to stand in the sun outside the bank in a queue that was as long as a hundred meters.\n\nThere was desperation written on the faces of everyone in the line. Some of them have been there as early as 5 am. I decided to strike a conversation with some of the people nearby. “Is it like this every day?”, I asked a middle-aged woman in front of me, and she responded by asking me where I come from.\n\nWhen I told her I’m from Ghana, West Africa, she started complaining bitterly about how they cannot get access to their own hard earned money. A young man behind me in the queue remarked that sometimes people have to sleep at the entrance of the bank when it is getting to holiday seasons like Christmas and Easter.\n\nI decided to introduced them to Bitcoin and proceeded to download a Blockchain wallet on the smartphone of the lady I spoke to earlier. At this stage, they became so interested and a human circle was formed around me.\n\nI managed to assist five people in all to get a wallet and tipped them $2 each. They were amazed at the speed the cash got into their wallets. With excitement written on their faces, I gave them the address of Bitfinace and told them they can buy Bitcoin and exchange their Bitcoin for cash there.\n\nIt was so invigorating since this is the essence of the Across Africa With Bitcoin Journey. When it finally got to my turn and I was served it was half past 13:00.\n\nEngaging a banker who asked for anonymity at the banking hall, I learnt the situation is going to get worse, as banks’ cash reserves are dwindling.\n\nSuffering Productivity\n\nThe circumstances Zimbabweans find themselves in is no doubt affecting productivity. To stand in a queue for hours before you can get money is very debilitating and counter-productive for work.\n\nMany of the people I spoke to at the bank explained to me they have left their business or been excused from work to come and access banking services. It is so frustrating and unthinkable.\n\nRipe For Cryptocurrencies\n\nObviously, the situation here can be remedied by pushing the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Tawanda Kembo of Bitfinance, Zimbabwe’s only Bitcoin Exchange tells me his company had to withdraw their advertisement since demand exceeds supply.\n\nThe challenge here is to scale education on Cryptocurrencies as well as supporting organisations pushing adoption in Zimbabwe. Crypto investors should also give Zimbabwe attention since there is a lot of money to be made here.\n\nWe should ignore the idea that digital currency businesses could be expropriated since the government understands it through the work and association with Bitmari founders, another organisation giving women farmers loan in Bitcoin.

The billionaire Bitcoin enthusiast has kept himself out of the media for some time. It appears Draper is now investing in a new cryptocurrency, though. To be more specific, he will partake in an ICO of a coin no one has heard of so far. Now is a good time to look at what Tezos brings to the table.\n\nIt is good to hear Tim Draper still keeps an eye on cryptocurrency. However, no one expected he would invest in an upcoming ICO. Initial Coin Offerings have become all the rage in cryptocurrency as of late. Some people are concerned this is a major bubble that will cause significant financial losses, though. Moreover, new coins and tokens are created nearly every day, yet very few of them will have any value whatsoever.\n\nTim Draper Is Not Done With Crypto Yet\n\nFor some unknown reason, Tim Draper believes Tezos will be the coin to invest in. It will be his first ICO in history, which is quite interesting. Rather than investing more in Bitcoin, Draper feels this unknown token will bring some value to the world. Tezos is yet another blockchain platform that will launch in the near future. An interesting development, although not something that will necessarily be a profitable investment.\n\nVenture capitalists have always been tight-lipped when it comes to cryptocurrency ICOs. A lot of people remain wary of this investment structure, and for good reason. A lot of these platforms have yet to show a single line of code when they raise money. Although there are people with good intentions out there, chances of buying a useless token are quite high. Moreover, with money pouring into ICOs right now, there is the risk of creating a bubble.\n\nWhat is even more disconcerting is the Tezos ICO itself. There is no hard limit on the number of tokens issued during the ICO. Moreover, it is unclear how the tokens can be used right now. It is good to see Tim Draper pay attention to these products. However, this sounds like investing into a platform that will offer no ROI whatsoever.

The best part was that there were many resistances break like $1500 and $1600. A solid trend as forecasted in the last weekly analysis above $1450 is established, and we may see more upsides. The price recently tested $1700 (data feed from SimpleFX), but could not break it for a move towards $1720. Later, it started a correction wave and moved below the $1600 support.\n\nIt traded as low as $1506 where it found support. At the moment, there are two bullish trend lines formed with support at $1550 and $1525 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. These both trend lines are important for more gains above $1620.

Currently, it is attempting a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1700 high to $1506 low at $1605.

She gets the money within 10 minutes, it costs me around 40 cents to send and she also gets a discount for using Bitcoin.""\n\nStellnberger uses Bitcoin as a way of converting his New Zealand dollars into Euros when he goes back to his native Austria on holiday.\n\nThis only really works, he says, in countries that have well-developed Bitcoin markets.\n\nI couldn\'t exchange my Bitcoin into Uruguayan Pesos or Thai baht unless I was willing to meet local dealers. That might not be safe, and there are more interesting things to do with your time.\n\nIn future, I am sure it will be possible to change Bitcoin or other electronic currencies such as Ethereum into local currency at the airport or from cashpoint machines.\n\nOr retailers and even market stalls may eventually start accepting payment directly in Bitcoin.\n\nRestaurants in some countries are already taking it as payment.\n\nI like the idea of pulling out my smartphone, scanning the restaurant\'s QR code and paying directly in Bitcoin instead of local currency or Visa/Mastercard.\n\nThe real advantage would be avoiding those offshore margins and unfavourable conversion rates offered by banks and credit card companies.\n\nThe problem is we\'re a bit backward here in New Zealand and buying Bitcoin is difficult and expensive.\n\nLocalbitcoins.com is probably the best known exchange where Kiwis buy Bitcoin. A staggering $300,000 of Bitcoin exchange is taking place on Localbitcoins.com here each week.\n\nThe graph can be viewed at coin.dance/volume/localbitcoin.\n\nThere is also myBitcoinsaver.com, which allows Kiwis to set up a direct debit to save Bitcoin into their personal wallets. But the fees are quite high and the marketing that includes the words ""set forget and watch it grow"" fails to mention that currencies can fall just as easily.\n\nThe real problem with both is charges.\n\nTraders selling through Localbitcoins.com take quite a high margin and myBitcoinsaver charges 2.5 per cent commission plus a ""delivery fee"", which partially defeats the purpose of Bitcoin exchange being cheap.\n\nIn the US and Europe it\'s possible to link your bank account to your Coinbase or other digital wallet and shift between $US or Euro and Bitcoin easily with no or minimal fees.\n\nThere is definitely a gap in the market here for a Coinbase equivalent, which I\'m sure will happen eventually.', ""On Friday, Bitcoin has added over $1 bln to its market cap, repeating the pattern of recent days.\n\nSince the month started, its market cap had risen by an average of $1 bln per day for the past five days according to CoinMarketCap moving from about $21 bln on May 1 to $26 bln on May 5.\n\nWhether this is sustainable would be determined by the market in the coming days. Thus, it falls within the premise of the discussion that the Bitcoin market is still small, its potential is huge and it has a long a way to go in terms of reach and adoption.\n\nRecent comments by some industry insiders support this viewpoint.\n\n84,12 and three months\n\nBruce Fenton, host of the Satoshi Roundtable and a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, recently made a tweet that puts the uptake of the entire cryptocurrency market cap into a somewhat meaningful perspective.\n\nBruce Fenton\u200f writes:\n\n“It took seven years for the value of all cryptocurrency to hit $10 bln, another year to hit $20 bln and three more months to hit $40 bln.”\n\nCan it become worthless in a day? Fenton’s point is to draw attention to the market’s trend which could establish that its growth rate is becoming exponential. This is particularly interesting considering that the entire market was able to gain about $5 bln in the past week alone.\n\nBitcoin Price $1,500 “isn't cool”\n\nIt leads to the view shared by the investor Trace Mayer,\u200f who, in reference to an interview he had granted in 2013, touched on the view that the Bitcoin market could grow more. In the video, Mayer laid out his case for Bitcoin to reach $2.8 mln per unit at some point tipping the price range at the time - $800 and $1,200 - as being at the initial stage of price discovery.\n\nHis latest tweet, however, coming in the wake of the recent rise of the digital currency over $1,500, was tagged to his 2013 claim. It suggests that the current price of over $1,500 “isn't cool” but a $2 mln to $5 mln price range for a Bitcoin actually is.\n\nHard part passed\n\nIn another twist, another Bitcoin crusader, Charlie Shrem, adds that the rise of Bitcoin price from $0 to $1,500 seems a lot harder to him than getting from $1,500 to $150,000."", 'FastCompany’s report revealed that overseas remittance totaled $429 billion in 2016. Some of the largest Remittance markets include China and the Philippines. Already, bitcoin startups have begun to dominate the remittance markets in the two countries, with the Philippines leading bitcoin remittance innovation.\n\nBoth domestic and international remittance is a massive market within the Philippines. Companies such as Lhuillier and Palawan operate thousands of branches throughout the country, with deeper market penetration in comparison to international remittance companies such as Western Union.\n\nSince early 2016, bitcoin startups led by Coins.ph, a remittance and bitcoin payment service provider founded by CEO Ron Hose, began to threaten local remittance companies such as Lhuiller that have been dominant for decades. An appealing business model of Coins.ph was to enable a wide range of deposit and withdrawal methods suited for the needs of local recipients.\n\nFor instance, like Western Union, Lhuillier users must visit local Lhuillier branches in order to receive payments. Coins.ph however have partnered with banks, local remittance companies, convenience stores and other companies to provide as many options as possible for local users. Currently, Coins.ph users can receive payments via nationwide bank ATMs, Gcash–local digital currency developed by telecommunications company Globe Telecom that can be used to send and withdraw payments using Bank ATMs, more than 20 partnered banks, remittance outlets such as Lhuillier and LBC, and even door-to-door delivery.\n\nEmployees working in cities such as Manila can utilize door-to-door deliveries to send money to their families in the provinces and countryside to prevent additional expenses and time occurred by visiting local remittance outlets and receiving payments.\n\nThe popularity and penetration rate of Philippine bitcoin startups exponentially increased when the Philippine government officially legalized bitcoin as legal tender and as a remittance method. The official circular released by the central bank of the Philippines read:\n\n“The Bangko Sentral does not intend to endorse any VC, such as Bitcoin, as a currency since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity. Rather, the BSP aims to regulate VCs when used for delivery of financial services, particularly, for payments and remittances, which have a material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability.”\n\nIn an interview with FastCompany, World Bank’s Marco Nicolo further emphasized that the emergence of innovative players and service providers within the global remittance markets has led to increased digital transactions in different forms. Nicolo stated:\n\n“We have seen more innovation in the delivery channel stage of the transaction where players allow transactions to be initiated over the internet in different forms. Ultimately, however, most of these models have to rely on the corresponding banking network. This is where where the potential of [distributed ledger technology] and blockchain innovation is.”\n\nHowever, executives of existing dominant remittance companies including Western Union reaffirmed that tight regulations and policies on remittance payments and service providers have made it more expensive to initiate payments internationally. Bitcoin can significantly reduce operating and regulatory costs in the sense that by using KYC and AML policies, each account or bitcoin wallet addressed are readily available for verification.\n\nExpressing his skepticism over bitcoin and blockchain technology’s potential impact on the global remittance industry, Western Union’s chief information officer David Thompson stated:\n\n“Technology doesn’t solve all those business and regulatory issues. Some pure technology plays forget that. We live in a world with criminal networks and entities that you have to keep out of your infrastructure. There’s a pretty high barrier to entry because of the risks associated with the market.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Wipro, one of the leading information technology and consumer goods company, is currently having a sense of deja vu after it received a threat from an anonymous source. According to Indian media reports, the threat email in which the sender demands a ransom of over INR 500 crore ($77.7 million) in Bitcoin was directed to the company’s IT division based out of Bangalore.\n\nThe email communication gives Wipro a deadline of May 25, 2017, to pay the ransom or face a biotoxin attack on one of their campuses in Bangalore. It further states that a 2-gram sample of Ricin, a potent biotoxin will be sent to one of the Wipro’s offices in the coming days.\n\nThis is not the first-time Wipro has received such threatening emails. Earlier in 2013, someone had sent a letter in which they threatened to blow up one of the company’s campuses. While the recent threat of Ricin attack and ransom demand seems to be a similar hoax, neither the company nor the law enforcement agencies are willing to take chances.\n\nIn a statement, Wipro officials have stated,\n\n“Wipro confirms that it has filed a complaint with the local law enforcement authorities after receiving a threatening letter from an unidentified source. Wipro has augmented security measures at all its office locations. There is no impact on the company’s operations. We have no further comments as the investigation is ongoing”.\n\nThe cybercrime division of Bangalore Police is said to be investigating the origin of the email at the moment.\n\nThe sender also lists possible methods of delivery of the toxin. The list includes contamination of the company cafeteria food, dispersal through drones or on toilet seats in the facility.\n\nThe number of ransom threats involving Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is on the rise in the recent days. There are many occasions where people fake a ransom threat just to create chaos. All these activities have ended up giving Bitcoin a bad name, making the governments and individuals consider the cryptocurrency a threat to security and well-being. However, the cryptocurrency and its underlying technology have been making progress in the economy and technology fronts, increasing the efficiency of existing processes which have mostly gone unnoticed among the uninitiated.\n\nRef: NDTV | Image: NewsBTC', 'Support us today!

While the answer to this question is obvious to all seasoned traders, I thought I’d spend a few minutes answering it for those who are relatively new to this arena.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nThere are several reasons, but there are a few that stand out as the most compelling. The first is paper profits. At the start of every major bull move there are many people who bought early. As the markets reward them for their buying decision they are increasingly happy (of course). But they understand that their ‘profits’ are only on paper until they sell. They realize that if the market falls back to where it began, their windfall will be gone, if not reversed to a loss. It puts them in a conundrum because they all want to sell the top, but where is the top? Every trader has an ever-increasing anxiety as their position grows in value. With each uptick they have more to lose. Everyone wants to be the first to sell, but they don’t want to panic and sell too soon. It is nerve-wracking. Those who were long Ripple last night were in this position. That is for sure.\n\nWhen there is a red candle each trader must make a decision, and there comes a time when many people decide, at the same time, to lock in their profits, and the way they do this is to sell. The initial selling puts fear in the hearts of those who were brave just a moment earlier, and the selling soon takes on a life of its own. Eventually, prices reach a point where other traders decide they want to buy at that price, and the selling is overcome by new buying.\n\nThe next reason is stop losses. Most traders use stop losses which close their position if the market moves against them. It is a wise practice, but it often results in positions being closed at the worst possible time. Selling at the low, or buying at the top. (I hate that, but I wold rather suffer a rash of such aggravating losses than be wiped out in a single market event.)\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nThere are a slew of cunning traders out there with the market power to ‘run the stops’ . They know that after a huge move there are a ton of stops out there, and they can pretty well guess where they are. By looking at the chart they can see where most people put their stops. They know that if they can start a reversal and cause it to move far enough to trigger the stops, a chain reaction will ensue, causing the market to move sharply in reverse. Before they begin the process these traders put in buy orders ( or sell orders, depending on market direction) at the low they expect will be hit.\n\nI can’t prove it of course, but I am reasonably sure that the ETH massacre last month at $52 was just such an affair. It was ruthless and financially devastating to many traders. It may seem unfair to newbies, but this business is a knife fight, and there are no rules in a knife fight.\n\nThe last major reason is margin calls. I advise new traders to NOT use leverage. Only trade what your account allows you to buy or sell. Leverage is awesome when you are on the right side of a trade, but quite cruel when you are not. Also, it forces you to sell in a panic, even when you don’t want to.\n\nIf you are using leverage you cannot wait out the violent swings. A friend of mine bought ETH at the $21 high and still had them at $6, because he did not buy them using leverage. I’m sure it was painful to the extreme to hold them, but he believed they would eventually go up again. As of yesterday he was up more than 5x!! His patience was amply rewarded. If he had used leverage, he would have been left with a significant loss when the inevitable margin calls were issued.\n\nI usually do not trade with leverage, though on occasion I will. I simply hate the added pressure of margin calls. There is enough pressure in this business without that headache. But, opinions differ on this point.\n\nHere is a brief look at the major coins as of this morning:\n\nBitcoin\n\nI still think Bitcoin is over-extended and ripe for a fall. I would close any long positions I had here.\n\nRipple\n\nXRP is still a buy here. I suspect .20 is in the cards in the next few weeks.\n\nLitecoin\n\nLitecoin is a buy with a target of $30, then $36 if $30 yields.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is a buy here. I have a feeling that $150 is on the horizon.\n\nETC\n\nETC is a hold until it clears the $7.5 high. If it does that, it could double to $15.\n\nZECUSD\n\nZEC is a buy. It could go to $140.\n\nXMR\n\nMonero is a buy. It could go to $40.\n\nREP & DASH\n\nThese two are a hold. They have resistance to get through before they can make significant gains again.\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgement.

05/07/2017,"['For the past several years, a hot debate has been taking place in the comment sections of alternative financial media sites. The debate is between those who have embraced cryptocurrency and its ability to protect its owners in tumultuous economic times and those who believe that only precious metals can properly fill this role.\n\nHowever, a well-rounded crisis portfolio should contain both cryptocurrency and precious metals, and they actually complement each other quite well.\n\nBitcoin price and financial crises\n\nGold and silver have thousands of years of history as a safe haven that no other asset class can match but Bitcoin is certainly building up an impressive track record for itself. Bitcoin price went up during the 2013 Cyprus Bail-in, the Russian Ruble Crisis of 2014, the 2015 Greek Crisis and the early 2016 imposition of Chinese capital controls.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Bitcoin had a similar reaction to Brexit and had an even more pronounced reaction to the Indian bank note demonetization and its resulting chaos.\n\nBitcoin’s latest crisis-driven run-up was assisted by continued Chinese capital controls and general political uncertainty. This short but consistent performance may not make Bitcoin a bona fide safe haven but it does demonstrate capital flight into crypto during times of economic shock will probably continue.\n\nChart data obtained from bitcoincharts.com\n\n- Cyprus Bail-in\n\n- Russian Ruble Crisis\n\n- Greek Crisis\n\n- Chinese Capital Controls\n\n- Brexit\n\n- Indian Demonetization\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap, according to coinmarketcap.com at the time of this publication, is about 34 bln dollars, which is less than one percent of the value of above-ground precious metals. In turn, the value of above ground precious metals is only about two percent of the size of the total world debt market. This is to say that the cryptocurrency market is very small and thus still has plenty of potential for growth.\n\nHow about precious metals?\n\nOver the past several years, the owners of gold and silver have seen losses or very little returns from their assets, whereas the owners of cryptocurrency have enjoyed significant gains. Currently, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lack a futures market, which is a favorite tool for manipulation of the precious metals market.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that precious metals don’t have their place. There is a lot to be said for an asset with no counterparty risk that you can retain in your possession.\n\nThe owners of precious metals who denounce cryptocurrency fear a government crackdown, technical problems or unknown flaws. For these reasons, they refuse to invest in cryptocurrency. There is also likely some stubbornness and/or sour grapes mixed in with their claims.\n\nHowever, what precious metal owners should realize is that they are at a significant advantage when investing in cryptocurrency, compared to those who don’t own gold and silver. If the value of cryptocurrency is significantly impacted or somehow wiped out by an unforeseen event, that safe-haven demand will flow somewhere.\n\nIf the thesis of cryptocurrency being a safe haven was to be called into question, precious metals would likely be the beneficiary. Considering this, precious metals are a natural hedge for many of the concerns and risks pertaining to cryptocurrency.\n\nThe impact of regulations\n\nThe most recent government reaction that impacted the cryptocurrency market occurred in China when regulators imposed new regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges that resulted in Bitcoin accounts being frozen. As you can see in the chart below, there was a clear negative reaction to Bitcoin price in response to this intervention but also note that the value of gold moved in the opposite direction.\n\nBoth precious metals and cryptocurrency will likely benefit from the inherent flaws in our debt-based monetary system, but owning one type of asset shouldn’t deter anyone from investing in the other. Precious metals and cryptocurrencies should be partners in a crisis portfolio: cryptocurrency for its potential for significant gains, and gold and silver, as always, as insurance against unforeseen outcomes.\n\nBy The Reset\n\nDisclaimer: The author of this story is not a financial adviser and it should not be considered financial advice.

The author is long silver, Bitcoin, and Ether.', ""NEW DELHI: IT company Wipro receiving an anonymous threat of a toxic drug attack unless it pays Rs 500 crore in bitcoins is part of a criminal trend gathering force all over the world — the bitcoin ransom.Transactions in the virtual currency of bitcoin, which is part of no banking system, cannot be tracked which makes it easier for cyber criminals to run their trade. People can send and receive money online through bitcoins anonymously.While Wipro has been threatened with a toxic drug attack, the more common form of this crime is hackers infecting a computer system with ransomware which encrypts all the data and then demanding payment in bitcoins to unlock the data or devices. A large number of individuals and organisations end up paying ransom to rescue their data.After getting the ransom, hackers send an encryption code which unlocks the data. In some instances, they offer to unlock a small part of the encrypted data to show the victim that the data could be rescued.Experts say bitcoin transactions are on the rise due to a large number of victims of ransomware attacks deciding to pay up instead of reporting the crime.Currently, a bitcoin is worth $1,595. The total value of the bitcoin market is about $24.5 billion, thrice what it was this time last year.According to the US Department of Justice, ransomware attacks have quadrupled this year from a year ago, averaging 4,000 a day. The ransomware payments range from $500 to $30,000, depending on the importance of the data.In February, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles paid $17,000 to get its files unlocked after a ransomware attack. Hackers broke into its servers and encrypted a huge amount of data rendering the documents unreadable, paralysing most of the services in the hospital.In India, ransomware attacks originate mostly from outside the country.Last year in August, computer server of a diagnostic centre in north Delhi was hacked into. Hackers demanded $1,300 ransom in bitcoins. They encrypted all the files and left a message, 'your data is encrypted'.In January this year, a horse-racing website operating from Bengaluru, RacingPulse.in, was hacked and all its filed encrypted. The hackers demanded an unspecified amount in bitcoins as ransom. They said the amount would depend on how fast the website owners got in touch with them. They offered to decrypt a small part of data to prove that they can decrypt all the files after receiving the ransom.Many banks and big corporate houses have suffered ranbsomware attacks in India before the Wipro case.?

Although a lot of people assumed this currency to be dead in the water, that is not the case. In fact, things are heading in a very bullish direction. The Litecoin value increased by over 700%. This is due to SegWit locking in and the Coinbase listing. The future’s looking bright for Bitcoin’s silver, that much is evident.\n\nLitecoin Value Continues To Soar\n\nLitecoin has come a very long way these past few weeks. Earlier this year, one LTC was valued at US$4. That is quite a ways from its previous ATH of around US$48 in 2013. Ever since that time, a lot of people have forgotten about LTC. Things have an odd way to work itself out, though, as Litecoin is on everybody’s mind right now.\n\nThe popular cryptocurrency locked in the activation of SegWit not too long ago. That in itself is quite a major boon for this popular currency. Bitcoin is trying to get SegWit activated too, yet keeps meeting opposition from miners. However, the impending activation of Segregated Witness has done wonders for the LTC price. In fact, the Litecoin value has increased by 700% so far.\n\nThat gain cannot only be attributed to the SegWit activation locking in, though. Coinbase, a very popular US-based cryptocurrency exchange, enabled Litecoin support as well. This, in turn, has given the Litecoin value another boost upward. It looks like LTC is well underway to surpass US$30 again. It is hard to tell where this will end, although a value of US$50 is not out of the question.\n\nWhat Is Next For LTC?\n\nAt the same time, one has to keep in mind Litecoin does not have the same issues bitcoin has. Litecoin never had full blocks to begin with, whereas it is very common on the Bitcoin network. There is also a lack of demand when it comes to Litecoin, especially from a merchant and consumer point of view. These are all issues that can be addressed quickly, though. However, the question becomes whether or not the Litecoin value can maintain this trend in the long run.\n\nIn the end, a lot of people still look at Litecoin as a Bitcoin testbed. Any development changes failing to gain traction can be ported to Litecoin to see how well they do. A lot of people will keep an eye on the SegWit malleability fix and how it affects Litecoin. These are still exciting times to be involved in altcoins, though. Anyone holding LTC may see the Litecoin value increase a bit further these coming weeks.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Ex-state legislator Daisy Baez pleads guilty to perjury charge in Miami\n\nThe Coral Gables Democrat, who lasted less than a year in office, left office last week as part of the plea deal struck with prosecutors.', ""Government working to end the double taxation of Bitcoin\n\nAlison Banney 8 May 2017\n\nCurrently, consumers are taxed when they receive digital currency.\n\nThe government has announced its support for the Productivity Commission's recommendation that digital currencies such as Bitcoin should be treated as a financial supply for GST purposes.\n\nThis recommendation is to eradicate the double taxation issue of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, to ensure that businesses that use these currencies are not being taxed twice to do so.\n\nCurrently, consumers and businesses are effectively taxed twice when using digital currency to purchase goods and services that are already subject to GST. This is because the supply of digital currency is taxed, meaning the consumer pays GST when receiving the currency and again when purchasing anything already subject to GST.\n\nThe Productivity Commission recommends that the definition of money in relevant GST regulations be updated to include digital currency. It also recommends that the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act be updated to include the regulation of digital currency businesses for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing purposes.\n\nThe government agrees with this approach, saying “The government is committed to facilitating innovation and growth in the digital currency sector,” in its response.\n\n“The government agrees that consumers should not be subject to the GST twice when using digital currency to purchase goods or services.”\n\n“The government is working with the FinTech Advisory Group on options to reform the current GST treatment of digital currencies and has released a consultation paper for public consideration as part of the 2016-17 Budget,” the response said.\n\nThe government has already previously announced its commitment to solving the issue of double taxation of digital currencies in a report released in March 2016. However, little has been done towards a solution since.\n\nJust last week Bitcoin’s value soared to record-setting highs, with the digital currency climbing above US$1,500 late last week.\n\nThe surge was the result of increased interest in the digital currency and a steep rise in global trading activity."", 'Bitcoin price could be due for more gains as it broke to the upside from its short-term symmetrical triangle pattern.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price recently formed lower highs and higher lows, creating a symmetrical triangle consolidation pattern on its 1-hour chart.\n\nZooming out to longer-term time frames reveals that this could be a bullish flag forming after its sharp climb.\n\nThis chart pattern is typically considered a continuation signal and bitcoin price just made an upside breakout.\n\nBitcoin price could be due for more gains as it broke to the upside from its short-term symmetrical triangle pattern.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside. In addition, the 100 SMA lines up with the triangle support, adding to its strength as a floor in the event of another pullback. Also, the gap between the moving averages is getting wider to reflect strengthening bullish momentum.\n\nStochastic is on the move up to show that there is some buying pressure left but the oscillator is nearing the overbought zone to indicate rally exhaustion. Once it turns lower, selling pressure could return and trigger a pullback to the broken triangle resistance around $1550.\n\nRSI is also heading north so bitcoin price might follow suit. This indicator is also approaching overbought levels so buying momentum could fade at some point. However, if bulls keep charging, bitcoin price could retest the latest highs or even set new ones.\n\nMarket Events\n\nEconomic data from the US turned outs stronger than expected on Friday as the economy added more jobs than expected while the average earnings figure came in line with estimates. The Fed labor market conditions index is due today and a rise from the earlier 0.4 reading could support stronger odds of a rate hike in June.\n\nStill, bitcoin price is enjoying support from stronger volumes in Japan as the government’s recent decision to accept the cryptocurrency as a legal form of payment has led to increase activity among investors. Expectations for SEC approval for the COIN bitcoin ETF is also driving up demand and price at the moment.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

By providing a peer to peer protocol wherein users can send and receive transactions with the absence of intermediaries, Bitcoin essentially became the first decentralized financial platform.\n\nReplicating or being inspired by Bitcoin’s structure, alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins emerged. One of the most successful cryptocurrencies that has maintained its market cap and client base over a relatively long period of time is Ripple. It consistently has ranked in the top three altcoin, falling behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ripple’s vision was to provide a more efficient infrastructure for the centralized institutions and the conventional finance industry.\n\nRipple is significantly different to Bitcoin philosophically and structurally. If bitcoin is described as a decentralized peer to peer network developed to operate as an alternative financial network to that of the existing global financial system, Ripple can be explained as a protocol structured to serve and enhance the existing global financial system. It has partnered with leading banks and major financial institutions to settle cross-border and cross-bank transactions transparently, with strong security measures in real time.\n\nThe current global financial system operates on top of an outdated and inefficient IT infrastructure and system. For a transaction to become fully verified and settled, it could take days to weeks with a substantial fee, usually in the range of $30 to $50 per transaction. Often times, transactions initiated by banks through an international financial network such as SWIFT get lost within the system, requiring manual confirmation and a period of weeks for the transaction to be recovered and settled.\n\nEssentially, Ripple utilizes blockchain technology and the concept of digital tokens to simplify global banking. Major banks and financial institutions are in agreement with Ripple’s vision and strategy and have adopted Ripple’s system. Most recently, CryptoCoinsNews reported that Spanish banking giant BBVA began to utilize Ripple blockchain for Spain-Mexico money transfers.\n\n“This pioneer initiative is a clear demonstration of how payment processes can be vastly improved through the implementation of emerging technologies. These improvements will benefit our clients’ transnationality,” head of digital transformation in investment banking at BBVA stated.\n\nHowever, an ambiguous component of Ripple’s services is the necessity of intermediaries. In an email, Ripple representative told CryptoCoinsNews that Ripple executives believe “bank’s aren’t going away” and that “bitcoin is getting it wrong.” Yet, by growth, bitcoin has evidently appealed to a wider range of users, businesses and investors as it is valued at $23.7 billion at the time of reporting. Ripple’s market cap is below 10 percent of bitcoin’s.\n\n`An intermediary such as BBVA utilizing the Ripple network for a customer can be understood as an intermediary using another intermediary to process transactions. Thus, in the long run, one of the two intermediaries could be rendered ineffective. Either users will solely rely on the Ripple network and utilize XRP to make transactions with each other or banks will develop their own blockchain network similar to SWIFT and simply discard its partnership with Ripple.\n\nThe issue with banks developing their independent blockchain networks is the necessity of cooperation and collaboration. Hence, by relying on an existing blockchain network structured to serve financial institutions, banks can cut development costs.\n\nThree advantages Ripple offers to its banks is speed, certainty and cost. By utilizing a decentralized blockchain in Ripple, banks can potentially see a reduction of billions of dollars in operating costs. Whether banks will remain with Ripple and work on the development of a cross-bank network or form their own blockchain network like JP Morgan is still difficult to speculate.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The bitcoin scaling debate has driven many people in the bitcoin community to assume a cult-like viewpoint, an observation Vinny Lingham makes with despair. In a blog titled, “Satoshi’s Choice,” Lingham observed that the bitcoin community has failed to maintain a level attitude aimed at achieving the greater good for the community. Hence, he doesn’t see a resolution to the current impasse on bitcoin scaling in the short term.\n\nWithout a reasonable resolution to the current impasse, it will be difficult to avoid “exogenous pricing pressure” or another external catalyst for change.\n\nEmotions Get The Upper Hand\n\nLingham noted that the replies to his tweets have been emotive and insulting. When emotions get the upper hand and people can’t communicate with decorum, they suffer from impaired judgment.\n\nMost bitcoiners care about bitcoin’s price, he noted. Emotionally, they are invested in bitcoin as a digital currency and a store of value.\n\nLingham once believed a bitcoin price under $875 would push parties to reach an agreement. He did not expect the price to stay above $1,000 for an extended period since the incentive to go beyond this did not exist. But he was wrong about this, and market forces are affecting the price, which he believes is not necessarily a negative development in the near term.\n\nAvoid A Hard Fork\n\nWhile he believes there are pros and cons to all sides of the scaling debate, one path that Lingham says should be avoided at all costs is a contentious hard fork resulting in a minority chain.\n\nBitcoin is still viewed by the public at large as a negative entity, thanks to Silk Road and other misadventures. One indication is the current set of issues dealing with getting fiat in and out of bitcoin exchanges.\n\nSatoshi’s Choice: What It Meant\n\nSatoshi made a choice, Lingham noted, to leave the bitcoin community to its own devices. He did this to give the community a gift, but one that came with a curse. The more the community loves bitcoin, the more greed emerged within the community and outside of it.\n\nLingham’s question now is: why does the community need a leader if bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency? The answer is that bitcoin is not yet a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency.\n\nFor bitcoin to be immune to manipulation, it must be decentralized at every layer. The bitcoin community, however, has focused on the price, scaling and other issues to the degree that bitcoin is the most secure but least innovative cryptocurrency.\n\nLingham would agree that immutability gives bitcoin its strength if the immutability was by distributed choice, not by default since decisions are centralized.\n\nBut instead of decentralized mining and decentralized exchanges with hefty volumes, the community has a few exchanges at the mercy of the banking system, as well as large mining pools controlled by a few operators, manufacturing controlled by two firms, and development that is run by one group of individuals.\n\nWhere capital formation has become decentralized, bitcoin is not making progress in removing monopolies.\n\nAlso read: Vinny Lingham says bitcoin hard fork should be avoided, Buterin argues\n\nOutlook\n\nDiversification is what leads to positive outcomes, Lingham claims.\n\nHe wants a world with multiple chip manufacturing and mining hardware providers competing for business from thousands of miners if not millions distributed worldwide. He wants to have a choice of dozens of mining pools with different bitcoin philosophies focused on the greater good but acting on their own accord.\n\nHe wants to see the market choose the best clients and BIPs, where dissenting voices find groups to join and not feel ostracized.\n\nHe wants to see each layer of decentralization working to make it more accessible to others as opposed to trying to fork bitcoin contentiously.\n\nIn the short term, people could start being more respectful of each other.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Now, Mauritius is looking at blockchain as a catalyst to fortify its competitive advantage and drive continued innovation on the island.\n\n""We are working to take our economy to another level, and these kinds of technologies are very important in our strategy,"" said Atma Narasiah, head of technology, innovation and services at the Board of Investment Mauritius, the national investment promotion agency of the island.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Blockchain is an area where we will be focusing, building competencies and ensuring that it permeates other sectors of the economy and government.""\n\nThe island nation has well-established financial services, information and communications technology industries, so attracting investors and entrepreneurs in blockchain and financial technology could be seen as a logical next step.\n\n""Blockchain is one of these technologies we want to drive. We see a window of opportunity here to be able to leapfrog others,"" Narasiah said.\n\nOpen invitation\n\nIn its quest to become the blockchain hub of the Indian Ocean, Mauritius has issued an open call for innovators to take advantage of the country\'s new Regulatory Sandbox License (RSL).\n\nThe sandbox allows companies operating in areas such as financial, medical and communications technology to start operating despite the absence of a formal legislative or licensing framework.\n\n""We\'ve been receiving innovative project [proposals] over the years but couldn\'t execute them because of the gap in the regulatory framework. We\'ve got a very good legal system, but at the pace at which technology is changing, we haven’t been able to keep pace on the regulatory front,"" said Narasiah, adding:\n\n""So we came up with Regulatory Sandbox License to be able to catalyze the execution of these projects.""\n\nModeled after similar approaches employed in Australia, Singapore and the UK, the RSL is open to all innovators, but there\'s an emphasis on attracting blockchain innovators across all verticals.\n\nThe expectation is that completed projects will help drive domestic and cross-border commerce and eventually expand into a smart city concept that links to other hub cities.\n\nSince launching in November 2016, the RSL has fielded 11 project proposals, with most under the fintech umbrella.\n\nTo be considered for approval, applicants must demonstrate their project is innovative, beneficial to the Mauritian economy and it cannot be accommodated in the investor’s home jurisdiction because of legal or regulatory gaps. Qualified applicants can obtain licensure in as little as 30 days, provided that all relevant information is received and risks are properly addressed.\n\nRegional force\n\nSo, why should blockchain investors consider setting up in Mauritius?\n\nNarasiah points to the nation\'s strong business and governance environment, which has been internationally recognized as the strongest in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAccording to the World Bank\'s annual ""Doing Business"" survey, Mauritius has the best business climate of any country in the region and ranks 49th out of 190 countries worldwide. The World Bank\'s rankings weigh factors such as ease of starting a business, enforcing contracts, obtaining credit, protecting investors and paying taxes.\n\nIn its annual competitiveness rankings, the World Economic Forum said Mauritius possesses Africa’s most competitive economy, best infrastructure and highest-educated workforce.\n\nNarasiah also highlighted an ongoing build-up of the country’s communications infrastructure – including projects to roll out free Wi-Fi across the island and install fiber optic connections in every residence – as a key attraction for technology investors.\n\nBridge to big markets\n\nSuch stability and its geographic location has made Mauritius a popular venue for financial services companies looking to make the jump into new markets on the African continent – where many of the world’s largest unbanked populations exist.\n\n""Mauritius is a country that many of the governments of African states would like to emulate. So if you have systems that have been tested properly in Mauritius – it gives a kind of assurance and credibility to that solution when you market it in Africa,"" said Narasiah.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Having done it in Mauritius gives it lots of mileage for you to expand into Africa.""\n\nMauritius also possesses a bilingual workforce speaking both English and French – two of the African continent’s lingua francas – and tax treaties with more than 20 African nations including South Africa, Zambia, Uganda and Rwanda.\n\nThe island nation also maintains close cultural and economic ties to India – a $2tn economy projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous nation in the next decade.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of Mauritians are of Indian descent, and Mauritius has been the largest single source of foreign direct investment into India in recent years because of a favorable double taxation avoidance treaty between the two nations.\n\nMauritius image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He explains why.\n\nIn January, people reacted strongly when Bitcoin passed the $1000 mark. Then in March Bitcoin surpassed the price of gold. So it was hardly a surprise when in May, it reached a new all-time high, trading above $1,400, mostly attributed to strong demand in Japan where it is now deemed a legal means of payment. The price of Bitcoin has tripled in the past year, and I believe it may top £3K in 2017.\n\nThe success of the digital currency lies in its universality and convenience, allowing people to do things in an easier way, much like the transport and telecommunications industries. However, just because something is easy does not necessarily guarantee adoption. So what is driving it’s popularity?\n\nThis year, the adoption of Bitcoin will be driven by those who operate in the grey economy and thus experience the strongest barriers to value transfer.\n\nA burgeoning ‘grey’ market\n\nTo use Bitcoins you don't need any proof of ID. Acquiring and transferring them from one location to another is extremely easy. Bitcoin rose to infamy due to its use on the dark web as the unit of currency for sites such as Silk Road, best known as an online market for selling drugs. However, Bitcoin is now being adopted by many people who want to move money across borders and hedge against hyper-inflation and currency restrictions, or as in India, banknote demonetisation. This is happening across the globe. Whereas dark web sites such as Silk Road occupy the dark market, this upswing in Bitcoin usage is known as the ‘grey’ market. These activities are likely become more and more mainstream in light of the changing political and economic climate, and this will drive a further increase in popularity. Thus Bitcoin is rapidly becoming a safe haven investment, being free from government interference, and with limited supply.\n\nThe right environment\n\nBefore the Brexit vote, when the world seemed a safe and consistent place, I put forward the theory that Bitcoin would pass gold as the safe haven currency. At the time I realised that given the right conditions digital currencies would only trend up in value. Since then we’ve seen the right conditions develop; China has a fragile economy, new political direction in the US, the political tsunami of Brexit, and upcoming European elections means we are likely to see more economic volatility.\n\nA consistent value\n\nAlmost all currencies are valued by either securing the currency against a commodity or by comparing its value against another currency. Bitcoin is unique; it not created by a sovereign state and without an owning authority. The value of Bitcoin is solely determined by the price someone is willing to pay for it. This is an important distinction from traditional currencies and the key strength of Bitcoin. With traditional currencies, when making international trades electronically you are relying on the availability of supply. If there are not enough dollars, yuan, euros or pounds the value of the currency will increase, or more is issued to cover the shortfall (supply and demand). This means one of two things, either the value of good in transit increases or the currency in question is devalued.\n\nThe value of bitcoin is, instead, determined by the value of products within trades taking place. When bitcoin was starting out, there wasn't much trade and therefore there wasn't much value; the value of a Bitcoin was low. Today, as we watch bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the amount of in-flight trade in goods using Bitcoin mans that the value must increase in order to cover the value of the goods. As there is a limited supply of Bitcoin and the supply will only increase slowly over time to a maximum of 21 million, the increase in trade volumes will result in an increase in Bitcoin value.\n\nSo the reason I believe that bitcoin will reach £3k in 2017 is really down to how much the value of trade will increase in 2017. The largest ever bitcoin transaction was on 12th March 2017 at $860K, the largest number of transactions in a single day is a number that increase week on week. This shows a upwards trend of Bitcoin usage, and as Bitcoin is not seen as an tradable commodity by the investment houses, this trend is driven by trade. Which means Bitcoins has to increase in value to meet the demands of higher trade and value volumes and thus higher value transactions.\n\nSo what?\n\nThe value of Bitcoin transactions, with more increasing adoption and acceptance, underpinned by easy access, growth could actually outstrip the original $3000 prediction. If not by the end of this year, then probably in the next. Bitcoin is one to watch."", 'Usually dismissed as less innovative than the more widely used bitcoin blockchain, the activation of a code upgrade called Segregated Witness (SegWit) is inspiring developers to give the smaller litecoin network a second look.\n\nThe fourth-largest public blockchain by total investment, litecoin is expected to formally add SegWit this week – a move that could pave the way for projects that are all but impossible to implement on bitcoin today. And, with the chances that SegWit will activate on bitcoin appearing less likely, the decision has put a new spotlight on litecoin, launched in 2011 as one of the first \'altcoins\' seeking to optimize the bitcoin code base.\n\nNow, projects that were seeking to build on top of SegWit on bitcoin are beginning to talk openly about using litecoin as a testbed that would hopefully prove their ideas on a live, public blockchain.\n\nSo far, the Lightning Network is the most concrete example of how some teams are adapting to the new possibility. Last week, one Lightning project released a version of its software designed to be compatible with litecoin.\n\nBut other projects that are dependent on SegWit look to be eyeing the bitcoin alternative as well.\n\nNicolas Dorier, bitcoin developer and CTO for distributed ledger startup Metaco, summed up the current mood by explaining that developers are simply becoming eager to continue their work in any way possible.\n\nDorier told CoinDesk:\n\n""[L]ots of developers assumed that SegWit would pass, and [they] built a lot of stuff. The last thing developers want is to see their work wasted.""\n\nNew migrations\n\nStill, the transition won\'t be as easy as it might sound, as there is work needed to ensure both the litecoin code base and projects that seek to use it can make the switch.\n\nFor example, Johnson Lau, one of the lead developers behind MAST (which seeks to enable more complex smart contracts on bitcoin), now plans to implement the project on top of litecoin. So far, this has seen Lau taking a more active day-to-day role with litecoin\'s code, writing up a guide to help miners to prepare for SegWit activation.\n\nDorier, who also leads development of NBitcoin, a .NET library for programmers, mentioned that he has spent some time adding support for SegWit into the software.\n\nAfter growing ""frustrated"" with the fact that SegWit wasn\'t activating on bitcoin, he made the library compatible with litecoin – a process that took him only a few hours, he said.\n\nDorier\'s other well-known project is NTumbleBit, an implementation of the theoretical decentralized coin mixer TumbleBit that works as a top-layer network similar to Lightning. (Dorier hopes eventually to add functionality that will allow users to exchange bitcoin for litecoin trustlessly and with more privacy via the service.)\n\n""That’s my goal,"" he said.\n\nMomentum boost\n\nThe buzz over SegWit is also helping jumpstart previously announced litecoin R&D efforts.\n\nFor instance, another much-talked-about project that could see use on litecoin is \'confidential transactions\', designed to shield sensitive data on public blockchains.\n\nLitecoin developers have been working on implementing the idea since at least September, when Litecoin Core developer Xinxi Wang issued a development update in which he argued that SegWit would make it easier to deploy the privacy-focused technology.\n\nYet, when contacted by CoinDesk, Litecoin Foundation director Franklyn Richards said that the team isn\'t ready to talk about the project yet.\n\nOne potential problem is that confidential transactions take up about almost 20 times more space on the blockchain than normal transactions. Considering that blockchain networks have limited capacity today (prompting much caustic debate in the bitcoin space), this factor could perhaps represent a problem for litecoin further down the road.\n\nFurther, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell, who\'s been working on confidential transactions, argued in a recent talk that it would be ""premature"" to add the technology to litecoin today.\n\nOther developers, however, spoke to their desire to use litecoin, if only for short-term ideation.\n\nSergio Demián Lerner, a developer at bitcoin smart contract startup RSK, said the team is unlikely to change its plans depending on ""which blockchain activates SegWit first"".\n\nHe emphasized:\n\n""RSK is bitcoin-centered at this point.""\n\nHowever, since the firm plans to open source the tech, it\'s possible that others will take up the reigns and build their own version on top of litecoin.\n\n""We will help any serious group that works to foster RSK technology,"" he added.\n\nThe caveats\n\nStill, it\'s worth noting that there\'s an element of politicization in the works.\n\nDespite the fact that litecoin has passed SegWit, as RSK\'s comments show, there\'s still a preference among developers toward the bitcoin network, which is seen as a more serious and more valuable long-term project. Further, the kinds of technical projects that are considering migrating efforts to litecoin are generally experimental and very early stage.\n\nThe combination of both factors has raised some concerns in the community.\n\nWhile litecoin may enable a wave of youthful projects to test their ideas, some have expressed fears that in doing so they will \'pump\' the value of litecoin\'s token by way of making grand technical promises that win attention from investors.\n\nAlready, litecoin\'s price has swelled to three-year highs on the SegWit news.\n\nAnd Dorier, for one, has been mulling over longer-term problems, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“Even if [SegWit] makes litecoin better for some use cases right now, the main problem is that the mining centralization issue is still not solved, whether it’s bitcoin or litecoin. If litecoin gets big enough, it will have the same problems that bitcoin is having right now.”\n\nHe pointed to the current favored way of making upgrades to bitcoin consensus rules, echoing the opinion that it unintentionally gives miners too much power to veto development upgrades.\n\nThe concern is, if this issue is never rectified on bitcoin, future litecoin upgrades along the lines of SegWit might have trouble getting support as its network and value grows.\n\nWith so much still uncertain, the takeaway might be that it’s still too early to know how (or whether) litecoin will play a role in bringing these projects to life as a get-around to bitcoin\'s long-standing scaling quagmire.\n\nStill, Blockstream\'s Maxwell expressed general optimism about litecoin\'s upcoming SegWit activation, saying at a recent meetup:\n\n""You are going to have bitcoin developers working on litecoin eventually, because nobody really doing protocol development in bitcoin wants to do script enhancement without SegWit because it makes it so much easier.""\n\nColored eggs image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Your life is destined for the blockchain Bitcoin Beyond bitcoin. Your life is destined for the blockchain\n\nThe blockchain ecosystem is weirdly wonderful. Filled to the brim with idealists who want to change the world and get very rich, quick while, ideally, paying no taxes in the process. The promise of bitcoin was a new global financial system free from the influence of any state. Now, holding more than $21 billion in value, everyone from Silicon Valley VCs to the Chinese middle-class have a stake. But still, nowhere is it widely used as a legal currency of note. Japan may change this, but its wealth distribution almost identically mirrors the 99 per cent to 1 per cent gross imbalance it was promised to replace.\n\n\n\nIn fact, far from freeing people from the oppression of the state, blockchains perversely promise the perfect tool for a fully auditable, tax compliant, cashless society. Similarly, the belief it is an anonymous digital cash has quickly vanished and we are now seeing a large number of analytics companies, set-up specifically to work with law enforcement agencies, to police this new parallel financial system.\n\nRead next For the future of insurance, we need to look to China For the future of insurance, we need to look to China\n\nThe few VCs brave enough to have invested early have seen their startups fail to make returns unless they have accumulated bitcoin in some way. Its most powerful innovation has, instead, been the creation of digital scarcity, and its importance cannot be underestimated. Today this has been applied solely as a digital gold in turbulent economic times and this fundamental misunderstanding has tripped up some of the world’s smartest VCs.\n\n""Far from freeing people from the oppression of the state, blockchains perversely promise the perfect tool for a fully auditable, tax compliant, cashless society""\n\nMost blockchain startups are still a long way from the mainstream; only really serving a niche of early crypto-enthusiasts or other blockchain startups that require a new decentralised stack to deliver their own promise. Most have settled to build enterprise consultancies for B2B clients rather than disrupting markets. Their energies are focused on fixing legacy systems and finding margin gains for incumbents for the financial services companies many hoped would be disintermediated forever.\n\n\n\nThe few exits that have happened, such as ChangeTip to AirBnB, or Mediachain to Spotify, have been acquihires selling out early because they realised they had built a feature set, not a high-growth standalone business.

The fact Bitfury, one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners has built a private ledger which simply hashes its output on the Bitcoin blockchain shows the limitations. The same rings true for Ethereum. Worse still, these limitations look likely to drive the Bitcoin community to breaking point, otherwise known as a hard fork, as has already happened in Ethereum. These public ledgers with their model of crypto-equity have some of the most powerful network effects we have ever seen, but they also have a fractious fragile quality.\n\nRead next In an uncertain world, security lies in your own fingerprints In an uncertain world, security lies in your own fingerprints\n\nFor the first time, there is a way for open-source communities to self-finance through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Before this has even started, some VCs have decided to experiment with hedge fund-like models to trade tokens as a commodity only they are able to do so, in a dark pool by design. Given the comparatively small market size, as a large holder, it will be much easier to move the price up or down. We are told we just need to trust they won’t.\n\nThe idea of liquidity is incredibly appealing to speculators but not so great for the startups who are naively choosing to ‘go public’ before they have anything close to product-market fit. Those, who now, rather than being backed by supportive angels, have thousands of day traders who can and will short them at the first sign of trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are told Web 3.0 brings an era of ‘fat protocols’. In Web 2.0,we saw centralised applications suck up most of the value in the form of companies like Facebook, Uber and AirBnB. But this time the hope is the majority of value resides in the democratically owned protocol layer. The only way you can profit from this is by holding their underlying tokens. Many are giddy with the idea we will do away with rent seeking, centralised, monopolies, but when people begin to apply AI to these new open datasets they can make their smart contracts smarter than yours. I believe this could lead to a winner takes all dominance seen in Web 2.0 companies like Google.\n\n""Worse still, these limitations look likely to drive the Bitcoin community to breaking point, otherwise known as a hard fork, as has already happened in Ethereum""\n\nAt my fund, after four years in the space and having spoken with more than 1,200 blockchain startups, we have come to the conclusion most of this open-source infrastructure is best thought of as purely foundational. Instead, it\'s the combinations of blockchain and AI that are most interesting commercially because they offer moats.\n\nRead next 20 things we learned at WIRED Money 2017 20 things we learned at WIRED Money 2017\n\nMost interestingly for me, the blockchain enables other tech trends like the Internet of Things, 3D printing and mixed reality to scale, and do so securely. We call this blockchain +. Think of 3D printing: today, no creator wants their digital asset anywhere near the internet, CAD files are passed around on USBs to avoid their being copied and then printed innumerable times. To physically transport the design file totally defeats the point of being able to produce at the edge. Yes, you can share, but doing this on a centralised system has many vulnerabilities and who owns it?\n\nHow AI is transforming the future of fintech Business How AI is transforming the future of fintech\n\nBlockchain-like technology can secure the CAD file to be as unique as a bitcoin and protect its ownership on a sharded and cryptographically secure ledger. Printers become wallets with read-only access to the file, on a per-print basis, using an open-source software install. All transactions are fully auditable with proceeds from royalties automatically distributed, instantly via smart contracts, to any number of participants including the tax man. To involve a network of so many stakeholders requiring automated and secure payments it must be decentralised. All of a sudden you have secure 3D printing.\n\nThis story plays out in similar ways across IoT, AI, mixed reality and autonomous robotics. Where it gets really interesting is if they all leverage this new web infrastructure, it could provide a common operating system whereby they begin to converge, combine and accelerate one another. We call this ‘convergence’.\n\n\n\nSo if I have sounded negative, I’m not. I’m now more bullish than ever. Blockchain-like technology brings new and powerful characteristics to Web 3.0. It enables greater levels of decentralisation, automation and governance; it fixes the digital scarcity Web 2.0 broke. But today blockchain is riddled with contradictions and misunderstandings. Most of its problems are very fixable, if you want to fix them, and this just requires pragmatism. Sadly, this is what has been, at least until now, in short supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterested in learning more about the future of finance?

Even before the price of Bitcoin hit new record highs in recent weeks, a landmark study out of the University of Cambridge found that cryptocurrencies are actively used by three times as many people compared to other estimates.\n\nThe Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study released this month is based on data collected between September 2016 and January 2017.

In it, the government pledged to address the ‘double taxation’ of digital currencies.\n\n‘[We] will take action to prevent the double taxation of digital currencies – we won’t be taxing digital currencies,” stated Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison at the time, in no uncertain terms.\n\nAustralian consumers are taxed twice during a transaction related to digital currencies, once for the GST (goods and services tax) on the product and again for the GST levied on the digital currency used for the payment.\n\n“If you pay $4 in bitcoin for a coffee, you will pay 40c GST for the coffee, and 40c again for the bitcoin you used to pay for the coffee,” explained Daniel Alexiuc, CEO of Australian bitcoin startup Living Room of Satoshi, speaking to CCN at the time.\n\nThis is due to the Australian Tax Office deeming bitcoin as an ‘intangible property’, treating its transactions as barter transactions, rather than acknowledging the cryptocurrency as money or a foreign currency.\n\nCome May 2016, the Government followed up on its pledge to put an end to the GST treatment of digital currencies. “This change will ensure that consumers are no longer ‘double taxed’ when using digital currencies to buy goods and services already subjected to GST,’ the government stated in its 2016-17 Budget summary.\n\nA year later, those legislative changes to put an end to the double taxation of bitcoin purchases are yet to occur, leaving Australia’s bitcoin and FinTech industry frustrated.\n\n“[I]t could be put through Parliament very quickly.

To combat this phenomenon, Polish blockchain startup Userfeeds plans to tokenize news discovery to incentivize users to rank high-quality news content in order to filter out fake news from real news.\n\n\n\nWarsaw-based Userfeeds is developing a new solution that uses “the principles and methods of Bitcoin and Ethereum to create transparent and publicly auditable content networks and ranking algorithms that use digital tokens as ranking signals,” according to a statement on the company’s blog.\n\nThe Userfeeds team was co-founded by CEO Maciej Olpinski, who previously worked for Google and YouTube, and CTO Greg Kapkowski, an experienced software engineer. They believe that the current system of news discovery and content ranking which involves links, likes and upvotes is broken as it can easily be manipulated by third parties. This enables “fake news” to rank high on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as on Google’s news search.\n\nUserfeeds’ first product, Userfeeds Engine, is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It will enable developers, publishers and users to run custom content rankings to produce search results, recommendation systems, news feeds, listicles and sponsored links. Its goal is to create new business model opportunities for content publishers and developers beyond advertising and subscriptions.\n\nThe new platform aims to build an incentive-based system that allows digital content such as news articles, blog posts and YouTube videos, for example, to be backed by tokens. These tokens can then be exchanged by users, which produces a time-stamped transaction that can be publicly viewed as a link between the content curator and the content they are backing. This process enables content curators to demonstrate confidence in the content they are posting and makes them accountable.\n\nUserfeeds expects the platform’s reputation tokens to gain value within their specific categories or applications. Furthermore, as is the case for most blockchain-based tokens, they will also be tradable for other currencies to create a mechanism by which content curators can generate revenue for sharing valuable content from trustworthy sources.\n\nTo build its new solution, the startup has managed to raise $800,000 in seed funding from BlueYard Capital, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and Data Ventures’ Piotr Smolen according to a TechCrunch report.\n\nNow that the company’s seed funding round has been completed, Olpinski told Bitcoin Magazine that it plans “to use this funding to deliver the Userfeeds Engine, the developer focused platform and APIs for 'tokenized' content rankings. In addition to that, we’ll build in-house applications that showcase how the Engine can be used to deliver end-user products.”\n\nUserfeeds provides an example of how blockchain technology can be applied to solve modern day problems. By incentivizing content curators to share only well-sourced quality content, we could soon receive more trustworthy and truthful news in social media feeds.""]"

As it did throughout the past month, the Japanese exchange market led the recent price surge, processing trades at an average Bitcoin price of $1,800.\n\nJapan, Korea growing importance\n\nThe Japanese Bitcoin exchange market currently accounts for 41.8 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market share, as the largest Bitcoin exchange market in the world.\n\nThe South Korean market falls behind the US, with around eight percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market share. The two markets, Japan and South Korea, demonstrate 50 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market.\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin price can be attributed to the explosive growth of the two above mentioned markets. Coincidentally, the two markets have always demonstrated higher demand from investors and traders toward Bitcoin, often listing Bitcoin price that is significantly higher than that of other markets such as the US and China in particular.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is being traded in Japan at around $1,800. Considering that the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market accounts for nearly half of all Bitcoin trades, it can be said that the high Bitcoin price of the Japanese market is being reflected in the global average Bitcoin price.\n\nThe South Korean exchange is also facilitating Bitcoin trades at an incredibly high premium of $1,970, demonstrating a staggering 15 percent premium over the US market, the second largest Bitcoin exchange market in the world, and around nine percent over the Japanese market.\n\n\u200b\n\nBitcoin undervalued?\n\nA strong case can be made in regard to the under-valuation of Bitcoin price. The demand for Bitcoin in the regulated Chinese Bitcoin exchange market has substantially decreased over the past few months due to the government and the People’s Bank of China’s implementation of strict and impractical Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies.\n\nLocal news sources including cnLedger revealed that to utilize Chinese Bitcoin exchanges such as Huobi and OKCoin, users need to submit bank documents, conduct a face-to-face interview and other necessary documents for proof of identity.\n\nRather than going through such difficult processes to trade Bitcoin, the Chinese market has moved on to over-the-counter (OTC) markets such as LocalBitcoins, which the Chinese government tried to avoid all along. Currently, Bitcoin is being traded in the Chinese market for as little as $1,350 on regulated exchanges, a price that is nearly 30 percent lower than that of the Japanese market.\n\nWill Bitcoin price reach $4,000 soon?\n\nHigh-profile and institutional investors including Daniel Masters, director at Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), believe that Bitcoin price can enter the $4,000 region relatively soon, within 8 to 14 months. In an interview with CNBC, Masters stated:\n\n""That example of a successful soft fork in litecoin has made people start to think that we could get a successful SegWit implementation in bitcoin and that could increase capacity and move us to the next level. In the 8- to 14-month horizon, my forecast would be around $4,000.”\n\nThe explosive growth of the Japanese and South Korean Bitcoin exchange markets have acted as the two major driving factors of Bitcoin price as of late. However, it is undeniable that the optimism around Segregated Witness (SegWit) is contributing to the upward trend of Bitcoin. Investors like Masters believe that once a scaling solution such as SegWit is activated on Bitcoin, the price will surge.', ""Michael Dunworth, the CEO of Wyre, a fintech startup which focuses on processing global bank transfers, recently stated that financial advisors must consider Bitcoin as an asset class.\n\nAs described by Bitcoin developer Andrew DeSantis,\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized timestamp and messaging protocol that when implemented and stable results in a value storage system.”\n\nThus, depending on the usage, Bitcoin can be used as digital gold, settlement network and digital cash or currency.\n\nSafe haven asset\n\nIn China and other countries, institutional investors and high profile traders utilize Bitcoin as a safe haven asset and wealth management product (WMP). In terms of economic uncertainty and currency curbs, investors refer to Bitcoin to protect their wealth and assets. Such use case of Bitcoin was also emphasized by early Facebook investor and Golden State Warriors NBA team owner Chamath Palihapitiya when he stated:\n\n“Reiterating my belief about Bitcoin. It's the ultimate insurance policy against autocracy, currency curbs and other forms of value destruction.”\n\nDunworth, who recently secured a $5.8 mln Series A funding round led by Amphora Capital for Wyre, expressed his optimism toward Bitcoin urging financial advisors to consider the abovementioned qualities of Bitcoin and categorize Bitcoin as an asset class.\n\nMost importantly, Bitcoin is one of the few currencies or assets that are completely and solely dependent on the market, while most of the assets in the public market are directly affected by the performance of reserve currencies and the global economy.\n\nVolatility\n\nAt the netwealth group study tour, a four-day fintech program attended by Australia-based financial advisers with a combined Funds Under Administration (FUA) of $14 bln, Dunworth stated:\n\n“There's a huge amount of technological growth that is yet to happen, with a very wide impact internationally. The scope for opportunity is huge...if someone told you back in 1991 that you could invest in this thing called 'the Internet', you would do it knowing what we all know now about it. We are at that same [early] stage with Bitcoin.”\n\nDunworth reaffirmed that while Bitcoin’s short-term volatility rate remains high, it still makes an excellent long-term investment for a wide range of clients and investors.\n\n“A lot of people say that Bitcoin is very volatile. It is in the short term but if I were doing fund management for my client, I see it as a very good long-term investment,” noted Dunworth.\n\nThe volatility rate of Bitcoin is a measurement of growth which doesn’t and can’t accurately depict the value of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has a fixed cap of supply established at 21 million. As long as the demand is sustained or continues to increase, Bitcoin price will also maintain an upward trend.\n\nAlthough many experts in the past did mention that the high volatility rate of Bitcoin is a negative component as a digital currency and technologically, Bitcoin is still in the early phase of development.\n\nAs time passes, the volatility rate of Bitcoin will decrease as scaling solutions are implemented and the network is optimized."", '', 'Despite bitcoin\'s recent all-time highs, the digital asset could see bigger price gains if its scaling debate ultimately resolves, at least according to one major hedge fund centered on the technology.\n\nIn an email to investors this week, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), a Jersey-based investment vehicle that buys and sells bitcoin on behalf of investors, touched on ongoing developments in the digital currency markets, putting a special emphasis on developments in litecoin and how they relate to the larger bitcoin market.\n\nIn the note, the firm pointed to the acceptance of Segregated Witness – a technical upgrade originally developed for bitcoin – by the litecoin community as one major factor behind that market\'s upward movement. The integration of SegWit on litecoin is a notable given the reticence by bitcoin miners to accept the upgrade on technical and political grounds.\n\nYet, should this kind of implementation be repeated for bitcoin, GABI argued, markets could have a similar reaction.\n\nThe firm wrote:\n\n""Even though one can find no evidence whatsoever that there were scaling pressures in litecoin, this upgrade went ahead and if it is even slightly predictive of a path that can be taken in bitcoin, one that will at least show progress if not resolution, the price impact could be significant. A double up wouldn\'t be shocking.""\n\nThe hedge fund also highlighted the broad increases observed across most cryptocurrency markets of late, which have increasingly diversified away from bitcoin.\n\nAs reported last week, markets outside of bitcoin have seen major trade activity in recent days, pushing the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies above $50bn for the first time ever. Of that, bitcoin accounts for roughly $27bn, according to available data.\n\n""This is a stunning progression and speaks to the thesis we\'ve held for some time that the cryptocurrency landscape would become increasingly diverse in response to user demand,"" GABI said.\n\nTrader image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Dr Gideon Greenspan is the founder and CEO of Coin Sciences, the company behind the MultiChain platform for private blockchains.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Greenspan attacks the idea that true immutability can be achieved in blockchain systems, arguing a more relative definition of this feature better encapsulates what\'s the technology can achieve.\n\n""The highest good, than which there is no higher, is the blockchain, and consequently it is immutably good, hence truly eternal and truly immortal.""\n\n— Saint Augustine, De natura boni, i, 405 C.E. (with minor edits)\n\nIf you ask someone well-informed about the characteristics of blockchains, the word \'immutable\' will invariably appear in the response.\n\nIn plain English, this word is used to denote something which can never be modified or changed. In a blockchain, it refers to the global log of transactions, which is created by a consensus between the chain\'s participants. The basic notion is this: once a blockchain transaction has received a sufficient level of validation, some cryptography ensures that it can never be replaced or reversed.\n\nThis marks blockchains as different from regular files or databases, in which information can be edited and deleted at will. Or so the theory goes.\n\nIn the raucous arena of blockchain debate, immutability has become a quasi-religious doctrine – a core belief that must not be shaken or questioned. And just like the doctrines in mainstream religions, members of opposing camps use immutability as a weapon of derision and ridicule.\n\nThe past year has witnessed two prominent examples:\n\nFor one, cryptocurrency advocates claim that immutability can only be achieved through decentralized economic mechanisms such as proof-of-work. From this perspective, private blockchains are laughable because they depend on the collective good behavior of a known group of validators, who clearly cannot be trusted.\n\nScorn has also been directed at the idea of an editable (or mutable) blockchain, in which retroactive modifications can be made to the transaction history under certain conditions. Mockers posed the question: ""What could possibly be the point of a blockchain if its contents can easily be changed?""\n\nFor those of us on the sidelines, it’s fun to watch the mudslinging. Not least because both of these criticisms are plain wrong. Both stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of immutability in blockchains (and indeed any computer system).\n\nFor those short on time, here’s the bottom line:\n\nIn blockchains, there is no such thing as perfect immutability. The real question is: What are the conditions under which a particular blockchain can and cannot be changed? And do those conditions match the problem we\'re trying to solve?\n\nTo put it another way, a blockchain\'s transactions are not written into the mind of God (with apologies to Augustine above). Instead, the chain\'s behavior depends on a network of corporeal computer systems, which will always be vulnerable to destruction or corruption. But, before we get into the details of how, let’s proceed by recapping some basics of blockchains themselves.\n\nBlockchains in brief\n\nA blockchain runs on a set of nodes, each of which may be under the control of a separate company, individual or organization. These nodes connect to each other in a dense peer-to-peer network, so that no one node acts as a central point of control or failure.\n\nEach node can generate and digitally sign transactions which represent operations in some kind of ledger or database, and these transactions rapidly propagate to other nodes across the network in a gossip-like way.\n\nEach node independently verifies every new incoming transaction for validity, in terms of: (a) its compliance with the blockchain\'s rules, (b) its digital signature and (c) any conflicts with previously seen transactions. If a transaction passes these tests, it enters that node\'s local list of provisional unconfirmed transactions (the \'memory pool\'), and will be forwarded on to its peers.\n\nTransactions that fail are rejected outright, while others whose evaluation depends on unseen transactions are placed in a temporary holding area (the \'orphan pool\').\n\nAt periodic intervals, a new block is generated by one of the \'validator\' nodes on the network, containing a set of as-yet unconfirmed transactions. Every block has a unique 32-byte identifier called a \'hash\', which is determined entirely by the block\'s contents. Each block also includes a timestamp and a link to a previous block via its hash, creating a literal \'blockchain\' going back to the very beginning.\n\nJust like transactions, blocks propagate across the network in a peer-to-peer fashion and are independently verified by each node. To be accepted by a node, a block must contain a set of valid transactions which do not conflict with each other or with those in the previous blocks linked. If a block passes this and other tests, it is added to that node’s local copy of the blockchain, and the transactions within are \'confirmed\'. Any transactions in the node’s memory pool or orphan pool which conflict with those in the new block are immediately discarded.\n\nEvery chain employs some sort of strategy to ensure that blocks are generated by a plurality of its participants. This ensures that no individual or small group of nodes can seize control of the blockchain’s contents.\n\nMost public blockchains like bitcoin use \'proof-of-work\' which allows blocks to be created by anyone on the internet who can solve a pointless and fiendishly difficult mathematical puzzle. By contrast, in private blockchains, blocks tend to be signed by one or more permitted validators, using an appropriate scheme to prevent minority control. (Our product MultiChain uses a technique called \'mining diversity\' which requires a minimum proportion of the permitted validators to participate in order to create a valid chain.)\n\nDepending on the consensus mechanism used, two different validator nodes might simultaneously generate conflicting blocks, both of which point to the same previous one. When such a \'fork\' happens, different nodes in the network will see different blocks first, leading them to have different opinions about the chain\'s recent history.\n\nThese forks are automatically resolved by the blockchain software, with consensus regained once a new block arrives on one of the branches. Nodes that were on the shorter branch automatically rewind their last block and replay the two blocks on the longer one. If we\'re really unlucky and both branches are extended simultaneously, the conflict will be resolved after the third block on one branch, or the one after that, and so on. In practice, the probability of a fork persisting drops exponentially as its length increases. In private chains with a limited set of validators, the likelihood can be reduced to zero after a small number of blocks.\n\nNonetheless, it\'s important to remember that each node is running on a computer system owned and controlled by a particular person or organization, so the blockchain cannot force it to do anything. The purpose of the chain is to help honest nodes to stay in sync, but if enough of its participants choose to change the rules, no earthly power can stop them.\n\nThat’s why we need to stop asking whether a particular blockchain is truly and absolutely immutable, because the answer will always be no. Instead, we should consider the conditions under which a particular blockchain can be modified, and then check if we\'re comfortable with those conditions for the use case we have in mind.\n\nMutability in public chains\n\nLet’s return to the two examples cited in the introduction, in which the doctrine of immutability has been used as a basis for ridicule.\n\nWe’ll begin with the claim that the consensual validation procedures used in permissioned blockchains cannot bring about the \'true immutability\' promised by public chains.\n\nThis criticism is most easily addressed by pointing to the vulnerability of public blockchains themselves. Take, for example, the ethereum blockchain, which suffered a devastating exploit in June 2016. Someone found a coding loophole in a smart contract called The DAO, in which almost $250m had been invested, and began draining its funds at speed. While this clearly violated the intentions of the contract\'s creators and investors, its terms and conditions relied on the mantra that \'code is law\'. Law or not, less than a month later, the ethereum software was updated to prevent the hacker from withdrawing the cryptocurrency \'earned\'.\n\nOf course, this update could not be enforced, since every ethereum user controls their own computer. Nonetheless, it was publicly supported by Vitalik Buterin, ethereum\'s creator, as well as many other community leaders. As a result, most users complied, and the blockchain with the new rules kept the name \'ethereum\'.\n\nA minority disagreed with the change and continued the blockchain according to its original rules, earning the title \'ethereum classic\'. A more accurate choice of names might be \'ethereum compromised\' and \'ethereum the pure\'. Either way, democracy is democracy, and (the pragmatic and popular) \'ethereum\' is now worth over 10x (the idealistic but sidelined) \'ethereum classic\'.\n\nNow, let\'s consider a less benevolent way in which public blockchain immutability can be undermined. Recall that block creation or \'mining\' in bitcoin and ethereum uses a proof-of-work scheme, in which a mathematical problem must be solved in order to generate a block and claim its reward. The value of this reward inevitably turns mining into an arms race, with miners competing to solve the problems faster. To compensate, the network periodically adjusts the difficulty to maintain a constant rate of block creation, once every 10 minutes in bitcoin or 15 seconds in ethereum.\n\nIn the last five years, bitcoin’s difficulty has increased by a factor of 350,000 times. Today, the vast majority of bitcoin mining takes place on expensive specialized hardware, in locations where the weather is cold and electricity is cheap.\n\nFor example, $1,089 will buy you an Antminer S9, which mines blocks 10,000 times faster than any desktop computer and burns 10 times more electricity. This is all a long way from the democratic ideals with which bitcoin was created, even if it does make the blockchain extremely secure.\n\nWell, kind of secure. If someone wanted to undermine the immutability of the bitcoin blockchain, here’s how they would do it. First, they would install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together, creating a so-called \'51% attack\'. Second, instead of openly participating in the mining process, they would mine their own \'secret branch\', containing whichever transactions they approve and censoring the rest. Finally, when the desired amount of time had passed, they would anonymously broadcast their secret branch to the network.\n\nSince the attacker has more mining power than the rest of the network, their branch will contain more proof-of-work than the public one. Every bitcoin node will therefore switch over, since the rules of bitcoin state that the more difficult branch wins. Any previously confirmed transactions not in the secret branch will be reversed, and the bitcoin they spent could be sent elsewhere.\n\nBy now, most bitcoin believers will be laughing, because I wrote ""install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together"" as if this is trivial to achieve. And they have a point, because of course it\'s not easy, otherwise lots of people would already have done it. You need a lot of mining equipment, and a lot of electricity to power it, both of which cost a ton of money. But here\'s the inconvenient fact that most bitcoiners brush over: for the government of any mid-size country, the money required is still small change.\n\nLet\'s estimate the cost of a 51% attack which reverses a year of bitcoin transactions. At the current bitcoin price of $1,500 and reward of 15 bitcoins (including transaction fees) per 10-minute block, miners earn around $1.2bn per year ($1500 × 15 × 6 × 24 × 365). Assuming (reasonably) that they are not losing money overall, or at least not losing much, this means that total miner expenses must also be in the same range. (I’m simplifying here by amortizing the one-time cost of purchasing mining equipment, but $400m will buy you enough Antminer 9s to match the current bitcoin network’s mining capacity, so we\'re in the right ball park.)\n\nNow, think about the reports that bitcoin is being used by Chinese citizens to circumvent their country’s capital controls. And consider further that the Chinese government’s tax revenues are approximately $3tn per year. Would a non-democratic country\'s government spend 0.04% of its budget to shut down a popular method for illegally taking money out of that country?\n\nI wouldn’t claim that the answer is necessarily yes. But if you think the answer is definitely no, you\'re being more than a little naive. Especially considering that China reportedly employs 2 million people to police internet content, which totals $10bn/year if we assume a low wage of $5,000. That puts the $1.2bn cost of reversing a year of bitcoin transactions in perspective.\n\nEven this analysis understates the problem, because the Chinese government could undermine the bitcoin network much more easily and cheaply. It appears that the majority of bitcoin mining takes place in China, due to low-cost hydroelectric power and other factors. Given a few tanks and platoons, China’s army could physically seize these bitcoin mining operations, and repurpose them to censor or reverse transactions. While the wider bitcoin world would undoubtedly notice, there\'s nothing it could do without fundamentally altering the governance structure (and therefore nature) of bitcoin itself. What was that about censorship free money?\n\nNone of this should be construed as a criticism of bitcoin\'s design, or a prediction that a network catastrophe will actually happen. The bitcoin blockchain is a remarkable piece of engineering, perhaps even perfect for the purpose its creator(s) had in mind. And if I had to put money on it, I would bet that China and other governments probably won\'t attack bitcoin in this way, because it\'s not in their ultimate interest to do so. More likely, they’ll focus their wrath on its more untraceable cousins like dash, zcash and monero.\n\nNonetheless, the mere possibility of this form of interference puts the cryptocurrency immutability doctrine in its place. The bitcoin blockchain and its ilk are not immutable in any perfect or absolute sense. Rather, they are immutable so long as nobody big enough and rich enough decides to destroy them. Still, by relying on the economic cost of subverting the network, cryptocurrency immutability satisfies the specific needs of people who don’t want to trust governments, companies and banks.\n\nIt may not be perfect, but it’s the best they can do.\n\nRewriteable private chains\n\nNow let’s move on to private blockchains, designed for the needs of governments and large companies.\n\nWe can begin by noting that, from the perspective of these organizations, immutability based on proof-of-work is a commercial, legal and regulatory non-starter, because it allows any (sufficiently rich) actor to anonymously attack the network. For institutions, immutability can only be grounded in the good behavior of other similar institutions, with whom they can sign a contract and sue if need be.\n\nAs a bonus, private blockchains are far less costly to run, since blocks only need a simple digital signature from the nodes that approve them. So long as a majority of validator nodes are following the rules, the end result is stronger and cheaper immutability than any public cryptocurrency can offer.\n\nOf course, immutability is still easy to undermine if all the participants in a chain decide to do so together. Let\'s imagine a private blockchain used by six hospitals to aggregate data on infections. A program in one hospital writes a large and erroneous data set to the chain, which is a source of inconvenience for the other participants. A few phone calls later, the IT departments of all the hospitals agree to \'rewind\' their nodes back one hour, delete the problematic data, and then allow the chain to continue as if nothing happened.\n\nIf all the hospitals agree to do this, who\'s going to stop them? Indeed, apart from the staff involved, who will even know that it happened? (It should be noted that some consensus algorithms like PBFT don\'t provide an official mechanism for rollbacks, but this doesn\'t help with governance since nodes are still free to bypass the rules.)\n\nNow, consider a case where most of a private blockchain\'s participants agree to rewind and remove some transaction, but a few withhold their consent. Since every organization’s node is under its ultimate control, nobody can force the minority to join the consensus. However, by sticking to their principles, these users will find themselves on a fork being ignored by everyone else.\n\nLike the virtuous proponents of ethereum classic, their place in heaven may well be assured. But back here on earth, they will be excluded from the consensus process for which the chain was deployed, and might as well give up completely. The only practical application of transactions outside the consensus is to serve as evidence in a court of law.\n\nWith this in mind, let\'s talk about the second case in which the doctrine of blockchain immutability has been used to ridicule ideas.\n\nHere, we\'re referring to Accenture’s idea of using a chameleon hash to enable a block buried deep in a chain to be easily replaced. The primary motivation, as described by David Treat, is to allow an old problematic transaction to be quickly and efficiently removed. Under the scheme, if a block substitution does occur, a \'scar\' is left behind which all participants can see. (It should be noted that any later transactions that depend on the deleted one would need to be removed as well.)\n\nIt\'s hard to overstate how many people attacked this idea when it was announced. Twitter and LinkedIn were aghast and aflutter. And I\'m not just talking about the crypto crowd, which takes sporting pleasure in mocking anything related to enterprise blockchains. The idea was broadly slammed by private blockchain advocates as well.\n\nAnd yet, under the right conditions, the idea of allowing blockchains to be modified retroactively via chameleon hashes can make perfect sense. To understand why, we begin with a simple question: in this type of blockchain, who would actually have the power to replace old blocks? Clearly, it can\'t be any unidentified network participant, because that would render the chain ungovernable.\n\nThe answer is that a chameleon hash can only be used by those who hold its secret key. The key is required to enable a new version of a block, with different transactions, to be given the same chameleon hash as before. Of course, we probably don’t want centralized control in a blockchain, so we can make the scheme stronger by having multiple chameleon hashes per block, each of whose key is held by a different party. Or we might use secret sharing techniques to divide a single chameleon hash key between multiple parties. Either way, the chain can be configured so that a retroactive block substitution can only occur if a majority of key holders approve it. Is this starting to sound familiar?\n\nAllow me to render the parallel more explicit. Let\'s say that we share control over chameleon hashes between those same validating nodes which are responsible for block creation. This means that an old block can only be replaced if a majority of validating nodes agree to do so. And yet, as we discussed earlier, any blockchain can already be retroactively modified by a majority of validating nodes, via the rewind and replay mechanism. So in terms of governance, chameleon hashes subject to a validator majority make no difference at all.\n\nIf so, why bother with them? The answer is: performance optimization, because chameleon hashes allow old blocks to be substituted in a chain far more efficiently than before. Imagine that we need to remove a transaction from the start of a blockchain that has been running for five years. Perhaps this is due to the European Union\'s right to be forgotten legislation, which allows individuals to have their personal data removed from companies’ records. Nodes can\'t just wipe the offending transaction from their disks, because that would change the corresponding block’s hash and break a link in the chain.\n\nThe next time the blockchain was scanned or shared, everything would fall apart.\n\nTo solve this problem without chameleon hashes, nodes would have to rewrite the early block without the problematic transaction, calculate the block\'s new hash, then change the hash embedded in the next block to match. But this would also affect the next block\'s own hash, which must be recalculated and updated in the subsequent block, and so on all the way along the chain.\n\nWhile this mechanism is possible in principle, it could take hours or days to complete in a blockchain with millions of blocks and transactions. Even worse, while engaged in this process, a node may be incapable of processing new incoming network activity.\n\nSo chameleon hashes provide a far more computationally efficient way to achieve the same goal. If you imagine a bad transaction as a rock buried many miles underground, chameleon hashes can teleport the rock to the surface, instead of making us dig all the way down, retrieve the rock and fill in the hole.\n\nImmutability is nuanced\n\nBy reviewing the risks of proof-of-work blockchains and the technical value of chameleon hashes, I hope to have convinced you that blockchain immutability is far more nuanced than a yes or no question.\n\nTo quote Simon Taylor quoting Ian Grigg, the question must always be: ""Who are you and what do you want to achieve?""\n\nFor cryptocurrency believers who want to avoid government-issued money and the traditional banking system, it makes perfect sense to believe in a public proof-of-work blockchain, whose immutability rests on economics rather than trusted parties. Even if they must live with the possibility of a large government (or other wealthy actor) bringing down the network, they can take solace in the fact that this would be a painful and expensive operation. And no doubt they hope that cryptocurrencies will only get more secure, as their value and mining capacity continues to grow.\n\nOn the other hand, for enterprises and other institutions that want to safely share a database across organizational boundaries, proof-of-work immutability makes no sense at all. Not only is it astoundingly expensive, but it allows any sufficiently motivated participant to anonymously seize control of the chain and censor or reverse transactions. What these users need is immutability grounded in the good behavior of a majority of identified validator nodes, backed by contracts and law.\n\nFinally, for most permissioned blockchain use cases, we probably don’t want validator nodes to be able to easily and cheaply substitute old blocks in the chain. As Dave Birch said at the time, ""The way to correct a wrong debit is with a correct credit"", rather than pretending that the debit never took place.\n\nNonetheless, for those cases where we do need the extra flexibility, chameleon hashes help make blockchains a practical choice.\n\nThis article was originally published on the MultiChain blog and has been reposted here with the author\'s permission.

The numbers are telling. Living Room of Satoshi, the company enabling bill payments in the country with bitcoin, launched in April 2014. By August that year, Australian residents had paid upwards of $150,000 toward bills with the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency.\n\n“Bitcoin usage in Australia is growing rapidly, and our customers tell us they are looking for more ways to spent their bitcoin,” stated co-founder and chief executive Daniel Alexiuc at the time.\n\nToward the end of 2015, the company struck a significant milestone, processing over $1 million of bitcoin payments toward bills.\n\nNow, the bitcoin company, which was awarded the ‘Best State Startup’ for Queensland and the ‘Best New Startup in Australia’ in 2015, has reached $5 million in processing bills paid with bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider AU, Daniel Alexiuc underlined the merits of using bitcoin as a currency:\n\nAs the first truly international, decentralized and peer to peer currency, Bitcoin is perfectly suited to bill payments in Australia. It also enables new possibilities, like parents in foreign countries being able to easily support their children studying in Australia by paying some of their bills.\n\nThe Brisbane-based bitcoin company allows Australian users to settle everyday bills for utilities, credit card payments, gas, water, telecom, school fees, home or property rent and even tax payments. Notably, customers are charged no fees for bills while using the service.\n\nSpeaking to CCN in an earlier interview, Alexiuc revealed:\n\nWe make a profit by selling bitcoin on multiple international exchanges, being able to achieve a better price than is possible locally in Australia.\n\nLiving Room of Satoshi enables anyone to make payments toward BPAY-enabled bills. Owned by the so-called ‘Big Four’ Australian banks, BPAY is an electronic bill-payment system that enables users to make bill payments for a number of services. Every major business in Australia is BPAY-enabled, as are the federal and state governments.\n\nRecent figures over three months reveal a majority of bills paid by Australians using bitcoin are toward credit card payments. Telecommunications (phone/internet) come next, followed by gas and electricity, property or rent payments, online shopping, water bills, tax payments, loans, council fee payments and fines.\n\nParents are turning to bitcoin-based bill payments with school fees figuring as the highest average bill amount.\n\nCommonly known as a bitcoin startup, the company also allows users to pay in other cryptocurrencies. While bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency of choice, users have also made payments with Dash, Ether, Litecoin and Monero.\n\nThe Brisbane bitcoin company has come a long way, particularly after shuttering its operations within its first 6 months in 2014, due to Australian Government’s bitcoin ‘double-tax’ ruling. Two months later, the company resumed operations. To this day, Australians continue to be taxed twice for bitcoin-related purchases. For its part, the Australian government has committed to put an end to the double taxation.\n\nCharts via LivingRoomofSatoshi.

From a user perspective, unconfirmed transactions are on the rise due to a clogged and busy network. Without any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, this will not improve, especially if bitcoin continues to push higher on heavy demand.\n\n\n\nThe number of unconfirmed transactions hit an ATH of 140,000 on May 5. Although this isn’t the best metric to evaluate health of the network because large numbers of spam transactions can inflate this number, it does give a user an indication of how quickly or slowly they will receive their bitcoin. To determine the optimal fee that will give your transaction a chance to be processed in a reasonable time, it’s a good idea to use a wallet that will calculate this for you. Alternatively, you can reference a website. At the current rate, microtransactions are not exactly feasible due to high transaction costs.\n\nHere are some tips for what to do if your transaction gets stuck.\n\nPrices and premiums between the various USD exchanges have been fluctuating wildly, with GDAX and Bitfinex often leading in price.\n\nNo amendments have been made to the COIN ETF since the SEC’s review of rejection, but this will be something to keep a close eye on since it could spark a media frenzy and drive price higher. GBTC, an OTC market that uses a BTC derivative available to the public, hit a new ATH of $2,000 per bitcoin yesterday, or a $200+ premium from the current spot price. We can expect this premium to shrink to $0 if the COIN ETF gets approved, as those same investors would likely move toward that market.\n\nWith prices this high, getting close to parabolic movement, it’s hard to estimate targets or true resistance in price discovery mode. Even a price target of $4,000 isn’t exactly impossible. The inverted head and shoulders that confirmed a few weeks ago hit its measured target of $1,575.\n\nA slightly modified pitchfork yields targets around $1,800–2,000, with price recently breaking the resistance diagonal rather cleanly.\n\nHeikin-Ashi candlesticks on the daily timeframe continue to show strong bullish momentum despite volume or oscillators suggesting otherwise. Typically, a Heikin-Ashi run like this will end in a blow-off top, similar to the price structure of January 4 and 5, as well as November 2015 (not shown).\n\nSummary\n\nUnconfirmed transactions will continue to plague Bitcoin, especially as new users and traders ramp onto the network. Stuck transactions can be avoided by using an appropriate transaction fee. The Bitfinex premium in excess of $100 at one point between exchanges continues to shrink. Most technicals are of little use with this price structure and discovery, although a large parabolic move is likely coming in the very near future.\n\nBitcoin MagazineBTCMediaBTCMedia', 'The altcoin surge has ended. After climbing for the past seven days, the majority of altcoins fell today while bitcoin has continued to rise.\n\nRipple, which yesterday replaced Ethereum for the number two cryptocurrency based on market cap, fell back to second place today as it lost nearly 15 points in a recent 24-hour period. As of yesterday, Ripple was outpacing all currencies with high double-digit gains. Today, its market cap fell to just over $7 billion. In the previous 24-hour period, Ripple posted an 83.91-point gain.\n\nEthereum suffered less of a loss in the 24-hour period, falling 1.43 points but recovering its number two spot at $8.197 billion in market capitalization. Ethereum Classic, the number 7 cryptocurrency with a $606.167 million market cap, lost 2.46 points.\n\nBitcoin Continues Its March\n\nBitcoin continued its steady march forward, posting more than 9 points in the 24-hour period, with a market cap approaching $30 billion. Bitcoin’s pace nearly doubled over the previous 24-day period. Bitcoin’s price topped $1,800 this morning.\n\nLitecoin was the only currency with more than a $1 billion in market capitalization to post a gain in the 24-hour period – 0.29 points for a market cap of about $1.5 billion, maintaining the number 4 spot. Litecoin surpassed the $1 billion mark earlier this month when its price jumped 30 points from around $16 to nearly $23.\n\nNEM, the only other currency with more than a $1 billion market cap, lost 8.07 points in the number 5 spot.\n\nDash, which has been on a roll as the number 6 currency, suffered a 5.09 point drop in the 24-hour period to $693.899 million. Dash had soared from $77 million to $528 million in its market cap in the first quarter.\n\nMonero, the number 8 currency that has also been rising as of late, lost 1.51 points. Monero successfully hard forked in January.\n\nStellar Performer: Steem\n\nThe only stellar performer in the recent 24-hour period was Steem, which at number 10 with a $324.198 market cap, posted a 34.87 point gain. Steemit is a decentralized social media platform that rewards users for delivering commentary, images and videos. Steemit’s blockchain successfully completed a hard fork late last year.\n\nWhile bitcoin in has continued to rise, the fallout in altcoin prices could undermine its growth. The altcoin surge was cited by some analysts as one of the factors behind bitcoin’s growth since investors were buying altcoins with bitcoin. Most exchanges don’t enable investors to trade fiat currencies for altcoins. Those who want to invest have to first purchase bitcoins, then exchange them for the desired altcoin.\n\nThe altcoin surge has not been the sole factor behind bitcoin’s gains, however.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin maintains price stability while altcoins fall; the importance of low volatility\n\nBitcoin’s Outlook Strong\n\nA jump in global trading volume, particularly from Japan and the Japan-based bitFlyer exchange, has also been fueling bitcoin’s surge.\n\nRecent trading is markedly led by Japanese markets where the yen contributed to over half of the global trading volume in a recent 24-hour period.\n\nCapital flows into bitcoin are also increasing worldwide.\n\nBrian Kelly, the founder of Brian Kelly Capital, noted the biggest driver in bitcoin’s growth is institutional investors in the digital asset sector.\n\nKelly referred to the incoming capital as “real money” that will be used to fund the new Internet.\n\nAnother factor Kelly noted is a consensus in the bitcoin community against Bitcoin Unlimited, which would divide the cryptocurrency into two coins.

05/10/2017,"['Bitcoin, which set a record high above $1,800 today, is “fully valued” and could see a pullback in the short term, but one investor expects bitcoin price could go as high as $4,000 over the next 14 months.\n\nIn the last 30 days, bitcoin, which has been steadily rising since April, has risen over 33 percent.\n\nBitcoin’s Setbacks\n\nThe rally perplexes some given that there have been a number of setbacks for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) sought by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The proposal is currently under review, however, and if approved, will give new credibility to bitcoin, especially among investors.\n\nThere is also a debate raging over bitcoin’s structure that remains unresolved in many peoples’ eyes.\n\nIn addition, some cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Bitfinex, have stopped allowing access to the banking system, preventing customers from withdrawing fiat currency.\n\nBitcoins Positives\n\nNonetheless, there are positive developments.\n\nJapan legalized bitcoin as a payment method, resulting in more bitcoin being bought with yen, noted Aurelien Menant, CEO and founder of Gatecoin, a Hong Kong based regulated blockchain asset exchange.\n\nThe recent change in the code of Litecoin could also bode well for bitcoin.\n\nLitecoin has deployed Segregated Witness (SegWit), which enables for faster cryptocurrency transactions. The successful SegWit deployment raises hopes that the tool can also help bitcoin solve its scaling challenge.\n\nA current backlog of bitcoin transactions has slowed transaction time. This is because bitcoin’s rules only permit a limited number of transactions per bitcoin block.\n\nBitcoin’s price fell in March on account of a proposed solution to the block size that would have created two blockchains, meaning two separate bitcoin currencies.\n\nLitecoin’s success with SegWit, however, demonstrates how the block size can be increased without causing such a disruption.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin price hits $1,567, new all-time high, led by Japan and US\n\nSegWit’s Promise\n\nDaniel Masters, director of Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, an investment fund listed on the International Stock Exchange on the Channel Islands, said the example of a “soft fork” in Litecoin has demonstrated SegWit can increase block size capacity and move bitcoin forward.\n\nPrevious bitcoin price peaks have suffered sharp pullbacks. Masters said the current price rise has been violent in the short term, with bitcoin “fully valued for the moment,” which could result in a pullback to $1,100.\n\nNevertheless, the outlook remains positive. In the next eight to 14 months, Masters expects bitcoin’s price to be around $4,000, speaking to CNBC.\n\nMenant of Gatecoin expects the price to surpass $3,000 this year.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Over the past few months, the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market led an upward momentum for the global Bitcoin exchange market, continuously pushing Bitcoin price to new highs. In a period of 30 days, Bitcoin price increased from $1,200 to $1,760, recording a 32 percent monthly increase in value.\n\nCointelegraph particularly provided extensive coverage of the Japanese exchange market’s overwhelming performance and influence over the global exchange. The demand toward Bitcoin in Japan significantly increased following the legalization of Bitcoin and the acceptance of Bitcoin payments by the country’s single most influential electronics retailer Bic Camera.\n\nAlso, some of the largest multi-billion dollar corporations have announced the launch of their independent Bitcoin and digital currency exchanges.\n\nAbsence of fees raises concerns\n\nOne criticism over Bitcoin’s recent price surge has been the absence of fees in the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market. Some analysts suspected that the Japanese exchange market’s decision to exclude fees could have a similar effect the Chinese Bitcoin exchange had on the global exchange market.\n\nIn an interview, Japan’s two largest Bitcoin exchanges QUOINE and BitFlyer clarified that the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market does in fact have fees in place. Yuzo Kano, the CEO of BitFlyer, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange which controls over 67 percent of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market share stated:\n\n“We charge trading fees for BTC and ‘swap point’ for FX. So it’s a different situation from China before this January. We are seeing funds inflowing not only to BTC but also all crypto markets.”\n\nMike Kayamori, CEO of QUOINE, which also controls around 10 percent of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market share further emphasized that fees are charged for all traders other than spot trading of BTC/JPY. Thus, the claims of analysts that there currently is instability in Bitcoin price due to the low fees or absence of fees on Japanese Bitcoin exchange market are false.\n\nKayamori says:\n\n“At QUOINE, we are charging fees on all trades other than spot trading of BTC/JPY. Every other currency pair, as well as margin trading, there is a fee. And our spreads are quite large, hence our volume is actually lower in April/May than it was March.”\n\nBitcoin as an alternative investment\n\nJon Southurst, a journalist based in Tokyo, noted that high profile and institutional investors along with casual traders are seeking out for alternative investments such as Bitcoin due to the government’s quantitative easing practice.\n\nOn April 24, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin price could surge as the Japanese government moved on to print massive amounts of cash. At the time, Holger Zschaepitz, the senior editor of the financial desk and market maniac at Welt, stated:', 'Australia has officially confirmed it will treat Bitcoin “just like money” from this year and it will no longer be subject to double taxation.\n\nIn its budget summary for 2017-18, the government states that as part of its plan to “make it easier” for digital currency businesses to operate in the country. It will ensure that nowhere in the supply chain is general sales tax (GST) paid more than once.\n\n“The Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia,” the summary reads.\n\n“From 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes. Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.”\n\nAustralia has had a troubled relationship with cryptocurrency regulation until recently. The decision to allow double taxation originally caused several well-known operators to quit the country back in 2014, while innovation has subsequently lagged behind markets in which businesses have enjoyed greater freedom.\n\nInnovative fintech deals involving Blockchain have surfaced this year, however, and the tone of the budget extract points to a desire to change Australia’s environment.\n\n“Innovation will drive productivity growth in Australia,” it continues.\n\n“The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (FinTech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.”\n\nMeanwhile, local business optimism is also increasing.', 'The president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank has opined that blockchain, not bitcoin, has more potential for adoption in the future. The central banker also took aim at bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nNeel Kashkari, an American banker and politician who is also the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis was speaking at the Minnesota High Tech Association’s Spring Conference when he was asked about digital currencies by an audience member.\n\n“From the Fed Reserve point of view, where do you see the [digital currencies] movement going? Are we going to embrace bitcoin or blockchain?”\n\nIn response, Kashkari first responded in stating that the Federal Reserve is keeping a keen eye on developments in the space.\n\nThis is a topic that a lot of people across the Fed are paying a lot of attention and watching how it evolves. I think the sentiment has shifted in the markets, in the Fed. I would say I think conventional wisdom now is that blockchain and the underlying technology is probably more interesting and has more potential than maybe bitcoin does by itself.\n\nShifting the focus to bitcoin, he prefaced his thoughts in stating: “This is going to trigger a tweetstorm of haters.”\n\nLaying out his criticism, he stated:\n\nThe problem I have with bitcoin is while it says by design that you’re limiting the number of bitcoins that can be created, it doesn’t stop me from creating Neelcoin, or somebody from creating Bobcoin or Marycoin or Susiecoin.\n\nHe added:\n\nI haven’t heard of a digital currency solution for a proliferation of competing virtual currencies. That to me is a fundamental question I have about bitcoin or other virtual currencies and their risk for inflation, just because of competition.\n\nThe US federal reserve published its first research paper on blockchain technology in December 2016, one which deduced that the “use of banks to conduct payments could become obsolete.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kashkari is also likely to have heard about bitcoin during the 2016 Federal Reserve Annual Meeting in Washington last May. The event, hosted by the Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), had Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen urging her counterparts to study emerging technologies, specifically mentioning bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nFeatured image from Neel Kashkari for Governor/Flickr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Across China, blockchain technology is recognized as an increasingly important development; however, bitcoin as a “virtual good” in China is facing yet another challenge from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2017, China’s top-tier financial media outlet, Caixin, reported that “according to a person close to PBOC, PBOC will soon issue a notice of penalties to BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi for irregularities based on its previous inspection in the past few months. The major problems are [related to] illegal margin trading services and lack of internal controls for anti-money laundering. The related penalty details have already been confirmed internally; all that is left to do is go through approval procedures.”\n\nCaixin also stated that, according to their source, further “regulation on bitcoin exchange and regulation on anti-money laundering systems for bitcoin exchange will likely be released in June.”\n\n“A person close to PBOC” is a common citation used by Caixin. Considered to be the most influential media in China’s economic and political sphere, Caixin is usually the first outlet in China to disclose any news from the PBOC related to Bitcoin, and always has insider access. It is, in effect, a mouthpiece by which the PBOC communicates with bitcoin exchanges and the Bitcoin community as a whole.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that Caixin often tends to exaggerate the PBOC’s actual political influence. For example, when the PBOC inspected the three biggest exchanges, Caixin said the PBOC would “thoroughly inspect and regulate” them. However, the official statement released by the PBOC merely suggested that the PBOC, together with the local financial office, would “inspect exchanges.” Similarly, Caixin said, “With staunch resolution and with bottom-level efforts, the local Financial Office and PBOC [would] jointly resolve the bitcoin exchange issue.”\n\nThe result of this consistent tonal bias from China’s most influential media, as it represents the interests of the PBOC, is to portray Bitcoin’s public image in China as still something deeply connected with price volatility and money laundering, and in need of severe government regulation. As to Bitcoin’s features like decentralization and P2P transactions, Caixin remains pointedly silent.\n\nConversely, the incoming penalties and regulations should be interpreted as a signal that the big three exchanges will soon be allowed to resume bitcoin withdrawal, though at a cost. Still this negative portrayal of bitcoin trading shows that, at least in the short run, bitcoin in China will have difficulty gaining legal tender status as a payment tool, as opposed to the acceptance that it is seeing in Japan.\n\nThe logic behind this stance seems natural considering that the PBOC’s own version of digital currency is already around the corner; Caixin announced in January that it had successfully completed a demo.\n\nIn China, blockchain technology itself is enjoying its spring. People’s Daily, the Chinese state-run media, speaks highly of it. China’s 13th Five-Year Plan national strategy includes it. Local governments support it.\n\nBitcoin, however, is facing a trial. The most likely result will be that bitcoin itself will remain the same as virtual goods. As for bitcoin trading, all the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering regulations point to one strategic bottom line: speculation of bitcoin must not result in any social or financial instability in China.', '(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277241LOGO )\n\n\n\nCurrently, Ulmart sells close to 150,000 SKU in its ""first-party seller"" format.

Litecoin, one of the oldest and biggest altcoins by market cap, deployed Segregated Witness (SegWit) today. The protocol upgrade that was originally developed for Bitcoin and proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team locked in on Litecoin two weeks ago, and was enforced by a majority of hash power on the Litecoin network as of a couple of hours ago.\n\nThe Segregated Witness soft fork activated without major issues — though there was an early slip up by the biggest Litecoin mining pool on the network.\n\n“F2Pool had a hiccup where they were not mining Litecoin correctly. For some reason their LTC pool was returning a BTC template to miners. We reached out to them and they fixed it right away,” Litecoin inventor Charlie Lee told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nSegWit\n\nLaunched in 2011, Litecoin was one of the first altcoins to gain significant traction. As opposed to some newer altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple and Monero, Litecoin is a straight fork of Bitcoin’s codebase but with a different mining algorithm and some changed parameters, such as faster confirmation times. This similarity to Bitcoin does mean that Litecoin suffers from similar weaknesses as Bitcoin, like transaction malleability.\n\nAnd, indeed, that it can adopt similar solutions and improvements, like Segregated Witness.\n\nWhile Litecoin inventor Charlie Lee has been advocating for activation of the soft fork since late 2016, miner support initially did not follow. This changed following the Global LTC Roundtable Meeting, an online meeting held amongst prominent stakeholders in the Litecoin industry, who are based particularly in China. The participants agreed on “Litecoin Global Roundtable Resolution 001 (2017),” which, among other things, holds that the mining pools would activate SegWit.\n\nWith its SegWit activation, the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” has immediately reclaimed a place in the spotlight, and the markets have been taking notice. Having lingered in Bitcoin’s shadow for years at price levels below $5, Litecoin’s exchange rate surged almost tenfold in anticipation of SegWit. The altcoin reached almost $40 today and is trading around $33 at time of publication.\n\nBitcoin\n\nPerhaps even more important, some prominent Bitcoin projects — like .NET Bitcoin library NBitcoin and wallet mSIGNA — announced to port their work to Litecoin now that it has enabled SegWit. Even more notable, Lightning Labs will roll out a version of their lightning network implementation on Litecoin, while ACINQ has tested their lightning software on the altcoin, too. Similarly, Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau, one of the authors of SegWit, has indicated that he will realize smart-contracting solution MAST on Litecoin.\n\nFurther down the road, Segregated Witness enables more innovations that could be deployed on Litecoin first. Confidential Transactions, Schnorr signatures and TumbleBit are all in the works for Bitcoin, and shouldn’t take too much effort to port to Litecoin.\n\nLee himself, furthermore, hopes that atomic swaps will soon see the light of day, enabling an instant and trustless altcoin exchange and lightning network type of transactions across different digital currencies.\n\n“SegWit opens up the doors to many amazing features that can be added to Litecoin,” Lee said. “These include Lightning Network, MAST, Confidential Transactions, Schnorr Signatures and more. I think Litecoin can show Bitcoin that SegWit is indeed the best way to improve the protocol. So I think it will help get that happening sooner on Bitcoin.”\n\nSegregated Witness is still pending activation on Bitcoin, where it requires 95 percent hash power support. It has stagnated at around 30 percent so far.', 'As the 24-hour transaction volume of the top digital currency Bitcoin reached a historical high of $1.3 bln this week, the days of altcoins that solve no substantial problem may soon be over - or tested to a point of failure.\n\nThe rising Bitcoin price which seldom reflects negatively on most alternative currencies is going to tell on their success.\n\nFor those who have noticed, the more Bitcoin rises, the lowermost altcoins go - even the super altcoins. This could be as a result of the established fact that one has to buy Bitcoin to get into altcoins and vice versa to opt out.\n\nOr it could be as a result of a reduced confidence in what some - if not most - of these altcoins have to offer. There are also words of some being scams and others being clones of another or serving the same purpose with another.\n\nTime for altcoins show what they are worth\n\nWhatever is the case of every altcoin, what they really stand for would be tested in due course unless the rise of Bitcoin gets stalled. Their existence could be affected negatively unless they evolve to be a true representation of their initial ideas and market more to show off their achievements. New ideas are popping up every day and some would definitely become obsolete.\n\nThe thought that the market decides really needs to be given consideration now especially as there is a growing notion that an altcoin bubble is in the making and it could pop at some point.\n\nBitcoin’s rise is setting a standard that altcoins need to rise up to so as to wax stronger as well.\n\nBitcoin’s superiority\n\nThe reality of each and every passing year that Bitcoin has survived without being crushed to the ground- some investors report huge returns on their investments along the way- is sinking into the minds of more people.\n\nThe confidence level in the currency has risen and new users are coming into the cryptocurrency world. It’s truly decentralized nature also makes its extremely difficult for its protocol to be changed by anyone or some developers unlike it’s the case with some altcoins - a good side to the SegWit/scalability standoff.\n\nNow aiming for the $2,000 price tag, the Bitcoin scarcity factor seems to be kicking in and pushing for demands that increase its value - remember last year’s block reward halving.\n\nIt throws a greater challenge to altcoins and their need to brace up for what could be coming.', ""Jim Cramer talks Bitcoin with his Trading Strategies panel, despite the fact that he rarely even comments on the cryptocurrency.

The shorter-term moving average lines up with the channel support around $1600-1650, which also coincides with a former resistance level.\n\nThis could serve as a potential pullback zone in the event of a large drop due to profit-taking. Stochastic is heading down to show that buyers are taking a break and letting sellers take over bitcoin price action but it looks like the pullback is a shallow one.\n\nA bit of bearish divergence can be seen on RSI as this oscillator made lower highs while bitcoin price had higher highs. If selling pressure picks up, a short-term drop to the channel support could be underway. On the other hand, persistent factors fueling this rally could lead to an upside break of the latest highs.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe main factors fueling the bitcoin rally these days are: rising volumes in Japan, signs of a slowdown in China, geopolitical uncertainties stemming from North Korea and Syria, and speculations of the COIN bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins have been given until May 15 to submit additional requirements, during which the regulator might announce their decision after the review. Approval could pave the way for greater market interest and liquidity, thereby leading to another big boost in volumes and most likely bitcoin price. Rejection, on the other hand, could lead to a sharp selloff but this could still draw more bulls in at cheaper levels.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

05/11/2017,"['The digital currency bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, rising to $1,800 Thursday—surpassing Tuesday’s record $1,760.\n\nCNBC reports that bitcoin rose more than $100 in just two days—namely thanks to recent comments from policy makers.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was trading at around $1,824 by early morning in London, according to Coindesk’s bitcoin price index, which CNBC cites. Since Monday, the market capitalization of bitcoin has risen over $3 billion to a whopping $29.53 billion.\n\nThe latest policy maker to credit for bitcoin’s price drive was Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari. According to CNBC, he talked up the potential of blockchain, which is the technology that bolsters the digital currency.\n\n“I think sentiment has shifted in the markets, in the Fed,” Kashkari said at a technology conference in Minneapolis, according to Reuters. “I would say I think conventional wisdom now is that blockchain and the underlying technology is probably more interesting and has more potential than maybe bitcoin does by itself.”\n\nOverall, the price of bitcoin has risen 81% since the beginning of 2017, according to CNBC.', 'UPD: The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the federal government agency for scientific research in Australia, stated that Blockchain technology will have a profound impact on the Australian economy.\n\nBitcoin will be treated as money in Australia by July 1, 2017, and will be exempt from goods and services tax (GST). Bitcoin traders and investors will not be taxed for purchasing and selling Bitcoin through regulated exchanges and trading platforms.\n\nOver the past two years, the Australian Bitcoin exchange market significantly fell behind growing markets such as South Korea, Japan and South Korea, that control more than half of the global Bitcoin exchange market share.\n\nTwo majors factors which drove startups, exchanges and businesses dealing with Bitcoin and other digital currencies in Australia away from the country where the termination of banking services by leading Australian banks due to their anti-competitive nature and the double taxation of Bitcoin trading by the Australian government.\n\nStarting July 1 however, double taxation and trading and goods and services taxation on Bitcoin will be exempted. In its 2017 to 2018 budget for “Backing innovation and FinTech,” the Australian government wrote:\n\n“The Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia. From 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes. Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.”\n\nThe government will also protect Bitcoin businesses and exchanges\n\nMore importantly, the Australian government’s new vision to spur the growth of fintech and the digital currency market would most likely prevent local banks and financial institutions for unfairly denying banking services to Bitcoin businesses and exchanges.\n\nIf the above mentioned issues can be resolved by July 1, the Australian Bitcoin market could potentially experience a rapid growth in terms of user base and trading volumes. The document further read:\n\n“Innovation will drive productivity growth in Australia. That is why the Government’s $1.1 bln National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA) is designed to enable Australia to take full advantage of new economic opportunities. The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (fintech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.”\n\nAt the Blockchain NZ conference held in Auckland, New Zealand earlier this week, Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos emphasized the Australian government’s uninvolvement in its local Bitcoin market and the impact of such actions on Bitcoin businesses and exchanges.\n\nMore to that, Antonopoulos criticized the local government’s taxation policy on Bitcoin, which essentially drove away businesses and users from Australia to other countries.\n\n“Governments can choose to either do nothing – which is okay, make things worse for cryptocurrency trading – like what Australia did by imposing sales taxes on all cryptocurrency transactions, or they can make things easier for companies by reining in the banks and encouraging companies by creating a level playing field,” Antonopoulos said.\n\nWith Australia’s new policy, the Bitcoin ecosystem in the country could change drastically. Banks will start offering services to Bitcoin exchanges and traders will not be taxed with GST upon the purchase of Bitcoin.', 'On May 9, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin price established a new all-time high at $1,733. In just two days, on May 11, Bitcoin price achieved its new global average all-time high at $1,866.\n\nPreviously, Cointelegraph revealed that high-profile and institutional investors envision Bitcoin increasing to around $4,000 by the end of 2017. Specifically, Daniel Masters, director at Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), stated:\n\n""That example of a successful soft fork in Litecoin has made people start to think that we could get a successful SegWit implementation in Bitcoin and that could increase capacity and move us to the next level. In the eight to 14-month horizon, my forecast would be around $4,000.”\n\nMasters emphasized that Litecoin’s official activation of the Bitcoin Core development team’s Segregated Witness (SegWit) early today is serving as a major driving factor of Bitcoin price. Since miners and investors are carefully observing the effect of SegWit on Litecoin, Masters explained that the demand for Bitcoin is rising exponentially.\n\nHere come the Aussies\n\nApart from Litecoin’s SegWit activation, the Australian government also revealed a major announcement on May 11. As Cointelegraph reported in an article entitled “Australia Will Recognize Bitcoin as Money and Protect Bitcoin Businesses, No Taxes,” starting July 1, traders and investors of Bitcoin will be exempt from goods and services tax (GST).\n\nThe decision of the Australian government to exempt Bitcoin from taxes and offer an even playing ground for Bitcoin business effectively removed double taxation on the digital currency and established a practical ecosystem for Bitcoin businesses.\n\nMore importantly, the Australian government reaffirmed in its 2017 to 2018 budget statement that the country will focus on the development of fintech and digital currency markets. The validation and approval of Bitcoin by the Australian government led to a short-term surge in Bitcoin price.\n\nThe Australian government stated:\n\n“Innovation will drive productivity growth in Australia. That is why the Government’s $1.1 bln National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA) is designed to enable Australia to take full advantage of new economic opportunities. The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (fintech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.”\n\nSince the Australian government\'s yearly report was released, Bitcoin price increased from around $1,750 to $1,860. According to various Bitcoin market data providers, Bitcoin price recorded a five percent 24-hour increase, stabilizing at $1,843.\n\nOther factors\n\nTwo days ago, when Bitcoin price achieved its previous all-time high, there was a large difference in price of Bitcoin between the US and Japanese markets, the two largest Bitcoin exchange markets in the world. Analysts explained that the Japanese market was leading the short-term price surge of Bitcoin.\n\nOn May 11 however, the Bitcoin price listed on the US exchange market rose rapidly, closing in on the Bitcoin price listed by Japanese Bitcoin exchanges. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $1,890 in Japan, $1,840 in the US and $2,115 in South Korea.', 'Russia’s largest online retailer Ulmart says it intends to accept Bitcoin payments “from September 1, 2017.”\n\nIn a press release issued on Wednesday, Ulmart, which deals mainly in electronic goods, says it intends to roll out Bitcoin availability to “higher-priced items first” and that deliberations were ongoing on the matter.\n\nAccording to Dmitry Kostygin, chairman and majority shareholder of Ulmart, the company had taken a keen interest in cryptocurrency behind the scenes while Russia was still deciding what legislative approach to take to the technology.\n\n“Ulmart started closely monitoring the market and regulatory environment for the use of crypto-currency in Russia as early as March 2014,” he said.\n\n“As the blockchain technology is coming into our operations to fight counterfeit items, we see that the mystery that existed around the bitcoin three years ago has significantly receded.”\n\nShould the move go ahead, Ulmart would become easily the largest outlet accepting Bitcoin in Russia, where the consumer landscape is still at its very beginning.\n\nAfter several years of uncertainty and even the threat of criminal punishment for cryptocurrency users, Russian lawmakers finally stated this year that banning it was unfeasible and that set regulations would likely occur in 2018.\n\n“We welcome the willingness that the Russian government has demonstrated with regards to the review of the bitcoin technology and look forward to cooperating with it in this area,” Ulmart’s Chief International Officer Brian Kean added.\n\n“Ulmart believes such initiatives as bitcoin can be part of the efforts to develop \'smart\' economy and cities and will aim to play a major role in this process.""', ""Bitcoin's price rose above $1,800 this morning, setting a new all-time high, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nAverage prices reached as high as $1,839.23, BPI data shows, after beginning the session at $1,732.13.

""Sometimes, that\'s what you have to do to survive. People appealed to me to trust them and you get taken advantage of.""\n\nBut Carlson now sees new opportunity in the booming market for initial coin offerings (ICOs), the process by which technologists are creating cryptographically unique data sets, linking them to a blockchain and selling them to investors as a fundraising tool.\n\nIn this seemingly ever-expanding market, Carlson is launching a new venture. Called Giga Watt, the startup aims to fulfill Carlson\'s long-time goal of democratizing access to bitcoin mining, this time by enabling investors to buy a stake in his company\'s services.\n\nAt a high level, the idea is that Giga Watt is tokenizing the power infrastructure that supports the facilities that host and operate equipment.\n\n""We\'re building and reselling crypto-mines. If you want a big mine, you buy a lot of tokens. If don\'t want to buy miners, then you let us put somebody else\'s miners in your spot and get paid. You don\'t have to concern yourself with how blockchains work,"" Carlson explained.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""You can look at it as you\'re acting as a power landlord, and people will pay to rent your power infrastructure.""\n\nIn this way, the idea is the latest and perhaps one of the more ambitious attempts to capitalize on the access to capital provided by the ICO mechanism. Though, it\'s important to note similar ventures so far have produced varying results for their initiators.\n\nFor example, when bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem sought to tokenize shares in companies this year, the ICO was eventually scrapped after months of promotion. Others have fared better with the model, with startup Gnosis raising over $12m in just under 15 minutes by selling 5% of the tokens that will power its in-development prediction market.\n\nAccording to Carlson, Giga Watt has raised over $1m from undisclosed investors to build out the facilities that would be used as part of the initiative.\n\nTerms of the deal\n\nScheduled to open to the public on 2nd June, Carlson said that Giga Watt is already exploring a pre-sale (and a pre-pre-sale) of its token while building up his team to offer support.\n\nFor Carlson, the idea is aimed at solving a long-standing conceptual issue for the bitcoin network – namely, that the economics that make bitcoins valuable have created economies of scale that made it impossible for smaller miners to compete for the rewards produced by the protocol.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is that, many enthusiasts believe decentralized access to the network is the key differentiator of bitcoin when compared to the centralized online money services it was designed to compete against.\n\nIn this way, Carlson sees Giga Watt as a managed services provider selling its professional abilities and the cheap power resources that make Washington state one of the more profitable areas of the world to operate equipment.\n\nThose who participate in the sale, Carlson said, will have funds placed in escrow until Giga Watt delivers on supplying the power infrastructure. Giga Watt will, in turn, invest the funds it makes into its own mining capabilities.\n\n""We would have facilities that are occupied for token holders, then we have facilities that are wholly owned by Giga Watt,"" Carlson explained.\n\nUncertain economics\n\nFor now, even Carlson is a bit unclear on how the economics of the model will play out.\n\nWhile the idea is to sell the tokens for $1 at launch, he conceded that it\'s possible the market could drive up the price of the asset in such a way that the value could conflict with their utility. Already platforms like ethereum, designed itself to enable the launch of ICOs and other tokenized assets, are facing challenges related to this difficult dynamic.\n\nStill, Carlson said that this is simply a factor that the market will need to take into account as it participates in the offer.\n\n""People need to understand that our token is something that works best when it\'s combined with mining or its buying into a co-location facility or a landlord of power,"" he said.\n\nHe further said that investors shouldn\'t conceive of the token as an asset with boundless utility, or that the token would necessarily provide outsized returns directly.\n\n""I don\'t want people to buy the token thinking it\'s going to do the moon,"" he said. ""People are going to be willing to pay more than what we\'re selling for, but it\'s not a share ownership of a company.""\n\nAnother factor to keep in mind is that token owners will be served with mining power in a first-come, first-serve manner, meaning those who buy earlier will have access to the token\'s real-world utility, and the potential earnings from the mining operations.\n\nLaunching point\n\nCarlson also stressed the legal work underpinning the offering, which is being issued by Giga Watt\'s Singaporean entity. (It worked with US law firm Perkins Coie on the structure to ensure that the token wouldn\'t be deemed a security.)\n\nCarlson said Giga Watt plans to sell 30 million tokens as part of the sale, and he remains confident that potential buyers will capitalize on the opportunity.\n\n""We can offer this to anyone. You can buy one token if that\'s meaningful to you. A household could buy a few hundred dollars of tokens and buy more tokens later,"" he said.\n\nFor now, Carlson is launching a website to support Giga Watt, which lists its available plans and the costs associated with the purchase. (In a bid for transparency, the firm lets buyers schedule an open house to see the facilities).\n\nOn display also are its planned \'Giga Pod\' units: mining warehouses that Carlson said have been optimized for efficiency with the years of expertise gleaned in the operation of MegaBigPower, his former operation.\n\nUntil the launch, though, he acknowledged that the market needs to now digest the deal and understand how it works. But he believes, if successful, it could be beneficial for the bitcoin network and investors at large.\n\nCarlson concluded:\n\n""I firmly feel that every household in America could have a small mining operation. It\'s a vision and it\'s possible. But, if the non-miner doesn\'t understand what the opportunity is, that\'s the hurdle.""\n\nBitcoin mining image via Giga Watt\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin traders may also be required to register with their real names.\n\nThe regulator recently inspected domestic trading platforms after warning they risk being closed if found violating the country’s currency regulations. It is attempting to curb capital outflow following fears of continued weakness in the domestic currency.\n\n“There needs to be a clear bottom line for the management of bitcoin trading platforms and websites. A blacklist should also be set up. Activities such as trading or financing on margin and market measures such as commission-free trading must be banned,” said Zhou Xuedong, Operations Director at the PBOC.\n\nChina accounts for about 90 percent of all bitcoin trading on exchanges.

Frankly, the kind of movements we’re seeing these days in the cryptocurrency markets are astonishing and are some of the biggest seen in any market since the beginning of time.\n\nI mean, we could talk about President Trump firing the FBI director but really that would just be beating a dead horse. Besides, I’ve made a conscious decision not to let President Trump dictate what I write about and I’m pretty sure you’re tired of reading it by now.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace. Click here to change your current membership -- //\n\nPoor Mark Carney though. The Governor of the Bank of England said some really interesting things yesterday and managed to move the Pound Sterling by about 30 pips. It’s just that during the time frame of that announcement Bitcoin moved more than $50 a coin.\n\n–Mati\n\nWhat’s going on?\n\nWell, the ride up was really nice. From a low of $1141, a coin on April 13th to a high yesterday of $1905 represents a move of more than $750 a coin (about 40%) in less than a month. This is a high-risk market though and is prone to rapid fluctuations.\n\nThe $150 pullback that we saw last night somehow seems like a normal retracement but it did manage to trigger a few stop losses.\n\nThe Scalability Issue\n\nOne issue that is on the minds of investors this morning is the issue of scalability. As the network grows, the bitcoin blockchain is finding it harder and harder to process transactions.\n\nThere have been some amazing updates from countries like Japan, India, Australia, and even Russia that indicate bitcoin and other digital currencies will be much more widely accepted in the future.\n\nHowever, all this excitement is putting some serious strain on the system. At the time of this writing, there are over 160,000 transactions stuck in the backlog and pending confirmation by blockchain miners. Meaning, that it’s taking a long time to process payments right now.\n\nTo put it in context, I personally tried to send a bitcoin payment last night before going to bed and as of this morning, 10 hours later, it still has not been processed.\n\nSo certainly the prospect of everyday use increasing rapidly is extremely exciting but if it takes 10 hours to make a payment it’s not a very useful system.\n\nSo What’s Next?\n\nThe rate of growth for all cryptocurrencies seems to be slowing down but has not stopped. On Monday, we celebrated the market cap of all cryptocurrencies passing $50 Billion for the first time. At the moment, the number stands at about $54 Billion. So the growth this week is a bit less than $1 Billion per day on average.\n\nThe seven-day chart shows a steady incline but it’s nothing near the $5 Billion days we saw last week.\n\nThe market cap of bitcoin peaked yesterday at $30.5 Billion but since then has lost about $1 Billion. So where did that money go?\n\nFor the most part, it seems to have been redistributed to other cryptocurrencies. During the same period, the Ethereum network grew by $200 Million and Ripple’s value has gone up by almost $700 Million.\n\nSo, for the most part, at least for the time being, it seems that in light of the overcrowded bitcoin blockchain, cryptotraders are reallocating their funds to other networks, ones that are faster and don’t have the same issues.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the move from last night could also be just a temporary pullback. There are some very large players entering the market at the moment. Players who have a lot invested and want to see the price up to $5,000 or $10,000 a coin. For them, a $150 pullback in the price is nothing but an opportunity and even if we do see $1200 again it will only be a chance to get more at a better price.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or comments on the above or if you need any sort of clarification.

Bloomberg\n\n""That is something we would like to see,"" Shawwa said. ""It will be called the Palestinian pound.""\n\nBitcoin is a global digital currency and payment system.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Close\n\nShawwa spoke to Reuters on the sidelines of the annual meeting in Cyprus of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The EBRD said during the meeting it would start investing in the West Bank and Gaza via donations\n\nThe PMA says on its website that it aimed to become a ""full-fledged and modern central bank"" for an independent Palestine.\n\nBut it is unclear how the planned e-pound would skirt the 1994 Paris Protocol agreement which gave the PMA the functions of a central bank but without the ability to issue currency. The protocol recommended the use of the shekel and gave Israel an effective veto over a Palestinian currency.\n\nThere are practical reason why Palestinians might consider a digital currency. The authority has no money-printing facilities of its own so all cash and coins currently come in from elsewhere.\n\n""If we print currency, to get it into the country you would always need clearance from the Israelis and that could be an obstacle,"" Shawwa said. ""So that is why we don\'t want to go into it.""\n\nThe Palestinians are not the only ones considering a digital currency. Sweden\'s central bank has said it may launch an e-currency as the use of cash declines and low interest rates tempt citizens to hoard money in vaults or at home.\n\nThe Palestinian pound is still some way off, however. The authority has been in a decade-long push to have a recognized central bank and the currency plans are part of a wider five-year strategy to be published before the end of the year, Shawwa said.\n\nOther options, such as keeping the status quo of using four currencies, or formally adopting one of them are also under consideration but Shawwa said the digital route was the preferred one.\n\n""But it\'s not only the currency, you have to see the economy also. Issuing (a currency) is something, but you also need the backbone of the currency; reserves, gold, oil and that is part of the business plan.""\n\nIt is already taking the first step towards those goals. Shawwa said the PMA was in the process of moving to a new purpose-built central bank building in Ramallah.\n\nThe building ""is designed and constructed to be a central bank"", Shawwa said, adding it had a strong vault.', 'It seems as if a Bitcoin scaling solution is urgently needed to process transactions more efficiently.\n\nEarlier today, on May 12, the Bitcoin network’s mempool, the holding area for all pending and unconfirmed transactions, achieved an all-time high size of 110 mln bytes or 110 MBs. For two days, the size of the mempool remained in the 100 MBs region, which meant that many transactions were left unconfirmed and weren’t broadcasted to the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nMore to that, the average size of Bitcoin blocks increased to around 0.988 MB, getting closer to the Bitcoin network’s 1 MB cap. Based on the growing mempool size and the average Bitcoin block size which is a few kilobytes away from maximizing Bitcoin’s block size cap, a scaling solution is urgently and evidently needed in order to scale the Bitcoin network proportionally to its growth.\n\nIntegration of Lightning\n\nIn April, Bitcoin Core developer Luke-Jr claimed that the legitimate use of the Bitcoin Blockchain amounts to only 750 KB or 0.75 MB per block on average, assuming that the rest are spam transactions initiated to mislead the community into thinking that a scaling solution must be urgently adopted. Luke-Jr wrote:\n\n“All legitimate uses of the blockchain currently amount to approximately 750k/block average. If inefficient and microtransaction usage is put aside, likely below 500k would be sufficient. No block size increase is likely to be needed in the near future. Before we reach the point that 1MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. This improves efficiency of blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k.”\n\nHe further emphasized that the integration of Lightning would optimize Bitcoin blocks by up to 90 percent by enabling cheap and secure micropayments with lesser fees. Whether only 750 KB of transactions in each block are legitimate and authentic is difficult to prove and conclude based on the current circumstances.\n\nHowever, as Luke-Jr noted in his comment about SegWit and Lightning, the activation of SegWit on Bitcoin will most likely lead to an immediate implementation of the Lightning network, as seen in Litecoin’s most recent facilitation of a Lightning micropayment.\n\n1.3 cents transaction in less than a second\n\nAccording to Blockstream developer Rusty Russell, Litecoin processed its first SegWit-based Lightning transaction that is worth about 1.3 cents. The transaction was settled in less than a second on a non-test network initiated by fellow Blockstream developer Christian Decker.\n\nThe effect of Lightning on the optimization of Bitcoin blocks is still speculative, mainly because Litecoin’s blocks are almost 90 percent empty and Lightning could have an entirely different impact on Bitcoin. For instance, Litecoin was designed to process transactions on a 2.5-minute basis, while Bitcoin settles transactions or grants confirmations every 10 minutes. Hence, the speed of Lightning micropayment settlement on Litecoin could significantly differ from that of Bitcoin.\n\nEither way, based on Bitcoin’s growing mempool size and the exponential growth in daily transactions, a scaling solution is needed. At this point, SegWit seems like the most viable mid-term scaling solution as it offers infrastructure for two-layer solutions and offers fixes to existing issues such as transaction malleability.', 'With a 94 percent year-to-date gain, and a single ""coin"" now worth $1,843, bitcoin has been on a helluva run lately.\n\nThe increase in the cost of the massively-volatile electronic tokens has led to many comparisons with that other favorite outsider ""currency\'\' — gold — recently.\n\nTrue, a unit of bitcoin passed the dollar value of one troy ounce of gold this year, and is now more than $600 higher.\n\nBut the daily swings in the digitally created asset have been vast. Even during the huge run up this year, it has moved more than five percent on 21 different days, with nine of those being moves lower. Gold on the other hand, has been much more stable.\n\nVolatility aside, there is a major problem with gold as a comparator for the software-based unit.\n\nNobody thinks comparing one share of Apple Inc. — current price around $155 — with one share of, for example, outdoor lighting company Acuity Brands Inc. — current price around $178 — is valid. It certainly does not show that Acuity, with its market cap of $7.9 billion, is worth more than Apple\'s market cap of $814 billion.\n\nBy the time the supply of new bitcoins ends, sometime after the year 2110, there will be 21 million bitcoins in (digital) existence, meaning the total value of all of the electronic tokens that will ever exist, at today\'s market price, is just under $39 billion. According to the World Gold Council, total gold stocks amount to approximately six billion troy ounces, or $7.3 trillion at today\'s price.\n\nTo put it another way, in order for bitcoin to be worth more than gold, one \'coin\' would have to trade at $347,000 in order for \'bitcoin worth more than gold\' to be a defensible statement.\n\nMust dash now, one bitcoin is about be worth more than one aluminum future...\n\n(Corrects spelling in first and fourth charts.)', 'Computers in hospitals across England are showing a terrifying message after a cyber attack.\n\nThe screen asks users to send money before they can get to their files – which include patients\' most sensitive data.\n\nIt asks the hospitals to send $300 to a specific bitcoin address, at which point their files will be unlocked.\n\nGadgets and tech news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43 show all Gadgets and tech news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/43 Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

After rejecting the filing for an ETF on this cryptocurrency by Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust , the SEC is reviewing its decision once again.

In mid-2015, the currency was at around $200 (read: Explaining Bitcoin and Crypto Currency ).\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoins are \'mined\' by using a greater amount of computer processing power. However, since there is a fixed amount of bitcoins, it becomes hard to \'mine\' for the coins when the limit is reached. The best part of this system is that it is beyond the reach of central banks (read: Believe It or Not: Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF on the Horizon ).\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nThe tussle between the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and Winklevoss over the launch has been going on for about three years. In fact, the issuer has restructured the proposal for the Bitcoin ETF multiple times.\n\nThe currency is in the limelight probably because of the fact that ""bitcoin isn\'t regulated by any government and has been used by consumers worldwide to shelter assets from inflation or political upheavals in their home countries."" As per an article published on CNBC , Bitcoin is emerging as a safe haven asset like gold.\n\nWith SPDR Gold Shares GLD coming under pressure due to rising rate prospects in the U.S. and a likely higher greenback, one can possibly find refuge in seemingly safe or alternative assets like bitcoin.\n\nThe operating backdrop may be strengthening for bitcoin, but the SEC is seemingly looking for more proof of the safety in this trade.

However, as prices continue climbing, prompting more and more people to buy in, questions are starting to arise as to whether the asset is headed for a bubble.\n\nOn Tuesday, a board member at the Bundesbank, Germany\'s central bank, issued a warning to the public not to buy bitcoin, saying the bank did not recognize it as a currency, and the cryptocurrency may be facilitating speculation.

On Thursday (May 11) of this week, bitcoin saw values break above $1,800 for the first time in history.\n\nIt’s a crazy amount of growth — up a full 81 percent since the beginning of 2017 and nearly triple (299 percent) the value at this time last year.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, CoinDesk pegged bitcoin at $1,832.35, up 4.30 percent for the day, though down from a high of a $1,839.23 earlier in the morning. The digital currency’s market cap stood at just under $30 billion, with some $16.3 million in circulation.\n\nAt the time of writing, bitcoin had settled back down a bit, dipping into the $1,780s.\n\nWith the latest rise, exchanges have seen a dampening of the widened exchange spread trends over the past few weeks.

(To be fair, the exact circumstances around the price rise from Saxo’s report were far different.)\n\nAt this time, there’s still no readily apparent catalyst on the market. One hypothesis is that investor optimism is rising in response to the SEC’s decision to review its rejection of the Winklevoss bitcoin-based ETF.\n\nAnd it’s not just bitcoin.

05/13/2017,"['It\'s worth more than an ounce of gold right now, it\'s completely digital and it\'s the currency of choice for the cyberattackers who crippled computer networks around the world in recent days.\n\nWhen the attackers\' ""ransomware"" sprang into action, it held victims hostage by encrypting their data and demanding they send payments in bitcoins to regain access to their computers. Bitcoin has a fuzzy history, but it\'s a type of currency that allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties.\n\nHere\'s a brief look at bitcoin:\n\nHow bitcoins work\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who ""mine"" them by lending computing power to verify other users\' transactions. They receive bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies.\n\nHow much is it worth?\n\nOne bitcoin recently traded for $1,734.65, according to Coinbase, a company that helps users exchange bitcoins. That makes it more valuable than an ounce of gold, which trades at less than $1,230.\n\nThe value of bitcoins can swing sharply, though. A year ago, one was worth $457.04, which means that it\'s nearly quadrupled in the last 12 months. But its price doesn\'t always go up. A bitcoin\'s value plunged by 23 percent against the dollar in just a week this past January. It fell by the same amount again in 10 days during March.\n\nWhy bitcoins are popular\n\nBitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators -- and criminals.\n\nWho\'s using bitcoin?\n\nSome businesses have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage. Overstock.com accepts payments in bitcoin, for example.\n\nThe currency has become popular enough that more than 300,000 daily transactions have been occurring recently, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. A year ago, activity was closer to 230,000 transactions per day.\n\nStill, its popularity is low compared with cash and cards, and many individuals and businesses won\'t accept bitcoins for payments.\n\nHow bitcoins are kept secure\n\nThe bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals\' greed for the collective good. A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction. The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn\'t be an issue.\n\nHow bitcoin came to be\n\nIt\'s a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn\'t matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.\n\nAn Australian entrepreneur last year stepped forward and claimed to be the founder of bitcoin, only to say days later that he did not ""have the courage"" to publish proof that he is.', 'Bitcoin has shown amazing, and fairly steady, growth over the last year.\n\nA single bitcoin was worth just $455 in May 2016. And even after retrenching slightly from a record Thursday high of over $1,800 per token, it has shown a stunning 286% annual return, based on prices from CoinMarketCap.\n\nAs with most assets, explaining bitcoin’s bull stampede is more art than science. Bitcoin’s price is fundamentally linked to how many people use the system to send money. But it’s currently mostly driven by speculators, who trade on their belief that it will become more popular in the future. Positive news on that front has been plentiful in the last three months in particular.\n\nGlobally, Bitcoin is being treated with a great deal more respect by regulators. Positive comments about blockchain by Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari coincided with the latest Bitcoin price surge. Japan approved Bitcoin as a legal method of payment in early April, and Chinese regulators have made progress in squaring Bitcoin usage with that country’s tight capital controls.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThere have been positive internal indicators, as well. Bitcoin’s major headwind is an ongoing debate over scaling up the system to handle more transactions. While that effort is still basically stalled by bitter infighting, some have seen a positive development in the successful deployment of a solution known as Segregated Witness on the LiteCoin system, which is largely a Bitcoin clone.\n\nWhen considering further upside on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, one factor looms above all: cryptocurrency is still essentially off-limits for institutional investors. While venture capitalists have poured more than $1.5 billion into blockchain startups, the tokens themselves don’t meet regulatory standards for more traditional funds. Once something like the Winklevoss twins’ proposed Bitcoin ETF is approved, the pool of potential Bitcoin investors will explode overnight.\n\nThere are also two very important points of caution. First, Bitcoin is still a risky asset in the short term. Boosters were just as excited when it peaked at over $1,100 in late 2013—and the price then spent years gradually slumping, reaching a low of $200 in mid-2015.\n\nThere’s also a serious long-term downside risk to Bitcoin. While the potential of Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology is widely acknowledged, Bitcoin itself is now only one of dozens of implementations of the idea. Bitcoin has a big first-mover advantage, but innovators with names like Ripple and Dash have already significantly expanded on its features.\n\nForemost among those innovative competitors is Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, whose price has also spiked over the last month. Many entrepreneurs building blockchain applications are using Ethereum, so it’s likely to share in—and maybe even cannibalize—Bitcoin’s long-term growth.', 'Bitcoins traded at over $1,800 late last week, marking a new all-time high. To understand how significant this is, even in the volatile bitcoin market, the cryptocurrency’s previous record price of $1,165 took three years to topple, which happened in February this year when bitcoin traded at $1,210. That milestone has now been crushed just two months later. What’s going on?\n\nAll markets have their own complexities and odd wrinkles, but bitcoin has a special array of oddities. I spoke to a range of institutional traders, exchange owners, and informed observers of the bitcoin markets. This is the picture that emerged. It connects the dots between (are you ready?): bitcoin’s civil war; Wells Fargo and a Taiwanese banking freeze; an obscure cryptotoken known as Tether; Japanese payments regulations; an explosion of interest in the usually anemic market for altcoins; and the phenomenon known as the initial coin offering (ICO), which is being touted as a mechanism to upend traditional venture capital raising. Here goes nothing:\n\n1. Bitcoin’s “civil war” reached its zenith in March, as developers threatened lawsuits and other action in the ongoing conflict over how to upgrade the bitcoin software so it can handle more transactions. The possibility that the cryptocurrency would “fork,” or split in two, loomed. Investors started getting jittery and began looking to diversify their crypto holdings. Paradoxically, this will trigger the current bull run. Bitcoin price: ?\n\n2. The preferred vehicle for diversification was ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market. It’s seen as bitcoin’s successor in some ways, offering more powerful computational features like smart contracts. Besides, it survived one hard fork already last July, the first of several. Ethereum volumes and prices began to climb in March. Bitcoin price: ? Ethereum price: ?\n\n3. In April, one of the world’s biggest bitcoin exchanges, Bitfinex, announced problems wiring money to and from customers. It said the Taiwanese banks it used were blocking the transfers at the behest of Wells Fargo, which the banks used to move money further afield. Bitfinex sued Wells Fargo over the freeze. This coincided with Taiwan stepping up its anti-money-laundering oversight, putting high-risk bitcoin exchanges in compliance officers’ sights. Several other businesses reported problems with banking around the same time. There is an important psychological dimension to this: in the bitcoin world, when an exchange starts having trouble getting people their money, flashes of the 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, when $350 million in bitcoin vanished, come to mind. The Bitfinex news spooked the bitcoin market further. Bitcoin price: ?\n\n4. Coincidentally, a rash of new tokens—available through so-called ICOs—caught the market’s attention. April was the biggest month for ICO fundraising ever, according to research firm Smith + Crown, with about $70 million raised. Companies use these tokens to both raise funds, and provide some utility to their products once launched.\n\nFor example, one of the most successful ICOs has been Gnosis, which raised $12 million worth of ether in 15 minutes, giving it a $300 million valuation. It’s a decentralized prediction market that requires the use of its own tokens to make bets on everything from the price of bitcoin to the value of a piece of art. The proprietary tokens can also be traded on the free market—Gnosis tokens doubled in value when they were offered on exchanges. These ICOs are priced in cryptocurrency only, and it’s usually ethereum. So more money flowed out of bitcoin and into ethereum and ICOs. Bitcoin price: ?\n\n2017 is a big year for ICOs. (Smith + Crown)\n\n5. At this point, ethereum and altcoin prices are exploding. There’s unprecedented liquidity in the crypto-to-crypto markets, a big shift from earlier phases of crypto trading, where the largest currency pairs were between a coin, usually bitcoin, and a fiat currency. Historically this has meant bitcoin-US dollar trading, and bitcoin-yuan trading. Now, people were trading exclusively between cryptocurrencies. You can see this in the huge volumes at the exchange Poloniex, once a bit player because it didn’t offer any fiat currency pairs. It’s now the biggest exchange in the world, by volume, according to data site ExchangeWar. “The bitcoin-to-altcoin trading pairs are making up significant volume on exchanges … you have people with a lot of bitcoin diversifying into other things,” says Arthur Hayes, who runs the derivatives platform BitMex in Hong Kong. Bitcoin price:?\n\n6. But the sharp rise in altcoin prices appear to have caught traders by surprise. Some traders are locking in gains, but to cash out of many altcoins, you have to sell them and buy bitcoin. This means demand for bitcoin rose as traders sold alts. “Making [10 times the returns] in four months isn’t sustainable … altcoiners are euphoric,” says Alistair Milne, who manages the Altana Digital Currency Fund, based in Monaco.\n\nAs traders cash out, bitcoin is now acting like the “reserve currency” of the cryptocurrency world. “Bitcoin is the central point of liquidity,” says Charles Hayter of data site CryptoCompare. “It has more tributaries in this whole delta system. People are moving in and out of the more risky cryptos, saying, ‘yes, let’s pull back into bitcoin’.” Bitcoin price: ?\n\nThe value of all cryptocurrencies in circulation have boomed. (CoinMarketcap)\n\nPut those events together, and you get an explanation for the surging altcoin and bitcoin prices. In addition, there are a few extra factors that help explain the price boost:\n\nJapan adopted legislation that recognized bitcoin as a commodity, paving the way for new financial products from big banks, like this interest-bearing bitcoin account.\n\nThe Taiwanese banking troubles also distorted prices on Bitfinex, because users who wanted to get their money off the exchange had to buy bitcoin to cash out. This bid up the bitcoin price on Bitfinex, which is seen in the price premium there: bitcoin is about 7% more expensive there than on other exchanges.\n\nThe Bitfinex issues also created a Taiwanese arbitrage play. One route out of Bitfinex was to buy bitcoin, move the coins to Poloniex, and buy a token called Tether there. Tethers were designed to be pegged to the US dollar, so each Tether is worth one dollar. But the peg crumbled in late April and Tethers started to trade at a discount to their face value on exchanges. However, those with Taiwanese bank accounts reported that they were able to redeem Tethers at face value, and extract fiat currency into their accounts. This created a lucrative arbitrage opportunity: buy Tethers at a discount, and redeem them at face value, earning seven or eight percentage points in the process.\n\nThere’s also a technical reason to be bullish about bitcoin. Its closely related cousin, Litecoin, upgraded its transaction capacity with a soft fork last week. The upgrade—known as “segregated witness”—is the same solution being proposed by one camp in bitcoin’s civil war. The execution on litecoin gives bitcoiners confidence that it could work on the grand-daddy of crypto coins.\n\nThe sources I spoke to also broadly agreed on two things: The cryptomarkets are in a huge bubble, and they are waiting for it to pop. Also, Bitfinex may be having banking trouble for now, but it’s unlikely to go through a Mt. Gox-style meltdown.\n\nSo the next time someone asks you why the price of bitcoin is going crazy, you’ll have a plethora of answers ready for them.\n\nRead this next: Bitcoin’s civil war threatens to blow up the cryptocurrency itself', 'On a recent episode of The Bitcoin Podcast, Litecoin creator and Coinbase Director of Engineering Charlie Lee spoke with co-hosts Corey Petty and Marcello Milteer about the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) on Litecoin. During the discussion, Lee shared his thoughts on the important role of miners in the activation process for protocol upgrades, which he referred to as “silly”, but he also clarified that it’s still the safest option available.\n\nActivating SegWit on Litecoin\n\nFor Lee, getting Litecoin miners to agree on the activation of SegWit seemed like a simple enough task; however, it proved much more difficult than he initially thought.\n\n“I thought the miners would all agree that, after being so boring for so many years, SegWit seems like an obvious choice to add to Litecoin to improve things, but that turned out to be a little bit harder to convince all the mines and pools to do it,” Lee told The Bitcoin Podcast.\n\nAccording to Lee, it was difficult to sell SegWit to some members of the Litecoin ecosystem because it was originally sold as mainly a scaling solution in the Bitcoin community. From his view, miners did not realize all of the secondary benefits, such as the Lightning Network and Confidential Transactions, that are also enabled by SegWit.\n\n“A lot of people didn’t realize what SegWit actually came with,” said Lee. “It’s a huge improvement for Bitcoin and Litecoin. Miners didn’t understand that.”\n\nAccording to Lee, Bitcoin politics also caused issues for the activation of SegWit on Litecoin because some Litecoin mining pools also run Bitcoin mining pools. Lee claimed that some Litecoin miners or pools explicitly told him that they did not want to activate SegWit on Litecoin because it could possibly undermine their position against developers who contribute to Bitcoin Core.\n\n“That was a political battle I didn’t expect,” said Lee.\n\nLee went on to say that he and other members of the Litecoin community had to prove to the Litecoin mining pools that SegWit was desired by both users and miners.\n\n“Even though [the mining pools] may not care about making a little bit more money on Litecoin, the miners actually care and the users care, so it puts pressure on the pools to do what their miners and users want,” said Lee.\n\nAccording to Lee, he was first able to convince a miner with around 10 percent of the network hashrate to start signaling for SegWit. Lee then also convinced F2Pool chief administrator Wang Chun to do the same. From his view, that is what got the ball rolling in terms of SegWit activation on Litecoin because the Litecoin price then became correlated with the prospects of SegWit activation on the network.\n\nThe Problems with Miner Signaling\n\nBased on Lee’s experience, he believes the use of miner signaling for the activation of soft forks, as outlined in BIP 9, definitely has its drawbacks.\n\n“In some sense, it’s just the pools that are in control,” said Lee. “From what I know, miners don’t really care too much. They obviously want their mining to be worth more, but most of them are blindly just buying equipment and mining bitcoins and not really that into the scaling issue or SegWit activation.\n\n“For a lot of miners it’s more just like business; they may not even believe in cryptocurrency. They see an opportunity to make money; they put in some investment.”\n\nWhile Lee clarified that this business-focused viewpoint does not apply to all miners, he added that it’s the point of view for “quite a few” of them. As a related note, Lee pointed out that miners were not immediately flocking to SegWit-supporting mining pools once it became obvious that the prospect of SegWit activation on Litecoin was having a serious effect on the price.\n\n“This whole miner signaling or miner voting for protocol changes is kind of a silly idea to begin with because miners — they’re getting paid to mine right,” said Lee. “They’re getting paid to secure the network. That’s their job, and they get paid for that. They don’t know too much about the protocol, so asking them to make the decision whether or not to do SegWit versus [Bitcoin Unlimited] versus Flexible Transactions or what not — it seems silly that they’re making the decision.”\n\nLee added that some miners claimed to not want to make any protocol decisions at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong back in 2015, but he also stated, “These days, it seems like some the miners and pools are kind of — they now realize how powerful being able to make this decision is, and they’re taking advantage of that.”\n\nA Better Method for Protocol Upgrades?\n\nIn terms of alternatives to BIP 9, Lee mainly discussed the idea of a\n\nuser-activated soft fork. When first discussing the idea of bringing SegWIt to Litecoin, Lee noted that it will definitely come to the alternative cryptocurrency if it’s something that everyone wants.\n\n“I was never really in doubt that SegWit would activate on Litecoin,” said Lee. “It’s just a matter of when and how — whether it’s through miner-activated BIP 9 or it’s user activated, which could take longer.”\n\nLee went on to explain how a user-activated soft fork would work from his point of view.\n\n“If users all want it, then exchanges would just run this code that would activate this feature after a year or a certain amount of time, and wallets would all run this code,” explained Lee. “After a year, it would just work because SegWit is a soft fork and it’s opt-in. If you don’t want to use SegWit transactions, you don’t have to, so it’s not really hurting anyone to have it in there.”\n\nLee also pointed out that there have been user-activated soft forks initiated on Bitcoin in the past by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen. From this perspective, Lee says miner-activated soft forks are a relatively new idea.\n\nIn addition to a user-activated soft fork, Lee also pointed out that a user-activated hard fork could be used in a situation where miners were being especially malicious. Although not mentioned by Lee, these sorts of proposals oftentimes come with a change in the proof-of-work algorithm, which would destroy the investment made by mining companies in specialized mining hardware.\n\n“If everyone wanted it and miners are really blocking it, then you hard fork away,” said Lee. “If user [activation] doesn’t work, then you do something drastic like a hard fork.”\n\nWith all this said, Lee concluded, “It’s nice that we were finally able to convince the miners and pools to signal and activate [SegWit] via miner activation because that’s like the safest way forward.”', ""The global ransomware cyber-attack that targeted tens of thousands of computers in 100 countries and crippled NHS systems appears to have raised just $20,000 (£15,500) for the criminals behind it, experts working with investigators have told the Guardian.\n\nTom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a company that identifies illicit activity involving bitcoin and provides services to most major law enforcement agencies in the US and UK, said that at least three bitcoin addresses have been identified as being associated with the malware used in Friday’s worldwide attack.\n\n'Accidental hero' finds kill switch to stop spread of ransomware cyber-attack Read more\n\n“Everyone’s efforts at the moment are being focused on getting relevant malware and getting systems up and running again,” Robinson said. “In terms of identifying the attacker, what we can see at the moment is that around $20,000 worth of ransoms have been paid to these addresses.\n\n“There are actually two versions of this malware, there was one that appeared in April and we’ve identified one bitcoin address associated with that, and there’s a second version which appeared on Friday and we’ve identified three bitcoin addresses associated with that.\n\n“These three addresses have received 8.2 bitcoins to date, which is about $14,000 dollars, and all of those bitcoins are still within those addresses. The ransomer hasn’t withdrawn any of the funds yet so there’s no opportunity to trace them.”\n\nThe unprecedented attacks, using software called WanaCrypt0r 2.0 or WannaCry, exploits a vulnerability in Windows. Microsoft released a patch – a software update that fixes the problem – for the flaw in March, but computers that had not installed the security update were vulnerable.\n\nOn Friday, British law enforcement agencies said they believed the attack was criminal in nature, as opposed to a cyber-attack by a foreign power, and was being treated as serious but without national security implications.\n\nAmber Rudd, the home secretary, said on Saturday that the government was not yet able to say who was behind the attack. “That work is still ongoing. We don’t know where it has come from at the moment. We know it has affected up to 100 countries and it wasn’t targeted at the NHS,” she said.\n\nElliptic claims to have helped deliver evidence of illicit bitcoin activity in cases involving international arms trafficking, money laundering, theft, and drug offences.\n\n“It’s not technically correct to say that bitcoin users are anonymous, they’re pseudonymous, by which I mean every bitcoin transaction ever made is recorded in this public database known as the blockchain,” Robinson said. “What we don’t have recorded are any identities, so we can see that bitcoins are going from address one to address two, but we don’t know who controls those addresses by default.\n\n“What we do as a company is we add identities to those addresses, so for example we can say that address belongs to a bitcoin exchange, that address belongs to a bitcoin ransomer, and you can then actually build up a very clear picture of who is transacting with whom.”\n\nInvestigators can often identify who is transacting because of when they transact through the gateways, in and out of bitcoin, Robinson added. “So if you want to obtain bitcoin you need to go to a bitcoin exchange, that exchange will usually take your identity, so if law enforcement comes to us to find out who controls this address, we look for a transaction from that address to the exchange and then they can go to the exchange and ask for that person’s identity”.\n\nWhether the exchange is obliged to give the identity to law enforcement is “a bit of a grey area”, he added. “Bitcoin exchanges are unregulated in Europe at the moment. The EU is putting efforts behind regulating bitcoin exchanges but we’re not quite there yet.”\n\nLuke Wilson, who recently joined the investigators from the FBI, where he constructed the first inter-agency taskforce for investigating illicit uses of virtual currency, said investigators had to “follow the money”.\n\n“Law enforcement have different powers, in the US they can issue a subpoena to bitcoin exchangers, and also the ones in the US are very compliant, they will see something like this and they would probably reach out to law enforcement and say we have over 20, 30, 40 victims that are paying into this ransomware scheme,” he said, adding that a lot of law enforcement agencies work with each other around the world because of cybercrime, so US agencies would be able to share information with UK ones.\n\nNHS left reeling by cyber-attack: ‘We are literally unable to do any x-rays’ Read more\n\n“For investigators, the first step is gathering the different bitcoin addresses and start watching the payments, to understand how this operation is working,” Wilson said. “Secondly you’d have to go out and get a sample of the ransomware malware, so there’s a whole other team that works on that aspect of it, and then they’ll eventually have some leads and clues, but these kinds of investigations take a long time.”\n\nRobinson said: “I wouldn’t say they would be completely untraceable, there are techniques to de-anonymise those payments, and the thing with the blockchain is the transaction details stay there for ever, so if the analytic capabilities improve in the future you can never guarantee that you wont be de-anonymised at some point.”\n\nRobinson said as things stand, it is too easy for criminals to launder their funds through bitcoin and recommended that some basic controls like customer due diligence requirements would go a long way to mitigating this risk. “But it’s difficult for regulators to act in an area where the technology is evolving so quickly. It’s appropriate that they don’t rush in, I think regulators in the US rushed in a bit too early and they’ve kind of stifled the industry.”"", 'Bitcoin price surged higher above $1800 against the US Dollar, and the current movement in BTC/USD looks very bullish for more gains in the near term.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price after a dip towards $1160 against the US Dollar found support and bounced sharply.\n\nA monster bullish trend line with support at $1660 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX) acted as a barrier for sellers.\n\nThe price bounced sharply and currently trading above the $1800 level.\n\nBitcoin price surged higher above $1800 against the US Dollar, and the current movement in BTC/USD looks very bullish for more gains in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Price Trend Line Support\n\nIt was a nasty week for Bitcoin price, as it continued to gain momentum above $1700 against the US Dollar. My view of continuing gains in BTC is playing well. Recently, the price traded close to the $1910 level from where a correction was initiated. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1510 low to $1905 high.\n\nOn the downside, a monster bullish trend line with support at $1660 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD was waiting. It acted as a barrier for further declines below $1650 and pushed the price back higher. There was also a test of the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1510 low to $1905 high. The price is now back above the $1800 level. It looks like a correction wave is over, and the price may soon retest the last swing high at $1905.\n\nIf all goes well, there is a chance of further gains above $1900. On the downside, we have two bullish trend lines at $1660 and $1610, which may continue to act as a support. The overall trend is bullish with a chance of BTC/USD testing $2000.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is currently gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now back above the 50 level and heading north.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1660\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1900\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Bitcoin itself, however, is still struggling with legitimacy and regulation issues. Just this week, the fact that bitcoin was chosen as the payment method for the latest round of global data ransomware attacks, WanaCrypt0r 2.0 malware, has underscored the negative perception that still swirls around the cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nOn the most recent episode of Epicenter, co-hosts Brian Fabian Crain and Meher Roy interviewed Peter Van Valkenburgh, Director of Research of Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing decentralized financial networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. During the interview, Van Valkenburgh explained how Bitcoin is currently dealing with its branding issue; how Coin Center is laying the groundwork for future discussions about Bitcoin regulation; and how more mainstream uses of the technology would be helpful for discussions around regulation.\n\nBitcoin’s Branding Issue\n\nVan Valkenburgh noted how Coin Center has struggled with the issues around Bitcoin as a brand, as many in the mainstream associate the digital currency with the collapse of Mt. Gox and drug sales on darknet markets.\n\n“We take a lot of meetings with congressional staff, we take meetings with regulators at [the United States] Treasury, and oftentimes we can’t take credit for those meetings because a congressman doesn’t want it, necessarily, to immediately hit the news that he’s meeting with the Bitcoin people,” said Van Valkenburgh.\n\nFrom Van Valkenburgh’s viewpoint, networks like Bitcoin are used to “decentralize power” and push security to end users’ devices. “That means you lose the choke point for regulation because the choke point for regulation is the bank, the choke point for regulation is the centralized intermediary,” he explained.\n\nVan Valkenburgh went on to note that, since control over these networks is pushed to the edges, the technology can potentially be used for illicit activities.\n\nLaying the Groundwork for a Future Debate\n\nOne of the illicit activities that regulators and journalists sometimes associate with Bitcoin is terrorism. Although there haven’t been any major terrorist attacks funded through Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency up to this point, that we know of, Van Valkenburgh pointed out that it’s “possible that one day somebody will use these networks in a meaningful way” to finance that sort of activity.\n\nAccording to Van Valkenburgh, one of Coin Center’s main goals is to prepare for the potential conversation that would take place within government in the aftermath of such an event.\n\n“What will be the government response when this tool is used in a way that a lot of people get upset about?” asked Van Valkenburgh. “Our metric of success, I think truly, would be a reasonable response to clear evidence of illicit uses of the technology — like dangerous, illicit uses of the technology.”\n\nFor Van Valkenburgh, success for Coin Center in such a scenario would mean the prevention of a push for an instant ban of Bitcoin and other related technologies, along with software developers not getting arrested as part of the process. Coin Center is effectively laying the groundwork to make sure these future conversations remain reasonable.\n\n“This is a technology and, just like all technologies, it can be used for good and for evil,” said Van Valkenburgh. “We are not, as Americans, in the business of banning technologies. We’re not in the business of banning speech.”\n\nMore “Legitimate” Use Cases Needed\n\nGoing back to the aforementioned branding issue, one possible way to improve the outlook on Bitcoin from a regulatory perspective is to create more mainstream use cases for the technology. This point was originally brought up by Crain.\n\n“If you have stuff where there is 50 million users and they are like, ‘This thing is great. It really makes something possible that I couldn’t do before. It’s a totally legitimate thing, and this is amazing.’ It would be so much harder if it’s still this kind of fringe thing,” said Crain.\n\nVan Valkenburgh agreed with Crain’s assessment and continued, “You need the legitimate use cases to emerge. You need to show that you’re making a positive impact on the world — that it’s not just a bunch of people getting rich off of token sales or people using underground drug markets.”\n\nVan Valkenburgh added that Coin Center hopes to clear the way, at least from a regulatory perspective, for these sort of mainstream applications to appear. “The longer we go without more mainstream, legitimate uses, the more danger we’re in,” he added.\n\nAs far as mainstream uses of Bitcoin today, Van Valkenburgh pointed to the financial autonomy enabled by the technology, and he identified WikiLeaks’s use of Bitcoin to get around a financial blockade back in 2011 as a specific example. However, Van Valkenburgh also added that this example has become more politically charged since allegations of WikiLeaks working directly with Russia have appeared.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Virgilio Lizardo Jr, head of international for Bitbank Group (owners of BW pool), describes the language barrier between China and the English-speaking world as ""immense"", leading to a dialogue blighted by miscommunication.\n\nOne significant effect of this divide, Virgilio emphasized, is that due to the lack of Chinese presence on English-speaking bitcoin forums, stereotypes of Chinese miners continue to proliferate.\n\nThe sentiment is echoed by perhaps the most well-known Chinese miner of them all, Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, the operator of AntPool.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""A lack of a common discussion field has allowed for the creation of an echo-chamber in the technical community outside China, where the voice and interests of the Chinese miners are misunderstood and not represented.""\n\nNature of the problem\n\nLizardo, a transposed Westerner with a strong sense of Chinese culture, noted that one overlooked issue is that the miners have no obvious media outlet to get their position across, leading to distorted narratives and the compounding of mistrust.\n\nHe further emphasized that there is a tendency to group the Chinese miners together as a single ""monolithic entity"".\n\nHowever, their visions for the future are predictably diverse. While Wu is an open supporter of Bitcoin Unlimited, positions toward the scaling debate vary enormously across the miners.\n\nAsked for his opinion, Tyler Xiong of Bixin, formerly HaoBTC, argued the importance of maintaining a single implementation of the protocol and a healthy community, stating: ""We don\'t want the breakup of bitcoin"".\n\nThis is contrary to Wu, who commented:\n\n""I believe multiple implementations are healthy for the bitcoin ecosystem.""\n\nBusiness priorities\n\nWu also stressed that it is important to recognize that the mining operations in China and elsewhere are businesses, each with their own agenda and strategies.\n\nAccording to Wu, while there is a general consensus among miners that bigger blocks are needed, ""most miners prefer to stay away from the discussion"" and focus on the daily operation of their businesses.\n\nAs is well-known, information about the actual, day-to-day mining operations in China are hard to come by. Occasionally, we will get photographs or videos of vast-industrial warehouses packed with whirring mining machines, but not much more.\n\nOften situated in the depths of the Chinese countryside they are, admittedly, aesthetically powerful: equal parts industrial traditionalism and science fiction. Most of the miners confirmed what many have long-known about why China cornered the mining market – cheap electricity.\n\nWu, arguably the most successful mine operator in the history of bitcoin, said the most challenging part of planning a new mining farm is finding access to a low-cost and reliable electricity supply. Lizardo also reported that while constructing a mine is not difficult the ""logistics of transporting thousands of miners is challenging.""\n\nTyler painted a picture of what occurs once construction is complete:\n\n""The daily job includes 1) the installing, maintenance and repairing of miners and other facilities, and 2) monitoring the temperature in different areas of the mining farm. It requires a lot of passion because there are tens of thousands of miner at the same time and you want all of them are available 24/7.""\n\nImportant function\n\nAt BW pool, most of the labour is drawn from local communities, trained by the company to become technicians and maintenance workers. Each miner we spoke to stressed that looking after the mines was a 24-hour job, requiring constant supervision by employees.\n\nJihan highlighted this same phenomenon, stating:\n\n""You need to human resource to constantly look after the farm, you need to maintain constant and direct communication with the investors of your farm, you need to maintain the mining equipment.""\n\nThe take home across all the interviews was that mining was, at heart, a difficult, costly and time-consuming job.\n\nFurther, that perhaps in the fog of endless debates we have lost sight of the important function Chinese miners have for bitcoin’s maintenance and security.\n\nShanghai image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

05/14/2017,"['New York: It’s worth more than an ounce of gold right now, it’s completely digital and it’s the currency of choice for the cyberattackers who crippled computer networks around the world in recent days.\n\nWhen the attackers’ “ransomware” sprang into action, it held victims hostage by encrypting their data and demanding they send payments in bitcoins to regain access to their computers. Bitcoin has a fuzzy history, but it’s a type of currency that allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties.\n\nWhat is ransomware? Understanding the cyberattack that locked up 100,000 computers\n\nHere’s a brief look at bitcoin:\n\nHow bitcoins work\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who “mine” them by lending computing power to verify other users’ transactions. They receive bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with US dollars and other currencies.\n\nHow much is it worth?\n\nOne bitcoin recently traded for $1,734.65, according to Coinbase, a company that helps users exchange bitcoins. That makes it more valuable than an ounce of gold, which trades at less than $1,230.\n\nThe value of bitcoins can swing sharply, though. A year ago, one was worth $457.04, which means that it’s nearly quadrupled in the last 12 months. But its price doesn’t always go up. A bitcoin’s value plunged by 23% against the dollar in just a week this past January. It fell by the same amount again in 10 days during March.\n\nWhy bitcoins are popular\n\nBitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators — and criminals.\n\nWho’s using bitcoin?\n\nSome businesses have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage. Overstock.com accepts payments in bitcoin, for example.\n\nThe currency has become popular enough that more than 3,00,000 daily transactions have been occurring recently, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. A year ago, activity was closer to 230,000 transactions per day.\n\nStill, its popularity is low compared with cash and cards, and many individuals and businesses won’t accept bitcoins for payments.\n\nHow bitcoins are kept secure\n\nThe bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals’ greed for the collective good. A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction. The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn’t be an issue.\n\nHow bitcoin came to be\n\nIt’s a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn’t matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.\n\nAn Australian entrepreneur last year stepped forward and claimed to be the founder of bitcoin, only to say days later that he did not “have the courage” to publish proof that he is.', ""Whether you are just curious about Bitcoin and Blockchain, see your career path in Fintech, or even better want to be an entrepreneur or investor you might want to hear about what the experts predict for the future. But the future we are talking about is now, with Blockchain and digital currencies certainly leading the discourse.\n\nAt the Arctic15 Conference in Helsinki, Cointelegraph spoke to Jeff Pulver, the VoIP pioneer, Internet entrepreneur and influential figure in the modern technology area.\n\nFrom ideas to setting trends\n\nPulver is well known for discovering and popularizing Voice over Internet Protocol technology. The idea that stood behind it was simple: to help people connect. During the 90s, within the span of two years, the protocol VoIP was adopted by the world’s biggest phone companies. On a global scale, it created worldwide communication systems and also created hundred of thousands of jobs.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2008, Pulver was running a conference known as VoN (Voice on the Net). Later on, the name of the conference was borrowed for the co-title of the world’s first broadband company Vonage, literally standing for the age of voice on the net, also founded by Pulver.\n\nAll the broadband companies appearing on the market afterward were using the protocols created by Vonage and providing the services, which Pulver’s company has laid as basics. He also sensed the directions to develop business, as we now communicate more by chatting and texting, rather than calling.\n\nPulver says to Cointelegraph:\n\n“In the past, I have created my own accelerator and incubator from the profits of the conferences and also invested in others. Today, all the years later, I’m running a new event. It is not VoN anymore, it is called Monage - age of messaging on the net. We are looking at chatbots, messaging as a platform, messaging as a service, evolution of conversational web tools.”\n\nThe greatest gift for an entrepreneur is to establish something that, with time, goes mainstream. That is what Vonage did and hopefully what the Blockchain is doing now. As for Pulver, Blockchain is “the future that is present today.”\n\nEthereum to scoot Bitcoin over?\n\nReaders may notice some shift in focus over Bitcoin and Ethereum, with increasing interest of common users in the latter. Both of them are real and are key players in the digital currency market.\n\nBeing a successor, Ethereum seems to be in a slightly better position as it has an opportunity to learn from past mistakes.\n\nPulver has an explanation for that too:\n\n“Bitcoin pioneered it, Ethereum now implements it. In every industry, the pioneers “are shot in the back” as they say. The pioneers educate but when you are educating you are not selling. Ethereum should thank all the work that Bitcoin did to educate the masses on what is possible. When they educated, the generation after that will come and monetize it. So we see the wave of many waves of adoption.”\n\nIn all the ups and downs we observe now on the market, no one can take it away from Bitcoin to be a real phenomenon.\n\nPulver continues:\n\n“We are living through a very interesting phase with Bitcoin. It opens the eyes of the world on what’s possible. It creates very vast opportunities for some. But others will benefit from knowing what’s possible. Bitcoin has lived a wonderful life already and if it continues to flourish, so be it. Its existence has inspired so many entrepreneurs that have come to the field and understood that they can pursue their dreams. And some of them will be amazingly successful, so we all have to be grateful to the genius behind Bitcoin.”\n\nGiving credit to what has been done by Bitcoin to change the traditional paradigm of money and payment systems, the most important is the impact on the business world it has on a daily basis. Being open, flexible and keeping up to speed is crucial for today’s businesses. Again, as the authority source claims, if there is an opportunity, it is now.\n\nICO and integrity issue\n\nCompanies go public at different stages of their life cycle, and for startups, going ICO is the way to boost business. As an alternative way to fund a startup, ICOs will be an opportunity for many people to fund the dream they never had before. It is an opportunity for people to invest into something they would otherwise never be a part of.\n\nTogether with some humanistic aspect, it offers businesses-to-be a kickstarter to become successful. At the same time, as Pulver also highlights, ICOs would not have happened if Blockchain did not happen. If people’s minds were not open to possibilities and alternative ways to get things done.\n\nWhen society reaches the stage when digital currency is commonly used, people would need secure ways to invest it. Transparency of transactions is provided through Blockchain, however, it is not all clear about ICOs and the ways the money is collected.\n\nTechnology may need to create algorithms or protocols to secure the investments and prevent scams. The trust people manifest in funding a startup company directly relies on the image of the entrepreneur.\n\nPulver explains:\n\n“If I do the ICO for my company, it won’t be a scam. It’s the integrity that prevents scams. You know that it is Jeff Pulver, it is me, and I will have your trust and you will invest in me based on what I say. That goes back to adding soul to business: to be authentic, to be real and not to be a bot but a person - to be presentable and accountable. Allow people to invest once again in people. It’s a human team that changes the world in a positive way.”\n\nBuilding the business with a human face and sincere services is the leitmotif that took over the minds of many successful entrepreneurs and it works on the level of going digitally public, as we may see. Trust will always be a trigger for growth, no matter what money is invested in the company.\n\nDigital money to become norm\n\nWhen we talk about Bitcoin or any other digital money, we cannot help but add that it is something brand new, innovative and provides perspective. We hope it will be globally accepted and exchanged. Little did we know that Fintech insiders have been using e-currencies for almost 20 years. One of the indicators that represent the death of physical money is the decreasing use of ATMs that is happening in all developed countries.\n\nFor the past twenty years, people have been making online transactions on their mobile phones more frequently, to the point in which we do not need cash any longer. We have bank accounts to make transactions and we do not need physical cash to carry around.\n\nPulver notes:\n\n“If you ask me about the future, I think the future is digital currency. There is absolutely no chance it won't be. So if it is inevitable that the US currency will be digital, it’s a matter of what system will be used to authenticate. If we are talking about the years 2025-2027, the world’s treasury will go all digital. I think that’s the reality and what we hold in the pockets will be antique.”\n\nThe greater discussion of digital currency is also whether it will be one global currency or many. Pulver says it is unlikely we will have only one e-currency. “I don’t believe there will be one global digital currency that will create a revolution,” he continues. “We continue having different countries, we will have different currencies. It will be, anyways, divided by border, imaginative or real.”\n\nAs far as there is opportunity, the opportunity is now\n\nNot only should technology be the driver of change but society also needs to keep up and be prepared to implement changes. When it comes to social norms, they will be the last to adapt to new conditions and to resist change. The way people see digital currency now will change within a generation, as all the transactions will go digital within no time.\n\nPulver explains:\n\n“If the US dollar, British pound and Euro go digital, what does this really mean? How does that affect the world trade balance? How does that affect payments? How does that affect our culture? Today we are born into the world that was already pre-existing before we were born so we except the norm. I believe there is a chance to break the norm. And I do think, at least for the next 10 years, people will be creating currencies. 15-20 years from now people will not talk about why they don’t do it [use digital currency]. It's all gonna be part of the norm. So, as far as there is an opportunity, the opportunity is now.”\n\nPeople change the way they communicate, the way they spend money and the tools to do it. For “Generation Z,” the new world will all seem common, nothing outstanding and new types of leadership will be formed.\n\nPulver says to Cointelegraph:"", 'A global ransomware attack derived from a leaked NSA tool successfully breached into 100,000 computer systems and servers across 99 countries. During the first day of the attack, the focus was set on Bitcoin instead, which had minimal involvement in the ransomware attack, rather than the use of an NSA tool developed using taxpayers’ capital.\n\nWhat actually happened\n\nOn May 12, the WannaCry ransomware began to spread across the world, attacking 75,000 computers in a matter of hours. According to MalwareTech, WannaCry targeted and encrypted 100,000 computers in a period of 24 hours, quickly becoming the largest ransomware attack in history.\n\nThe WannaCry ransomware, which is also known as WanaCrypt0r 2.0, infected some of the world’s largest corporations and organizations including the National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK, FedEx and Telefonica. The malware targeted a wide range of industries including the education industry.\n\nAs a result, companies weren’t able to carry out operations and hospitals across the UK struggled to serve patients as their databases and servers became encrypted.\n\nOn May 13, Russia Today (RT) further revealed that computers at Russia’s Interior Ministry and the country’s largest telecommunications company Megafon also fell victim to the WannaCry ransomware. In an interview with RT, Megafon spokesperson Pyotr Lidov stated:\n\n""The very virus that is spreading worldwide and demanding $300 to be dealt with has been found on a large number of our computers in the second half of the day today.”\n\nWhy Bitcoin got blamed, again\n\nBitcoin was the helm of global media attention because the WannaCry ransomware demanded victims to pay ransom in Bitcoin in order to receive decryption keys to regain access to their encrypted files. Some major media outlets including the New York Times blamed Bitcoin for the WannaCry ransomware attack, emphasizing the “anonymity” of Bitcoin.\n\nObviously and evidently, Bitcoin is not anonymous in nature. In fact, in its coverage, the New York Times contradicted itself by stating that Bitcoin is anonymous but a startup called Elliptic was able to trace payments back to the accounts of the WannaCry ransomware distributors. Hence, if Elliptic was able to trace transactions or ransom payments to the accounts of the cyber criminals, Bitcoin is not anonymous and is transparent.\n\nMoreover, as Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos noted, Bitcoin had minimal involvement in the ransomware attack solely because Bitcoin was the currency of choice for the ransom payments. If it wasn’t for Bitcoin, the criminals would have used other methods that are much harder to track and trace.\n\nAntonopoulos wrote:\n\n“Ransomware attacks used the leaked NSA tools to compromise computers. News media blaming Bitcoin? Blaming Bitcoin for ransomware is exactly like blaming the duffel bag full of cash for a kidnapping.”\n\nKeep calm and buy Bitcoin\n\nHowever, after the initial day of the attack, many media outlets specifically in the UK started to offer factual and fair reports. On May 13, the day after the WannaCry ransomware struck, “How to Buy Bitcoin” features dominated the front page of major UK newspapers.\n\nNone of the UK media outlets are blaming #bitcoin. But, I\'ve never seen this many ""How to Buy Bitcoin"" features on local newspapers before. pic.twitter.com/shhI91w3Y8 — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 13, 2017\n\nAccording to analysis, the WannaCry ransomware attack spreads exponentially due to its SMB exploit and remote hijacking on vulnerable computers. Every online IP address exploited by the WannaCry ransomware can get encrypted.\n\nIt is likely that more victims will emerge in the next few days as the ransomware attack spreads ever further across the globe.', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'With a 94 percent year-to-date gain, and a single “coin” now worth $1,843, bitcoin has been on a helluva run lately.\n\nThe increase in the cost of the massively-volatile electronic tokens has led to many comparisons with that other favorite outsider “currency” — gold — recently.\n\nTrue, a unit of bitcoin passed the dollar value of one troy ounce of gold this year, and is now more than $600 higher.\n\nBut the daily swings in the digitally created asset have been vast. Even during the huge run up this year, it has moved more than five percent on 21 different days, with nine of those being moves lower. Gold on the other hand, has been much more stable.\n\nVolatility aside, there is a major problem with gold as a comparator for the software-based unit.\n\nNobody thinks comparing one share of Apple Inc. — current price around $155 — with one share of, for example, outdoor lighting company Acuity Brands Inc. — current price around $178 — is valid. It certainly does not show that Acuity, with its market cap of $7.9 billion, is worth more than Apple’s market cap of $814 billion.\n\nBy the time the supply of new bitcoins ends, sometime after the year 2110, there will be 21 million bitcoins in (digital) existence, meaning the total value of all of the electronic tokens that will ever exist, at today’s market price, is just under $39 billion. According to the World Gold Council, total gold stocks amount to approximately six billion troy ounces, or $7.3 trillion at today’s price.\n\nTo put it another way, in order for bitcoin to be worth more than gold, one ‘coin’ would have to trade at $347,000 in order for ‘bitcoin worth more than gold’ to be a defensible statement.\n\nMust dash now, one bitcoin is about be worth more than one aluminum future…\n\n© 2017 Bloomberg', 'Repercussions Continue From Global Ransomware Attack\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Schiefelbein/AP Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nThe ransomware attack unleashed on Friday has affected more than 100,000 organizations in 150 countries, according to Europe\'s law enforcement agency Europol on Sunday.\n\nThe malware, which locks files and asks for payment to unlock them, hit businesses and institutions across the world, including shipper FedEx, train systems in Germany, a Spanish telecommunications company, universities in Asia, Russia\'s interior ministry and forced hospitals in Britain to turn away patients.\n\nMore than 200,000 people around the world have been affected by the malware, Jake Cigainero reports for NPR\'s Newscast.\n\n""The recent attack is at an unprecedented level and will require a complex international investigation to identify the culprits,"" Europol said in a statement.\n\nAs employees return to work on Monday and turn on their computers, the number of infections could rise, the agency said.\n\nThe malware, which has been called multiple names including WannaCry, Wanna Decryptor or WannaCrypt, creates a pop-up window informing users that their files are encrypted and are no longer accessible — without a payment. Screenshots of the malware show an initial request for $300 to be paid in bitcoin, with a timer that says the ransom amount will rise if it\'s not paid within a certain time frame, and files will be lost after that.\n\nThe hacker\'s total take from the global outbreak, however, appears to be much smaller than anticipated. Security researcher Brian Krebs wrote that as of Saturday, evidence showed about $26,000 in payments to the bitcoin accounts associated with the malware. ""One of the nice things about Bitcoin is that anyone can view all of the historic transactions tied a given Bitcoin payment address. As a result, it\'s possible to tell how much the criminals at the helm of this crimeware spree have made so far and how many victims have paid the ransom,"" Krebs writes.\n\n""A review of the three payment addresses hardcoded into the Wana ransomware strain indicates that these accounts to date have received 100 payments totaling slightly more than 15 Bitcoins — or approximately $26,148 at the current Bitcoin-to-dollars exchange rate.""\n\nA ""sinkhole"" that saves\n\nA young security researcher in the U.K., identified only as MalwareTech has claimed credit for stemming the initial outbreak.\n\nThe researcher wrote a blog post detailing the creation of a new domain as a ""sinkhole"" for the ransomware. The malware attempts ""to connect to the domain we registered and if the connection is not successful it ransoms the system, if it is successful the malware exits,"" MalwareTech wrote.\n\nThe researcher added:\n\n""[B]ecause WannaCrypt used a single hardcoded domain, my registartion [sic] of it caused all infections globally to believe they were inside a sandbox and exit...thus we initially unintentionally prevented the spread and and further ransoming of computers infected with this malware. Of course now that we are aware of this, we will continue to host the domain to prevent any further infections from this sample. ""One thing that is very important to note is our sinkholing only stops this sample and there is nothing stopping them removing the domain check and trying again, so it\'s incredibly importiant [sic] that any unpatched systems are patched as quickly as possible.""\n\nThe ransomware exploited a security flaw in Microsoft\'s Windows operating system. Microsoft released a patch back in March, but many users and organizations had not updated their systems with the the fix.\n\nThat prediction seemed to be borne out Sunday. Cybersecurity researcher Darien Huss, whom MalwareTech credited with assisting in stopping the first outbreak, tweeted Sunday morning that a new outbreak could be oncoming, as likely copycats released an updated version of the ransomware, without the previously used ""kill switch.""\n\nWorldwide lockout\n\nAny halting of the initial spread, however, does not help with computers already infected.\n\nStudents at universities in China were locked out of their work, including dissertations and thesis papers, according to Chinese media and reported by The Associated Press.\n\nIn Germany, train operator Deutsche Bahn wrote on Twitter that signboards in stations were affected, though no train operations were affected. French automaker Renault had to temporarily shut down manufacturing at plants in northern France and Romania, Reuters reported. Among others affected, according to Reuters, include:\n\nHundreds of computers at a hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia\n\ntelecommunications companies in Spain, Portugal and Argentina\n\nsigns at malls in Singapore\n\nhundreds of hospitals in the U.K.\'s National Health Service\n\nU.K. politicians are harnessing the attacks to criticize the U.K.\'s Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May, which made cuts to the NHS system, Willem Marx reports for NPR\'s Newscast unit. The cuts made NHS computer systems ""outdated and vulnerable"" to attack, critics say.\n\n""Defence Minister Michael Fallon told the BBC that British authorities are spending more than $60 million on safeguarding computer systems,"" at the NHS, Marx adds. ""Mr. Fallon said the government had already identified cyberattacks as one of the three greatest threats to Britain\'s security, and had pledged almost 2 and a half billion dollars to protect IT infrastructure.""\n\nRansomware is big business\n\nRansomware works by hijacking a person\'s files and threatening to delete them without payment. The latest outbreak seems to be the biggest by far, though security experts have been warning about the risks of ransomware, especially to businesses, for some time.\n\nA report by IBM in December found 40 percent of spam emails contained ransomware attachments last year, up from less than 1 percent the previous year. The technology has been ""increasingly rampant since 2014,"" the study says, though the concept goes back to 1989, ""when PC-locking malcode was snail-mailed to victims on floppy disks."" The average ransom request is $500, IBM found.\n\nThe FBI said victims incurred costs of $209 million in the first three months of 2016, Reuters reported. The U.S. government says more than 4,000 ransomware attacks happen every day.\n\nThe government recommends reporting ransomware immediately to the FBI or the U.S. Secret Service, and advises against paying ransoms, saying that payment is no guarantee of recovering data, and that it only encourages further attacks.\n\nThe IBM study found, however, that seven in 10 victims end up paying to get their data back. The FBI says the typical ransom runs between $200 and $10,000. Of the victims surveyed by IBM, more than half paid more than $10,000 in ransom.\n\nThe government recommends strong prevention measures as the best defense against ransomware attacks, including: strong spam filters, making sure software is patched and up to date, using anti-virus software, and regularly backing up data.', 'Both Bitcoin and gold are considered prominent stores of value and safe haven assets. However, over the past seven years, one experienced a meteoric rise in terms of market cap, user base and value, while the other failed to live up to the expectations of its investors.\n\nAll hail the early Bitcoin investors\n\nOn May 13, StockTwits, the world’s largest financial communications platform for the investing community, revealed one of its users’ growth chart comparing various currencies, bonds and assets. In it, a StockTwits user by the name of Charlie Bilello noted that a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin made in July 2010 would have earned investors a $200 mln return.\n\nTo be exact, a Bitcoin investor who purchased $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in 2010 would have earned $201.56 mln.\n\nIn contrast, an investor who purchased $10,000 worth of gold in 2010 would have experienced a negative return of $9,981.\n\nGold is widely regarded as a safe haven asset, which by definition means an investment that retains or increases its value amidst market turbulence and economic certainty, over time. In the past seven years, gold hasn’t met either of the two descriptions. Gold has failed to sustain its value over a seven-year period and has failed to see an increase in its value. Thus, whether gold can still be considered as a safe haven asset is quite unclear.\n\nSince July of 2010, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Euro, Silver, Gold, US Dollar, bonds, global stocks, US real estate and US stocks. Naturally, its decentralized nature, high liquidity and transportability began to appeal to a wide range of investors seeking for alternative assets to protect their wealth with a long-term investment.\n\nThe perks of being Bitcoin\n\nIn many ways, Bitcoin can be perceived as Gold 2.0, or digital gold, due to its characteristics. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can sustain its value or even record an increase in its value over time because of its fixed supply of 21 mln Bitcoins. If a massive gold supply is discovered, then gold could become inflationary in terms of supply and could hinder its mid-term value.\n\nIn fact, in late March, China’s largest gold mine to date was discovered by Shangdong Gold Group, a state-owned gold producer in China. At the time, Bloomberg reported:\n\n“The Xiling mine in Shandong province told local authorities it had found 382.58 tons of gold reserves and that the volume could reach more than 550 tons once exploration is completed in two years.”\n\nMore importantly, Bitcoin’s ownership is evidently portrayed with the utilization of cryptography. Hence, Bitcoin can’t be seized by a central entity because the Bitcoin network itself is decentralized and unalterable.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin provides an important component which gold fails to offer and that is settlement network. Bitcoin as of current is often referred to as digital gold and settlement network. It isn’t necessarily perceived as digital cash as laid out by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto because of the lack of scaling and the network’s high transaction fees.', 'New consumer interest in bitcoin is trickling up into traditional retirement savings products and tax-advantaged vehicles like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).\n\nBut while a new phenomenon, cryptocurrency IRAs are no different than IRAs invested in more traditional options like stocks and bonds. Holders of IRAs can deduct contributions from their income tax every year until the commencement of disbursements, currently at 59.5 years old in the US.\n\nHowever, while there is no legal difference in an IRA account\'s status based on the investment, most popular IRA providers only allow pre-approved investments, not more unusual options like cryptocurrencies or private equity and property.\n\nAccording to data from Greene IRA, 38% of Americans use IRAs as a type of retirement savings.\n\nNew options\n\nCurrently, the firm BitcoinIRA is the only option for investors who wish to hold cryptocurrencies in their IRAs directly, using Kingdom Trust and Palo Alto-based BitGo for storage. BitcoinIRA took its first accounts in June 2016, and just recently began offering ethereum IRAs as well. (The firm even boasts former US Mint director Ed Moy as an advisor).\n\nInvestors with 401ks through their employers can transfer those funds into such IRAs under certain circumstances.\n\nDamon Smedley, a BitcoinIRA investor, who lives in Portland, Oregon, opened an account with BitcoinIRA last year. A former manufacturing engineer for a major technology company, Smedley bought his first bitcoins in 2013 and has monitored the price since.\n\nThat\'s a typical profile for early BitcoinIRA investors, said Chris Kline, chief operating officer of BitcoinIRA. But increasingly, Kline said, he has seen inquires from people who were less interested in the technology and were instead motivated by the uptrends in digital currency prices.\n\nKline told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'ve had experts and novices, 25–75 age range, an even mix of gender and a blend of reasons for looking at bitcoin.""\n\nBitcoinIRA charges a one-time upfront fee of 15% on deposits of $15,000–$100,000; 13% on $100,000–$200,000 placements and 11% on those $200,000 and above.\n\nKingdom Trust, a self-directed IRA provider and BitcoinIRA partner, also charges a custodian fee for holding bitcoins in a multi-signature wallet, enabling investors to verify funds in real-time.\n\nUptick in interest\n\nKline said BitcoinIRA has seen a surge in interest as bitcoin prices have skyrocketed. To date, the price of bitcoin has almost doubled this year: from just under $1,000 at the end of 2016 to nearly $2,000 today.\n\nConsidering this growth, Kline expects cryptocurrencies to one day be as commonly held in IRAs as stocks or bonds. Indeed, if there is one asset class well suited for retirement savings products like IRAs, it might be deflationary cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which increase in value over time. (It\'s important to note, however, not all cryptocurrencies are deflationary by design).\n\nNotably, too, ethereum has climbed 900% since the beginning of the year, and the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies has spiked 80% over the last month alone.\n\nAnother option for some IRA investors, who would like to benefit from the price increases without holding cryptocurrencies, is private placement with products offered by Grayscale Investments, a digital currency startup providing products for high net-worth investors and that works with IRA administrator The Entrust Group.\n\nFor its products, investors must be accredited, which means a net worth of over $1m or income over $200,000 in each of the last two years.\n\nBoth BitcoinIRA and The Entrust Group administer \'self-directed\' IRAs, which means the account owner is responsible for their investments, including understanding the tax consequences.\n\nThat\'s why the Government Accountability Office issued a report in January calling for more clarity on the tax consequences of less-common IRA investments so that investors are aware of the risk.\n\nFor example, the IRS classifies virtual currencies as property today.\n\nOfficials with the IRS have started compiling data on alternative investments in IRAs, including cryptocurrencies, and said in statements they plan to release findings sometime this year.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Grayscale Investments.\n\nBitcoin and money image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'The FBI wrote on its blog May 3 about a ticket selling hub that led to the uncovering of a Bitcoin laundering scheme. Charges were brought this March, and the FBI chose to recount this unique, and successful, investigation.\n\n“The beginning of the end of an Ohio man’s venture into the murky world of cryptocurrencies can be traced back to the moment investigators linked the 29-year-old to a ticket-fraud scheme nearly 2,000 miles away in California,” they wrote on their website.\n\nDaniel Mercede, from Chagrin Falls, used stolen credit card information to buy concert tickets and other events from a ticket seller in California. He then sold them through another ticket vendor, oftentimes for less than he paid, to profit from his ill gotten gains.\n\nMr. Mercede’s $420,000 in proceeds from his actions beginning 2014 were thanks to the stolen information of over 40 victims. With their identities, he applied for more than $1.5 million in loans.\n\nThings got hairy for Mr. Mercede when the victims sought the funds back. An investigation led to Mercede. The tickets had been delivered to his home address or to his parents.\n\n“A lot of the material that we got out of his apartment led me to believe there was something much, much greater going on here than a simple fraud,” according to Detective Sergeant Andy Capwill of the Chagrin Falls Police Department.\n\nThe Chagrin Falls Police Department found thousands of pages of evidence of money transfers, dozens of checking accounts, and a digital currency trading. “I realized I was going to need some help here,” said Capwill, who promptly asked for the FBI’s assistance. The Detective Sergeant had never heard of Bitcoin prior to the investigation.\n\nMercede had been acting as an unlicensed money transmitter alongside his ticket selling fraud. He made large bitcoin purchases from legitimate exchanges in Europe and China and resold them to customers locally.\n\nHis business, which he called Cryptocoin Capital Management, advertised itself as U.S.-based – one of its perks.\n\n“A lot of the time, people who want bitcoin want it now, so they will go through more peer-to-peer transactions,” said Special FBI Agent Gary Sukowatey.\n\nAn investigator on the case, Sukowatey added: “He was buying larger quantities and waiting whatever period was necessary to wait, then he would sell it to people that wanted bitcoin right away.”\n\nSans a Money transmitters license, such operations are illegal in the amounts Mr. Mercede did them. In order to process such transactions, a business must register with the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN.\n\n“You’ve got to do it the right way,” said Special Agent Milan Kosanovich, who specializes in complex financial crimes and investigated the case with Sukowatey and Capwill. “It’s perfectly fine to operate as a money exchanger for bitcoin. However, those exchangers, like other financial institutions in the U.S., have specific rules to follow to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering requirements.”\n\nCoinDesk reported that Mercede mostly purchased from exchanges like Bitstamp and Lake BTC, and sold over-the-counter (OTC) to regional customers.\n\n“Demand is really high with low prices and all the sellers that [were] holders before are actually returning buyers again right now,” he said at the time.\n\nHe claimed CCM returns averaged between 8%-15% per day thanks to his ability to buy off Chinese exchanges and selling regionally, as well as vice-versa.\n\n“I can get some crazy returns right now,” said Mercede, who spoke of a trade that September in which he bought 20 BTC at $375 and resold the bitcoins at $560 to a regional customer within hours.\n\nCCM regularly executed trades for up to 50 BTC per trade, Mercede told Coin Desk. He also said he was considering registering with the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) to add more products and services. He also told Coin Desk he wanted to…raise more cash.\n\nMercede wired for daily purchases of $10,000 and $40,000 in bitcoin. The strictest Bitcoin processors do no more than $150 per day per customer. Beginning one month before the Coin Desk article, Mercede “converted or transmitted” $1.4 million.\n\nHe was sentenced on March 21 to over six years in prison.\n\n“It’s easier for people not to do it and hope they don’t get charged with it,” said agent Sukowatey. “But as we were able to prove in this case, you can be charged criminally for not being registered.”\n\nCapwill appreciated the learning experience. He had not known about Bitcoin before the investigation. “It was a lot of information being shared back and forth between the agencies, which was really helpful,” he said. “It’s always nice to know there’s somebody out there on the other end of the phone that can help you.”\n\nIt’s important to remember in this crime, there were indeed victims. Prosecutors drove this point home in the trial of Mercede, who was 29 when he faced the charges.\n\n“Mr. Mercede was motivated solely by greed,” Acting U.S. Attorney David A. Sierleja said. “He has shown himself to be a serial scammer and identity thief who is a clear economic danger to the community. Prison is the proper place for him.”\n\n“Mercede left a wake of financial damage with the numerous unlawful schemes he engaged in,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Stephen D. Anthony. “The FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure fraudsters serve their due time behind bars instead of on lavish vacations at the expense of others.”\n\n“Daniel Mercede perpetrated a complex scheme involving identity theft and the illegal use of an unlicensed bitcoin exchange service that was driven by insatiable greed and a blatant disregard for the tremendous damage inflicted on innocent victims,” said Frank S. Turner II, Acting Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Cincinnati Field Office. “Be assured that IRS Criminal Investigation, together with our law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, will hold those who engage in similar behavior fully accountable.”\n\n“I would like to acknowledge the hard and diligent work of Detective Sergeant Andy Capwill,” said Chagrin Falls Police Chief Amber Dacek. “He really dug in to this case and gathered a good deal of the initial financial information that ultimately led to this prosecution. I am very pleased with the collaborative effort that went in to obtaining this conviction.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Prior to the 2017 French Presidential election which came to a conclusion on May 7, there has been a lot of talks around then Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and her mid-term strategy to detach France from the European Union (EU). Emmanuel Macron, the current president-elect who defeated Le Pen in the second round of the election, proceeded his campaign with expressing his strong support toward keeping France in the EU.\n\nSeveral analysts suggested that Le Pen’s election could bring about a massive influence on bitcoin price and create surging upward trend in the short-term, considering that if elected, Le Pen would have urgently pushed for Frexit, the country’s exit from the EU. As seen in the effect of Brexit in Britain’s finance and fintech industries, analysts predicted that France’s potential exit from the EU with Le Pen as President would lead to a massive upward trend for bitcoin price.\n\nOn May 7, Emmanuel Macron secured a decisive victory over Le Pen, successfully obtaining 66 percent of the votes and as a result, the one-month long deliberation of Frexit came to an end.\n\nHowever, during the election period, which lasted for 14 days from April 23 to May 7, some analysts including Willy Woo, the moderator of cryptocurrency investment data provider Woobull, claimed that the election of Le Pen and her strategy to take France out of the EU would have led to a significant alteration to bitcoin’s short term price trend.\n\nTheoretically, a Frexit would have led to a domino effect throughout Europe and EU, similar to the effect the election of current US President Donald Trump had on international markets including Australia and South Korea.\n\nTrump’s election did demonstrate a significant impact on bitcoin’s price trend. Investors and traders moved on to bitcoin and bought the digital currency as a safe haven asset to protect themselves from potential economic uncertainty and financial instability. In a relatively short period of time, bitcoin volumes and price surged, which maintained for several months after the election.\n\nThe US election had a large effect on bitcoin price due to its connection to the Chinese and South Korean markets. The US itself operates the second largest bitcoin exchange market with a 25 market share over the global bitcoin exchange market and South Korea and China hold approximately 15 percent of the global bitcoin exchange market share. Hence, the election of Donald Trump affected 40 percent of the global bitcoin exchange market and led to a mid-term surge in bitcoin price.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, Europe in contrast holds only 7.6 percent of the global bitcoin exchange market share. The bitcoin trading volume of all European countries is smaller than that of the Chinese bitcoin exchange market, which is still behind Japan and the US.\n\nThus, even under the assumption that the initiation of Segwit would have had a domino effect throughout Europe and the EU, the impact of Frexit would have been minimal on bitcoin price in consideration of current circumstances.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
05/15/2017,"['Behind the rise of ransomware lies the rise of Bitcoin, the virtual currency of choice for hacker blackmailers who steal huge amounts of sensitive data. That doesn\'t mean Bitcoin is inherently to blame, but it does suggest that business has a Bitcoin problem. Buying the currency has become a form of short-term protection, however dicey, against attacks.\n\nRansomware\'s Currency of Choice Bitcoin\'s rise has been underpinned by companies hoarding the virtual currency, studies say Source: Bloomberg data for Bitcoin Tracker EUR, a Sweden-listed ETN that tracks returns of Bitcoin\n\nThe logic is twisted but tempting. Hoarding Bitcoin to pay off hackers may seem a better option for companies that either don\'t or can\'t make the heavy investments needed to see off the attacks in the first place.\n\nPaying ransoms certainly isn\'t considered best practice in IT security circles. And that\'s putting aside the principles of supporting criminals. But if you fall prey to a ransomware attack, there aren\'t many options, especially if you have no data backup. One Los Angeles hospital reportedly paid about $17,000 to hackers to restore its computer systems last year.\n\nHopefully, the global outrage over WannaCry, which hit more than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries, will nudge CEOs into trying something more than just playing along with the hackers. A study by Citrix Systems Inc. last year found one-third of British companies were hoarding digital currencies for future ransomware payoffs. It also found that one in five medium-to-large businesses didn\'t have any broader contingency measures in place for this kind of attack.\n\nAnd it\'s not as if cyber-criminals offer guarantees. One in three Australian companies that pay off attackers don\'t get their data back, according to Telstra Corp Ltd.\n\nRansomware\'s Rise Number of attacks tracked by specialist insurer Beazley in its portfolio Source: Company filings\n\nUnfortunately, with even blue-chip companies such as ArcelorMittal and Kering identifying ransomware as a risk in their annual reports, finding an alternative that works is neither easy nor cheap.\n\nWhile Europol says ""remarkably few"" payments have been made in response to WannaCry, recent data suggest ransomware attacks are soaring -- as is their cost. The first half of 2016 saw a doubling of ransomware attacks versus all of 2015, according to specialist insurer Beazley Plc. It found finance firms with yearly revenue below $35 million were among the top targets. These companies won\'t have the deepest pockets to fight cybercrime. The mix of damages and related costs from ransomware is seen topping $1 billion a year, according to one estimate.\n\nSo it won\'t be easy to break the cycle feeding such attacks: victims willing to pay up, and hackers responding to that opportunity. The price of Bitcoin fell on Friday, as traders weighed the chance of tighter regulatory scrutiny of what is a crucial enabler of ransomware. But it has already recovered some of the losses.\n\nBitcoin\'s rise to record heights just increases the temptation for criminals, while the purchasing of the crypto-currency by businesses looking for insurance is almost certainly fueling its rise.\n\nBitcoin In Ransomware Spotlight The virtual currency\'s price has recovered some of its losses as the WannaCry attack unfolds Source: Bloomberg data for Bitcoin Tracker EUR, a Sweden-listed ETN that tracks returns of Bitcoin\n\nTougher sanctions against companies with meager data protection may force them to find better ways of tackling this. Yet technology is only part of the answer. Humans need to up their game too through better training and organizational awareness.\n\nWith people often the weak spot in cyber-defenses, this is easier said than done. For now, Bitcoin will keep filling company wallets and hackers\' pockets.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story:\n\nLionel Laurent in London at llaurent2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nJames Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net', ""The latest movies in the Disney franchises “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “Cars” are set to hit the big screen this summer, but Disney CEO Bob Iger is reportedly warning that hackers are holding an unreleased Disney film for ransom, to be paid in Bitcoin.\n\nRead more\n\nDuring a town hall meeting on Monday with American Broadcasting Company employees in New York City, Iger revealed that hackers may have stolen an upcoming, unreleased Disney film. Iger said that the hackers have threatened to release the movie, piece by piece, unless the company agrees to pays a large ransom in Bitcoin, numerous sources told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co chief reportedly said that the hackers are demanding “a huge sum” in Bitcoin and are threatening to release parts of the film, starting with the first five minutes, followed by subsequent 20-minute segments until the ransom is paid.\n\nDisney’s next two upcoming major movies are “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” which is scheduled to open on May 26, and “Cars 3,” which is scheduled to open on June 16.\n\nIger has not revealed which film was reportedly stolen. However, a report from Deadline claims that the hackers stole the fifth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The film series has netted the studio over $3.72 billion to date, according to Deadline.\n\nLast month, an anonymous hacker or group of hackers, going by the name TheDarkOverlord (TDO), released the first 10 episodes of the fifth season of the Netflix show, “Orange is the New Black” on Pirate Bay, a popular file-sharing site. The show is officially set to be released on June 9.\n\nWho is next on the list? FOX, IFC, NAT GEO, and ABC. Oh, what fun we're all going to have. We're not playing any games anymore. — thedarkoverlord (@tdohack3r) April 29, 2017\n\nTDO claims that the first episode was released after Netflix was “unresponsive” to their demands. They then decided to release the next nine episodes “after many lengthy discussions at the office where alcohol was present,” according to a press release from the hackers obtained by Heavy.\n\n“We figured a pragmatic business such as yourselves would see and understand the benefits of cooperating with a reasonable and merciful entity like ourselves,” the hackers continued. “And to the others: there's still time to save yourselves. Our offer(s) are still on the table – for now.”\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the same hackers were behind both attacks, the TDO Twitter account that took credit for the Netflix hack has not mentioned anything about the unreleased Disney film.\n\nHowever, the account has tweeted that they have obtained unreleased material from ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC.\n\n“Who is next on the list? FOX, IFC, NAT GEO, and ABC. Oh, what fun we're all going to have. We're not playing any games anymore,” the Twitter account posted in April."", ""Why are hackers using Bitcoin?\n\nThe digital currency Bitcoin has emerged as a favorite tool for hackers demanding a ransom for a simple reason: You can start accepting Bitcoin anywhere in the world without having to reveal your identity.\n\nFor criminals, this makes Bitcoin much more attractive than systems like Western Union, which generally require customers to provide identification before opening an account and receiving transferred money.\n\nHow do you buy Bitcoin?\n\nThere are companies in most countries that will sell you Bitcoin in exchange for the local currency. In the United States, a company called Coinbase will link to your bank account or credit card and then sell you the coins for American dollars. Opening an account with Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank or stock brokerage account, with lots of verification of your identity needed.\n\nFor people who do not want to reveal their identities, there are services like LocalBitcoins that will connect local people who want to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash, generally without any verification of identity required.\n\nTo start accepting Bitcoin is even easier. One needs only to create a Bitcoin address, which can be done anonymously by anyone with internet access.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly and is determined by open-market bidding on Bitcoin exchanges, similar to the way that stock and gold prices are determined by bidding on exchanges.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Law enforcement or financial authorities can sometimes use the blockchain to track transactions among criminals. But as long as the criminals do not associate a real-world identity with their Bitcoin address, they are generally safe. Complicating matters further, there are increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin laundering services, known as tumblers, which mix large quantities of transactions together in order to make it harder for the authorities to track the transactions.\n\nWhere it can get more difficult for hackers is when they want to convert the Bitcoin they have received into a traditional national currency. Most companies that convert Bitcoin to dollars in the United States require that their customers provide identification. If a criminal registered with a company like that, it would be relatively easy for the police to track them down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there are many Bitcoin exchanges outside the United States that do not require customers to register with a real-world identity. LocalBitcoins also makes it easy to find someone in any city around the world who will meet you in person and pay cash for Bitcoin without requiring any identification — a sort of Craigslist for Bitcoin exchanges. It is also getting easier to buy goods online using Bitcoin, without ever converting the digital currency into dollars or euros.\n\nWhat’s happening with the price of Bitcoin?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been rising, and recently hit a high above $2,000. Like gold, the price of Bitcoin has always been driven by the scarcity of the digital tokens. When Bitcoin was created in 2009, it was determined that only 21 million coins would ever be created.\n\nTechnology investors have purchased coins and pushed up the price out of a belief that the tokens and the system will be a sort of global digital currency and financial network for the future.\n\nWhile real-world transactions have been slow to take off, Bitcoin has continued to be popular for black market uses like ransomware and online drug markets like the Silk Road and its successors.\n\nThe corporate world has also taken interest in the technology that enables Bitcoin, especially its decentralized financial network and the blockchain, the global ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Many banks are making big bets that real-world financial transactions will one day be run on networks similar to Bitcoin, which can operate more quickly, efficiently and securely than traditional financial networks.\n\nThere are now many competitors to Bitcoin, like Ethereum, and their value has also been pushed up by growing interest in the Bitcoin technology. But Bitcoin has remained the largest so-called cryptocurrency and is generally the one that people use to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat are the currency’s origins?\n\nBitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a shadowy creator going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who only communicated by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as likely candidates to be Satoshi, as the creator is known in the world of Bitcoin, not one has been confirmed. So the search for Satoshi has gone on.\n\nSatoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then released the software to the world in 2009. Whether it is he, she or they, Satoshi largely disappeared from view two years later. Anyone can download and use the software, and Satoshi now has no more control over the network than anyone else using the software."", 'The head of the Palestine Monetary Authority, the emerging central bank of Palestine, has revealed plans toward launching Palestine’s own digital currency.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) chief Azzam Shawwa has pointed toward a ‘digital-only currency’ as a ‘bitcoin-style solution’ for the territory of Palestine. As things stand, Palestinians have no official currency to call their own and use the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Israeli shekel and the Jordanian dinar as unofficial currencies in their daily lives.\n\nThe PMA, currently an independent public institution, outlines its vision ‘to be a full-fledged and modern central bank for an independent and sovereign Palestinian state,’ on its website.\n\nAs such, the de facto central bank does not have the means to issue its own currency as it is bound by the 1994 Paris Protocol agreement [PDF], which recommends the use of the Israeli shekel.\n\nAdopting its own digital-only currency will effectively safeguard it from Israel’s interference, Shawwa revealed.\n\n“If we print currency, to get it into the country, you would always need clearance from the Israelis and that could be an obstacle,” Shawwa told Reuters. “So that’s why we don’t want to go into it.”\n\nNotably, he added:\n\nThat [a digital currency] is something we would like to see. It will be called a Palestinian pound.\n\nShawwa also underlined the need for commodities to function as the ‘backbone of the currency’, beyond its issuance, pointing to “reserves, gold, oil.”\n\nPlans toward a digital currency, the official revealed, is a part of the PMA’s larger five-year strategy to be published before the end of 2017.\n\nThe issuance of a digital-only currency will come as a respite for users in Palestinian territories, who have seen a cold shoulder by the likes of PayPal.\n\nWhile there are is no official timeline to launch the digital currency, the defacto central bank’s head pointed to such a move ‘within five years’, according to the report. Any official roadmap toward the issuance of a digital currency could be revealed by the end of the year’s five-year strategy. As such, the authority is in the process of moving into a purpose-built central bank building in the Palestinian city of Ramallah.\n\nFeatured image of Ramallah from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'An unprecedented cyberattack swept across the globe over the weekend, but so far the majority of victims haven’t paid hackers a ransom.\n\nAfter the ransomware began infecting users on Friday, they were given 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin -- chosen by the hackers because the crypto currency is harder to track than conventional payments -- or pay twice as much. If they refused to pay after seven days, their computer would be permanently locked -- a serious problem for those who haven’t backed up their data.\n\nAs of early Monday, only about $50,000 had been paid in ransoms, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a London-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands, adding that it expects the total to rise.\n\n""The amount is indeed low,"" said Michela Menting, digital security research director at ABI Research. ""This is likely due to the fact that organizations have initiated their backup and recovery procedures.""\n\nMoreover, for those who didn’t save their data on a separate system, paying a ransom isn’t like buying something from Amazon by entering their credit or debit card information. Even though the hackers provided a helpful link for those new to paying in bitcoin, the crypto currency is a black box for most people.\n\n""If you’re presented with something that says pay this amount in bitcoin, most people don’t know where to start with that,"" said James Smith, the CEO and co-founder of Elliptic.\n\nThere are several steps. First, a person or business has to obtain the bitcoins by registering with one of the various online exchanges and going through its verification process. After that, money can be deposited into the exchange. For those living in countries that don’t have an exchange, including the U.K., money must be converted into another currency.\n\nOnce the money is deposited on the exchange, the bitcoins can be sent to the address provided by the extortionist. ""It looks like a long garbled string of text,"" Smith said. After the fee is paid, the hackers supposedly free the affected computer.\n\n""A large amount of bitcoin is actually somewhat difficult to source quickly,"" said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at bitcoin research company CoinDesk, adding it might take a few days to create an account at a bitcoin brokerage or exchange, connect a bank account, and then receive the bitcoin.\n\nOne notable difference with this attack is that the perpetrators demanded a relatively small amount of money but from a large number of people, said James Chappell, chief technology officer and co-founder of U.K. security company Digital Shadows.\n\nMore typically, he said, hackers demand one large ransom to unlock all the infected machines. ""Quite often they’re in the thousands rather than the hundreds of dollars,"" he said. ""It is unusual to see this piecemeal approach, computer by computer.""\n\nAlthough harder than tracking a traditional bank payment, hunting down the bitcoin payments will be a key way law enforcement authorities attempt to track down those responsible. It’s almost impossible to know who the perpetrators are based on the bitcoin addresses they give to victims, according to Elliptic, but once the bitcoins are moved from that address, it can be tracked, potentially helping lead to the culprits.\n\n""There are things you can do to identify the actors behind suspicious addresses or transactions,"" says Kevin Beardsley, head of business development at Elliptic, which also works with law enforcement.', 'The surge in the price of bitcoin has some worried that the world’s most popular cryptocurrency is an asset bubble in an unregulated market.\n\nBitcoin was trading close to $1,900 against the US dollar on the Bitfinex exchange on Friday, pushing the market value of digital currencies to break through the $50 billion mark.\n\nRead more\n\nAn increasing number of alternative cryptocurrencies, amounting up to 830 “alt-coins,” is boosting the speculative shift with the price of some plummeting over the past week.\n\nThe speculation among alt-coins has benefited anonymous payment systems employed by cyber criminals performing wide-scale attacks.\n\nAt the same time, growth in initial coin offerings (ICOs), which help blockchain startups to sell their tokens directly to the public to get capital without any regulatory oversight, is fueling the market, drawing attention from lawyers and economists.\n\nSome experts are worried ICOs breach existing securities law.\n\n“An ICO issues crypto tokens rather than stocks and bonds, but that’s irrelevant to the substance of the activity, which is raising capital from the general public. Capital raising activities need to be regulated to protect investors. The question is how sophisticated are these investors?” said PricewaterhouseCoopers director Ajit Tripathi, as quoted by the FT.\n\nLast week, a German central bank board member warned the public not to buy bitcoin, as the bank doesn’t recognize it as a currency, and there are serious risks of facilitating speculation.\n\nLast month, Japan moved to tighten regulations on bitcoin trading and dealing. The measure enforces bitcoin exchanges to register. This adds costs to their businesses due to the necessity to follow know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $1,743 against the US dollar at 2:46 pm GMT on Monday, retreating from record highs, according to XE Currency Charts.', '(Photo: Pixabay)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — When hackers behind a worldwide ransomware scheme insisted on bitcoin as payment, they showed this high-flying digital currency just can\'t shake its connections with the digital underworld.\n\nPerpetrators of the WannaCry cyberattack that swept the globe and more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries over the weekend demanded $300 per user to unlock the frozen devices. They wanted ransom in bitcoin, reinforcing the notion among some that the digital currency is synonymous with shady corners of the Dark Web.\n\n""Any time there is a ransomware attack for the next year, bitcoin will be blamed — fairly or not — because of this,"" says Melanie Shapiro, CEO of Case, a bitcoin hardware wallet.\n\nThose links have held back some of the commercial endeavors of bitcoin\'s advocates, who are trying to bring this currency into the mainstream. But reflective of a global boom in demand for the alternative currency, the criminal connections have done little to slow a recent rally in prices.\n\n""This won\'t help, but whether it will taint the (record value of bitcoin) is hard to say,"" says Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent, a communications protocol of peer-to-peer file sharing used to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet. ""This example was crude and the transaction path is very traceable.""\n\nCriminals are thought to favor bitcoin as a preferred form of money transfer because it is harder to track than conventional payments and easily transferable between countries because it bypasses banking systems.\n\n“Instead of using cash or check they are want to be paid in bitcoin because they believe it’s anonymous and it’s quick,” says Luke Wilson, vice president for business development and investigations at Elliptic Enterprises, a consulting firm that works with law enforcement to assist in tracking of bitcoin.\n\nCryptocurrency experts doubt the episode will badly tarnish bitcoin\'s reputation. According to CoinDesk, prices fell 6% Monday to $1,666.44. But these prices have been on a tear — a year ago, they were worth less than $500.\n\nThe currency, the digital equivalent of gold for some speculators, has been boosted by interest in alternative currencies, changes in Japanese payment regulations and a recent boom market in Korea.\n\n""We\'re in a strong bull cryptomarket,"" says Brock Pierce, managing partner at Blockchain Capital and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit aiming to standardize use of bitcoin. ""I wouldn\'t be surprised if we see a run-up to $3,000.""\n\nLinks to criminal activity have hammered prices in the past. For example, the hacking of Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, in 2014 and the related theft of consumers\' bitcoin drove down the currency\'s value by more than 80%.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\'s stigma as a favored currency of cybercriminals has undermined the ability of its advocates to introduce it to more established markets. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a proposal for the first exchange-traded fund that would track bitcoin\'s price. The SEC noted significant markets were unregulated and said it was worried the proposed ETF\'s exchange operator would not be able to address concerns ""about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices.""\n\nUnlike after the Mt. Gox crash, bitcoin prices have proved largely resilient to its links with criminal acts.\n\n""Bitcoin makes some nefarious things easier, but it ultimately makes a lot of positive things possible,"" through micro-transactions to those in need in oppressed regimes such as Venezuela and North Korea or getting funds to people without bank accounts, says Kathleen Breitman, co-creator of Tezos blockchain platform, a form of cryptocurrency.\n\nMORE:\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise and Mike Snider.\n\nFollow USA TODAY\'s San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rjm1fk', 'LONDON, May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Payza, an award-winning global payment platform, today announced that it has become the first eWallet provider to treat Bitcoin like any fiat currency. Members can now hold their bitcoins directly in their Payza eWallets, no longer needing a separate Bitcoin Wallet to perform Bitcoin exchanges to or from fiat currencies.\n\nAdditionally, Payza members can now instantly send and receive Bitcoin to and from other Payza members. The fee to receive Bitcoin is just 1.2% per transaction, which is lower than the standard Payza receiving fee of 2.9% + $0.30.\n\nMerchants who use Payza to process online payments will also have the option to receive Bitcoin as payment for their products. Previously, all payments made by Bitcoin were automatically converted to fiat currency. With today\'s announcement, merchants will have the option to retain those payments in Bitcoin in their eWallets until they choose to convert the funds themselves. Merchants will also have the option to set their prices directly in Bitcoin without setting that price in a traditional currency like U.S. dollars. However, it will still remain possible to accept Bitcoin payments that are automatically converted into fiat currency.\n\n""We were among the first online payment platforms and eWallet providers to embrace Bitcoin back in 2014,"" says Firoz Patel, Payza\'s global executive vice president. ""Even then we recognized the important role Bitcoin was set to play in eCommerce. The ultimate goal was to provide our members a secure option to store their bitcoins in their Payza accounts. So we mapped out a set of incremental steps to accomplish that goal. Today, we fulfill our promise to our members and are now able to treat Bitcoin like any other currency we deal with. This means that every Payza member can now hold Bitcoin in their eWallets, and send and receive Bitcoin throughout our network, just like they would with USD, Euros or Sterling.""\n\nPayza began offering Bitcoin services to account holders in 2014 with the introduction of Bitcoin Withdrawals, one of the easiest ways to buy Bitcoin online. Within three months, Payza then announced Bitcoin Deposits, an equally simple way to sell Bitcoin. In May 2015, Payza launched a Bitcoin payment option, which enabled merchants to accept Bitcoin as payment for their products or services. Bitcoin payments were immediately converted and settled in USD to help avoid the risk associated with Bitcoin\'s volatility.\n\nToday\'s Payza merchants will now have the choice to retain Bitcoin in their accounts or to immediately convert them to fiat currency. All purchases made by Bitcoin through Payza\'s online payment platform—unlike traditional Bitcoin payments, which are irreversible—will remain protected by Payza\'s Resolution Center, a section within Payza accounts dedicated to resolving transaction disputes between buyers and sellers.\n\n""We\'re very excited about these new features because it positions Payza as one of the best options for Bitcoin neophytes who are ready to experiment with cryptocurrencies,"" explains Patel. ""We wanted to provide a worry-free way for our members to exchange and hold Bitcoin. We feel that the services announced today are perfect for people who are interested in Bitcoin, but are intimidated by the security risks and technical knowledge seemingly required to use them.""\n\nPatel also offered insight into Payza\'s upcoming cryptocurrency projects: ""On top of the features announced today, Payza will be unveiling more Bitcoin and cryptocurrency features in the coming weeks and months. We are on track to launch full cryptocurrency exchange services, providing current and future crypto-enthusiasts the ability to exchange dozens of cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin, within their Payza accounts. We are also enhancing our Payza Card service: Payza members will soon be able to exchange Bitcoin in their Payza eWallets to instantly load their Payza Cards with U.S. dollars.""\n\nAbout Payza\n\nPayza is an award-winning payments technology company.

If you can\'t cash that value or turn it into something, then it doesn\'t do anything for your criminal business model.\n\n""In the past month alone we have trained investigators and prosecutors in over 40 countries on how to investigate Bitcoin transactions and how to link those transactions to find an individual or entity.\n\n""So, that is the risk (for the hackers) if they start to get payments coming back. It gives us opportunities to investigate and identify.""\n\nHe added that due to the notoriety of the cyber-hit, those responsible will be feeling nervous about being identified.\n\nMr Walsh said: ""If I was the person or persons who had sent this and you hit over 100 countries and you hit big players - the US, Russia, China, the UK - I\'d be nervous.\n\n""You can rest assured that global law enforcement effort will be looking at identifying the origin of this.\n\n""Whether they predicted it would go so wide, so quickly is hard to say.\n\n""The people who have done this will be sitting there thinking \'has this helped us or hindered us?\', because when you get a situation-room briefing being called by President Trump, when you get Cobra being called by Theresa May and lots of other countries around the world calling in their national investigators to look at this, then I suspect they have started to get nervous.""\n\nMr Walsh said he was not aware of anything on the scale of Friday\'s attack but that the UN has been warning ransomware poses a very significant threat for the past few years.\n\nHe stressed it should be a wake-up call for all governments and law enforcement agencies to work together to tackle the threat.\n\nHe added: ""When we see something of this scale and it is brought to attention of senior policymakers and politicians, it highlights something that has already been there and will hopefully now bring more attention to it and that it does needs a more global effort to counter it.\n\n""This shows the need for government, law enforcers and policy makers across the world, irrespective of their political persuasion or perspective, to work together to try and counter the risk.""', 'Elliptic\n\nUpdate 15.05.2017: Elliptic has released a WannaCry tracker showing the current balance of the three bitcoin addresses known to be associated with the ransomware (above). The total at the time of writing is $54,000 and counting. See the tracker here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOriginal story\n\nIt’s the biggest ransomware outbreak in history, claiming 200,000 victims in at least 150 countries – with more expected as the working week begins. But, according to bitcoin experts, the criminals who spread it have made just $49,000 from their demands at the time of writing. Although this seems like a substantial amount of money for little effort, the scale of the attack suggests the yield would be higher.\n\nTo put this into perspective, a single hack on banks in 2015 generated a yield thought to exceed £650 million.\n\nRead next Bitcoin\'s scaling problems mean it won\'t make it as a currency Bitcoin\'s scaling problems mean it won\'t make it as a currency\n\nRansomware works by encrypting a user’s files, then displaying a message demanding payment to unlock them. In the case of the NHS cyberattack, the hackers asked for $300 (£231) in digital cryptocurrency bitcoin, then gave several addresses to send the money to.\n\nA simple guide to Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies A simple guide to Bitcoin\n\nEvery bitcoin transaction is recorded in the bitcoin blockchain, which lists all the transactions between addresses. From this, it is possible to track number and total of the amounts transferred – which, at the time of writing, came to a little over $49,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“As far as we\'re aware this is how much they\'ve made from this attack, although it is possible there are addresses we\'re not aware of,” says Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, which works with law enforcement authorities to identify illicit activity involving bitcoin. “However, the ransomware addresses we are aware of tally with those mentioned online.”\n\nPayments to the addresses have been rising slowly but steadily ever since the attack. At 12:58 am on Saturday 13 May, Elliptic recorded 45 payments totalling around $15,000. By 10.30 am there were 68 payments totalling approximately $25,000. ""We expect this number to accelerate this week, especially as the first deadline for the ransomware expires, after which the ransom doubles,"" says Robinson.\n\nRead next Psychology explains why your friends can\'t shut up about bitcoin Psychology explains why your friends can\'t shut up about bitcoin\n\nElliptic has additionally been tracking a second, related, strain of ransomware, from April, which forced 16 payments, totalling $10,000, out of its victims. Taken together, the two cyberattacks have brought in around $57,000.\n\nThere are also a number of smaller payments in the account, some of which, Robinson said, could come from the criminals themselves. “Some of the payments probably aren\'t from the victims – they are very small payments, which is known as ""dusting"". This is the digital equivalent of throwing a penny into a thief\'s pocket.” (It is possible to embed messages in payments, which might be the reason for the payments.)\n\nSo far, there has been no attempt to move the proceeds. When there is, it may be possible to track where the money goes, although Robinson warned that “is very difficult,” because criminals can use a range of techniques to cover their tracks – including bitcoin ""mixers"", or tumblers, which break the connection between a bitcoin address sending coins and the addresses they are sent to.\n\nYet Elliptic, which has delivered “actionable evidence” to law enforcement agencies in cases involving arms trafficking, money laundering and drug offences, says that if the hackers are going to be caught it will probably be when they attempt to claim their ransoms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Identification usually occurs by linking the suspect\'s transactions to a bitcoin exchange, which would hold identifying information about their clients. These transfers are often seen, as the criminal will usually need to cash out at some point.”\n\nExpand your mind with WIRED\'s pick of the best podcasts']"
05/16/2017,"['Our London Correspondent Nick Ayton, the Sage of Shoreditch, reports on the WannaCry ransomware outbreak and why things don’t entirely add up.\n\nIt can come as no real surprise the source of the ransomware was the secret services of the United States – NSA. Apparently, they were also hacked and the malware that targets Windows was taken.\n\nA national security agency hacked?\n\nAs reported, the attack widely impacted many countries.\n\nI felt the brunt of this attack when I was at Essen Train station trying to get to Dusseldorf airport on Friday 12 when all hell broke loose.\n\nThe German rail network on that rare day did not run to time, yet they also didn’t admit the issue until the red outline of the ransomware sign appeared on platform screens.\n\nOf all countries, Russia and China were hit the hardest and yes the USA was hit the least with only Fedex apparently reporting an issue. With Edward Snowden mentioning the NSA could have prevented this attack there remain many unanswered questions.\n\nA ploy led by the US government?\n\nOne has to suspect this is a big ploy by the US government led by the SEC and other concerned parties to discredit Bitcoin, by association. The ransom is Bitcoin after all. Ignoring the fact the most used currency that funds disruption and bad things is the US dollar.\n\nYes, Bitcoin was chosen for payment of the ransom because it is supposedly easy to set up and is technically anonymous, but those in the community all know this isn’t true. And all Bitcoin transactions leave a trail.\n\nIs the fact the NSA could have prevented this and the fact that the US was not really impacted the biggest clue of all?\n\nThe accusations that China and Russia are hacking the world and focusing on the USA seem to run counter to what we have witnessed this weekend.\n\nMicrosoft strangeness\n\nStrange, the malware targets those computers with Microsoft, still the most widely used computer software. And yes, the most hacked given the age of some of the implementations at the UK’s NHS that run Microsoft XP, would you believe, and then the UK Government’s claim that they are investing in the NHS and hospital care.\n\nIt all seems a bit odd and doesn’t resonate with the punters that have had their operations delayed and left hanging on, stressing a system that is already creaking at the edges, the sides, the center and the core.\n\nAnd yet, these ransomware attacks and the fines being asked pale in significance compared to bank crimes by those inside and the fraudsters that attack them every day. Billions taken, lost and removed but then the money they take isn’t real money as we know.\n\nScaring people off\n\nSo, it is a ploy to discredit Bitcoin, the crypto community.\n\nA community that is now vast, growing rapidly and touching everything. A world that offers hope to the people and spells problems for those trying to keep power.\n\nIt is overwhelmingly a ploy especially given the SEC’s position as they are those who are pushing the EU and ECB to begin blocking (regulate) users of cryptocurrency, in a vague attempt to regulate it, to control it, to scare people off.\n\nYet, this isn’t the first nor will it be the last time when something of the kind comes along for the benefit of the people and not those who want control.\n\nYes they fail\n\nRemember these same authorities tried to control, regulate and influence the Internet, regulate good old TCP/IP and YES they failed after many attempts.\n\nCrypto economics is for the people, it isn’t owned or controlled and it is fundamentally liberating.\n\nIt has the potential to connect the world and give a lifeline to those disadvantaged, the poor, the less well educated.\n\nBut then the white elite don’t want this as there would be nobody to do the work and bail out the banks again as the next financial bubble hits.\n\nWith the build up of new subprime – car loans, student loans and yes housing - it will soon be upon us.\n\nCentral banks are in on it\n\nSo here is the thing, the German central bank told everyone not to buy Bitcoin because it isn’t real.\n\nA bit rich given they have allowed Deutsche Bank to be more than 40 times over-leveraged and on the verge of collapse that would bring down the euro when you consider Lehman Bros was only 30x and we know what happened them. BOOM!\n\nThey are stating, stick to the euro and dollar “to protect purchasing power.” Are they mad? These currencies are falling, devaluing because of the overuse of QE and central banks that don’t understand the current climate as their models don’t work anymore and they know these currencies will be worthless very soon.\n\nHow many central banks hold negative rates? A lot, and it is clear fractional reserve banking doesn’t work and people want answers.\n\nCrypto future is bright\n\nThe overarching strategy seems to be the authorities trying to scare people away from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, mentioning the risk, that they are not real currencies, they are the reason for ransomware and a bubble about to go pop.\n\nBut why then are most central banks, governments and larger banks involved in cryptocurrencies, investing heavily with many citing it as the future of capital markets?\n\nAre we really to believe anything the FED, SEC, EU, ECB, BoE and FSA says in the era of “fake news” or politically aligned agendas?\n\nThey know the “worm has turned,” demonstrated by Trump and Brexit effects, where the vast majority of middle classes that have been asked to close the deficits and pay for bailouts are disillusioned with decision making, have lost faith and trust in the political systems and won’t stand for the “bullshit” anymore.\n\nEnd of banking\n\nAs I have said before, the next crash will spell the end of banking in its current form. The last nail as the public won’t stand for it, as few are held accountable as nothing changes as we go from one crisis to another, and governments are apparently asleep at the wheel - with one eye open.\n\nCrypto is a new hope, an equalizing effect free from government tampering, without a concept of credit or debt where all transactions are transparent, guaranteed and auditable, leaving no room for the boys club and mates to benefit from a rising or falling market.\n\nVulnerable\n\nIt is time to buy more Bitcoin, not less, if for no other reason than organizations and governments who are now stockpiling the crypto to be able to pay ransoms, as they continue to leave their systems vulnerable and open for our personal data to be hacked and our lives altered.\n\nOrganizations run by bureaucrats whose only remit is to try to stay in power and have no clue what is really coming.\n\nI feel really sorry for those who have had operations canceled in the UK and in Russia, whose lives were put in great danger by this ransomware attack. Where the conditions and the tools to create it came from we may never know. I will let you be the judge.', 'Hackers claim to have access to a new Walt Disney movie (DIS) and are threatening to release it, should the film studio refuse to pay them a huge bitcoin ransom, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting with ABC employees in New York, Disney\'s CEO Bob Iger confirmed that the company is working with federal investigators to deal with the threat. Iger didn’t disclose the name of the film, nor the amount the hackers are seeking, but did state that the responsible party plans to release the first five minutes of the movie, followed by 20 minute segments, if Disney refuses to meet their demands. Iger added that Disney has no intention to pay the ransom.

Deadline.com reports that the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film is the one being held at ransom.\n\nNews that a major movie picture has been stolen came just one week after rumors circulated online that Disney’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi was in the hands of ransom-seeking hackers. The rumors were later confirmed to be false. (See also: Disney Shareholder Meeting Gets Political.)\n\nCyber Criminals Target Hollywood\n\nHollywood has become a prime target for cyber-criminals. Last month, hackers stole the entire fifth season of Orange is the New Black and then uploaded the 10 episodes on Pirate Bay six weeks ahead of the official June 9 launch date after Netflix (NFLX) refused to pay a ransom.\n\nMoreover, back in 2014, hackers, dubbed the ""Guardians of Peace"", demanded that Sony Pictures (SNE) cancel its distribution of The Interview, a comedy movie based on a plot to assassinate North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. The studio responded by cancelling the film\'s formal premiere and mainstream release after the the cyber-criminals threatened to launch terrorist attacks on U.S. cinemas showing the movie.\n\nSeveral Hollywood agencies, including UTA, ICM and WME, have also reportedly been targeted by hackers.', 'From Kill Switch To Bitcoin, \'WannaCry\' Showing Signs Of Amateur Flaws\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Schiefelbein/AP Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nCops have a decent shot at catching run-of-the-mill online scammers — say, the guy selling a car that\'s just too good to be true on Craigslist. But catching ransomware attackers is generally much more difficult — unless they slip up.\n\nThe criminals behind the ""WannaCry"" ransomware attack may have done just that. Experts are now seeing some amateur flaws emerging including an easy-to-find kill switch and the unsophisticated way the attackers are demanding bitcoin from their victims.\n\nThe ransomware itself, we have seen that before in the wild and it\'s not that sophisticated.\n\nRansomware ""tends to be a crime that is born on the Internet, born through kits sold on the dark web that already pre-build in anonymity of the perpetrators,"" said police detective Nick Selby, who specializes in cybercrime.\n\nThose ""kits"" Selby describes are what experts think they\'re seeing with WannaCry. Somebody\'s using software tools created by somebody else.\n\n""The ransomware itself, we have seen that before in the wild and it\'s not that sophisticated,"" said Paul Burbage, malware researcher for Flashpoint-Intel.\n\nHe says the most obvious tip-off is the fact that the malware contained an easy-to-find ""kill switch"" — basically, a URL address included in the code, which was used to stop the malware\'s spread.\n\n""The kill switch allowed people to prevent the infection chain fairly quickly,"" Burbage explained. ""It was kind of a noob mistake, if you ask me.""\n\n\n\nAnd WannaCry has other deficiencies. Sophisticated ransomware usually has an automated way to accept payments from victims who want to unlock their computers. But Burbage says WannaCry\'s system seems to be manual — the scammers have to send each victim a code. Not very practical for an infection involving thousands and thousands of computers.\n\n\n\n""It leads me to think they did not think it would spread as far as it is,"" he said. ""You know I really think these guys are running scared and they\'re probably laying low at this point.""\n\n\n\nAnd then there\'s this: So far, the scammers have collected payments from fewer than 200 victims. We know this, because they\'re demanding bitcoin — and bitcoin transactions are public. We don\'t know the scammers\' names, but we know the bitcoin addresses they\'re using to receive payment — just three addresses. Again, more sophisticated ransomware would have the ability to generate a unique bitcoin address for each victim.\n\nIt might be that they don\'t have a good idea yet about how to launder the bitcoin.\n\nSo far, the attackers have collected about $60,000 worth of bitcoins which are just sitting there untouched, according to Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, a company that analyzes bitcoin usage to identify money-laundering. He\'s been watching the bitcoins accumulating at WannaCry\'s three addresses.\n\n\n\n""It might be that they don\'t have a good idea yet about how to launder the bitcoin,"" he said. ""Perhaps they\'re not really set up to take advantage of the success of their campaign so far.""\n\n\n\nLevin says one way to turn dirty bitcoin into real-world money is to do the conversion in a jurisdiction where financial authorities will turn a blind eye. So scammers sometimes have safe-zones — usually their home country — where their malware doesn\'t do any damage. He gives the example of a very successful ransomware called ""locky,"" which favors Russia.\n\n\n\n""So if it detects Russian language on the machine, it actually does not execute and deletes itself,"" he said.\n\nWannaCry, in contrast, doesn\'t seem to be playing geographic favorites that way. Two cybersecurity firms now say they\'ve found some technical similarities between the WannaCry ransomware and earlier attacks from hackers in North Korea, though they\'re not calling the clues proof that North Korea is behind the worldwide attacks. Burbage says his company, Flashpoint-Intel, does not see a link between WannaCry and North Korea at this point.\n\nLevin says if the perpetrators actually live in one of the countries hit hard by this attack — say, Russia — that would be, as he puts it, ""an incredibly bad life choice.""', 'It’s worth more than an ounce of gold right now, it’s completely digital and it’s the currency of choice for the cyberattackers who crippled computer networks around the world in recent days.\n\nWhen the attackers’ “ransomware” sprang into action, it held victims hostage by encrypting their data and demanding they send payments in bitcoins to regain access to their computers. Bitcoin has a fuzzy history, but it’s a type of currency that allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties.\n\nHere’s a brief look at bitcoin:\n\nHow bitcoins work\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who “mine” them by lending computing power to verify other users’ transactions. They receive bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies.\n\nHow much is it worth?\n\nOne bitcoin recently traded for $1,734.65, according to Coinbase, a company that helps users exchange bitcoins. That makes it more valuable than an ounce of gold, which trades at less than $1,230.\n\nThe value of bitcoins can swing sharply, though. A year ago, one was worth $457.04, which means that it’s nearly quadrupled in the last 12 months. But its price doesn’t always go up. A bitcoin’s value plunged by 23 percent against the dollar in just a week this past January. It fell by the same amount again in 10 days during March.\n\nWhy bitcoins are popular\n\nBitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators — and criminals.\n\nIs it really anonymous?\n\nYes, to a point. Transactions and accounts can be traced, but the account owners aren’t necessarily known. However, investigators might be able to track down the owners when bitcoins are converted to regular currency.\n\nFor now, the three accounts tied to the ransomware attack appear untouched — and it’ll be difficult for perpetrators to cash in anytime soon without getting traced.\n\nHow much money?\n\nSecurity experts say the amount of ransom collected so far appears small relative to the extent of the outbreak. Tom Bossert, President Donald Trump’s adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism, says it appears less than $70,000 has been paid in ransoms.\n\nIt’s possible, though, that there are unknown accounts beyond the three identified.\n\nWho’s using bitcoin?\n\nSome businesses have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage. Overstock.com accepts payments in bitcoin, for example.\n\nThe currency has become popular enough that more than 300,000 daily transactions have been occurring recently, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. A year ago, activity was closer to 230,000 transactions per day.\n\nStill, its popularity is low compared with cash and cards, and many individuals and businesses won’t accept bitcoins for payments.\n\nHow bitcoins are kept secure\n\nThe bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals’ greed for the collective good. A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction. The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn’t be an issue.\n\nHow bitcoin came to be\n\nIt’s a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn’t matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.\n\nAn Australian entrepreneur last year stepped forward and claimed to be the founder of bitcoin, only to say days later that he did not “have the courage” to publish proof that he is.', 'Sandeep Goenka, the co-founder of Zebpay, one of India’s three leading Bitcoin exchanges, believes that Bitcoin price can reach $3,500 by the end of 2017.\n\nDespite a few setbacks, Bitcoin price has maintained a strong rally over the past few months. While Bitcoin is struggling to re-enter the $1,800 region after it experienced a correction on May 11, on a monthly basis Bitcoin price has still managed to record a 30.8 percent surge, increasing from around $1,176 on April 16 to $1,700 on May 16.\n\nAfter recording a 30 percent monthly increase in value, Bitcoin price has continued to maintain stability in the $1,700 region for around two straight weeks. Such stability in value should be considered as an optimistic outlook on the mid-term growth of Bitcoin price.\n\nGrowing demand\n\nAccording to Goenka, the current Bitcoin rally isn’t necessarily defined by certain events. In fact, Bitcoin price is able to grow at a stable rate because global awareness toward Bitcoin is increasing and the demand from institutional investors is rising.\n\nGoenka stated in an interview:\n\n“Current bitcoin rally is due to increasing awareness and demand for bitcoins globally. Positive news of regulation in major countries like China, Japan and Russia have added fuel to the current rally.”\n\nAs Cointelegraph explained in a series of extensive analytical articles, Japan has played a key role in maintaining the strong rally of Bitcoin price. Japan has also established a platform for institutional investors by announcing Bitcoin as a legal currency. Such clarity on the regulatory side of Bitcoin and digital currencies in general allowed institutional investors and multi-billion dollar corporations to participate in the Japanese Bitcoin industry.\n\nJapan’s ecosystem\n\nMost notably, the $1.5 bln Japanese Internet giant GMO announced in January that it is officially entering the digital currency trading business and market by launching its own digital currency and Bitcoin trading platform.\n\n“Just the beginning”\n\nIn a statement, the GMO Internet Group stated that it sees highly of Bitcoin’s ability to process both domestic and international remittances with low costs and fast speeds in a secure ecosystem, similar to the Bangko Sentral, the central bank of the Philippines.\n\nGoenka reaffirmed that the Bitcoin exchange market and industry will see the entrance of more institutional investors by offering an entirely new investment category in digital assets.

He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'Two unnamed Coinbase customers are seeking to stop the IRS from obtaining records on the digital currency exchange\'s user base.\n\nOn 15th May, law firm Berns Weiss LLP filed a motion seeking to quash – legal-speak for rendering invalid – the IRS summons, which it first submitted in November. At the time, the US tax agency sought records on Coinbase\'s bitcoin users in a bid to catch potential tax cheats (the IRS deemed bitcoin and other digital currencies a taxable form of property in 2014).\n\nThat effort sparked what has become a months-long legal battle that saw Berns Weiss intervene on behalf of its own managing partner, Jeffrey Berns, as well as Coinbase itself jumping into the fray.\n\nThe IRS ultimately asked another federal judge in March to enforce the summons, which Coinbase indicated at the time it intended to fight. Court records show that, on 4th May, Judge Jacqueline Corley ordered the IRS and Coinbase to propose a briefing schedule during which Coinbase is expected to mount its defense.\n\nBerns Weiss submitted the new filing on behalf of two customers, referred in the documents as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2. The filing, according to the law firm, was spurred by the Corley\'s 4th May decision and ""to insure that Coinbase\'s customers are represented in the proceeding and that the Court has the opportunity to consider their perspective"".\n\nNotably, according to a separate filing, the two customers in question are seeking anonymity. The reason, they argue, is to prevent the IRS from ""attempting to moot Movants\' motion by withdrawing its request that Coinbase provide Movants\' records"".\n\nAttorney Lee Weiss said in a statement:\n\n""We look forward to the opportunity to finally litigate the merits of the IRS Summons and for the Court to consider the grave privacy and financial risks to which Coinbase’s customers will be exposed if the summons is enforced in its current form.""\n\nA representative for Coinbase declined to comment when reached.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nIRS image via Shutterstock\n\nThe full motion can be found below:\n\nMotion\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It includes instant Bitcoin-fiat exchanges and the option to hold Bitcoin alongside fiat currency in its eWallets.\n\nThe global payment platform, whose mobile app has been made available on Apple iOS this month and downloadable from the App Store, announced the new service on its network on Monday, May 15.\n\nPayza’s joker\n\nIts focus on countries with high remittance rates could be its joker. From China to India and Mexico, the platform has a payment service already in place. This could facilitate the spread of Bitcoin in some of these countries.\n\nPayza recently launched a new funding method in China which makes online transactions in Chinese yuan available to residents.\n\nA similar service was also launched in Mexico where the peso is now made an available currency on the Payza platform.\n\nEarlier in March, it teamed up with India’s popular household utility and telecommunications service providers including Airtel, Tata Sky and Vodafone for the initial launch of its online Utility Bill Payments service for Indian customers.\n\nFiroz Patel, Payza\'s global executive vice president, stated:\n\n“Today, we fulfill our promise to our members and are now able to treat Bitcoin like any other currency we deal with. This means that every Payza member can now hold Bitcoin in their eWallets, and send and receive Bitcoin throughout our network, just like they would with USD, Euros or Sterling.""\n\nThe service enables Payza members to hold their Bitcoins directly in their eWallets without the need for a separate Bitcoin wallet to perform exchanges to or from fiat currencies. Members can also send and receive Bitcoin to and from other members instantly.\n\nNorwegians want Bitcoin\n\nThe Payza announcement comes as the largest online bank in Norway, Skandiabanken, reportedly launched a new feature - still in a beta phase - that allows customers to log into a third-party user interface of Coinbase to get Bitcoin through the bank’s website.\n\nSpeaking to E24, Head of Innovation and Development at Skandiabanken, Christoffer Hernæs, argues that more and more Norwegians are eyeing the digital currency saying they have realized that Bitcoin is something people want to put their money in and they think it is a better approach rather than perceiving it as scary.\n\nStephan Nilsson of the Bitcoin Association of Norway praises the bank’s move deeming it to be the positive signal they have been waiting for.', 'Much of the world has now heard about Bitcoin due to the global WanaCrypt0r 2.0 ransomware, which should continue spreading over the course of next week. Optics for Bitcoin aren’t great in situations like this because it furthers the notion that Bitcoin is used for nefarious means. You can follow a live feed of the incoming transactions from this twitter bot. However, the silver lining is that many people who did not know what Bitcoin is or how to use it before the attack certainly do now.\n\n\n\nWorst-case scenario for Bitcoin here would be a government crackdown on its use and distribution, which, although a low probability, is probably not a non-zero possibility considering the current administration. This would create a large down day in the market similar to when Silk Road was shut down, Mt. Gox was found to be insolvent and Bitfinex was hacked. Of course, Bitcoin the protocol would be unaffected, so the price is likely to bounce back rather quickly.\n\nThe block size and scalability debate trickles on with no current end or resolution in sight. I wouldn’t really expect a push out of the SegWit camp until October or November, when the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is set to be tabled for the time being. The number of unconfirmed transactions continues to rise on an upward trend, all the while miners who support Bitcoin Unlimited are mining empty or non-full blocks.\n\nThe COIN ETF comment period closed yesterday, which isn’t to say there will be any type of decision on the SEC’s part. This will likely be a non-event for the market considering the ETF itself will remain in limbo until further notice.\n\nTotal cryptocurrency market capitalization broke a new all-time high (ATH) of $55 billionearlier this week, while Bitcoin dropped just shy of 50 percent of that total.\n\nSome may view this as Bitcoin losing its impact and success, which can be partially attributed to the block size and scalability in-fighting. Others, like myself, view this shift as a massive altcoin bubble. Hockey stick parabolic curves on a chart like that end with large selloff candles. There is also only one Bitcoin, with a fixed supply, competing against an infinite number of altcoins, many with pre-mined or infinite supply as well.\n\nBecause of the correction late in the week, the weekly candle was threatening a bearish close with a wick longer than the candle body, but the heavy buying on Sunday prevented the bearish close.\n\nThis weekly close alone suggests continuation over reversal or sideways movement in price. Since the beginning of the trend, duration of consolidation between large upward moves has decreased. This will eventually lead to a parabolic, euphoric, blowoff top with a massive candle wick. Until then, expect more of the same. A small correction this week would just mean an even greater chance for extended continuation.\n\nBitcoin did make a new high this week of $1,868.50, according to index, and is currently drawing an “M for murder” double top. This likely represents consolidation to a further move upward and not exhaustion of trend.\n\nThis is the only chart I’m really focused on at the moment. There are plenty of potential patterns, such as head and shoulders or Adam and Eve, harmonics, and horizontal support levels here, but all that really matters is the larger consolidation pattern.\n\nThis may also represent a flag/pennant, which is another sign of bullish continuation.\n\nA more ominous double top for a bull market would have similar price structure to the pattern that formed during the ATH of 2013.\n\nAs discussed above, a serious threat of reversal shows large candle wicks on high timeframes, which is not currently the case with price structure.\n\nSummary\n\nMost of the world is now aware of Bitcoin due to the WanaCrypt0r 2.0 ransomware. The block size and scalability debate continues with large transaction backlogs in an upward trend. Based on market capitalization, Bitcoin is currently hovering around 50 percent of the total. Price remains in consolidation; once finished, expect a return to the status quo.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The dividends are offered on a monthly basis, in Bitcoin, to all Aureus token holders through the Aureus Bitcoin Trust (ABT). The Aureus cryptocurrency operates on Bitcoin's proven blockchain protocol but with superior transaction speeds at lower fees in comparison to the Bitcoin network. The cryptocurrency has a close connection with Bitcoin as the ABT is backed by a reserve of 15000 BTCs.\n\nAureus\n\nAureus is a unique blockchain based cryptoasset that derives its value from both cryptocurrency and real-world economies. Modeled on the highly successful Bitcoin protocol, AUR combines the flexibility, liquidity, and accessibility of cryptoassets with returns derived from the real-world economy.\n\nThe cryptocurrency platform's aim is to enable all types of investors from around the globe to invest in local economies via the proven power of blockchain, but this time, with monthly Bitcoin dividends issued to the holders of the cryptocurrency. This way of investing will attempt to offer investors superior returns than traditional market investments while maintaining a low level of calculated risk.\n\nAs the initial Aureus seed BTC belongs to the members of a failed community lending program, the initial distribution of AUR will be allocated to the existing community members that are contained within a closed ecosystem.\n\nLike Bitfinex' BFX Tokens, AUR is then distributed proportionately to each member in a systematic time delayed manner. The longer a member holds on to their AUR, the more AUR they will receive periodically. This would allow AUR to be introduced to the open cryptocurrency economy in a gradual manner whilst retaining the value for the community in the long term, reducing the risk of inflation or over-supply when AUR is transferred out of the community.\n\nCryptocrest manages the distribution by creating a Treasury Reserve (TR) designed to hold and distribute AUR for the community's benefit.\n\nAureus is essentially valued through the ABT, a fund initially consisting of 15,000 bitcoins held for low-risk investment. Cryptocrest's consultancy management team controls the investment strategy with a present focus on low-risk peer-to-peer Bitcoin margin lending in top exchanges.\n\nThe 15,000 bitcoins are held by a reputable independent custodian and can only be returned proportionately to the AUR owners when a majority of the owners votes for liquidation. Votes are calculated by the number of AUR each individual hold. This mechanism allows the community to decide the path of ABT if Bitcoins reach unprecedented prices.\n\nCryptocrest has already proven its experience in the regular economy, with an impressive investment management history, primarily in lending. It benefits investors in two ways as they stand to profit from not only the increase in the value of Aureus but also the value of ABT. Returns generated by the ABT are distributed among the AUR holders, providing them with multiple sources of gains.\n\nAureus Tokens\n\nThe Aureus cryptotokens are entirely pre-mined with a fixed supply of 21,000,000 AUR (21 million). However, unlike other pre-mined cryptocurrency tokens, monthly supplies of AUR will be allocated into the ecosystem until the maximum cap is eventually reached.\n\nThe platform has already issued 3,600,000 AUR (17.14%) out of the total supply to 70,000 Citizens, A Treasury Reserve (TR), formed for the stewardship of capital for the community, will receive 500,000 AUR monthly, and it will always maintain a minimum balance of 100,000 AUR.\n\nAureus Wallets\n\nAureus will offer online wallets to its Citizens, enabling them to store, send and receive the AUR cryptotokens. The wallet is available for Android-powered devices on Google Play Store. It will be made available for iOS devices soon along with a hardware wallet. The digital wallets are created using Bitlox' technology.\n\nAbout Cryptocrest\n\nThe Cryptocrest team helps clients by tackling problems together and crafting reliable solutions for their cryptocurrency business, from app development, tech architecture, financial models, marketing & PR.\n\nLearn more about Aureus at – http://aureus.cc/\n\nLearn more about Cryptocrest at – http://www.cryptocrest.com/\n\nAureus Press Conference – http://aureus.cc/?page_id=4484\n\nWhitepaper – http://aureus.cc/?page_id=4500\n\nYoutube channel here – https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuxAe2t0JrrZLWhuyYhqyzg\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: Jarrah Lim\n\nContact Email: contact@cryptocrest.com\n\nCompany Name: Cryptocrest\n\nLocation: Luxembourg City\n\nContact Phone Number: +60173042536\n\nCryptocrest is the source of this content.

05/17/2017,"['Is infecting more than 300,000 computers around the world with a ransomware virus a good way to make a fortune? It sure doesn\'t look like it.\n\nThe WannaCry cyberattack that\'s making headlines this week has squeezed around $80,000 from its victims so far, barely enough to put down a deposit on an apartment in cheaper parts of London. But it\'s seized the attention of powerful governments around the globe.\n\nWhat\'s more, the hackers\' decision to use the digital currency bitcoin to collect the ransom money is likely to make it tough for them to withdraw their ill-gotten gains without being caught.\n\nThe malware instructed victims to pay $300 in bitcoin in order to regain control of the data it had seized, threatening to increase the sum demanded every three days.\n\nRelated: Researchers find possible North Korea link to massive cyberattack\n\nFollowing the money\n\nAt first glance, using bitcoin to gather the money could make sense: cybercriminals can set up accounts in the virtual currency anonymously. But anyone can see the accounts online and also view a record of transactions.\n\nThat makes spending the bitcoins or cashing out of them into another currency without getting caught a tricky task, especially when you\'ve already attracted widespread global attention.\n\n""I have the feeling we will soon see ... how difficult it is to launder [bitcoin],"" Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos tweeted over the weekend, suggesting law enforcement and intelligence agencies could cooperate in tracking what happens to the money.\n\nRelated: Police warn: If you\'re hit by cyberattack, don\'t pay the ransom\n\nThey may have their work cut out: the global bitcoin market sees roughly 250,000 transactions a day. And criminals can use murky online markets to try to cover their tracks, said Leonhard Weese, who advises startups on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nThe WannaCry hackers are likely to have plenty of cyber sleuths on their trail, though. U.K. startup Elliptic has made a business out of helping law enforcement agencies trace shady money through the bitcoin realm to track down people or groups in the real world.\n\nElliptic is already monitoring the funds in the three bitcoin accounts linked to the WannaCry cyberattack.\n\nPuzzling decisions\n\nOther decisions by the hackers also look puzzling, especially if their goal was to profit from the attack.\n\nAsking computer owners who use outdated versions of Microsoft Windows to pay a ransom in an obscure digital currency is an optimistic request at best -- and it\'s one of the likely reasons why the amount paid is so low compared with the number of victims.\n\n""One or two people I know have joked to me that even if they did get hit, they wouldn\'t know how to get a bitcoin to pay them with,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of Hong Kong-based cybersecurity provider Network Box.\n\nPolice have told victims not to pay the WannaCry ransom, warning that handing over the money doesn\'t guarantee that they\'ll get everything back.\n\nThere have been more sophisticated and successful instances of cybertheft in the past. Cryptowall, a similar type of malware that spread through businesses around the world in 2015, is estimated to have made its creators $325 million.\n\nWas it a political move?\n\nAll of this begs the question: Was WannaCry really about the money?\n\nPatrick Coughlin, COO of cybersecurity firm TruSTAR, asked in a blog post Tuesday whether the hackers cared about financial returns at all or were motivated instead by a political agenda.\n\n""The answer is probably somewhere in the murky middle,"" he wrote.\n\n""No matter what you think about the motives behind this particular attack -- there will be more to come,"" Coughlin warned. ""And the next wave will learn from the impact we\'ve seen (and not seen) here.""', 'MUMBAI: Despite the Reserve Bank\'s call for caution to people against the use of virtual currencies, a domestic Bitcoin exchange today said it is adding over 2,500 users a day and has reached five lakh downloads.Zebpay, an app-absed Bitcoin exchange, said it has had five lakh downloads on the Android operating system and is adding more than 2,500 users every day.The company, launched in 2015, said, the increasing downloads highlight the ""growing acceptance of Bitcoins as one of the most popular emerging asset class.""RBI has been repeatedly flagging concerns on virtual currencies like Bitcoins, stating that they pose potential financial, legal, customer protection and security-related risks.In recent cyber attacks, "" ransomware \'\' hackers held victims hostage by encrypting their data and demanding them to send payments in bitcoins to regain access to their computers.Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties.Bitcoin is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who \'mine\' them by lending computing power to verify other users\' transactions.They receive bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with US dollars and other currencies.One bitcoin recently traded for $1,734.65, according to Coinbase, a company that helps users exchange bitcoins. That makes it more valuable than an ounce of gold, which trades at less than $1,230.The value of bitcoins can swing sharply, though. A year ago, one was worth $457.04, which means that it\'s nearly quadrupled in the last 12 months. But its price doesn\'t always go up.A bitcoin\'s value plunged by 23 per cent against the dollar in just a week in January. It fell by the same amount again in 10 days during March.Bitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators and criminals.Yes, to a point. Transactions and accounts can be traced, but the account owners aren\'t necessarily known. However, investigators might be able to track down the owners when bitcoins are converted to regular currency.For now, the three accounts tied to the ransomware attack appear untouched -- and it\'ll be difficult for perpetrators to cash in anytime soon without getting traced.Some businesses have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage. Overstock.com accepts payments in bitcoin, for example. The currency has become popular enough that more than 300,000 daily transactions have been occurring recently, according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info. A year ago, activity was closer to 230,000 transactions per day.The bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals\' greed for the collective good. A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction.The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn\'t be an issue.It\'s a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn\'t matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.An Australian entrepreneur last year stepped forward and claimed to be the founder of bitcoin, only to say days later that he did not \'have the courage\' to publish proof that he is.', ""Headquarters of the NSA, the agency believed to be behind the creation of the EternalBlue and DoublePulsar exploits.\n\nThe same exploits that allowed the WannaCry ransomware attack to spread so quickly have been used to set up an illicit cryptocurrency mining scheme. And it sure was worth it to the hackers.\n\nLate last week, the world was hit by ransomware that locked up computers in hospitals, universities, and private firms, demanding Bitcoin in exchange for files being decrypted. It was able to spread so fast thanks to a Windows flaw weaponized by the U.S. National Security Agency known as EternalBlue, and a back door called DoublePulsar. Sadly, the tools were inadvertently lost and leaked because the NSA considered it wise to stockpile them for future use.\n\nWannaCry was halted by swift work on behalf of dedicated security researchers. But during investigations into the attack, security firm Proofpoint has found that another piece of malware, called Adylkuzz, makes use of the same exploits to spread itself around the word’s insecure Windows devices.\n\nThis particular hack has gone unnoticed since April. That’s because unlike WannaCry, which demands attention to get money directly from a user, Adylkuzz simply installs a piece of software and then borrows a PC’s resources. It then sets about mining the little-known cryptocurrency called Monero using your computer. It does so in the background, with users potentially unaware of its presence—though perhaps a little frustrated because their computers are slower than usual.\n\nIt makes sense that EternalBlue and DoublePulsar are being used in this way, said Nolen Scaife, a security researcher at the University of Florida. The combination of exploits allows attackers to load just about any type of malware they want onto compromised machines. “It's important to stress that it could be anything—it could be keyloggers, for example,” he told MIT Technology Review. “But what we're seeing is that attackers are using this wherever this makes the most money.”\n\nInterestingly, though, it’s the attack that has until now gone unnoticed that has secured the most loot. WannaCry’s attempt to extort cash in return for unlocking encrypted files has only drummed up $80,000 at the time of writing—probably because Bitcoin, the currency WannaCry’s perpetrators are demanding, is hard to use. Meanwhile one estimate suggests that the Adylkuzz attack could have already raised as much as $1 million.\n\nIn some sense, Adylkuzz is less problematic than WannaCry. It’s certainly less overtly destructive. But it does raise a more pressing cause for concern: if it’s been running since April, how many other leaked NSA tools have been used to carry out attacks that have so far gone unnoticed? Stay tuned—there may be more to come.\n\n(Read more: Proofpoint, Reuters, “The WannaCry Ransomware Attack Could’ve Been a Lot Worse,” “Security Experts Agree: The NSA Was Hacked,” “Should the Government Keep Stockpiling Software Bugs?”)"", 'Indian Bitcoin exchange and wallet provider Zebpay has experienced an exponential growth in its user base over the past 12 months. Recently, the company reached a major milestone of 500,000 mobile Android users, a mobile user base that is larger than all the mobile applications of Bitcoin exchanges and service providers in South Korea combined.\n\nLeading Indian bitcoin exchange Zebpay\'s android application has more downloads than all of South Korean exchanges\' apps combined. #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/pA6IWHCu8q — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 16, 2017\n\nSuch metric is important to assess the actual growth rate of the Indian Bitcoin exchange market and industry as South Korea is the fourth largest Bitcoin exchange market with a market share of nearly 10 percent and a $63 mln daily trading volume. In contrast, the Indian Bitcoin exchange market accounts for around one percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market with a relatively small daily trading volume.\n\nIndia’s growth rate\n\nMost Bitcoin market data providers including BraveNewCoin don’t include the three leading and largest Bitcoin exchanges in India which are Unocoin, Coinsecure and Zebpay.\n\n""If the daily trading volumes of the three exchanges are also considered, it is highly likely that the Indian Bitcoin exchange market would rank significantly higher than other exchange markets that currently portray larger trading volumes than India.""\n\nAs seen in the note provided above, South Korea has some of the most prominent exchanges backed by major investors including the $17 bln South Korean telecommunications company SK Telecom. South Korea’s three largest exchanges Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone are all backed by influential investors and conglomerates in the country. Yet, one of the three leading Indian exchanges on the Indian Bitcoin exchange market, which isn’t even currently ranked in the top 10 largest exchange markets, has a larger mobile user base than that of the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market.\n\nIt is an interesting and important market data to acknowledge considering that India is struggling to deal with a nationwide financial crisis. 90 percent of the country’s ATMs are dysfunctional and a limited group of people has access to banking services that can be used to obtain cash to fund day-to-day operations.\n\nGovernment approach\n\nAmidst this economic and financial uncertainty in India, the user base of Bitcoin is rapidly increasing throughout the region.\n\nUnocoin, in particular, has also experienced a surge in its user base and trading volume after the Indian government announced that it intends to consider regulating the industry in the near future.', 'Mike Maloney, the founder of precious metals broker GoldSilver.com, has suggested that owning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is one of the answers to how to protect yourself against a shift in the global monetary system.\n\nHe says “something big and very dangerous” is coming ahead very fast and it requires everyone to be prepared.\n\n“Going to be devastating”\n\nMike Maloney, who has written a book on investing in precious metals, notes in a video presentation that the pending market crash is the first time in history that there would be an everything bubble:\n\n“Back in the year 2000, it was stocks. In the year 2008, it was stock and real estate. This time, it is stocks, real estates and bonds and they are all in some of the biggest bubbles of all time. When these burst, it’s going to be devastating for most people but it doesn’t have to be devastating for you.”\n\nHe added that the answer to the question of how to be prepared for this roller coaster crash and the potential for the new world monetary system - he’d found while researching his book that a new system emerges every thirty years - has become a little more complex than just relying on gold and silver.\n\nAlternative system exists\n\nHe stressed that although cryptocurrencies should not be relied upon solely because they are worthless without an Internet connection, he explains how essential they are:\n\n“You want to have an alternative monetary system that is already ready to go and those actually exist today. They are called cryptocurrencies. It started with Bitcoin. There have been several others that have been introduced. I own a few of them. I don’t own a lot of cryptocurrencies but I think it is something that is necessary to be prepared because if the monetary system fails, you’ll be able to do transactions right away with other people and you can do them over long distances. You can do them over the Internet just like you pay with your credit card today.”\n\nPrudent Bear advice\n\nUnlike others that caution against Bitcoin as a competitor to gold or as a risky investment, Maloney’s recommendation of Bitcoin as a solution for online transactions seems to be in line with the view of the former manager of the Prudent Bear Fund, David Tice.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC. Tice said that although Bitcoin has been looked down on, it truly makes a lot of sense to invest in it, particularly on a transactional basis as it has the potential to give investors money.', 'On May 9, Evelyn Chen of CNBC reported that bitcoin price surged to a new all-time high due to the announcement of the Federal Reserve Bank president Neel Kashkari. However, quite obviously and evidently, Kashkari’s statement on blockchain did not lead to a bitcoin price surge and have any sort of influence on the market.\n\nThe global bitcoin exchange market is far bigger than most imagine. If the bitcoin-to-altcoin pair is included, the trading volume of the global bitcoin exchange market is $811 million, with Japan leading the market as the largest bitcoin exchange market with nearly 33 percent of the market share and a $120.5 million daily trading volume.\n\nOver the past few years, banks, financial institutions and the so-called blockchain consortia have allocated the majority of their resources and capital in detaching the term blockchain from bitcoin. Most notably, before the R3 consortia distanced itself from blockchain development, the organization pushed the term distributed ledger technology, an identical technology to the blockchain, with the sole intent of convincing the global finance market that blockchain is different from bitcoin.\n\nIn a way, the development of blockchain is the finance industry’s counter project to bitcoin. By replicating a part of the Bitcoin protocol, banks and financial institutions aim to create a decentralized technology that could be used to reduce their operating costs and optimize existing infrastructures.\n\nConsidering that blockchain and bitcoin are two different technologies, mostly because of the efforts of the finance industry to independently develop bitcoin-inspired banking technology, the Federal Reserve Bank’s announcement that blockchain has more potential than bitcoin couldn’t in any possible way affect bitcoin price positively. If anything, it would have led to a decline in bitcoin price because an established financial institution and powerhouse within the global finance ecosystem boldly stated that bitcoin’s competing technology has more potential.\n\nIn his statement Kashkari said:\n\n“I think sentiment has shifted in the markets, in the Fed. I would say I think conventional wisdom now is that blockchain and the underlying technology is probably more interesting and has more potential than maybe bitcoin does by itself.”\n\nThe actual factors that led bitcoin price to surg on May 9 are the explosive growth of the Japanese bitcoin industry and the rise in the demand toward bitcoin from institutional investors. More importantly, Japanese bitcoin exchanges clarified that their trading platforms don’t portray inflated volumes because fees exist for average traders. In an interview, Yuzo Kano, the CEO of Bitflyer, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, stated:\n\n“We charge trading fees for BTC and ‘swap point’ for FX. So it’s a different situation from China before this January. We are seeing funds inflowing not only to BTC but also all crypto markets.”\n\nMike Kayamori, the CEO of QUOINE, another major Japanese bitcoin exchange which controls around 10 percent of the Japanese bitcoin exchange market share, explained:\n\n“At QUOINE, we are charging fees on all trades other than spot trading of BTC/JPY. Every other currency pair, as well as margin trading, there is a fee. And our spreads are quite large, hence our volume is actually lower in April/May than it was March.”\n\nTo this date, bitcoin is being traded in Japan for a high premium of 7 percent over other major bitcoin exchange markets such as the US and Europe, demonstrating the continuous rise in demand toward bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'After hackers stole $69 million from Bitfinex last year, the bitcoin exchange’s fate seemed sealed: lawsuits, bankruptcy and years of liquidation proceedings.\n\nThat’s what happened to Mt. Gox, the high-profile marketplace for trading the virtual currency, which lost $480 million. There were also other smaller implosions such as Cointrader and Bitcurex.\n\nPhil Potter Photographer: Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg\n\nBut against the odds, Bitfinex pulled out of its spiral dive, announcing last month that all customers were repaid. The exchange posted its most profitable month and claimed its spot as the largest bitcoin venue for U.S. dollar trading. “We’ve demonstrated an alternative to bankruptcy,” said Phil Potter, 45, Bitfinex’s chief strategy officer.\n\nBehind the turnaround, unusual in an industry with few safeguards, is a combination of an uptick in market activity that boosted fee-based income and a mostly successful effort to mollify angry customers with an innovative market-based solution to how everyone would be compensated. Assuming the strategy doesn’t unravel down the road, Bitfinex may prove to be a valuable template for how the bitcoin community deals with a crisis in the future.\n\nOn Aug. 2, as the U.S. presidential election got into full swing after the Republican and Democratic conventions, Potter got an early morning phone call at his beach home in Long Island saying hackers had breached security and were draining customer deposits. Bitfinex’s executives don’t work in a single location, but are peppered throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. Its parent company iFinex Inc. is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, while back office functions are done in Taiwan, technology support is concentrated in London and the compliance team is run out of Hong Kong.\n\nWhile the exchange succeeded in protecting U.S. dollar and other currency deposits, by the time they could block access, thieves had walked away with about 57 percent of bitcoin deposits. Even though the virtual currency exists as software, it can be stolen and transactions are irreversible. In the aftermath, bitcoin briefly slumped 15 percent against the dollar.\n\n“The first thought we all had was, ‘Oh my god, is this another Mt. Gox?’"" said Harry Yeh, managing partner at digital currency dealer Binary Financial and a large Bitfinex customer.\n\nA key concern was whether another large bitcoin exchange implosion would undermine the virtual currency’s ecosystem and trigger a bear market like the one that followed Mt. Gox’s demise in 2014.\n\nAs Potter, who once worked in Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management business, and other Bitfinex executives assessed the damage, they spoke to bankruptcy lawyers. After four sleepless days, they decided against shutting down the exchange and bet they could pull out of the mess.\n\nThe first step was the toughest. Bitfinex decided to ‘socialize’ losses evenly among all customers and apply a 36 percent haircut to every account. Even though some people’s bitcoin weren’t stolen, the exchange had a margin lending system that affected almost everyone. Unsurprisingly, users whose accounts weren’t breached were outraged and began rounding up allies to file class actions.\n\n“We thought we might still have had to go in to bankruptcy, and if we did, this is likely how it would have had to work out: everyone takes an equal hit,"" Potter said.\n\nOn the whole, however, the community saw the benefits of avoiding a drawn out bankruptcy with their money locked up indefinitely, and were relieved to receive at least 64 percent of their money back.\n\nNext, Bitfinex sweetened the deal by issuing IOU tokens to each customer equal to the 36 percent that was taken from their accounts. Management promised the tokens would eventually be exchanged for cash or equity in Bitfinex’s parent company.\n\nIn another clever move, Bitfinex said users could trade the tokens and let the market decide how much they were worth. Customers who wanted nothing more to do with Bitfinex could sell the instruments at a discount and walk away. Those who believed they would be repaid could gamble on a recovery by snapping up more tokens, although U.S. customers were given fewer options in order to comply with local regulations.\n\nInitially, the price of each token plunged to around 15 cents on the dollar, indicating that traders thought there was only a one-in-eight chance the exchange would make good on its promise to pay back losses.\n\nThen, the value of each token began to pick up as Bitfinex’s big customers started buying. Within a month, prices were at about 50 cents on the dollar. Potter said Bitfinex insiders and employees were barred from trading tokens.\n\nEventually, a virtuous cycle kicked in. As the tokens rose in value, confidence swelled and traders returned, boosting earnings from transaction fees and the likelihood of a successful turnaround. In mid-October, customers agreed to convert about a third of all tokens into equity. The deal valued the parent company at $200 million, underscoring the recovery in confidence.\n\nA bitcoin rally that began last year, with prices more than doubling since August, also lifted market turnover. Bitfinex used the profits and drew down reserves to exchange more of the tokens for cash each month. The cycle continued until March when, with income at an all-time high and tokens trading at more than 90 cents on the dollar, management redeemed the remaining tokens and announced the recovery complete.\n\n“They didn’t go into receivership, nobody lost money and now if anything they’re back and bigger and more profitable than ever,” said Binary Financial’s Yeh.\n\nNot everyone was happy. Some smaller customers sold their tokens early, failing to recoup most of their losses. Essentially, the token market inherently favored bigger customers, whose close relationship with Bitfinex gave them a better idea of their potential. That also made it harder for disgruntled users to find allies to sue the exchange.\n\nStill, it might be too early for Bitfinex to celebrate. Two weeks after announcing the $69 million was paid off, Bitfinex was forced to halt withdrawals and deposits of fiat currencies after its banks stopped processing payments. Potter said the situation is improving, but it remains unclear when access to fiat funding will be restored.\n\nMeanwhile, Mt. Gox’s customers are still waiting for details on when and how much money they’ll get back. The trustee overseeing the liquidation told creditors in March that the investigation ""is still on-going.""\n\nWhile it’s not clear whether Bitfinex’s recovery strategy is one that will be adopted for another crisis, the idea of using tradeable tokens is catching on. Used as derivatives that represent a share of future profits, equity or any other underlying asset, the tokens are gaining in popularity because they are unregulated and can be immediately bought and sold.\n\n“Bitfinex’s recovery is an example of people starting to get creative with how to utilize tokenized systems to engineer solutions or mechanism that previously didn’t exist,” said Brian Lio, who runs research firm Smith + Crown. “Groups are going to step forward and try and come up with solutions in the absence of regulations.”\n\n(An earlier version of this story was corrected to show that employees were barred from buying or selling tokens.)', 'The biggest bank in the Nordic region says this month’s ransomware attack underscores the need for lawmakers to look more closely at bitcoin’s role in financial crime.\n\nNordea Bank AB, whose chief risk officer, Julie Galbo, testified to the Danish parliament on Tuesday in response to questions about management’s efforts to fight money laundering, says virtual currencies like bitcoin are making that battle harder to win.\n\n“Bitcoin is an unregulated and opaque currency that’s often used in shady transactions,” Galbo told Bloomberg after testifying. She says bitcoin represents a “big risk” standing in the way of efforts to fight money laundering because of the anonymity it affords those who use it.\n\nNordea has been investigated by authorities in Denmark and Sweden for its failures to comply with anti-money laundering requirements. Last year, it was also responding to inquiries from the U.S. government on alleged breaches of anti-money laundering rules that have already led to fines in Sweden.\n\nThe bank, the only global systemically important financial institution in the Nordic region, featured prominently in the Panama Papers for allegedly helping rich clients hide their wealth from tax authorities. Management, led by Chief Executive Officer Casper von Koskull, has tried to address the criticisms, adding hundreds of people to Nordea’s compliance department.\n\nGalbo, who used to work at Denmark’s financial regulator, said “patterns of financial crime change constantly,” making it increasingly difficult for those fighting it to do their jobs. She says working closer with the relevant authorities, including sharing knowledge, would help banks comply with the rules.\n\nGalbo said WannaCry, which affected more than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries, is a clear example underscoring the need to treat bitcoin with suspicion. The hackers gave those targeted 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin. If people refused to pay after seven days, their computers would be permanently locked.\n\nGalbo told lawmakers in the Danish parliament that aside from complying with the law, Nordea is “morally obliged” to do everything in its power to prevent its systems being used in connection with money laundering.\n\nWhile bitcoin was singled out for criticism, Galbo said the technology behind the payment form -- blockchain -- was something Nordea continues to view “very positively.”', 'Ever since the dot-com and housing bubbles popped in 2000 and 2008, spotting bubbles has become a national obsession. Investors have spotted bubbles in bonds, credit, equities, gold -- you name it -- over the last several years.\n\nI wouldn’t use the B-word to describe any of those investments -- yet. In fact, I wouldn’t even nominate any of them for Most Likely to Bubble Over. I would give that distinction to a certain cryptocurrency that is quickly making its name and fortune: Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has all the attributes of a bubble in the making. First, it’s radically new. It’s a digital payment system that allows users anywhere in the world to transact directly without interference from intermediaries, governments, regulators or central banks -- at least for now. Transactions are administered by a decentralized network of computers, much like the internet.\n\nIn his book about the 17th-century tulip bubble in Holland, ""Tulipmania,"" British journalist Mike Dash points out, “It is impossible to comprehend the tulip mania without understanding just how different tulips were from every other flower known to horticulturists in the 17th century.” The same could be said about the internet in the 1990s and about digital currency today.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin is shrouded in secrecy. Buyers and sellers of Bitcoin can trade anonymously, which makes the digital currency a favorite of criminals and hackers demanding ransom. Its origins are shrouded in mystery. Its creator goes by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, but it\'s unclear who that person is or if it\'s even one person. That, too, is reminiscent of another bubble. At the height of England’s South Sea Bubble in 1720, one company floated shares “""For carrying-on an undertaking of great advantage but no-one to know what it is."" Of course, that didn’t stop investors from throwing money at the company.\n\nRiding the Wave In 1720, share prices of the South Sea Company rose 400 percent in three months and then collapsed just as quickly Source: ICF working paper, “New Evidence on the First Financial Bubble” by Rik Frehen, Will Goetzmann and Geert Rouwenhorst Note: European date format.\n\nThird, Bitcoin has no value other than what a buyer is willing to pay for it, which makes it susceptible to the argument that underlies all bubbles. Namely, that any price is appropriate. But there’s already reason to worry that Bitcoin\'s price is excessive. An investment in Bitcoin has returned a breathtaking 351 percent annually since its inception in July 2010 through Tuesday. To put that in perspective, an investment of $100 in Bitcoin from the beginning would be worth close to $3 million today. It’s not easy to justify that kind of return for any investment.\n\nDigital Gold The price of Bitcoin is up 3 million percent since July 2010 Source: Bloomberg\n\nBitcoin is similar to other currencies and commodities such as gold, oil, potatoes or even tulips in that its intrinsic value is difficult -- if not impossible -- to separate from its price. But there are governments standing behind currencies and reliable currency markets for exchange. And with commodities, investors have something to hold at the end of the transaction. Bitcoin feels more speculative because it’s just digital ephemera.\n\nThat isn’t true for all investments. Stockholders are entitled to a share of a company’s assets, earnings and dividends, the value of which can be estimated independent of the stock’s price. The same can be said about a bond’s payments of principal and interest.\n\nThis distinction between price and value is what allowed many observers to warn that internet stocks were absurdly priced in the late 1990s, or that mortgage bonds weren’t as safe as investors assumed during the housing bubble. A similar warning about Bitcoin isn’t possible.\n\nDuring the dot-com craze, Warren Buffett was asked why he didn’t invest in technology. He famously answered that he didn’t understand tech stocks. But what he meant was that no one understood them, and he was right. Why else would anyone buy the NASDAQ 100 Index when its price-to-earnings ratio was more than 500 times -- a laughably low earnings yield of 0.2 percent -- which is where it traded at the height of the bubble in March 2000.\n\nInternet Gold The NASDAQ 100 Index\'s spectacular rise and fall within five years embodied the dot-com bubble Source: Bloomberg\n\nThinking back on investors’ credulity during the last two bubbles, I can’t help but wonder if buyers of Bitcoin understand what they’re invested in. They would be wise to ask themselves that same question.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story:\n\nNir Kaissar in Washington at nkaissar1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nDaniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net', 'Bitcoin wallet provider Xapo has told its customers that they will soon have to pay the network fees for outbound transactions from their accounts.\n\nWhen a user broadcasts a bitcoin transaction (or one for any other digital currency), they attach a fee that acts as an incentive for miners to include that transaction in their next block.\n\nThe higher the fee, the more likely a miner will want to include it, as they’ll collect any associated fees should their block be accepted by the wider network.\n\nAccording to an email sent to users by Xapo, they’ll now be responsible for this fee, though the startup clarified that any transfers between Xapo accounts won’t incur this charge.

05/18/2017,"['Bitcoin is well-entrenched as the preferred payment for cybercriminals like the WannaCry hackers who have hit more than 300,000 computers over the past week, but cryptocurrencies offering more anonymity are threatening to displace it.\n\nA key reason for bitcoin’s dominance in the nefarious online underworld, say technologists and cybercrime experts, is its size – the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is more than twice that of the nearest of hundreds of rivals.\n\nThat makes it easy for victims to access enough to pay the ransoms demanded, and for hackers to cash out of it via online exchanges to spend money in the real world.\n\nBitcoin was set up in 2008 by someone – or some group – calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.\n\nMoney is sent from one anonymous online “wallet” to another with no need for a third party to validate or clear the transactions.\n\nIn the WannaCry attack, the addresses of three anonymous bitcoin wallets were given to victims, with a demand for ransom payments from $300 worth of bitcoin, with a promise the affected machines would be decrypted in return, a promise that no evidence has shown will be kept.\n\nBut since the way that Bitcoin functions is via the blockchain – a giant, virtually tamper-proof, shared ledger of all bitcoin transactions ever made – payments can be traced, if users do not have the sophistication to take further steps to cloak themselves using digital anonymity tools.\n\n“In the initial days of bitcoin, people…didn’t realize they were recording for posterity on the blockchain every financial transaction that ever took place,” said Emin Gun Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University.\n\nBitcoin addresses are anonymous, but users can be traced through IP addresses or by analyzing money flows.\n\nIf criminals using bitcoin want to stay truly anonymous, Gun Sirer said, they have to go through a number of additional, complex steps to make sure they do not get caught.\n\nIt is not yet clear what level of sophistication the WannaCry hackers have when it comes to laundering their cryptocurrency, as none of the money has yet been moved out of the three bitcoin wallets linked to the ransomware, which have had over $80,000 worth of bitcoin paid into them so far.\n\nBut some have suggested that the fact that the WannaCry hackers demanded bitcoin shows how amateur they are.\n\n“If it was me, I would want people to use bitcoin all day, because you can trace it,” said Luke Wilson, vice president for law enforcement at Elliptic, a London-based security firm that tracks illicit bitcoin transactions and that counts the U.S. Federal Bureau for Investigations (FBI) among its clients.\n\nWilson, who used to work at the FBI, where he set up a taskforce to investigate the use of virtual currencies, did not disclose all the ways that Elliptic and law enforcement agencies find criminals using bitcoin. But sometimes, he said, the offenders make as obvious a mistake as withdrawing money from a bitcoin wallet directly into their bank accounts.\n\nCat-and-mouse game\n\nMore sophisticated criminals use obfuscation methods that make it very hard to be tracked down. One of the most basic ones is a technique known as “chain-hopping,” whereby money is moved from one cryptocurrency into another, across digital currency exchanges – the less-regulated the better – to create a money trail that is almost impossible to track.\n\nNewer and more complex money-laundering methods have also emerged in recent years, which make it very difficult for law enforcement and bitcoin security firms such as Elliptic or New-York-based Chainalysis to track down cybercriminals.\n\n“It’s a cat-and-mouse game – as police and companies like Elliptic catch up to criminals’ techniques, they invent new techniques,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Coin Center, a not-for-profit advocacy group focusing on public policy issues around cryptocurrency.\n\nThese techniques are not foolproof, however – chain-hopping, for example, relies on unregulated exchanges that do not carry out know-your-customer (KYC) checks, and security firms say they will develop ways to trace such methods.\n\nMonero Hack\n\nEasier, perhaps, would be for cybercriminals to use next-generation cryptocurrencies that have built-in anonymity from the start, such as Monero, Dash and Z-Cash.\n\nAnd indeed, experts said late on Tuesday that a computer virus that exploits the same vulnerability as the WannaCry attack had latched on to more than 200,000 computers and begun using them to manufacture – or “mine” – Monero currency.\n\nBut with a total value of around $425 million – a little over 1 percent of that of bitcoin – converting that currency into spendable cash might not be so easy, and it is also much harder for victims to access, alternative payments experts said.\n\nThat is why the Monero attack did not demand a ransom, but rather used the infected computers’ computing power to create new currency.\n\n“This used to happen in bitcoin before it became big – there were loads of botnets that went into computers that used to mine bitcoin, but you now can’t basically mine bitcoin on normal computers because you need specialist hardware,” said Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin.\n\nLevin said such bitcoin-based attacks were carried out several years ago, when mining it was still largely a hobby for tech geeks using their home computers.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAs the bitcoin price has risen and as transaction numbers have grown, the computers have become so specialized that only they can only perform the function of bitcoin mining.\n\n“If Monero does become adopted and is as big and liquid (as bitcoin), that means the crime (will) move from using computers to mine to getting to extortion,” Levin said.', ""The security firm found evidence that it's been in use since May 2nd, though it could have been around as early as April 24th. It flew under everyone's radar because it's nowhere near as attention-grabbing as WannaCry, and it doesn't require people to know how to use Bitcoin. According Proofpoint exec Ryan Kalember, the miner's creators could've already earned over a million from its efforts. Meanwhile, the three Bitcoin wallets connected to WannaCry have only gotten payments equivalent to around $81,000. Proofpoint says that it expects more cyber criminals to use NSA's leaked tools in the future.

Further, he revealed that Zebpay is seeing more than 2,500 new customer sign-ups every day.\n\nIn quotes reported by a regional publication, Goenka stated:\n\nIndia is at the cusp of a new financial revolution as Indian customers are opening up to non-traditional investment measures. While this [growth] is a steady and promising start, we expect the bitcoin trend to roar further. We aim to achieve 12 million downloads by end of September 2017.\n\nIndia sees relatively modest trading volumes compared to other Asian markets bitcoin markets in China, South Korea and Japan. In February, the Reserve Bank of India – the country’s central bank and financial regulator – turned a cold shoulder toward bitcoin, neither banning nor legalizing it and certainly not regulating the industry.\n\n“India’s bitcoin trading volumes are relatively small compared to other countries around the world,” stated Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of India’s largest bitcoin exchange Unocoin in a conversation with CCN in February this year. “So, it [regulation] may not be a priority, yet. First, the RBI will need to understand the bitcoin ecosystem before regulating it.”\n\nTwo months later, the Indian government stopped ignoring bitcoin.\n\nAfter Bitcoin was discussed in the Indian Parliament repeatedly through March and early April, India’s Ministry for Finance established an inter-governmental committee to study the framework of virtual currencies.\n\nWhile one particular politician called for bitcoin to be declared illegal in the country, it is increasingly likely that the cryptocurrency-gauging committee is set to recommend the Indian government legalize bitcoin.\n\nIn mid-April, a televised report by the Indian affiliate of CNBC pointed to the government looking at legalizing and taxing bitcoin in India. A report from earlier this month cited an unnamed Finance Ministry official underline the regulation of the bitcoin industry as a priority, further squashing any talk of banning the world’s most prominent and widely-used cryptocurrency.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'After peaking at $1,840, Bitcoin price stabilized in the $1,820 region earlier today on May 18. The recent surge of Bitcoin price seems to be largely affected by the economic uncertainty of the US, caused by troubles surrounding the Trump administration.\n\nDonald Trump sent jitters down the spine of the world’s political and financial elite from the day of his inauguration when Bitcoin price immediately shot upward.\n\nBloomberg reported that major US stock indexes had their worst session in eight months while world’s 500 most valuable billionaires have lost $35 bln due to the Trump administration’s turmoil and the US economy’s underwhelming performance.\n\nAmazon’s Jeff Bezos and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg shed $3.7 bln as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by more than 370 points.\n\nTurmoil\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Evercore ISI Executive Dennis DeBusschere stated:\n\n“What has been setting in over the course of the day is that political uncertainty is something that’s likely going to be with us for a significant amount of time. We may be looking at a higher volatility backdrop with a trending lower market for the next couple of months.”\n\nAmid the economic and financial turmoil, investors have begun to protect their assets and wealth with safe haven assets such as gold and Bitcoin. While gold has gained around 1.9 percent, Bitcoin price recorded a seven percent increase to surpass the $1,820 mark, reaching closer to the current all-time high price established at $1,868.\n\nSafe haven\n\nRecently, Cointelegraph reported that gold hasn’t met the description of a safe haven asset over the past seven years. Being considered as a safe haven asset for centuries, since 2010 gold has not managed to maintain its value nor demonstrate an increase. As Cointelegraph noted, a $10,000 investment in gold back in 2010 would have led to a loss of $20, while a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin would have led to a net gain of $200 mln.\n\nHence, investors have started to rely on Bitcoin, which is considered to be digital gold and a settlement network, to avoid market instability and economic uncertainty. As DeBusschere noted, the US market will most likely struggle to recover throughout the next few months. If so, Bitcoin price is likely to maintain its upward trend and potentially set new all-time highs in the upcoming months.\n\nThe rise in demand toward Bitcoin in the US is evident as the US Bitcoin exchange market surpassed the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market for the first time in 2017 in terms of trading volume.\n\nAt the time of writing, Japan has reclaimed its position as the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange market with over 37 percent of the market share.', '', '', 'The US Bitcoin exchange market briefly overtook Japan to become the largest Bitcoin exchange market in the world, amidst serious economic uncertainty.\n\nAccording to various analysts including Lukman Otunuga, currency broker FXTM’s research analyst, the Trump administration’s troubles with former FBI Director James Comey’s memo and the call for impeachment by the Democratic Party have led to wide fluctuations on the US stock market.\n\n""With a growing chorus of Democrats accusing Trump of obstructing justice and even calling for his impeachment, the Trump administration could come to an early season finale,” said Otunuga.\n\n""Even mainstream media analysts have emphasized that Bitcoin, alongside gold, has demonstrated a surge in demand as investors started to seek out for alternative and safe haven assets to protect their wealth.""\n\nOn Wednesday, Cointelegraph reported that prominent gold investor Mike Maloney, the founder of GoldSilver.com, encouraged other investors to maintain Bitcoin as a mandatory investment in their portfolios in case of market instability and unforeseen economic uncertainty.\n\n“You want to have an alternative monetary system that is already ready to go and those actually exist today. They are called cryptocurrencies. It started with Bitcoin. There have been several others that have been introduced. I own a few of them,” said Maloney.\n\nUS vs. Japan\n\nEvidently, an increasing number of investors are moving toward Bitcoin perceiving the digital currency as gold 2.0, a more evolved safe haven asset with transportability and high liquidity, to avoid market instability.\n\nThe short-term fall in US stocks, bonds and assets have also allowed the Japanese market to strengthen, leading to the longest economic growth streak in over a decade.\n\nAlthough mainstream media outlets including CNN and Bloomberg have emphasized the rising demand for Bitcoin amid economic uncertainty, it seems as if strengthening markets such as Japan are giving investors more confidence and resources to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nJapan’s key to adoption\n\nAs Koji Higashi, the co-founder of IndieSquare and a Japan-based analyst, stated, investing in cryptocurrencies has become the norm after the legalization of Bitcoin by the Japanese government and the exemption of taxes for Bitcoin traders.\n\nHigashi wrote:\n\n“Japan is known for its homogeneous culture and the key to adoption of anything is whether people perceive that “everyone else is doing it” or not. So, obviously, it seems we have passed the tipping point in Japan and now it’s suddenly completely “OK” to hop onto the crypto train and people started assuming it’s safe to invest in them because “everyone else is doing it”.”\n\nTug-of-war\n\nAt one of the lowest and sharpest declines of stock markets and assets, the US briefly became the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange market, obtaining a 30 percent market share over the global Bitcoin exchange market. At the time of writing, Japan has already reclaimed its title but the US is maintaining its substantially high market share of 30 percent.\n\nIn the upcoming months, if the US market and economy struggle to recover, the Bitcoin market may see the US exchange market overtake Japan again in the near future.', 'According to an article published on Trustnodes today, Ethereum is now handling almost half the transaction volume of Bitcoin. That might not sound impressive but you have to consider the fact that Ethereum launched less than 2 years ago whereas Bitcoin is over 9 years old. The fact that Ethereum has been able to grow so rapidly in such a relatively short time has industry experts excited.\n\nTwo Big Players\n\nThe article on Trustnodes bases its assertion on data collected by blockchain.info and etherscan, which found that Bitcoin is currently handling around 220,000 transactions a day with a peak daily capacity of about 250,000 (Reddit user u/Savage_X was quick to point out that Bitcoin’s daily peak was actually around 320,000). Ethereum, on the other hand, is now handling around 125,000 transactions per day.\n\nThe gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum might still seem large, however, you not only have to consider the fact that Bitcoin has been around for over 4 times longer but also the fact that no other cryptocurrencies come even remotely close. The next 3 largest cryptocurrencies by volume are Litecoin, Dash, and Monero and they only handle about 4,000 transactions per day. The cryptocurrency market is clearly a two player game at this point.\n\nOverflow from Bitcoin?\n\nThe primary reason why Ethereum has jumped up in transaction volume may be due to overflow from Bitcoin. According to the Trustnodes article, Bitcoin’s capacity is limited. Even though there may be a higher demand than 250,000 transactions per day, not everyone can have their transaction processed which leads to a traffic jam of sorts. As users on this Reddit thread have speculated, it’s possible that the backlog of unconfirmed transactions on Bitcoin is causing more people to turn to Ethereum for faster, more efficient, and, most importantly, cheaper processing.\n\nRegardless of the reason, the fact that Ethereum is quickly catching up to Bitcoins transaction volumes is a good sign of the market’s longevity.

(Reuters)\n\nCryptocurrency\'s security prompting cyber-thieves to look for new channels of payment\n\nBitcoin is well-entrenched as the preferred payment for cyber-criminals like the WannaCry hackers who have hit more than 300,000 computers over the past week, but cryptocurrencies offering more anonymity are threatening to displace it.\n\nA key reason for bitcoin\'s dominance in the nefarious online underworld, say technologists and cybercrime experts, is its size - the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is more than twice that of the nearest of hundreds of rivals.\n\nThat makes it easy for victims to access enough to pay the ransoms demanded, and for hackers to cash out of it via online exchanges to spend money in the real world.\n\nBitcoin was set up in 2008 by someone - or some group - calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.\n\nMoney is sent from one anonymous online ""wallet"" to another with no need for a third party to validate or clear the transactions.\n\nIn the WannaCry attack, the addresses of three anonymous bitcoin wallets were given to victims, with a demand for ransom payments from $300 worth of bitcoin, with a promise the affected machines would be decrypted in return, a promise that no evidence has shown will be kept.\n\nBut since the way that Bitcoin functions is via the blockchain - a giant, virtually tamper-proof, shared ledger of all bitcoin transactions ever made - payments can be traced, if users do not have the sophistication to take further steps to cloak themselves using digital anonymity tools. ""In the initial days of bitcoin, people...didn\'t realise they were recording for posterity on the blockchain every financial transaction that ever took place,"" said Emin Gun Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University.\n\nBitcoin addresses are anonymous, but users can be traced through IP addresses or by analysing money flows.\n\nIf criminals using bitcoin want to stay truly anonymous, Gun Sirer said, they have to go through a number of additional, complex steps to make sure they do not get caught.', 'Litecoin has released its 2017 roadmap as investors delight in sustained price growth and low volatility.\n\nPublished on Litecoin Core, plans from various developers behind the altcoin range from major releases such as Litecoin 0.13.3 to user-focused improvements such as the relaunch of its Android app.\n\nLitecoin creator Charlie Lee announced the roadmap Wednesday, prior to Litecoin being buoyed by a series of encouraging announcements from the community.\n\nWe just published the Litecoin Roadmap for 2017: https://t.co/m4PVzx3RrC\n\n\n\nTo the moon!!! ?(°0°)? — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) May 17, 2017\n\nThe asset’s earlier implementation of SegWit, as well as preparation of Lightning Network and other so-called Layer 2 technology, is already paying dividends.\n\n“Better than Bitcoin”\n\nBitcoin core developer Eric Lombrozo repeated excitement surrounding the activation after the roadmap unveiling, noting “next generation tech” can already see the light of day on Litecoin.\n\nMeanwhile, content management platform Yours confirmed Thursday that it would launch on Litecoin and not Bitcoin “due to the fee situation.”\n\nWe have big news.

The Government withdrew the summons as to Mr. Berns, and argued in its opposition papers that the withdrawal mooted his motion.\n\nNow, though, the Government has since filed a new motion in an attempt to enforce the summons on Coinbase. Reacting to the motion, the law firm has proceeded to file a new motion to intervene in the enforcement proceeding and to quash the summons.\n\nIt’s also hoped that the two Coinbase customers will be able to proceed anonymously so as to stop the Government from withdrawing the summons and mooting the motion again.\n\nA statement from Berns Weiss LLP said the following:\n\nOn March 16, 2017, when the Government filed its petition to enforce the IRS summons, we indicated that we intended to file a motion to intervene and to quash the summons on behalf of Coinbase customers in order to protect them from this government overreach. As the Court recently directed the Government and Coinbase to agree on a schedule for Coinbase to oppose the petition, we have now filed such a motion seeking to insure that Coinbase’s customers are represented in the proceeding and that the Court has the opportunity to consider their perspective. Additionally, to prevent the Government from repeating its prior tactic of withdrawing the summons as to a proposed intervenor and then contending that the proposed intervenor’s motion to intervene is moot, Movants are seeking permission to proceed anonymously in this matter under fictitious names.\n\nThis is the latest development with the case, which began in November 2016 when the IRS started targeting Coinbase users, specifically bitcoiners. According to the IRS, they revealed in March that less than 1,000 were declaring their bitcoin profits or losses in their yearly tax returns after conducting an investigation from 2013 to 2015.\n\nIt remains to be seen how successful this latest motion from the IRS will be and whether or not the two individuals involved will succeed in challenging the new motion.\n\nHowever, with Coinbase issuing a statement in March stating they had not handed over any records under the summons, it seems unlikely that they will do so anytime soon.\n\nBerns Weiss LLP Partner Lee Weiss said:\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to finally litigate the merits of the IRS Summons and for the Court to consider the grave privacy and financial risks to which Coinbase’s customers will be exposed if the summons is enforced in its current form.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'You could almost see a baffled \'WTF\' come across Eric Lombrozo’s face as he watched Gavin Andresen at CoinDesk\'s Consensus 2016 conference.\n\nThe man many people saw as the leader of the bitcoin community, or at least a kind of elder statesman, Andresen had just affirmed that he was standing behind Craig Wright\'s claim that he was the cryptocurrency\'s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n""It was a very bizarre moment,"" Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core developer since 2011 recalls.\n\nLombrozo was not alone in that thinking. Andresen\'s announcement onstage was a bombshell that caused a commotion for the rest of the event with both community members and reporters, most of whom had dreamt about uncovering that story for years.\n\nBut that confirmation would never come. Namely, because the overwhelming consensus from the technical community was, as Lombrozo put it: ""There is absolutely no way he\'s Satoshi.""\n\nFor Andresen – a man so well-liked, so looked-up to, yet so resistant to his leadership role within the bitcoin community – to make this rash assumption in public with everyone watching, seemed curious, if not embarrassing.\n\nAs interviews reveal, however, it had deeper effects.\n\nWhat might seem like a harmless comment to some would do much to shake perceptions of Andresen among the very group of people he was supposedly leading.\n\nFame monster\n\nJust like the cryptocurrency itself, Andresen found himself in the spotlight nearly overnight, at least as it relates to any mainstream celebrity status.\n\nGraduating from Princeton with a computer science degree in 1988, he developed software for a number of companies before landing on a full-time role working on bitcoin alongside Satoshi Nakamoto in December 2010. Before this, though, he focused his career on 3D graphics and virtual reality modeling.\n\nFrom there, he dedicated his life to advancing public perception of bitcoin (at various points explaining it to the CIA and giving out by today\'s value thousands of dollars in bitcoin via a public website).\n\nAndresen proved effective in enlisting other developers in working on the open-source software protocol. Then, around early October 2013, the price per bitcoin started rising pretty quickly, from $133 on the first to more than $1,200 two months later.\n\nThere were glowing articles about his involvement, and as the industry grew from a swelling of investment in 2013 and 2014, he took positions as an advisor at key companies and a full-time position at the Bitcoin Foundation, the nascent industry\'s once-prominent advocacy group.\n\nAndresen as the face – at least the unmasked face – of bitcoin became a minor celebrity. And everyone wanted to know the backstory.\n\nThe persistent narrative that came from these inquiries was that, when Satoshi Nakamoto left the project, he happily handed the work over to Andresen.\n\nBut Lombrozo, and other developers, think the tale is a bit embellished. Sure, he said, Andresen deserves credit for bringing cryptographers and developers together to build the project, but Satoshi didn\'t really hand over the reins, he/she/they/it simply disappeared, they say.\n\nThe more romantic version of the story gave Andresen even more clout.\n\nAs more developers began working on the code and more venture-backed startups began building applications for the protocol emerged, Andresen still had a significant amount of influence over the path of the world\'s first decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\nIn an article titled, ""The Man Who Really Built Bitcoin"" from August 2014, MIT Technology Review conceded that, although there was infighting about the best way to scale the bitcoin protocol to handle more than seven transactions a second, ""One way or another, whatever Andresen decides on will probably get done.""\n\nAnother story\n\nYet, as a decentralized, open-source project, many developers who joined bitcoin perhaps weren\'t predisposed to such notions of hierarchy.\n\nAs it may be, one of the most misunderstood aspects of bitcoin is what a massive technical project it is, one that involves collaboration from a large group of interested parties and near-constant mundane tasks like code de-bugging. And as an outgrowth of the scaling debate, bitcoin has even come to encompass differing developer groups, working on competing implementations of the code.\n\nA developer like Peter Todd may specialize in asking hard questions about other developers\' ideas (trolling for the sake of improving ideas), while others like Matt Corallo specialize in training new developers. (Although these are far from something like traditional formal jobs.)\n\nFurther, Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival group of developers, is able to work on wholly different fixes that aim to make changes to the network.\n\nAs the lead maintainer for the project, Andresen played a key role in facilitating this work in bitcoin\'s early days. Today, development is overseen by Wladimir van der Laan (employed by MIT), but startups Chaincode Labs is the largest single supporter of Bitcoin Core development. MIT employs two full-time developers, while Blockstream supports Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell.\n\nSome members of Core don\'t have any relationship to a startup or company, others do. Yet, they\'re all united by an active, and public, mailing list that serves as the basis for formal discussion on project ideas.\n\nIt\'s perhaps a clash of cultures then that came to a head the day Andresen took the stage at the Marriott Marquis in New York and vouched for Wright. Not a week later, Andresen\'s ability to make changes to code had been revoked.\n\nDisagreements emerge\n\nBehind the scenes, Andresen and the other developers had also started butting heads about other things.\n\nWladimir van der Laan, Bitcoin Core\'s lead developer and maintainer, told CoinDesk, that even before Andresen turned the position over to him, he had been doing most of the ""maintainer tasks"".\n\nHis statements, and those of others, paint a portrait of someone increasingly divorced from the day-to-day efforts that kept the project up and running 24/7.\n\n""Not only was [Andresen] not writing code, he wasn\'t discussing on the developer IRC nor on GitHub, nor reviewing code,"" Van der Laan said.\n\nWhile internally, Andresen had passed his leadership role onto Van der Laan, externally, Lombrozo said: ""[H]e still paraded himself around as the leader, as someone that had control.""\n\nAnd this is where things really went sour.\n\nHow Andresen saw his influence within the Core developer community was evident during a 2015 CoinScrum event in London, where Mike Hearn, a former Core contributor, and Andresen spoke about the continuing block size contention.\n\n""A lot of people are pushing me to be more of a dictator,"" Andresen said, as Hearn took a swig of a beer and pointed at himself. There was discussion then from an audience member about calling his role something other than ""dictator"", such as ""traffic cop"" or ""decision maker"". Andresen suggested ""ice breaker"".\n\nThen Andresen continued:\n\n""That may be what has to happen with the block size, frankly. I may just have to throw my weight around and say, \'This is the way it\'s going to be. And if you don\'t like it, find another project.\'""\n\nThis authoritarian statement seemed strange to participants in a community building a decentralized protocol that\'s always touted its imperviousness to control by any one person, group of people or state.\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, this event was only a month before Andresen started pushing for bigger blocks on his blog. And shortly after, when Corallo saw the posts, he brought it to the attention of the Core mailing list.\n\nAfter Corallo\'s post, Pieter Wuille, a Core developer since 2011 and co-founder of Blockstream, penned a response in support of increasing the block size, but wary about using Andresen\'s proposed method and hard forks.\n\nBackroom discussions\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, Andresen was talking to bitcoin companies such as Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain and Xapo, selling them a solution to the block size limitation that hadn’t gone through any peer review. Yet, to those participating in bitcoin development, there were channels of communication where such fixes were supposed to be brought up.\n\nBryan Bishop, a Core developer since 2014, said the Core team had sent Andresen multiple requests ""asking him to voluntarily step down from (mis)representing Bitcoin Core to the wider community"".\n\n""The fact that he went around the whole system, and people thought he was trying to circumvent peer review; that upset everyone,"" Lombrozo said. ""It wasn\'t the block size thing really.""\n\nAlthough, it also kind of was. Because Andresen\'s plan for increasing the block size was met with resistance by the other Bitcoin Core developers.\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, that\'s because there were technical concerns with his proposal, but Andresen was not willing to listen. Instead, Andresen went back to those companies he had spoken with and told them the fix was simple but Core wasn\'t interested in helping.\n\n""The problem was that he was misrepresenting himself as having some sort of special privilege in bitcoin development – but really anybody can show up and propose anything,"" Bishop said.\n\nObviously, this caused tension. Not only that, but also there\'s the perception, which still remains a point of contention today, that the Core development team is stubborn and uninterested in helping bitcoin businesses and in turn extending bitcoin to more and more consumers around the world. (It\'s even perhaps an outgrowth of the feud that bitcoin developers are even bundled into differing groups – Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Classic – at all.)\n\nAndresen created this ""expectation that a quick fix was there and that’s been a huge point of frustration,"" Lombrozo said.\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, no one knew how pervasive Andresen’s involvement was with advising startups and at least he thought most bitcoin companies had executives following Core communication channels for updates.\n\n""To be honest, it caught me a little by surprise,"" he said. ""Although, in hindsight it\'s obvious, there were tons of flags everywhere.""\n\nBishop seconded that:\n\n""Alarm bells were already ringing by the time Andresen began to use blog posts and social media to bypass peer review.""\n\nThe blog Bishop mentioned was Andresen\'s own, where he sometimes conveniently skirted issues the Bitcoin Core mailing list was discussing. This, something most people would find aggravating, though, Bishop analyzed more pragmatically.\n\n""Security work requires very careful review and analysis,"" he said. ""When you bypass peer review, you\'re going to miss a lot of bugs and incompatibilities.""\n\nCould money have been involved as some in the community have suggested? Andresen was getting paid by the Bitcoin Foundation and held advisory roles at startups.\n\n""I don\'t know [Andresen\'s] main motivation but he was trying to make a career out of advising companies in the bitcoin space,"" said Lombrozo. ""And he was sort of telling them what they wanted to hear, that scaling was possible and easy, because why tell them it was going to take a long time and be complicated, right?""\n\nHe continued: ""And that came back to bite him pretty hard.""\n\nA nasty core\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, though, some Core developers and the group’s supporters took unpopular stances that the block size should never be raised, but that wasn\'t the pervasive sentiment. Core had trouble abating that idea, though, since Andresen who had been the frontman for the corporates and public for some time had already passed the torch to a much less public Van der Laan.\n\nNot to mention, Lombrozo went on, explaining the issues was difficult in that it required an in-depth knowledge of the protocol to understand the trade-offs. Plus, he said, the way some Core developers and its supporters reacted was less than ideal, many times brash, if not stooping to the level of personal attacks. Especially on the Core team\'s communication channels, which didn’t scale well as the community expanded rapidly.\n\nSo off Andresen went, joining forces with Hearn, who\'s now a developer at bank-focused blockchain consortium, R3, to push an alternative implementation called Bitcoin XT.\n\n""That was the beginning of the politicization,"" lamented Lombrozo.\n\nBishop agrees, saying, the narrative that \'Core doesn\'t listen\' is easily discounted by the fact that anyone can send any of the Core developers an email at any time.\n\n""The reason for the \'Core doesn\'t listen\' idea is because lots of people were too busy talking in secret with Andresen,"" Bishop said. ""And he didn\'t really bridge the communication gap with the developers.""\n\nAlthough, Lombrozo doesn\'t think Andresen intended for that politicization to turn into the big mess that it has today (Lombrozo is still cordial with Andresen), there\'s no doubt the issue is one of the biggest on the table for the now eight-year-old digital currency protocol.\n\nOlive branch or poisoned apple?\n\nWhile Andresen’s moves seem to have caused an unstoppable rift in the bitcoin community, some Core developers have reached out ""to extend an olive branch"".\n\n""I would prefer him to be more aligned in working together with people,"" said a Core developer that wanted to remain anonymous. “But realistically that’s probably not going to happen.""\n\nAndresen, the developer said, is still friendly, but there’s an awkwardness now and many Core developers hold grudges because of the perception that he betrayed, if not completely sold out, the team.\n\nAnd everything seemed to implode that summer day on the stage at Consensus.\n\n“I don’t know,” said Lombrozo, in response to inquiries about Andresen’s belief in Wright. ""From what I’ve heard, Wright is a very charming, magician sort of guy. I haven’t met him myself, but I know others who have and they say he’s a really good con man.""\n\nAccording to folks in the bitcoin community, Wright invited Andresen, likely because Andresen had influence over the community, to London and convinced him he was Satoshi.\n\nFor someone that\'s spent years working on the bitcoin protocol, even interacting with a masked Satoshi during the early years, it seems odd that Andresen would fall for a scam. But Lombrozo suspects Andresen wasn’t complicit in any scam, but instead just got tricked.\n\nVan der Laan agrees, saying it was a ""confidence scam"" Andresen fell for.\n\n""That can happen, but even confronted with evidence he kept saying Wright was Satoshi,"" he said. ""For that reason we decided to remove him from the development team.""\n\nVan der Laan concluded:\n\n""He had become more of a risk to the project than a boon.""\n\nSo where is he now?\n\nSince the Wright debacle, Andresen has been weirdly absent from bitcoin news.\n\nVia email, Andresen himself said, ""I\'ve been avoiding getting myself into any press lately, and that\'s been going well so I\'m going to keep doing that.""\n\nAlthough, in recent months he’s been tweeting more than usual about the block size debate. He\'s also a co-signer of a still unreleased bitcoin scaling proposal being put forward by Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert.\n\n""He keeps repeating the \'block size must increase\' line without being involved in any innovations that are happening,"" said Van der Laan.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Andresen did offer some confirmation on the blockchain-focused jobs he was last known to be working. He resigned, not only from the Bitcoin Foundation, but also MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative early in the year.\n\nR3’s Hearn said in an email, “The last time I talked to Gavin, he wanted to disconnect from the blockchain/cryptocurrency space and spend more time working with his local community.”\n\nOther than keeping an interested eye on the block size debate, though, Andresen was advising some cryptocurrency projects and involved in zcash to a certain extent, all while working on a stealth project.\n\nThis stealth project people referenced might be the Random Sanity Project Andresen tweeted about at the beginning of this month. The project, perhaps owing to the continued debate about Andresen himself, was met with both praise and skepticism on Twitter and Reddit.\n\nCorrection: An early version of this article stated that Blockstream was the largest supporter of core development. This has been revised.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.

Trying to stay objective with mild to extreme euphoria in times like this can be difficult. As someone who was a new trader during the 2013 bubble, the chart is beginning to look very similar.\n\n\n\nMarket capitalization and trading volume both on exchanges and over-the-counter markets have hit ATHs as well.\n\nDespite being in price discovery mode, there is an established, longstanding trend we can compare the current price against, as well as the entire left side of the chart. Past results don’t always predict the future, but they can influence it.\n\nThere are a few questions we can investigate:\n\nIs the price near an interim top? Is the price nearing parabolic conditions? Will the price continue on the previous trend at the same rate?\n\nLooking at the monthly Bitstamp chart, there have not been too many candles of this proportion. This would suggest we are nearing bubble-like conditions.\n\nPrice has also begun to close outside of the longstanding trend. This weekly candle has not closed yet, but if it does close outside of the diagonal, it will be the first weekly candle to do so. This again points to breaking the trend strongly to the upside.\n\nFibonacci retracement and extensions are admittedly partly magic voodoo, but there are plenty of traders who use and watch them to make the resistance and support levels legitimate. Drawing this Fibonacci from the local high established on March 10, 2017, to the low on January 14, 2015, several Fibonacci extensions emerge as well.\n\nThese can be seen as resistance levels, the next being the 1.618 at $2,088. Although the horizontal levels are arbitrary, we can confidently predict resistance based on the fit of the previous horizontals. Most of the prior “Fibs” match the price. This should be seen less as curve fitting and more as levels that just make sense. Based on the Fibonacci levels alone, there is not necessarily evidence for top or bubble just yet.\n\nWe can tease apart the trend even further by using the Fibonacci tool on each previous high and low.\n\nIn the trend, a consolidation from the previous high to low has yielded a price that has seen resistance at the 2.272 Fibonacci extension. Currently, the price has exceeded the previous 2.272 Fibonacci extension and shown it was supported based on the multiple candle touches. This suggests price is moving faster than the previous trend as well as closer to bubble-like conditions.\n\nFor low-timeframe, intra-day trading, there was a long entry signal when the price cleanly broke the consolidation triangle. On the next correction, pullback or consolidation event, I’d expect the support diagonal (green) to remain the same.\n\nRemember that splashy gold parity headline? BTC is now sitting several hundred dollars above it.\n\nSummary\n\nBitcoin is making ATHs by almost every available metric: price, market capitalization, volume, hashrate, difficulty and fee per transaction. Although $2,000 is the next milestone and resistance target, the price will likely exceed that level based on the strength and rate at which the price is exceeding current trends. Watch for signs of a large pullback or correction in the near future, two to three months at the latest, based on previous price history.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

More than half (57 percent) of companies with between 501 and 1,000 employees said they kept this digital currency on hand.\n\nBy comparison, only 36 percent of organizations with between 250 and 500 employees and less than a fifth (18 percent) of companies with over 2,000 employees said they stored Bitcoin.\n\nEmergency caches such as these do ensure organizations can ""regain access to important intellectual property or business critical data"" in the event they suffer an extortion-based attack like ransomware. After all, most ransomware infections go hand in hand. Bob Wice of Beazley Group elaborated on this point for NBC News:\n\n""Part of the everyday ransomware demand is Bitcoin, because it\'s easy to get and it\'s the currency of choice for the criminal underground.""\n\nCompanies got to witness computer criminals\' preference for Bitcoins firsthand on 12 May when an updated version of WannaCry ransomware swept the United Kingdom\'s National Health Service (NHS), Telefonica, and other organizations using an exploit for a Windows vulnerability. (The NSA developed the attack, code which the Shadow Brokers hacker group eventually obtained and leaked online.)\n\nBy 15 May, the ransomware had swept across 150 countries and claimed more than 200,000 victims. Every affected machine displayed the same demands: $300 in Bitcoin.\n\nIt makes sense that organizations would want to be prepared for ransomware attacks. Dr. Simon Moores, Britain\'s former technology ambassador and chairman of the annual international e-Crime Congress, clarified this perspective:\n\n""I\'ve often heard expressed that intelligence agencies and law enforcement act on a reactive basis. Once it\'s into your system, there\'s not much they can do about it.... It\'s all well and good to catch up to the actors and prosecute them, but that doesn\'t help you if you happen to be a financial institution or a business and data is mission critical.""\n\nTrue. But businesses realize there are risks other than ransomware that threaten their ""mission critical"" data, right? One of their production servers could crash, or a fire could damage their data center. How could companies recover if a non-ransomware incident affected their data?\n\nThe answer isn\'t obvious. Citrix observed in 2016 that a third of UK companies didn\'t back up their data. This is a HUGE missed opportunity. With data backups, not only do organizations have hope of restoring their data if an asset goes down or if they experience a physical disaster. They can also recover from a ransomware incident without paying the ransom.\n\nIf your company doesn\'t back up its mission critical data, you begin doing so ASAP. Here is a great place to start.', ""Image: Jim Urquhart / Reuters (Image for illustrative purposes only) Image: Jim Urquhart / Reuters (Image for illustrative purposes only)\n\nBitcoin prices are on the rise. Over the last year, they were up by 330 percent and are currently traded at $ 1810. The price has shot up by 60 percent over the last month and that has attracted many Indians to this crypto-currency. Bitcoin price on Zebpay, an app-based bitcoin exchange mainly for Indian investors, works out to Rs 1.32 lakh.The overall price of the currency has gone up on news that many countries are now making bitcoins legal. Japan has started to accept bitcoin as legal currency with consumer retailer Bic Camera leading the pack. This has resulted in the price of crypto-currency shooting up by 80 percent over the last one month, making Japan the largest bitcoin market in the world. Investors expect a lot more countries to make legal use of bitcoins. However, investors still need to be careful and hold only around 5 percent of bitcoins in their overall portfolio.Russia has decided to regulate the currency and plans to make it legal in the near future, according to Bloomberg. Australia will accept bitcoins as legal currency from July 2017 and it will also be exempt from goods and service tax. In early March, the SEC rejected a proposal to launch an exchange traded fund (ETF) based on bitcoins. But now there is optimism that it is ready to review the proposal made by the Winklevoss twins who played a role in the creation of Facebook. If the application goes through, the bitcoin ETF will be one-of-its-kind that will allow retail investors to easily hold the asset in their portfolio.The use of bitcoins surges when economies go through bad patches, political or financial crisis. That is the reason why it is also known as “Digital Gold”. Take for example, Venezuela. Since the time the country went through a political crisis under the rule of Hugo Chavez on the back of falling oil prices, violence erupted on the streets of the country. People had problems getting out of their homes. In such situations, many middle-class citizens took to bitcoin mining and started purchasing basic everyday items with the use of bitcoins on the internet (for more details listen to the econtalk podcast with Jim Epstein).Bitcoin analysts feel this is a trend that will be seen in countries where economies are not stable or their home currencies are volatile. Many Chinese are also taking to bitcoins as the yuan continues to fall. China is turning out to be one of the big markets for bitcoin trading.Similarly, Indians are slowly catching on the bitcoin fever. But most of them are doing it for the wrong reasons. They want to take a quick punt on rising prices of bitcoins and this can be dangerous. The number of downloads for Zebpay, has moved above its 500,000 mark. The exchange in its press release has said the present milestone shows the growing acceptance of bitcoin as one of the most emerging asset class.While we can agree that bitcoin is an emerging asset class, the only problem is that the price is volatile and the asset class is new. Sceptics feel that the bitcoin is now another investment fad which will go through the dotcom style boom and bust cycle where investors would understand the importance of the technology but will not be able to value the same. A rise in bitcoin prices has led to a surge in Ponzi schemes in India where gullible Indians were made to invest into such schemes. The Reserve Bank of India has cautioned people against the use of bitcoins.“If you are buying bitcoins for the short term, it is a bad idea. But if your horizon is above two years, you can still make returns from here. But bitcoins should not exceed more than 5 to 10 percent of your entire portfolio as there is a lot of volatility associated to the crypto-currency,” says Vishal Gupta, CEO, Searchtrade, a bitcoin technology and trading venture.The currency has been used by terrorists and criminals. The recent Wannacry ransomeware attackers also demanded payments in bitcoins which bothers regulators or countries who want to legalise bitcoin as a currency. But countries are working out solutions and Japan and Australia are showing the way.If more countries make it a legal currency, the chances of the price going up is high. Besides, the number of bitcoins that will ever be mined will be restricted at 21 million. Today the total number of bitcoins mined works out to 16.33 million. The next 4.6 million bitcoins will take some time to mine as bitcoin miners will be constrained in terms of computing power. So there are more reasons to believe that the price of this crypto-currency should ideally go up from here as well. But buyers will have to be careful and study this currency before investing.Here are some resources about bitcoins:## Major World Events That Affect Bitcoin's Value ## Writer, reporter, and film producer Jim Epstein talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts about mining Bitcoins in Venezuela as a way to import food ## Nathaniel Popper of the New York Times and the author of Digital Gold talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts about Bitcoin .

This was triggered by the US Bitcoin exchange market and the rise in demand for Bitcoin amid severe political uncertainty.\n\nEarlier today, Cointelegraph reported that US stock exchanges, bonds and assets plunged amidst troubles surrounding the Trump administration.\n\nEvercore ISI Executive Dennis DeBusschere specifically emphasized the Trump-Comey memo incident as the catalyst for market turbulence.\n\nBloomberg also reported that the Democratic party has started talks about impeachment, which led to a further decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell by more than 370 points yesterday.\n\n“What has been setting in over the course of the day is that political uncertainty is something that’s likely going to be with us for a significant amount of time. We may be looking at a higher volatility backdrop with a trending lower market for the next couple of months,” said DeBusschere.\n\nCointelegraph also reported that the US Bitcoin exchange market surpassed the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market by trading volume, which hasn’t happened since 12 months ago.\n\nJapan has maintained complete dominance over the global Bitcoin exchange market. The explosive surge in demand for Bitcoin from US-based investors and traders allowed its exchange market to surpass that of Japan for a brief period of time.\n\nThe demand for Bitcoin in the US is rapidly increasing due to the wide regard of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, alongside gold. In fact, prominent gold investors including Mike Maloney have urged investor and traders to hold Bitcoin in their portfolios as a mandatory asset to avoid market turbulence and economic certainty.\n\nSpeaking of Bitcoin’s high liquidity, transportability and decentralized nature, Maloney stated:\n\nI don’t own a lot of cryptocurrencies but I think it is something that is necessary to be prepared because if the monetary system fails, you’ll be able to do transactions right away with other people and you can do them over long distances. You can do them over the Internet just like you pay with your credit card today.”\n\nSustained momentum\n\nThe upward trend and momentum of Bitcoin price could be sustained and stabilized if the demand for Bitcoin in the US and Japanese Bitcoin exchange markets continue to increase. It is evident that the demand for Bitcoin in the Japanese exchange market is rising rapidly simply due to its price. Bitcoin is being traded at a high premium of $1,975, a price that is more than $100 higher than that of the US and European exchange markets.\n\nAs DeBusschere explained, the US stock markets and the economy could struggle in recovering within the next few months, which is an enough time frame for Bitcoin price to stabilize and maintain its momentum.\n\nHowever, some investors including Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust, stated that if the economy holds up, Trump troubles and other political incidents will be absorbed to recover market stability.\n\n""Even if we have a big, prolonged mess in Washington, it\'s not going to necessarily hurt the economy. As long as the economy holds up, I think the market is going to brush off what is going on in Washington,” said Roth.']"
05/20/2017,"['The world’s most popular cryptocurrency is now worth over $2,000 per coin. That’s according to a range of bitcoin exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken. That valuation puts the total market cap of bitcoin — the total number of coins in circulation — at $32.92 billion.\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear this year, as this chart from Coindesk shows.\n\nBitcoin first broke the $1,000 valuation mark way back in 2013, but a combination of factors — including the implosion of then-top exchange Mount Gox — saw the currency drop in value. Support from financial institutions trialed bitcoin and blockchain-based services, and a general stability following new regulation in China, saw bitcoin return to the $1,000 mark again at the end of last year. Since then, its valuation has continued to grow consistently through 2017.\n\nWhen we wrote about bitcoin (and ethereum) hitting all-time highs back at the end of April, you could buy a bitcoin coin for $1,343. Now, some three weeks later, the valuation is up 50 percent. The price of a coin rose 12 percent over the past week alone.\n\nBut bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency on the rise. Ripple, the centralized currency that is aiming to be a settlement protocol for major banks, has surged more than 10x, or 1000% in under a month making it now the second most valuable cryptocurrency (only behind bitcoin) in circulation.\n\nSimilarly, ethereum, a cryptocurrency designed to function as a blockchain-based computing platform for developers, is now trading $130 per coin with a total market cap of just under $12B, which represents a a little more than a 2x increase over the last month.\n\nThe result of these increases is that bitcoin no longer constitutes the majority of the market cap for all cryptocurrencies. Today the total market cap of bitcoin represents just 47% of total cryptocurrencies – up until a few months ago it consistently hovered around 80%.\n\nWhy have these other cryptocurrencies been performing so much better than bitcoin? Some say it’s because of bitcoin’s scaling issue. The currency has grown so large that the network is having trouble quickly confirming transactions unless users attach hefty fees for minors. And while the problem can be fixed with solutions like SegWit or Bitcoin Unlimited, the most powerful miners (who effectively control the codebase of bitcoin) haven’t been able to come to a consensus on which new protocol to implement.\n\nWhile increases of 10x in a month would typically be an obvious sign of a bubble, it’s a little different with cryptocurrencies because no one really knows how much they should be worth. Unlike a company there are no assets or revenues we can use to assess a predictable valuation. So in one sense, a total cryptocurrency market cap of $70B is insane – considering there is no tangible value behind it.\n\nBut on the other hand, if (any of) these cryptocurrencies actually replace or supplant a global store of value like gold, then $70B is nothing. For example, the total estimated value of all gold mined is around $8.2 trillion USD. Meaning that right now all cryptocurrencies put together don’t even equal 1% of the world’s gold reserves. Similarly, there is currently about $1.5 trillion USD in circulation, meaning that all cryptocurrencies today are still worth less than 5% of USD in circulation.\n\nThe currency is in unchartered waters at $2,000, but some pundits believe it has the potential to reach $10,000 (or more). To achieve this the community would likely have to sort out the scaling issue, which would give investors confidence that bitcoin’s infrastructure be able to support it as it grows.', 'Bitcoin price rocketed above $2000 against the US Dollar, and now it looks like there can be continuous gains in BTC/USD towards $2100-2200.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price soared higher and cleared a major hurdle at $2000 against the US Dollar, as mentioned in the last weekly analysis.\n\nThere are a few important bullish trend lines with support at $1980 and $1850 formed on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nThe price is likely to continue moving higher, and may soon break $2100 for further gains.\n\nBitcoin price rocketed above $2000 against the US Dollar, and now it looks like there can be continuous gains in BTC/USD towards $2100-2200.\n\nBitcoin Price Crucial Supports\n\nIn the last weekly analysis, I mentioned that Bitcoin price may soon head towards $2000 against the US Dollar. It did move higher, broke the $1900 resistance and even cleared $2000. A new all-time high was formed at $2072 recently, and the price looks set for more gains. The most important point is the fact that the price is well positioned above $2000.\n\nThe two bullish trend lines highlighted in the last weekly analysis are still active at $1850 and $1700. There is one more formed with support at $1980 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. So, if the pair corrects lower, there are many supports waiting on the downside around $2000. Moreover, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1717 low to $2072 high is at $1988. So, we can witness a nice reaction around $2000 if the price dips from the current levels.\n\nThe overall trend is bullish with chances of a break above $2072 for a move above $2100. The price may even target $2150 and $2200 during the coming sessions. On the downside, we can keep an eye on $2000 and $1850 as crucial supports.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is currently super bullish, calling for more gains.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is heading higher in the overbought levels.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1980\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $2100\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Yesterday it handled around 319,000, but it varies up and down due to its backlogs which might be forcing users to not transact.\n\nThat means ethereum is now handling more than 50% of bitcoin’s transaction volumes, transferring yesterday nearly $2 billion worth of value without any congestion or backlog as eth transactions usually confirm in seconds.\n\nThe increase in volume corresponds to a considerable increase in price, with the currency yesterday experiencing a jump from around $87 to $122, showing a strong correlation between transaction levels and price.\n\nEthereum’s market cap, however, has not yet reached 50% of bitcoin’s, currently standing at around 36%, with both currencies moving up recently as bitcoin now stands within touching distance of $2,000, a doubling from a few months ago.\n\nEthereum has had a lot of recent news, but it’s not clear why bitcoin is increasing considering its backlog of around 200,000 that continues for the fourth day running, high fees, as well as a number of businesses moving to other chains while bitcoin hasn’t seen any new ones or new projects.\n\nIt may be because of recent front page publicity due to the ransom attacks, while ethereum has attracted attention more because of the many new projects that have and continue to launch as well as the Ethereal Summit yesterday.\n\nCan Eth Handle the Volume?\n\nEth’s rate of adoption is fairly remarkable with its transaction volumes far higher than any other digital currency, except for bitcoin. Some merchants have even began accepting it for commerce, but most of the volume probably comes from smart contracts.\n\nAt this rate of growth, it might overtake bitcoin’s transaction volumes, not least because bitcoin can’t currently handle any more. Unlike bitcoin, it would continue operating normally, but next year or in 2019 it might begin needing more capacity.\n\nThat is planned to be provided in two ways. One of them is Raiden, a second layer protocol similar to the Lightning Network, which can be used by smart contracts and repeated payments businesses. It was in alpha last year and plans to launch any time now.\n\nThe second scaling method is on-chain with Vitalik Buterin stating they plan to use “a combination of sharding schemes, random sampling, heavy use of Merkle proofs and asynchronous calling in order to increase the potential transaction throughput from ~10-20 transactions per second to over 100,000.”\n\nThat should be plenty of capacity if achieved with plans to increase it gradually through proof of stake and sharding. So the network should be able to handle demand with its current version probably working fine at 1 million transactions a day while future versions might handle a billion or more.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem is also proving to be one of its greatest problems. With a mounting number of unconfirmed transactions, transfer costs are going up. This move forces companies to come up with creative solutions. Unfortunately, that means these companies pass transaction fees on to their customers. Bitpay is the latest company to do so. It is very unfortunate this is happening during such a critical time in Bitcoin’s history.\n\nOn the one hand, it makes sense for BitPay to stop paying transaction fees. The company specializes in processing Bitcoin payments. They also charge a 1% fee to do so, which is more than fair. However,t hat 1% fee is not enough to provide such a service and pay the transaction fee. With mounting costs to send Bitcoin on the network, it is only normal customers pay for these fees themselves.\n\nA Radical Change for All Bitpay Users\n\nCome June 20, 2017, BitPay will pass these fees onto their customer base. The company will no longer fully subsidize the miner fee cost of sending refunds. That can prove to be somewhat of a problem for anyone accepting Bitcoin payments right now. It is another cost merchants will need to take into account when enabling this alternative payment method. Whether or not this will affect Bitcoin growth, remains anybody’s guess at this point.\n\nUnfortunately, BitPay is not the only company to make this decision. Various exchanges are no longer subsidizing miner’s fees either. That was only to be expected, though. The Bitcoin transaction costs have been going up for many months now. Especially during times of network congestion, such as what is happening right now. Miners reap the benefits from higher fees, as they make more money. However, if people were to stop sending transactions, that wouldn’t bode well for miners either.\n\nThe bigger question is how this will affect alternative cryptocurrencies. Any coin that is not Bitcoin has much lower transaction cost. Litecoin could become a major contender for Bitcoin in this regard. The Litecoin network has SegWit activated and the Lightning Network is being implemented. If Bitcoin developers don’t solve these problems quickly, things could change very quickly. Other currencies, such as Ethereum, may be used more commonly for payments as well.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Bitcoin price finally breached the much anticipated $2,000 line, sending excitement throughout the burgeoning global cryptocurrency community. As early as five a.m. GMT+2 on Saturday, CoinMarketCap listed the pacesetter of digital currency for $2014 with almost $34 mln Market Cap.\n\nThe $2,000 lane has been expected for some time now but it intensified three days ago when Satoshi Nakamoto\'s brainchild stabilized at the $1,800 range.\n\nOn Friday it made it to the $1,900s further increasing the $2,000 price obsession.\n\nAs much as it is good news for the whole community, what does this mean for all of us? What is in it for the ecosystem? Experts and community members differ on what’s ahead.\n\nLingham: not healthy\n\nBitcoin Price Pundit Vinny Lingham is not excited about the current price trend and sees it as very deleterious for the space. ""Not healthy in my opinion, but clearly everyone else knows best,"" he noted. ""I\'ll just wait and see.""\n\nMalcolm Macleod: problems remain\n\nMore so, Gulden Wallet Developer, Malcolm Macleod\'s concern is that the price has been pushed too high, without the fundamentals to back it up and ultimately it is damaging to the ecosystem.\n\nHe cites particularly the ongoing transaction queue problems.\n\n""These things are always a mixed bag, so probably some good and some bad things come from it,"" Malcolm stated.\n\nMore flow from fiat\n\nBut Alexandro Colorado of Bitcoin Mexico believes otherwise. For him, even though Bitcoin certainly has the availability issue but the rally has merits. ""It makes sense as there is more money coming into the system,"" Alexandro explained to Cointelegraph.\n\nThe Chief Cat Herder of Cryptopulco, the annual cryptocurrency conference in Acapulco, Mexico, Nathan T. Freeman had this to say:\n\n""BTC increases in value relative to USD because people are willing to give up more fiat currency in exchange for Bitcoin. If you try to explain why they are willing, you are projecting a motive for their subjective value, and you\'re most likely full of shit. Even if the motive you ascribe is correct, you can\'t prove it. It\'s just an unfalsifiable claim in a sea of individual choices. It\'s all good.""\n\nBitcoin Bubble to burst in 2019?\n\nThough the network is growing impressively, hitting pass $2,000 seems like an impending doom for some experts.\n\nWhilst others point to some nagging fundamentals, many are optimistic it will keep growing without any blemish.\n\nAlexandro Colorado says:\n\n""A bubble is some sort of manipulation but actual growth is another thing. Companies grow billions in months, why crypto shouldn\'t? The Mexico-based Bitcoin enthusiast pointed out that a lot of the world still don\'t know or trust crypto but it doesn\'t mean we are heading into a bubble.”\n\nWhen Cointelegraph asked Vinny Lingham if there is an impending bubble, this was his answer:\n\n""Yes, but people who called the bubble in 2011 were wrong. It took two years to burst.""\n\nCoin-flipper\n\nMalcolm MacLeod is unsure if there is going to be a burst, but it is unclear to him what fundamentals if there are any behind the latest price growth. ""I think there is a high chance that it is a bubble of some kind but I hope to be wrong,"" he indicated.\n\nAbsorbingly, this is Nathan T. Freeman\'s take on whether it is a bubble and will it burst soon:\n\n“There\'s only one major event in Bitcoin itself that could shape the future, and that\'s the outcome of the block size debate. All other factors are outside the purview of Bitcoin itself and therefore could shape out. Anyway, you\'re talking about predicting the simultaneous global effect of huge political shifts.”\n\n""Predicting a bubble is a dice roll, and anyone who claims to know those outcomes is a coin-flipper,"" he added.', ""In a bid to free its economy, Palestine is considering a digital national currency. But with Bitcoin around, is it worth reinventing the wheel?\n\nUsing foreign currencies\n\nThere are many countries that do not have a national currency and instead use another country’s currency in daily lives. For example, East Timor, British Virgin Islands, Palau and Zimbabwe use the US dollar. Similarly, Montenegro, San Marino and Kosovo use the Euro. The case of Palestine is an interesting one as it uses multiple currencies like the US dollar, Jordanian Dinar and the Israeli Shekel.\n\nNow, it has emerged that the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) is planning its own digital currency, something of a Palestinian Bitcoin.\n\nEnter the Palestinian Pound\n\nThere are a number of digital currencies already in circulation. Bitcoin, of course, is the most popular and widely used of them all. These currencies are not issued by a central monetary authority like a central bank.\n\nHowever, inspired by them some central banks have been mulling the idea of launching national cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nWe reported that Senegal was introducing a national cryptocurrency as an example. Similar plans have also been discussed with regards to Sweden and China.\n\nA Palestinian currency thus would not be the first or unique in this respect but it does bring to fore an interesting use case: countries that have trouble printing their own currencies due to one reason or another can explore a digital currency alternative.\n\nThe proposed digital currency would be called the Palestine Pound.\n\nSkirting Israeli curbs\n\nThe proposed digital currency can help Palestinians skirt around Israeli curbs that have been imposed and the need for obtaining clearance from them.\n\nAzzam Shawwa, Governor of the Palestine Monetary Authority was quoted by Reuters as saying:\n\n“If we print currency, to get it into the country you would always need clearance from the Israelis and that could be an obstacle, So that is why we don't want to go into it.”\n\nThe digital currency would largely eliminate that problem for the Palestinians. According to Reuters another problem that PMA might encounter is the 1994 Paris Protocol, which gives PMA the legitimacy of a central bank but does not allow it to issue currency. The Paris Protocol suggests that the Palestinians use the Israeli currency - The Shekel instead.\n\nFive-year strategy\n\nAccording to what the PMA governor told Reuters, the Palestine Pound is a part of the bank’s ‘five-year strategy’, which will be published before the end of 2017.\n\nThe governor also revealed that the digital currency route is a preferred alternative. It would be interesting to see if the Palestinians could pull off a national cryptocurrency in the short to medium term.\n\nHowever, the governor seems to realize the scope of the wider challenge that awaits him. He revealed to Reuters:\n\n“But it's not only the currency, you have to see the economy also. Issuing (a currency) is something, but you also need the backbone of the currency; reserves, gold, oil and that is part of the business plan.”\n\nBitcoin to help oppressed\n\nWhile a national currency for Palestine may or may not happen, countries that do not have their own currencies can always use Bitcoin as an alternative.\n\nAs Max Keiser wrote way back in 2013 in RT:\n\n“Bitcoin, like the spiritual leaders who have come before it in the Middle-Eastern desert, is a miraculous gift capable of transforming an oppressed, forgotten people. The Palestinian economy is a multi-billion dollar economy that unfortunately benefits mostly outsiders. But if Bitcoin were adopted as the official currency, Palestinians would be able to shape their own economic destiny and in so doing their sovereign destiny.”\n\nIf economic independence is the stated aim of the PMA, then it should probably explore what already exists instead of reinventing the wheel."", 'Jeffrey Dorfman, an economics professor at the University of Georgia, sees bitcoin as an asset rather than a currency. Writing in Forbes that value of the cryptocurrency increased 140% in 2016 and 49% in the past month, Dorfman maintains the swings in either an upward or downward direction do not make bitcoin a plausible currency as much as a speculative asset.\n\nBitcoin does not make a good currency for two key reasons: its unstable value and its slow transaction time.\n\nDorfman claims the most important feature a currency has is being a stable store of value. This factor is important to a developing economy trying to attract investment. It is also important for developed countries to allow investors to earn the returns they expect on investments. An unstable currency makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of future earnings.\n\nBecause uncertainty makes investments less valuable, less investment occurs.\n\nBitcoin Price Swings\n\nThe value of bitcoin changed an average 2% over the last month, Dorfman noted. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, by contrast, was under 1% and only changed 3% for the full month. There were seven days when the value of the cryptocurrency changed more than 3%, which is more than the dollar’s value changed for the full month.\n\nPeople do not want debts or investments denominated in a currency with value changing by nearly 50% monthly, Dorfman observed.\n\nAs for transactions, bitcoin is slow due to the process of protecting the security of its blockchain.\n\nThere are restrictions on how many bitcoin transactions can be completed in a day. Changing the rules for processing BTC transactions has met resistance in the bitcoin community from those who wish to preserve its traceability and anonymity.\n\nDorfman claims bitcoin’s security negates its value for everyday use.\n\nHe said the cryptocurrency’s main value is for speculation and for shielding transactions. It is a commodity asset that people trade.\n\nAlso read: Coinbase VP: BTC is demonstrating signs of a currency\n\nSpeculation’s Value\n\nSpeculation has value, Dorfman noted. It adds to market liquidity and determines assets’ market value. Where bitcoin differs from other assets is that it does not have an underlying use. One can invest in jewelry or gold, for instance. Bitcoin, by contrast, is used to hide wealth, conceal illegal transactions and to trade in order to gain or lose value.\n\nBitcoin’s popularity, Dorfman noted, confirms the value many people see in the cryptocurrency. He said he has no problem with people using bitcoin for these reasons, but people should stop expecting it to be a currency for everyday transactions. It is destined to remain in its niche to speculate and to conceal.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin mining hardware firm Canaan has acquired document timestamping service Proof of Existence.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Manuel Araoz and Esteban Ordano, the service lets users verify the existence of documents by linking them to transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAs part of the deal, Araoz will join Canaan as an advisor, working on new product initiatives at the startup.

They discuss how bitcoin began and how it took off, some of the biggest potential draws and drawbacks for adoption, how regulators are responding to bitcoin, how bitcoins are made, and much more.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on May 15, 2017.\n\nGaby Lapera: Hello, everyone! Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. You\'re listening to the Financials edition, taped today on Monday, May 15, 2017. My name is Gaby Lapera, and joining me on the phone is Brian Patrick Eha, a journalist whose work has been published by Fortune, The New Yorker, and CNNMoney, and a variety of other publications. Hey, Brian! How\'s it going?\n\nBrian Patrick Eha: Hey, it\'s going well. How are you?\n\nLapera: I\'m doing pretty good. I\'m excited to have you on the show. Brian is here to talk about his book, How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance. Listeners, this is super exciting for me. I knew very, very little about bitcoin before reading this book. This book got me sufficiently up to speed that I could talk about bitcoin on a different show and actually sound mostly coherent. I didn\'t even get any emails saying, ""You have no idea what you\'re talking about,"" so I know I must have been right. [laughs] But, yeah, let\'s start with some of the basics, for people who have never heard of bitcoin, which, I don\'t think there are that many people left, but it\'s still a pretty confusing topic. So, what is bitcoin? What\'s blockchain technology? Why are those two things always going together?\n\nEha: Sure. In the simplest terms, bitcoin is a form of commodity money. When it was released in January 2009, originally, its promise was to be a truly universal currency, a form of electronic cash that could be sent around the globe in minutes, that would work as well in New York as it does in New Delhi. Transactions were supposed to be anonymous. It all happened on a network that existed independently of any government or bank. So, bitcoin can serve as a unit of exchange, something with which you buy a plane ticket or a pair of shoes, or as a store of value, like gold. That\'s the double meaning in commodity money. It\'s also a revolutionary payment system that can send money, in the form of bitcoins, directly from person to person in minutes anywhere in the world. Now, the blockchain is the technological breakthrough that makes bitcoin possible. It\'s basically a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger for recording transactions, which I know sounds like the least sexy thing in the world. But the revolutionary thing about it is that it allows for transactions to be verified and recorded without the need for a central authority, which normally would be a payments company like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) or Venmo, or it would be a government or a bank. So, the blockchain businesses and services of businesses can be decentralized. It simultaneously cuts out middlemen that add costs to the system, and it removes any single points of failure in the system, all in one fell swoop. So, a lot of financial institutions remain wary of bitcoin itself, but they have seized eagerly on blockchain technology, because it could cut their back-office costs, it could help them do a lot of things more quickly, more transparently, more cheaply. Large tech firms like Microsoft have done the same. So, they\'re all setting up blockchain labs and working groups to study it, and coming out with proof of concept, and so on.\n\nLapera: Yeah, that\'s really cool. I was reading that IBM was doing the same thing. It\'s crazy, because most people think IBM and they think ""stodgy,"" but this is pretty cutting-edge stuff. Actually, I want to get into something you said about cutting out the middleman. In your book, you talk about the history of bitcoin. What I hadn\'t realized, but what makes total sense in retrospect, is that bitcoin has a really strong libertarian streak. It\'s like a bunch of libertarian nerds who got together and were like, ""Everyone should be their own bank. There shouldn\'t be government interfering with people\'s financial matters."" Can you talk a little bit about the founding of bitcoin, and what that looked like?\n\nEha: Sure. By the time bitcoin came along cryptoanarchists and some digital libertarians had been talking for years about the need for digital cash that could just be peer-to-peer. Cryptoanarchists are essentially people who want to use encryption technology and peer-to-peer network culture to increase personal liberty, as they see it, and undermine state control. As a philosophical movement, cryptoanarchy emerged in the early 1990s in California among a group of people who called themselves cypherpunks.\n\nLapera: I love that name, by the way, so much. And it totally makes sense that it came out of California.\n\nEha: It was great branding, right?\n\nLapera: Yeah. Listeners, you might not know this, I love punk music, and I especially love punk music that has come out of California. So, if you ever want to chat about it with me, shoot me an email. But, go ahead, cypherpunks.\n\nEha: So, they were actually organized around this electronic mailing list not unlike the one on which Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin\'s creator, would later announce his invention to the world. So, these earlier guys, they made some attempts of their own to create digital cash, but there were a couple of problems they couldn\'t figure out how to solve. One was, if my money exists in electronic form, how do I keep it from being counterfeited and spent over and over again, the same way you can send infinite copies of a Word document or a digital photo? Satoshi solved that, and the first chapter of my book is all about these origins of bitcoin, its precursors, and what makes it a breakthrough that really rivals the invention of the telephone, or maybe even the internet. But, you\'re right, once bitcoin was invented, the libertarians and the cryptoanarchists were among the first to see its potential and start using it. You weren\'t aware of it because the later bitcoin users don\'t necessarily subscribe to those same ideals, they may even clash with those ideals of those radical early adopters. But, ordinary people today probably would never have heard of bitcoin if not for those crypto anarchists.\n\nLapera: From reading your book, it\'s really interesting because, it looks like the roots of bitcoin, the reason it really got started, was because these people with this libertarian bent who were using it to purchase things that are, perhaps, not legal in the wider world. I\'m talking specifically about Silk Road. That\'s also an outgrowth of ""the government shouldn\'t be able to tell me what to do."" Backing up, can you tell listeners what Silk Road is, and why it was so important to bitcoin?\n\nEha: Sure. Silk Road was the world\'s first so-called crypto-market, it was a new kind of secretive, online black market that did a booming trade in illegal drugs. It was run by this 20-something Texan named Ross Ulbricht, who call himself Dread Pirate Roberts, after The Princess Bride character. He was kind of a libertarian philosopher drug lord, and he did a lot to associate radical free-market principles with bitcoin in the popular imagination. But, beyond that, the importance of Silk Road pragmatically really can\'t be overestimated.The illicit commerce on Ulbricht\'s market, which opened in January of 2011, drove a lot of early demand for bitcoin, because bitcoin was the only form of payment allowed on Silk Road. For the first two years of bitcoin\'s existence -- I mentioned it launched in January 2009 -- it really had almost no monetary value at all. But soon after Silk Road launched, the price of bitcoin went above $1 U.S. for the first time ever, and has never dropped below it since. But, by the time Ross Ulbricht was arrested in October 2013, there were still these black markets, people were still using bitcoin to buy illegal drugs online and so on, but the bitcoin economy was much larger at that point, and the shutdown of Silk Road by the Feds didn\'t do anything to shut down bitcoin. In fact, the price of bitcoin went on a huge run after that point, and there was a lot of excitement from that point on.\n\nLapera: Yeah, it\'s really interesting. Bitcoin really hasn\'t been around for that long, when you think about it, in the grand scheme of things. But, I believe one of the first legitimate uses of bitcoin to pay for something was pizza.\n\nEha: Right, and that actually happened on May 22nd, 2010. May 22nd is my birthday, as it happens.\n\nLapera: Happy birthday soon!\n\nEha: [laughs] Thank you. But, yes, someone got the bright idea to ask if someone else would order him a couple of Papa John\'s pizzas over the internet, and in exchange he would send some huge amount, like 25,000, bitcoins, I forget the exact number, which, of course, now would be worth millions upon millions of dollars. They did it, but it was just a proof of concept that, yes, this works, you can send digital money across the world and interact on a peer-to-peer basis without anybody else being involved in that transaction. That was, as ridiculous as it was, that was the first time anyone had exchanged bitcoin for any other form of value, so it is a bit of a milestone, and people like to mark the occasion every year.\n\nLapera: Yeah, it\'s really wild. Listeners, bitcoin\'s price today is $1,733.99. That\'s a lot of money for a pizza, now. [laughs] But, so, one of the things with Silk Road, there are some potential downsides to bitcoin, which is that it kind of works outside of this regulatory sphere. This weekend, we actually saw the malware attack called WannaCry, where people\'s files on their computers were held ransom, and people had to pay these hackers with bitcoin in order to get their files back. And that has temporarily gone offline, but it\'s going to come back online soon, probably, once the hackers fix the thing that took it offline. What are some of the downsides of bitcoin?\n\nEha: I think you said it, the downsides of bitcoin, one of them is that, because it\'s a form of money that\'s harder to trace than normal transactions, it can be sent directly from person to person, it doesn\'t have to go through the same kind of channels that are easy for law enforcement to monitor, so it does allow cybercriminals on the other side of the world to reach out and harm people. To be honest, they can reach out and harm people even without bitcoin, of course. Computer viruses and worms have been around for a long time. It\'s just that this adds a monetary element, that, before, maybe they were just doing it for the hell of it, they were just doing it to mess with people and show off their skills, but now they can actually do it as a business and make a lot of money from it. In fact, this is something I\'ve looked into. Cybercriminals are raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a year from ransomware, and this was even before the WannaCry outbreak. I haven\'t looked into exactly how much money that might have yielded for the people behind it.\n\nThe good news is, bitcoin can also provide things like cheaper remittances. This is one of the big pain points for people around the world. There are 2 billion adults in the world that have no bank account, and when immigrants send money back home to their families, they have to go through Western Union or MoneyGram, and they\'re charged really high fees, and it\'s often the poorest people who are charged the highest ones. So, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, pay an average of almost 10% when they send money back to their loved ones, and the global average is 7.5%, which is still pretty enormous. Remittances were ignored by economists for a long time, but they recently realized it\'s a $600 billion market, this amount of money that\'s flowing around the world. For countries like Mexico and India, it\'s one of the largest chunks of their GDP. So, bitcoin, because the transaction fees are so low compared to traditional methods, it has a chance to grab a piece of that market while putting millions of dollars back in people\'s pockets. In fact, there\'s a venture-backed company called Abra that is using bitcoin today to provide cheaper remittances, I think, it\'s over 100 countries, I\'m not sure exactly how many, but they claim to be able to reduce these remittance fees by as much as 90%. So, those are two sides of the same coin --\n\nLapera: Ha, two sides of the bitcoin, you might say. [laughs] Sorry, I couldn\'t help myself.\n\nEha: [laughs] That\'s OK. But, I guess the point I\'m trying to make is that, the downsides of bitcoin are inextricably intertwined with the upsides of bitcoin. This thing that allows it to be sent peer-to-peer around the world for very low transaction costs in minutes without necessarily getting anybody else involved, it\'s the same, it has very positive and some negative consequences.\n\nLapera: Definitely. That\'s actually something I was talking about with Simon Erickson, who\'s one of the investors here at The Motley Fool, which is, the future of finance is probably going to end up being decided in the developing world, because they\'re completely skipping over banks with physical footprints. They\'re going straight to mobile technology to transfer money, and a lot of them are keeping these bitcoin-esque wallet things to transfer this money. It\'s really interesting, they\'re using blockchain technology to make sure that government documents are well-recorded, something that you couldn\'t really do before that. It\'s really interesting, and something we\'ll probably dive into on a future episode.\n\nEha: Right. In addition to the lack of bank accounts, a lot of people in the developing world don\'t have photo IDs, they don\'t have official identification. So, people are working on methods that you can use blockchain technology to securely store proof of people\'s identities that can be used for all kinds of things. So, that\'s true, a lot of people from the early days, critics were saying, ""Why use bitcoin if I can use a credit card, or this or that?"" But a lot of the most forward-looking advocates of bitcoin were saying, really, the use case is for the developing world. There are uses for it in the developed world, but where it\'s really going to become huge, and then maybe surge and come back into the developed world, will be with people who have cellphones, like you mentioned, where they can have mobile money and digital wallets to hold their balances, but they don\'t have bank accounts, so something like bitcoin is perfect for that.\n\nLapera: Yeah. It\'s definitely super exciting. But, next question for you, talking about the developed world, especially the U.S., what do you think about the legal/regulatory future for bitcoin? We know that the Winklevoss\' ETF got rejected by the SEC recently, they said it was moving money around in a way that might be harmful. And I think you said right before we started the show that the SEC has decided to reconsider their decision, but who knows what they\'re going to say, it could be yes or no.\n\nEha: Yeah, Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has said that governments will flatten bitcoin before it can become a true competitor to the dollar, the pound or the euro. But I think there are good reasons to believe he\'s wrong. The monthly transaction volume of bitcoin has continued to climb. The price is close to its all-time high, which it reached in the last week or so. The user base keeps growing. A report out of Cambridge University last month found that the number of cryptocurrency users worldwide now rivals the population of small countries. So, at a certain point, it gets difficult, I think, to ban bitcoin outright, or to come down on it too hard. To be honest, if the U.S. government were going to do that, I think it would have done it already. Instead, what we\'ve seen is that the IRS has said, ""OK you can use bitcoins, but you have to pay taxes on them,"" and FinCEN and other regulators have said to bitcoin start-ups, ""You can work with this digital currency, but you still have to register as a money-transmitting business, or something like that."" So, they\'re trying to enfold it into the existing regulatory scheme. Now, the more radical bitcoiners would say it\'s going to be disruptive to the existing regulatory regime, just like the internet was. But, if the government had known from the get-go what the internet would turn into, they probably would have come down a lot harder on it in its early days, they would have tried to get their arms around it much sooner and much more stringently. But there are a lot of people who think bitcoin is going to be the same way, that they won\'t realize just how disruptive it\'s going to be until it\'s a little too late for them to do anything about it.\n\nWhat I will say is there are still challenges to overcome if bitcoin is going to succeed, and some of them are not regulatory, some of them are inherent in the very rules of the bitcoin software. It\'s still unclear whether or not bitcoin can scale up sufficiently to serve the needs of the global user base while staying true to its origins as digital cash, or if it\'s going to stay a niche technology and maybe eventually die out. So, the future of bitcoin is not yet written, but I would say we\'re well past the point where we know the technology is good for something, and there are people in Washington who realize that.\n\nLapera: Yeah. It\'s an interesting thing. Listeners, part of the reason that the government is so invested in trying to figure out regulations around bitcoin is because of anti-money laundering laws and ""know your customer"" laws, just to make sure that money is getting funneled into legal operations. That\'s where a lot of the restrictions on bitcoin from the federal government come from, is they\'re saying they\'re not meeting the standards. But of course, bitcoin was designed so that you wouldn\'t have to know anyone, you wouldn\'t have to disclose anything, so it\'s kind of this fundamental mismatch between what regulators want and what the original bitcoin people want.\n\nEha: It\'s also important to understand just how much regulations have changed in the last 15 years or so. Peter Thiel, I saw him at a public debate in New York a couple of years ago, and he was very open about saying that a company like PayPal could never have been founded in a post-9/11 world, we would have been accused of money laundering. So, that is something to understand, too, that the things that bitcoin pioneers have run afoul of are things that earlier pioneers would also have run afoul of, they just have to deal with a much more stringent regulatory regime than what existed before.\n\nLapera: Yeah, definitely. It\'s an interesting thing, and it\'s definitely a space to watch. I want to switch gears really quick and talk about the book itself. The book was really great for a few different reasons besides that it actually explained bitcoin to me in a way that I understood. It\'s incredibly well-written, and it\'s a super bold and interesting approach to writing about bitcoin. Most people would write a textbook or focus on the technicalities, but you actually created this set of narratives and interwove them. You humanized the main players in bitcoin while simultaneously teaching the reader about bitcoin along away. It actually kind of reminds me of those recipes that are like, ""Secretly feed your child vegetables by hiding them in mac and cheese!"" That\'s what your book felt like to me, it was like, ""Oh, I learned something, and I was entertained along the way."" This is a really accessible book for the average person, and I have a few questions about your writing style. Listeners know that we really enjoy good writing here at The Motley Fool. First question, why did you write this book?\n\nEha: It was partly that, when I first heard about bitcoin, it struck me as an idea whose time has come. I mentioned Peter Thiel just a minute ago. Early internet pioneers had always envisioned that a payments protocol would be woven into the fabric of the web. And when Peter Thiel was building PayPal, his original ambition was for it to be an internet currency that would replace the U.S. dollar for online transactions. But, it was the post-9/11 regulations that forced him to pivot away from that. The brilliant thing that Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin\'s creator, did was, rather than found a new company like PayPal, he built a decentralized system that no one would own but anyone could participate in. That really interested me. And then, the first time I wrote about bitcoin was in the summer of 2012, I\'ll never forget. I was a staff writer at CNNMoney briefly, and when I pitched this Bitcoin story to my editor, she told me, ""Go ahead and do it, but don\'t make too much of it, bitcoin is just a digital curiosity, it\'s a play thing for crypto anarchists."" Well, I didn\'t see it that way, exactly, but I also didn\'t know a lot about bitcoin at the time. So I went and did the story. And as I talked to the employees of this one bitcoin start up in Manhattan, I was just overwhelmed with the realization that bitcoin had real potential. These guys were young, hungry, passionate, willing to do the Mark Zuckerberg thing, moving fast, and I was just fascinated by how they were risking everything to build the early foundations of a new economy, and the CEO of that start-up actually became one of the main characters in my book. At that point, I just knew I wanted to keep following this story. And as it got bigger and bigger, and more and more headlines came out, I saw how rich a book-length narrative could be.\n\nBack, by the way, when I did that first story for CNNMoney, the price of a single bitcoin was less than $10, and all the bitcoins in existence put together were worth less than $100 million. Now, as you mentioned, bitcoin is above $1,700, its market cap is somewhere close to $30 billion. So, I think I made the right choice to take it seriously.\n\nLapera: Yeah, definitely. A side note to listeners, it\'s really interesting, because you get bitcoins by mining, which is basically that you have computers solve these problems, and the problems get increasingly hard as you go along. Right now, there\'s about 16.8 million Bitcoins in circulation, but there is a known cap of the total amount of Bitcoins that could ever possibly exist, which I believe is around 21 million, right?\n\nEha: Right.\n\nLapera: It\'s, really interesting, it does act a little bit more like a commodity like gold, where there is a finite amount of gold in the world, just like there\'s a finite amount of bitcoin in the world. It\'s definitely a really interesting thing. But, back to the book. My next question is, what was your favorite story to tell? You told a lot of different people\'s stories. Which one was your favorite?\n\nEha: I think, of the main characters, probably this guy Charlie Shrem\'s story resonates with me the most, because he was just a young middle-class guy living with his parents in Brooklyn before he discovered bitcoin. And he ended up co-founding one of the major early start-ups, that was actually the first to receive serious venture capital funding. Of all the major players in those days, he was, perhaps, the one most gratified by the attention, and most eager for the publicity, the fame, the respect that came from his leadership role in the community. And he also ended up suffering more than most, he had to spend more than a year in federal prison as a result of some things he did in the bitcoin space. So, there\'s a pathos there, the story of this middle-class kid made good, and his fall from grace, and now, actually, he\'s out of prison and he\'s working on making a comeback. So, that\'s all compelling to me.\n\nLapera: Yeah. And it\'s a really interesting and great story, and it so perfectly illustrates the rise and fall and rise again of bitcoin, that is the whole overarching story. Brian, I don\'t know if you know this, but we are kind of obsessed with reading here at the Fool. We do an annual reading list, we love interviewing authors like you, we have a bunch of book clubs. So, I\'m going to ask you a few different questions about books and reading. What are you reading right now?\n\nEha: I\'ve always got a number of books going at any one time. Right now, a few of the ones I\'m reading are Virginia Woolf\'s To The Lighthouse, which, honestly, I should have read years ago, it\'s brilliant. I\'m reading the collected poems of Philip Larkin. And, I\'m reading this other book that\'s a huge doorstop called The Creators: A History of Heroes of the Imagination by Daniel J. Boorstin. It was a national best-seller when it came out in the \'90s, and it essentially traces thousands of years of human history from the point of view of creativity and the creators who pushed the boundaries of the imagination forward, all the way from Stonehenge and ancient Egypt through James Joyce and Picasso and on into the future.\n\nLapera: That sounds really interesting. I will probably pick that up at some point and read it piecemeal over the course of a couple years.\n\nEha: Oh, it\'s definitely a book that you can read piecemeal and still get a lot out of it, yeah.\n\nLapera: Excellent. What\'s one thing that you think everyone should read? It doesn\'t have to be bitcoin-related.\n\nEha: I\'m going to do this as a two-part answer. I think the one thing about bitcoin that everyone should read is Satoshi Nakamoto\'s original white paper. Bitcoin itself was released in January 2009, but the white paper came out a few months before that, and it was essentially a technical paper explaining, ""This is the system I build, this is what I\'d like to do, this is how it will work."" It\'s only a few pages long, it\'s really accessible to pretty much anyone, and I think it\'s just an important founding document for anyone who wants to understand this really revolutionary technology. I think the one thing non-bitcoin-related that everyone should read in these days is the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson, which I return to again and again. I find them a useful corrective to the current trends of our time and society and politics. There\'s a lot of groupthink going on, a lot of people, especially in my industry, talk about filter bubbles, which is basically, on social media, we only follow people who think like we do and say the things we want to hear. Ralph Waldo Emerson is all about being a non-conformist and about charting your own path and thinking for yourself. So, it\'s really valuable in this day and age.\n\nLapera: Those are two really wonderful answers. I really love Emerson. Also, I really love that you suggested a primary source document for bitcoin. I think it\'s really important that people go back and look at how things were originally written, and that kind of combats what you were talking about, those filter bubbles, because you can see what the original data, what the original evidence, said. Super interesting. Is there anything else you want to say as we wrap up this interview?\n\nEha: No, I wish I had something prepared. Well, I guess the one thing I would say is, I think, in the history of money and in the digital economy, bitcoin does not mark an endpoint, as far as I can tell. But, I do think it marks a point, like the invention of the telephone, from which there can be no turning back.\n\nLapera: Awesome. Thank you so much. I really, really enjoyed having you on the show. If you ever write another book, definitely let us know.\n\nEha: Sure, let\'s stay in touch.\n\nLapera: Yeah, I would love that. As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don\'t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Contact us at industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus, and let us know what you thought about the show, or if you have any other questions about bitcoin. I can see this becoming a pretty reliable topic for us. Thank you to Austin Morgan, today\'s producer. Austin, would you buy bitcoin?\n\nAustin Morgan: It\'s a little pricey.\n\nLapera: Fair enough. Thank you to everyone for joining us, and have a great week!']"
05/21/2017,"['Bitcoin price established its new all-time high at $2,087 earlier today after surging past its previous all-time high set at $2,050, with demand toward Bitcoin rising from institutional investors in the US, Japan and South Korea.\n\n#bitcoin officially hits new all-time high at $2,050 as global average. Bitcoin being traded in Japan & South Korea at $2,350. pic.twitter.com/tFR0zXsUku — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 21, 2017\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is being traded in Japan and South Korea, the second and third largest Bitcoin exchange markets in the world, at around $2,350, at an 11 percent premium relative to the global average Bitcoin price and the price listed by US-based Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nAnalysts including Charles Hayter, the CEO of CryptoCompare, explained that the Japanese and South Korean Bitcoin exchange markets played a key role as the driving factor of Bitcoin’s recent price surge. In an interview with CNBC, Hayter stated:\n\n""Arbitrage between the fiat pairs drags markets up or down in line with leading markets. At present, volumes on the KRW and JPY pairs dominate trading with a combined 48 percent market share.”\n\nCointelegraph previously emphasized the importance of the Japanese and South Korean exchange markets on the global Bitcoin market. The two markets hold over 48.6 percent of the global bBtcoin exchange market share and represent the vast majority of institutional investors within Asia.\n\nJapan, in particular, has experienced an explosive growth in demand for Bitcoin as some of the country’s most influential conglomerates announced the launch of their independent digital currency exchanges, with the vision of facilitating fiat-to-digital currency trading securely and transparently, with low fees.\n\nForever blowing bubbles\n\nCointelegraph reported that a significant number of investors have started to fuel an altcoin bubble concentrated around Ripple and NEM.\n\nIndieSquare co-founder and Japan-based researcher Koji Higashi stated that the legalization of digital currency and the tax exemption of Bitcoin convinced beginner and casual cryptocurrency traders that every other cryptocurrencies are legitimate and well-based.\n\nHowever, Higashi noted that most investors are investing in cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin with relatively shallow knowledge and understanding of digital currencies.\n\nHigashi explained:\n\n“I think I know the answer now. Newly entering Japanese investors are driving this great altcoin bubble and not-so-smart money is flowing into the space especially into some altcoins at a rather concerning rate. Another thing to note about this new trend is that the general lack of understanding or appreciation of the technology by many of new users.”\n\nWhat happens next\n\nIn the next few months, as Bitcoin maintains its momentum and upward trend, it is likely that the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange market will demonstrate some stability and see a decline in interest over alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins. If so, the demand for Bitcoin will likely increase over time.\n\nCurrently, analysts and researchers at mainstream media outlets such as CNBC and Bloomberg are attributing Bitcoin’s recent upward momentum to the economic uncertainty and instability of the US. This is a rational conclusion considering that the US replaced the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market for the first time in the past 12 months to become the largest Bitcoin exchange market.', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ledger Holdings, the New York-based parent company of bitcoin options exchange LedgerX, said on Monday it closed $11.4 million in funding led by Miami International Holdings Inc and China’s Huiyin Blockchain Venture Investments.\n\nThe funding supports LedgerX’s plan to operate a regulated exchange and clearing house for bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nLedgerX is awaiting regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to operate the first U.S. regulated exchange and clearing house for bitcoin options. On approval, participating institutions can use the LedgerX platform to obtain and hedge bitcoin using exchange-traded and centrally cleared options contracts.\n\n“In the short term, these investments will further our application to become a regulated exchange and clearing house for bitcoin options,” Paul Chou, chief executive officer of LedgerX LLC, said in a statement.\n\n“In the long term, these strategic investors will help us enter additional marketplaces and territories,” he added.\n\nChou sits on the CFTC’s Technology Advisory Committee.\n\nMiami International Holdings is the parent company of Miami International Securities Exchange LLC and MIAX PEARL LLC, two fully electronic options trading exchanges.\n\nMIAX Options lists and trades options on more than 2,600 multi-listed classes. Huiyin Blockchain Venture is a subsidiary of investment conglomerate Huiyin Group.\n\nLedgerX earlier raised $1.5 million from funders led by Google Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that can be moved like money around the world quickly and anonymously without the need for a central authority. It hit a record high over the weekend, with one unit of bitcoin trading above $2,000 on the BitStamp platform BTC=BTSP.', 'It was an exciting week for crypto traders. It seems like there are an ever-increasing number of traders joining the party doesn’t it? Given that just a year ago there was just a handful of traders compared to now, and we still have not even scratched the surface of the number of traders out there still trading Forex exclusively, the future seems bright indeed. To do well, all you have to do is make sure you don’t make a mistake that wipes out your trading account and forces you out of the game.

I know it sucks to be in a trade and then see a different coin is going through the roof while yours is stuck in the mud. Happened to me this week – I missed the ETH party. But if you chase a trade after the fact, you are highly likely to buy a high. There will be another trade tomorrow, and another the day after that, and the next… If you miss one, try not to get greedy and/or impatient – just catch the next trade. If you just stay in the game, IMHO, you stand a good chance of doing very well for yourself. There is a ton of money flowing into the altcoins, and we are still in the very early stages of what might be a bull market they will write about in the history books – IMHO.\n\nBitcoin\n\nI believe XBT is finally approaching the end of it’s present historic run. There are 2 arcs, a short-term 3rd, and a long-term 5th, very close by (~ $2100). I always counsel others, and myself, to never short a bull market. But I might make an exception in this case, if I am feeling brave enough. This 12 hour chart is screaming out a major warning to longs.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace.

A little more pullback and a new advance to the 5th arc will like begin. There is a number of reasons to believe that 5/27-5/28 will be a significant energy point for DASH. It is too soon to tell if it will be a high, low or acceleration. But mark it on your calendar.\n\nEthereum\n\nRegretfully I missed this rally. By the time I noticed it, price was too close to the 3rd arc to buy it. However, my guess is that price will get through the arcs to go to the 5th arcs. Target ~$165. (Last week we identified $130 as a next target. This rally was stopped at $129). I see there is an energy point due tomorrow (red vertical line). Maybe that is the time to watch. I suggest waiting for a close above the 3rd arc, but aggressive traders might risk buying here.\n\nLitecoin\n\nLTC was a bit of a disappointment this week. We tweeted the low was likely in at $21, and it was. The subsequent rally to $29 was exhilarating, but that 1st arc pair stopped the party, and then the top of the square provided a ceiling. Then the money moved to ETH I suppose… Lets see when/if this coin can get through those arcs…\n\nRipple\n\nWe tweeted that the low was likely in at .28, and indeed that was the low. Since then there was a rally that brought XRP back to the same arc that crashed the party several days ago. The arc stopped the rally again. My guess is that it will get through the arc soon and rally again. My suggestion is to wait for a close above the arcs though. It could fall again here.\n\nZcash\n\nZEC closed above the 2nd arc before falling back. This suggests to me that the arcs are weak and will yield on the next test. I suggest waiting for confirmation. However, a rally to the 3rd and/or the 5th arcs is likely in the week ahead.\n\nMonero\n\nXMR rallied hard into the 5th arc of a longer-term setup. At this writing it is sitting just below the 5th arc. It is too soon to say if this is a double top or not (could be!), so my suggestion is to take profits here, if you are long.\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgment. Do your own research, and be prepared to take full responsibility for your own trades.', 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is testing the $2000 levels and traders are wondering if it could keep rising past this psychological mark.\n\nBefore this happens, though, bitcoin might need to pull back to nearby support levels to get more buyers to join in.\n\nA rising trend line can be drawn to connect the latest lows of bitcoin price action on the 4-hour chart.\n\nBitcoin price might need to make a correction before sustaining its climb past the $2000 mark.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside. This short-term moving average is also close to the rising trend line that’s been holding since the start of May, adding to its strength as support.\n\nIn addition, applying the Fibonacci retracement tool on the latest swing low and high shows that the 38.2% to 50% levels line up with the trend line and a former resistance area that might now hold as support. If so, bitcoin price could resume its climb past the swing high around $2070 and climb to $2100 next.\n\nRSI is turning lower from the overbought zone to show a return in selling pressure. A bit of divergence can be seen as this oscillator made lower highs since May 10 while price had higher highs then.\n\nStochastic is also heading south from the overbought zone to show that sellers are taking control of bitcoin price action. Once the oscillator hits the oversold region, buyers could get back in the game.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nRising volumes in Japan are still seen to be the major drivers of the bitcoin price gains, but the increase in geopolitical risk is also sustaining the climb. Last week, the focus has been on the uncertainty generated from the ongoing investigation on Trump’s intelligence information leak to Russian officials.\n\nApart from spurring demand for non-traditional assets like bitcoin, it has also led to lower demand for the dollar on weakening Fed rate hike expectations for next month and declining US bond yields. Even if the Fed does tighten, the lack of progress on fiscal reform could weigh on the odds of future rate hikes for the year.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Last week there was an intense competition on the Top 10 of CoinMarketCap with some casualties being posted.\n\nIt was so engrossing to see some old cryptocurrencies uprooted from their longstanding positions. This registered the fact that no entity has a monopoly over a particular position.\n\nEthereum lost to Ripple\n\nSmart Contract king, Ethereum in a very surprising circumstance lost its long-held number two spot to snowballing Bank Transfer giant Ripple. Fascinatingly, within the week it doubled its value and it was near twice the value of Ethereum.\n\nRising almost 40 percent, its market cap was over $15 bln. It has now lost almost $2 bln and Ethereum is now closing the gap. Actually, it was the second best-performing cryptocurrency on the top 10 last week.\n\nYet still, Ripple leads Ether with almost $2 bln in Market Cap. Some analysts in the space are strongly convinced it is likely that it will recover and take back the number two position it nearly monopolized for a couple of years.\n\nIt remained to be seen since Ripple keeps making deals with banks around the world expanding its portfolios. Anyway, Ethereum with no doubt as well has become a popular smart contract platform.\n\nNEM pushed Litecoin\n\nIn a related development, on Thursday fast-growing NEM also pushed SegWit trailblazer, Litecoin to the fifth rank and became the world's fourth most valuable digital currency. This was when the Ethereum Token rose a towering 50 percent in growth rate.\n\nIt became one of the notorious astonishments associated with altcoins rise since Litecoin, the silver of crypto has been performing awesomely in the market since choosing the SegWit path. Well in this space nothing is no more a bewilderment. NEM now holds more than $2 bln in Market Capitalization.\n\nSignificantly New Economic Movement (NEM) was the best performing crypto in the week and continues to lead in altcoin growth in 2017. It seems to be attracting more investors to its fold.\n\nStellar Lumen vs. Monero\n\nAnother interesting raging battle is between the radioactivity of Ripple as a result of a misunderstanding, Stellar Lumen, and steadily declining Monero. On Thursday XLM dislodged Monero from the eighth rank but the latter fought back gallantly to take it back on Friday.\n\nAlas! This did not last long and the Microfinance Blockchain once again took over on Saturday. At the time of filing this report, the difference in Market Cap between the two was $20 mln.\n\nIf Monero remains the way it is tanking, the likelihood of gaining back the position is slim. Moreover, Stellar Lumen so far has given all indications it has come to the top 10 to stay.\n\nByteCoin bites Steem\n\nAmong the other things, last week witnessed a newcomer in the ranks of the elites when Bytecoin crashed the gates of the top 10 sending Steem stumbling down below. For four days now Bytecoin has held the tenth position firmly. It is up to them to prove to the community if they have come to stay or not.\n\nMeanwhile, Siacoin is barking fiercely to gain entrance to the top as it is now at the eleventh spot. Cointelegraph anticipates a hot week ahead."", ""Bitcoin is soaring to a new high after hitting a peak of $1,939 per coin recently. At this point, it wouldn’t be surprising to see BTC reaching $2,000 in the next few days. Bitcoin is smashing record after record, after reaching $1,800 just a few days ago.\n\nThe hike is believed to be connected with the political uncertainty which is currently impacting global currencies, which in turn, pushed people towards digital currencies instead of traditional ones.\n\nAccording to Coinmarketcap, Bitcoin's market cap reached $32.161 billion today after moving $989.952 million in the past 24 hours. Today's high is a 7-point gain over the past week, with more than $4 billion being added to its market cap.\n\nBitcoin has been becoming increasingly attractive for investors across the globe who see it as a safe haven during times of political turmoil. While Bitcoin has its own challenges, it is not as easily influenced by issues taking place across the world, mainly because it belong to no country. Therefore if the dollar goes down due to Trump being investigated, Bitcoin still remains high. If Euro faces issues for whatever reason, Bitcoin remains unmoved.\n\nThe only things that will influence Bitcoin's value are situations that directly impact it - like a country refusing to accept it as a real currency, or another government discussing ways to track payment.\n\nThe recent WannaCry ransomware spread has also helped more and more people find out about Bitcoin, even those who aren't familiar with the notion of digital currencies. It is believed that it has had some impact on the digital currency's evolution this week. As a general rule, Bitcoin is growing in popularity and so are other digital currencies and it will likely continue to do so. Now, we're just going to have to wait to see it hit $2,000."", 'A closely-watched fight between the Internal Revenue Service and a popular bitcoin exchange took a new twist last week, as senior Republicans in Congress sent a sharply-worded letter that suggests the tax agency is overstepping its powers.\n\nThe letter concerns an IRS investigation into possible tax evasion by customers who use Coinbase, a San Francisco-based company that many people use to buy digital currencies. As part of the investigation, which began last year, officials demanded that Coinbase turn over information for every one of its accounts.\n\nCoinbase and its customers are currently in court trying to block the demand, saying it’s too broad, and now the letter from the Republicans is likely to give them extra ammunition.\n\n“The summons is estimated to affect 500,000 active Coinbase customers and would result in the production of millions of pages of associated records, many of which contain personally identifiable information … Based on the information before us, this summons seems overly broad, extremely burdensome, and highly intrusive to a large population of individuals,” says the letter, which is signed by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Ut), Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and by Vern Buchanan and Kevin Brady, who head the House Committee on Ways and Means. (my emphasis)\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe Republicans’ concerns echo those of Coinbase and its customers, who argue the IRS does not need every single Coinbase account to carry out its audit, and that the investigation sweeps in people who have clearly done nothing wrong.\n\nThe tax agency, for its part, has pointed out that only 802 Coinbase users filed a tax form related to bitcoin in 2015, which suggests large number of people have failed to declare capital gains related to bitcoin.\n\nThe IRS investigation also comes at a time when the price of bitcoin has been on an incredible tear, climbing from $13 in 2013 to a new high of over $2,000 last week. Those who profited from the higher prices—either by selling bitcoin for dollars or exchanging it for merchandise—are required to pay taxes on the gain.\n\nSome Coinbase customers, however, have not sold any bitcoin at all while many others hold only a minimal amount, raising questions of why the IRS demanded information about every account.\n\nOne theory, according to a lawyer who spoke with Fortune late last year, is that the IRS’s sweeping demand is a negotiating tactic to make Coinbase more cooperative, and that the two sides will reach an agreement to allow the agency to inspect some, but not all, of the accounts.\n\nThe letter from the Republicans, which asks the IRS to explain its strategy for enforcing tax payments on digital currency by June 7, is likely to put pressure on the agency to come to a deal with Coinbase.', 'Ever since the dot-com and housing bubbles popped in 2000 and 2008, spotting bubbles has become a national obsession. Investors have spotted bubbles in bonds, credit, equities, gold — you name it — over the last several years.\n\nI wouldn’t use the B-word to describe any of those investments — yet. In fact, I wouldn’t even nominate any of them for Most Likely to Bubble Over. I would give that distinction to a certain cryptocurrency that is quickly making its name and fortune: Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has all the attributes of a bubble in the making. First, it’s radically new. It’s a digital payment system that allows users anywhere in the world to transact directly without interference from intermediaries, governments, regulators or central banks — at least for now. Transactions are administered by a decentralized network of computers, much like the internet.\n\nIn his book about the 17th-century tulip bubble in Holland, “Tulipmania,” British journalist Mike Dash points out, “It is impossible to comprehend the tulip mania without understanding just how different tulips were from every other flower known to horticulturists in the 17th century.” The same could be said about the internet in the 1990s and about digital currency today.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin is shrouded in secrecy. Buyers and sellers of Bitcoin can trade anonymously, which makes the digital currency a favorite of criminals and hackers demanding ransom. Its origins are shrouded in mystery. Its creator goes by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, but it’s unclear who that person is or if it’s even one person. That, too, is reminiscent of another bubble. At the height of England’s South Sea Bubble in 1720, one company floated shares “”For carrying-on an undertaking of great advantage but no-one to know what it is.” Of course, that didn’t stop investors from throwing money at the company.\n\nRiding the Wave\n\nIn 1720, share prices of the South Sea Company rose 400 percent in three months and then collapsed just as quickly\n\nThird, Bitcoin has no value other than what a buyer is willing to pay for it, which makes it susceptible to the argument that underlies all bubbles. Namely, that any price is appropriate. But there’s already reason to worry that Bitcoin’s price is excessive. An investment in Bitcoin has returned a breathtaking 351 percent annually since its inception in July 2010 through Tuesday. To put that in perspective, an investment of $100 in Bitcoin from the beginning would be worth close to $3 million today. It’s not easy to justify that kind of return for any investment.\n\nDigital Gold\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is up 3 million percent since July 2010.\n\nBitcoin is similar to other currencies and commodities such as gold, oil, potatoes or even tulips in that its intrinsic value is difficult — if not impossible — to separate from its price. But there are governments standing behind currencies and reliable currency markets for exchange. And with commodities, investors have something to hold at the end of the transaction. Bitcoin feels more speculative because it’s just digital ephemera.\n\nThat isn’t true for all investments. Stockholders are entitled to a share of a company’s assets, earnings and dividends, the value of which can be estimated independent of the stock’s price. The same can be said about a bond’s payments of principal and interest.\n\nThis distinction between price and value is what allowed many observers to warn that internet stocks were absurdly priced in the late 1990s, or that mortgage bonds weren’t as safe as investors assumed during the housing bubble. A similar warning about Bitcoin isn’t possible.\n\nDuring the dot-com craze, Warren Buffett was asked why he didn’t invest in technology. He famously answered that he didn’t understand tech stocks. But what he meant was that no one understood them, and he was right. Why else would anyone buy the NASDAQ 100 Index when its price-to-earnings ratio was more than 500 times — a laughably low earnings yield of 0.2% — which is where it traded at the height of the bubble in March 2000.\n\nThinking back on investors’ credulity during the last two bubbles, I can’t help but wonder if buyers of Bitcoin understand what they’re invested in. They would be wise to ask themselves that same question.\n\n© 2017 Bloomberg', 'Increasing demand for Bitcoin and other altcoins can no longer be ignored. The cryptocurrencies have already made inroads to the conventional financial system, both directly as well as indirectly. As banking institutions continue to adopt blockchain technology, a Norwegian online bank — Skandiabanken has gone a step further to recognize Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies as an investment class.\n\nIn order to facilitate the use of cryptocurrency among its customers, Skandiabanken has recently announced a new feature that enables users to buy and store Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether on its online banking platform. The bank is offering the new service in partnership with Coinbase, integrating its wallet to customers’ internet banking accounts.\n\nWith the inclusion of support for cryptocurrencies, Skandiabanken has become one of the first mainstream banking institutions to acknowledge Bitcoin as an alternative financial asset. Christoffer Hernaes, the head of innovation and development at Skandiabanken said,\n\n“We recognize cryptocurrency as an investment class on an equal footing with other securities.”\n\nThe new feature is currently available only for those who are using the bank’s beta solution, and in the coming days, it is expected to be rolled out to other customers as well. Skandiabanken’s initiative has been appreciated by the country’s cryptocurrency community. The head of Norway’s Bitcoin Association, Stephan Nilsson was quoted in one of the online publications saying,\n\n“This is very positive. These are the signals we have been waiting for from the Norwegian banking industry.”\n\nThe bank’s initiative may influence other financial institutions in the country to come up with similar initiatives. However, few believe that it might not happen anytime soon. Some of the other banking institutions offering similar services in Europe includes Georgia’s Liberty Bank and Germany’s Fidor Bank.\n\nIn the coming days, the Japanese banking sector could start offering cryptocurrency-based services following Bitcoin’s recently gained legal status in the country. All these changes mark Bitcoin’s progress towards attaining mainstream status, and it is going to happen much sooner than expected.\n\nRef: Nasdaq |E24 | Image: NewsBTC', 'Retailers all over the world are taking a closer look at Bitcoin payments. Especially companies active in online retail can benefit from accepting Bitcoin. The largest online retailer in the Czech Republic has made the bold decision to accept BTC from now on. Alza is a major household name in the Eastern European country, and they will aim to put Bitcoin on the map.\n\nIt is quite interesting to see Alza accept Bitcoin payments all of a sudden. The company has been around for over two decades already. Initially, the company made a name for itself by selling electronics and computer parts. This catalog has now grown to encompass toys, magazines, and even sporting goods. Moreover, Alza is no longer active in just the Czech Republic either. Right now, they ship goods to 26 different countries in Europe.\n\nAlza Embraces Bitcoin Payments\n\nHaving the support of such a large online retailer is good for Bitcoin. Considering how a lot of sales occur over the Internet in the Czech Republic, Bitcoin can make a big impact. It is good to see them integrate this Bitcoin payment option immediately. It makes a lot of sense to deal with cryptocurrency payments as of right now. Due to its global accessibility and cheaper costs, Bitcoin can be quite beneficial.\n\nIt is evident Alza is quite keen on Bitcoin as of right now. Not only did they integrate Bitcoin payments, but they also installed two ATMs. Both machines can be found in two of the company’s showrooms. Interestingly enough, one of the two Bitcoin ATMs is located in Slovakia. Quite unusual for a Czech company, although Alza has quite a presence in Slovakia as well. It appears both machines are two-way ATMs, supporting crowns and euro transactions.\n\nThis news comes on the heels of Russian retailer Ulmart accepting Bitcoin as well. it is good to see some international exposure for the popular cryptocurrency. Until 2016, most retailers accepting Bitcoin focuse on the US and Canada only. European users have been left in the cold a bit in this regard. Slowly but surely, that situation is changing for the better. All of this news will elevate Bitcoin to the next level.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
05/22/2017,"['New York City\n\n“Blockchain! Blockchain! Blockchain!”\n\nTaariq Lewis, a bitcoin entrepreneur wearing a tuxedo, is chanting as he sprints down from the ballroom stage of the Marriott Marquis in Time Square. He high-fives the dark-suited executives seated in the front row before returning to the stage to close out his routine—a song about blockchains and cryptocurrencies—with two sequin-studded backup dancers. It’s 8:30am on a Monday morning.\n\nThe bitcoin and wider blockchain world is gathered in New York for the annual Consensus conference, an industry confab organized by trade publication CoinDesk. (Full disclosure: I started the conference in 2015.) They have good reason to be singing and dancing: The cryptocurrency’s price has rocketed in recent weeks. On May 22, the day of the event, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index pegs it at $2,230.\n\nThe unusual kickoff to a conference aimed at 2,500 financial and technology executives sums up the schism at the heart of the blockchain world. Blockchain tech was meant to be the grown-up version of the freewheeling, anarchic, bitcoin scene that it descended from. Yet it’s clear from Lewis’ dance routine that the wilder impulses of cryptocurrency culture—fueled by euphoria over an ascendant price—aren’t so easily tamed by its would-be corporate overlords.\n\nIt’s not just bitcoin’s price that’s climbing. Etherum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market, with more powerful computational features than bitcoin, is setting records too. Indeed, one speaker remarked on stage that everyone at the conference seemed more interested in ethereum than bitcoin this year.\n\nWhile these cryptocurrencies are often treated as speculative financial instruments, the point of the Consensus event is to showcase their potential real-world usefulness. To that end, conference-goers were presented with a slew of announcements from corporations hoping to harness the technical principles behind blockchains. Here are some of the most interesting:\n\nToyota Research Institute is using blockchains for self-driving cars. They could be used to share data between car users or about a car’s environment, to handle payments between users for car-sharing platforms, or to store data about how a car was used for insurance purposes. Blockchains could even help record information about whether a car’s trunk is available for rent.\n\nCoinList, a platform for launching so-called Initial Coin Offerings, was launched on May 18; at Consensus, co-founder Juan Benet talked about its progress and high-profile partnership with Naval Ravikant’s AngelList. ICOs are upending traditional fundraising mechanisms by making everything automated and on the blockchain. Benet was mobbed by business-card waving executives as he tried to leave the hall.\n\nMicrosoft, Ideo, Accenture, and others launched something called the Decentralized Identity Foundation, a nonprofit with the ambitious goal of creating a blockchain-based identity layer for the internet. That means users would control how their data is stored and accessed. Such a development could potentially curtail the increasing dominance of Facebook or Google accounts as our online identities.\n\nAlibaba is using a blockchain to track dairy supplies, vitamins, and more in Australia, part of a partnership with consultancy PwC. The idea is to reduce fraud in the food supply chain using a blockchain’s tamper-proof logging abilities and smart contracts.\n\nThe breadth of companies plunging into blockchains suggests that enthusiasm for the technology has not waned, though some projects are closer than others to showing real cost savings. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which is responsible for processing trillions of dollars of securities transactions daily, said its blockchain-based platform developed by IBM would slash clearing and settlement costs across the entire industry by a quarter when it goes live next year. In a separate project with shipping line Maersk, IBM promised savings of “tens of billions” for the company by digitizing supply-chain paperwork with a blockchain.\n\nThe exuberance in the blockchain world is matched only by the enthusiasm of speculators who trade in bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies that are exploding in value. From inside the ballrooms of the Marriott Marquis, the value of blockchain tech really does look like it’s going “to the moon,”—a popular refrain among cryptocurrency investors—as Taariq Lewis sang to a room full of suits.', ""Bitcoin is having its moment.\n\nThe often maligned crypto-currency continued its incredible run on Monday, soaring to nearly $2,200 at 10:30 p.m. — leaving it up 124 percent this year and ahead nearly 400 percent over the past 12 months, according to Coindesk.\n\nsee also Bitcoin's appeal is at an all-time high Global stock indexes are not the only asset class making...\n\nBy comparison, the Dow Jones industrial average, in the midst of a Trump Rally, has gained 5.7 percent this year.\n\nIn fact, $100 invested in bitcoin in July 2010 would be worth $3.5 million today, according to a chart sent to some people by Jeroen Blokland, a portfolio manager on the Robeco Global Allocation team, according to MarketWatch.\n\nThe same investment at the same time in the S&P 500 would be worth $250 — excluding dividends, according to Blokland’s chart.\n\nThat means just a buck invested in bitcoin seven years ago would be worth $35,000 today."", 'Monday marks the seven-year anniversary of the first Bitcoin transaction, in which a Florida man paid for two pizzas with the cryptocurrency. The day has become part of folklore, not because of the transaction, but more the price: the man in question paid 10,000 Bitcoins, which today is worth $20 million, for the two pizzas. (See also: New Bitcoin Price Record: Over $2,000 Per Coin)\n\nOn May 22, 2010, now known as Bitcoin Pizza Day, Laszlo Hanyecz agreed to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for two delivered Papa John\'s pizzas. Organized on bitcointalk forum, the Florida man reached out for help. ""I\'ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day,"" Hanyecz wrote.\n\n""I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I\'m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don\'t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a \'breakfast platter\' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you\'re happy!""\n\nA British man took up Hanyecz\'s offer and bought the two pizzas for him in exchange for the 10,000 Bitcoins.

Nine months after the purchase, Bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar, making the two pizzas worth $10,000 and in 2015 -- the fifth anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day -- the two pizzas were valued at $2.4 million. Today, Bitcoin has surged to an all-time high, trading above $2170, making the pizzas worth...you get it.

""It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,"" Hanyecz told the NY Times.', 'Bitcoin prices surged to another all-time high Monday, taking the total value of the cryptocurrency in circulation to more than $37.5 billion.\n\nBitcoins were marked at $2,120 each on the Bitsmap exchange in Europe at 08:45 BST, a more than $100 increase from last week\'s close and a more than 51% increase from the beginning of the month.\n\nThe gains followed news that Ledger Holdings, the parent company of the bitcoin options exchange LedgerX, said it had closed $11.4 million in new financing as it awaits approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for the first U.S.-based trading and clearing house for the virtual currency.\n\n""In the short term, these investments will further our application to become a regulated exchange and clearing house for bitcoin options,"" said LedgerX CEO Paul Chou. ""In the long term, these strategic investors will help us enter additional marketplaces and territories.""\n\nBitcoin\'s gains have also mirrored declines in the U.S. dollar and surge in trading activity in Japan, where it was deemed as \'legal tender\' by the government and began being used as a common form of payment as of April 1.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index, a measure of the greenback\'s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has fallen more than 1.9% since the beginning of the May amid investor concern over the fate of President Donald Trump\'s tax reform and stimulus spending strategies as his administration grapples with myriad allegations related to his ties with officials in Russia.\n\nOver that same time period, spot gold prices, a traditional ""safe-haven"" for investors transitioning from riskier bets, have fallen around 1% to $1,255 per ounce.\n\nRead More Trending Articles:', 'The Indian government is opening itself to public comments and suggestions about the regulation and legality of virtual currencies like bitcoin in the country.\n\nEarlier in March this year, India’s Ministry of Finance (FinMin) established an interdisciplinary committee that includes a number of authorities including representatives from the central bank – which has issued warnings against the use of bitcoin in the past – to study the legal framework surrounding virtual currencies.\n\nChaired by the Special Secretary of Economic Affairs and officials from a number of other ministries, the committee’s primary tasks, as reported by CCN earlier, are specifically:\n\nConsidering the present status of virtual currencies globally and in India\n\nExamining the existing regulatory and legal structures governing virtual currencies around the world\n\nSuggesting measures in dealing with concerns in consumer protection and money laundering related virtual currencies and,\n\nExamining other relevant matters related to virtual currencies.\n\nNow, India’s FinMin is courting suggestions about virtual currencies from the public on a government portal after stating that ‘the circulation of Virtual Currencies which are also known as Digital/CryptoCurrencies has been a cause of concern’.\n\nThe FinMin points to two separate public notices issued by the Reserve Bank of India in 2013 and February 2017.\n\nMore specifically, the government is seeking answers to the following questions:\n\na) Whether Virtual Currencies (VCs) should be banned, regulated or observed?\n\nb) In case VCs are suggested to be regulated:\n\ni). What measures should be taken to ensure consumer protection?\n\nii). What measures should be taken to promote orderly development of VCs.\n\niii). Which appropriate institution(s) should monitor/ regulate the VCs?\n\nc). In case VCs are not suggested to be regulated:\n\ni). What should be the effective self-regulatory mechanism?\n\nii). What measures should be adopted to ensure consumer protection in this scenario?\n\nLocal reports from India hint at the government already ‘in the processing of preparing norms’ for the regulation of virtual currencies. A televised report from an CNBC affiliate in India from mid-April revealed the government’s intention to legalize and tax bitcoin and virtual currencies in the country. All signs are pointing toward the government ‘legalizing’ virtual currencies at a time when the likes of Japan and the Philippines officially acknowledge bitcoin as a legal method of payment.\n\nAn Indian government ban of virtual currencies is highly unlikely and would be counter-productive to the government’s own digital payments and finance agenda.\n\nA number of suggestions have already called for the regulation of legalization of virtual currencies in the country.\n\n“Bitcoin should be regulated in India,” writes Shradha Jadhav. “With proper regulation which will benefit the Indian economy and citizens with growing technology. When other countries are legalizing n accepting it, we should be stepping forward for the digital future of the country.”\n\n“Yes…Regulation of Cryptocurrency in India will be one more positive step toward economic empowerment,” adds Priya Ratan Janjal.\n\n“Japan & Korea have already legalized it and India should get onboard,” suggests Udit Agarwal.\n\nThe government is accepting public suggestions concerning the future regulation and legalization of virtual currencies until May 31st, 2017.\n\nComments/suggestions from public invited on Virtual Currencies Framework by 31.5.2017 on website: MyGov.in.\n\nLink\u200b is:https://t.co/CWbcsNidkL — Ministry of Finance (@FinMinIndia) May 21, 2017\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Sources of Cointelegraph, as well as others including Bitcoin investor Alistair Milne, suggested that Bitcoin miners have agreed to activate the Bitcoin Core development team’s transaction malleability fix Segregated Witness (SegWit).\n\nAlthough the consensus amongst miners to activate SegWit is only a rumor as of current and is not confirmed, the Bitcoin community seems to be anticipating the activation of SegWit and the execution of a two MB hard fork as a compromise.\n\n2MB hard fork agreement\n\nOn February 20, the Bitcoin Core development team, miners and businesses participated in the Hong Kong Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus to come to an agreement in regard to a scaling solution for the Bitcoin network. In consideration of the rising fee market, increase in the number of daily transactions, mempool size and block size, miners, developers and businesses agreed to a two MB hard fork.\n\nAt the time, Bitcoin Core developers and miners released a statement which read:\n\n“This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around two MB, with the total size no more than four MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.”\n\nOne of the unresolved issues between the Bitcoin Core development team and miners has always been the disregard for the two MB hard fork agreement established at the Hong Kong Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus in February. In order to resolve this conflict, some have previously suggested a compromise which entails the activation of SegWit in return for a two MB hard fork to expand the current Bitcoin block size by 100 percent.\n\nConsensus discussions\n\nOn May 22, former BTCC executive and Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow quoted Milne’s summation of the discussions conducted at the New York Consensus event to express his optimism toward the idea of activating SegWit first and leading a two MB hard fork execution within a year. Mow said:\n\nSo they will activate SegWit and fork off after a year. I'm okay with that! https://t.co/TfZeQTtBai — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 22, 2017\n\nAs Blockstack’s Ryan Shea stated in the past, SegWit is like a Swiss army knife of a solution. It fixes transaction malleability and thus provides a robust infrastructure for two-layer solutions such as Lightning, offers 75 percent optimization of Bitcoin block amongst other many benefits.\n\nHence, the plan to activate SegWit to optimize Bitcoin and executing a two MB hard fork a year after to efficiently and securely scale the Bitcoin network is practical and viable.The mixture of high anticipation toward SegWit adoption, rising global awareness of Bitcoin and the increase in the interest of institutional investors in Bitcoin are acting as the three major driving factors of Bitcoin price at the moment.\n\nAs of today, Bitcoin price stabilized at the $2,150 margin, after reaching its new all-time high at $2,160 earlier in the morning.\n\nExpected to surge\n\nIf SegWit talks continue to develop and if the solution will, in fact, be activated in September as the rumors suggest, Bitcoin price is expected to surge in the short and mid-term. Most traders and experts including Mow have predicted Bitcoin price to surpass and stabilize at the $2,000 region in 2017.\n\nSo close to my $2k target. https://t.co/Lrz8zgQwvM — Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 20, 2017\n\nThe activation of a scaling solution could also potentially push Bitcoin price to $3,500, as mentioned by Zebpay co-founder Sandeep Goenka.\n\nHe said:"", 'Andrey Armyagov/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nCan bitcoin’s cryptographic technology help save the environment?\n\nIf you’ve heard of bitcoins, it may have been in the context of people using the digital currency to pay off ransom demands for the contents of their hacked computers or buy drugs on the dark web. But the underlying cryptographic technology, a growing chain of time-stamped records or “blocks” that is shared between many computers, forming a “blockchain,” could also be used to help save the environment, according to a commentary published today in Nature by Guillaume Chapron, an ecologist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Riddarhyttan. Science spoke with him about the future of money, the government, and trust. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nQ: What is a blockchain?\n\nA: The blockchain—by which I mean the technology underlying all blockchains—is a protocol to build an immutable ledger, a database of transactions. You could say it’s a kind of decentralized supercomputer that creates trust.\n\nQ: How can it help the environment?\n\nA: Environmental problems emerge because we lack trust. The environmental crisis grows in a fertile ground, which is the multiplication of intermediaries. To take an example, if you buy a fish at the supermarket, the supply chain is very long. The supermarket might not even know where it came from. And so there are multiple opportunities for environmentally unsustainable goods to enter the supply chain. A blockchain-based supply chain would mean that when you buy a fish, you scan a QR code [like a bar code] with your smartphone, and you see every step. And you know that it cannot be falsified.\n\nThe blockchain can also change how we treat ownership. In many developing countries, land rights are not properly defined and a government or a company could claim a land that is owned by a local community. So if we were to put a land registry on the blockchain, it would be immutable. We could not falsify that land registry.\n\nThe blockchain can also influence policymaking. Blockchain voting is a very cheap and secure way of organizing elections. Now, if you want to organize an election on how to manage a natural resource, whether it’s a forest or fishery, you need to plan the infrastructure, you need the ballot boxes, you need to tell people to go out and vote that day. That takes a lot of money, a lot of time. And in the end maybe people may not trust the results. With a blockchain, you could vote with a smartphone and your cryptographic identity and achieve strong security.\n\nThe fourth way is by changing incentives. A blockchain can ensure that an event will happen. That sounds a bit strange, but if you put a contract on the blockchain, you can include business logic as computer code. When a condition is met, the contract will be automatically executed. For example, we could have satellites remotely monitoring biodiversity, and if we reach a certain amount of biodiversity in an area we could reward the local community with immediate and direct payment. You could say, “How are you going to pay communities if they don’t have bank accounts, which is the case for about 2 billion people on the planet?” Then comes the blockchain again. They can simply create a bitcoin wallet as soon as they have access to the internet.\n\nQ: Are there downsides to the blockchain?\n\nA: There are several downsides. The first one is that the blockchain is still slow. It handles seven transactions per second, compared to 2000 for the Visa network. And then the big irony is that the blockchain is a giant sucker of energy, consuming almost twice that of the whole company Google. What’s needed is to develop a more energy-efficient algorithm. Another disadvantage is, if you have a bitcoin wallet and you lose your private key, your digital signature, then your bitcoins are lost forever. What we need is to hide the cryptographic complexity in smartphone apps.\n\nQ: Are a lot of ecologists interested in the blockchain approach?\n\nA: I’m not aware of any other academic papers that link the blockchain to how it can help the environment. We need more development. We have FinTech, which is using new computer technology to help the financial industry, but I am proposing the term SusTech, which is using new technology like the blockchain to help sustainability. And the other that has not been much mentioned before is cryptogovernance. We have cryptocurrency, like bitcoin. What I propose is to explore governance that relies on cryptography, through elections and contracts. When people understand more and more what the blockchain will allow, they will have more and more new ideas that we can’t imagine today. My paper is intended to stimulate thinking.', 'A ShapeShift Into the World of Trustless Asset Portfolios\n\n\n\n“ShapeShift” is a concept describing the ability to change form or identity to adapt to changing conditions. It is also the name of a Swiss-based company that created the world’s first trustless asset portfolio for acquiring digital assets without counterparty risk.\n\nLaunched today at the blockchain summit Consensus 2017 held in New York, the cutting-edge platform known as Prism seeks to usher in a new age for investors with a thirst for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Prism announcement comes on the heels of record-setting growth within the cryptocurrency market, with bitcoin among others advancing to new all-time price highs. Momentum has been further buoyed by a blockchain industry that is already experiencing an incredible diversity of projects, from tokenized venture capital funds to blockchain-based casinos to global distributed computing systems. Prism is the first live platform that enables investors to create their own funds focused on investments in crypto-assets.\n\nThis new development is the brainchild of Erik Voorhees, long-time champion of and entrepreneur in the Bitcoin space. ShapeShift, the company he founded in 2013, raised $10.4m during its Series A from leading German VCs in March 2017 to jumpstart this new venture.\n\nBuilt entirely on Ethereum-based smart contracts, Prism will enable investors to curate portfolios, known as “Prisms,” of digital assets known as “Prisms,” such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Golem. Within minutes, an investor can set up a crypto portfolio — absent of third-party intermediaries — and gain exposure to a wide swath of blockchain tokens. Moreover, they can secure their investments without having to establish a unique wallet for each asset.\n\nWith Prism, users will create their portfolios by funding it with ether (the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network). The total amount of ether is divided among whichever assets they decide on, in percentages they elect to allocate to each asset. When the investor is ready to finalize their Prism portfolio, they will be prompted to send a zero-ETH transaction to a provided Ethereum address, signaling the smart contract to close the portfolio.\n\nThe beta period for Prism will likely extend for at least six months after the launch, with new features being added over time.\n\nPrism’s approach and philosophy offers an ideal complement to ShapeShift and its established reputation for securing over a million secure transactions for customers since 2014. ShapeShift’s policy of not holding any customer assets or private personal information keeps users safe from identity or financial theft — a critical improvement in digital exchange technology.\n\nShapeShift is now leveraging their proven model of simplicity and security to cultivate Prism. With this latest development, the complex functionality of a diversified crypto portfolio is distilled down into a simple interface allowing users to buy, rebalance and settle their assets. All of this can be executed by a user with nothing more than their Ethereum wallet.\n\nPrism enables investors to gain secure, transparent exposure to digital assets in a way that has never before been possible. The days of leaving funds at an exchange ‘because it’s easier’ are over. - Erik Voorhees, CEO and founder of ShapeShift and Prism\n\nVoorhees goes on to assert that Prism’s digital asset portfolios, built entirely on non-custodial smart contracts, will demonstrate a new normal for financial security. “Prism takes us one step closer to a world of truly borderless finance. We suspect it will kickstart a vast horizon of financial experimentation upon smart contracts.”\n\nRaine Revere, lead engineer for the Prism project, says that ShapeShift’s focus on simplicity and security was a perfect fit for the design of Prism. “Part of the joy of engineering is seeing how all the pieces will fit together and then systematically carrying out that vision in order to build a working product. That link between vision and functional product is what makes software engineering so special. The vision of Prism was clear from the beginning, allowing this creative process to proceed uninhibited.”\n\n“Gone are the days of trusting a 3rd party with one’s wealth,"" said Voorhees in a statement. ""Prism’s digital asset portfolios, built entirely on non-custodial smart contracts, demonstrates a new standard in financial security.”', 'The proceeds of the financing, along with Company cash reserves will allow MGT to purchase 1,000 Bitmain Antminer S9 computers and associated power supplies.

Stephen Pair, the company\'s CEO, went as far as to call for a fork that would end in two bitcoins.\n\nPair said:\n\n""It\'s not working for us. The first option is to use a fork of bitcoin, second option is to use a fork of bitcoin, third option is to use a fork of bitcoin. We don\'t have any other option right now.""\n\n""Long-term we need one chain that\'s liquid and secure. But for a while we might run two versions of bitcoin to see which one works out,"" he added later, arguing that the market should decide which version ultimately prevails.\n\nNot everyone agreed that this is the best way forward.\n\n""Nobody that I\'ve talked to wants chain to split. I don\'t think there will be,"" said Peter Rizun, chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, another bitcoin client that has been the center of the bitcoin debate for the past year or so.\n\nThe DCG proposal was also raised during the panel, with Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo calling the proposal a ""logistics nightmare"" – but chatter on that subject was quickly derailed.\n\nOther options?\n\nIn a way, the panel showcased the many dimensions of the debate. Much of the discussion that took place centered on what role users on the bitcoin network play.\n\nOne of the more recent developments in the scaling debate is a proposed effort known as a ""user-activated soft fork"" (UASF), a mechanism that has been used in the past to push through a particular type of critical change to bitcoin (known as the ""consensus level""). Yet it didn\'t see much of the limelight until an unknown developer posted the idea as an alternative to the current mechanism, which requires near-universal support among miners.\n\nAdvocates have been advancing the concept as a way to push SegWit across the finish line. It\'s not a change mechanism that everyone agree is safe, but some on the panel seemed open to the idea.\n\nIn fact, Lombrozo put on a UASF hat several minutes into the panel.\n\n""We don\'t have to stay on the same chain. That\'s the freedom and the right that everyone has. Including the user-activated soft fork. I would never say that you can\'t do that,"" Pair said, agreeing that users have options.\n\nStill, the panel itself demonstrated how the debate has grown even more complex over time, with alternative implementations like Unlimited and Bcoin seeking a path forward. Bcoin is an alternative client that tries to solve the debate with an experimental technology that would effectively allow users to choose their own block size.\n\nPurse CEO Andrew Lee posited that Bcoin is a way to help diversify the community of developers in the bitcoin sphere, which he believes has been monopolized by one implementation, Bitcoin Core.\n\nDespite all the new developments and proposals, though, moderator Jameson Lopp argued that users should expect this kind of debate for the long haul, concluding:\n\n""This is a debate that in my opinion will probably never end.""\n\nDisclosures: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.

05/23/2017,"['Bitcoin may not seem as though it needs much help these days, having soared more than 400% over the past 12 months, but the industry surrounding digital currencies and blockchain—the cryptocurrency’s underlying technology—needs to address some major issues if it is going to be viable for a broad and mainstream consumer base.\n\nCheck out: Bitcoin’s rise: $1,000 invested in 2010 would be worth $35 million today\n\nThat’s according to Abigail Johnson, the chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments, one of the biggest champions of bitcoin and blockchain among traditional financial-services companies.\n\n“I like to think that huge new markets and products will be built on these platforms,” she said at Consensus, a blockchain-centric conference put on by digital currency site CoinDesk. “But before that can happen, we need to address the barriers there are to adoption—and there are several.”\n\nFidelity has made inroads into blockchain, according to Johnson’s keynote address, including venture investments, partnerships, and its own initiatives, but “most of our experiments have hit one roadblock or another due to the emerging nature of the technology.”\n\nShe cited four primary “roadblocks” that needed to be addressed.\n\n1). Technological shortcomings\n\nThe first concerns blockchain technology itself, about which she said there were “still questions to be answered,” though she was “confident that there’s good progress being made in this area.”\n\n“We understand there are important trade-offs that need to get made as these systems grow,” Johnson said. “We care about the trade-off between scalability, privacy, and achieving peer-to-peer settlement. It seems right now you can’t have all three.”\n\nOf these three, Johnson said that privacy was the most important, calling it “a core customer need” that was an area of investment for Fidelity initiatives.\n\nRead more about the issue of bitcoin scalability\n\n2). Regulation\n\nJohnson called regulation “the policy challenge,” arguing that innovation in the blockchain industry was happening so fast “that it is outpacing the regulator’s ability to keep up.” Regulators will have a steep learning curve, she added, “and that will cause some growing pains.”\n\nEarlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled against a product that would have led to the first bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded fund, citing a lack of regulation in the marketplace.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin’s rise: $1,000 invested in 2010 would be worth $35 million today\n\n“We need to continue to work with regulators to have an open dialogue about this technology,” Johnson said, adding that Fidelity was working with Coin Center, a nonprofit focused on cryptocurrency policy issues, to help the nascent industry engage with regulators.\n\n3). Control\n\nJohnson’s third roadblock involves “control,” as she put it. “Networks like bitcoin, by design, have no formalized management structure,” she said. “They’re open projects, which is great, but companies like ours, that build products on these platforms, don’t have the clarity on the future path they might take, or how to influence the developer communities.”\n\n“The financial services industry will need to work to understand the risks associated with who controls the features of these new systems,” she said.\n\nRelated: Citi, Nasdaq team up for blockchain payment system\n\n4). “Human problem”\n\n“The human problem,” is Johnson’s reference to how bitcoin and blockchain are often seen as “solutions in search of a problem.” Consumers won’t feel comfortable using these technologies, she implied, if they had few obvious applications for their daily life. “We need to come up with use cases for this technology that drives clear benefits for individuals and institutions.”\n\nRight now, “you won’t find a lot of compelling use cases” for the technology, “at least, not ones that can be implemented at scale.”\n\n“We need to come up with use cases for this technology that drives clear benefits for individuals and institutions.” Abigail Johnson, chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments\n\nShe added, “If you’re looking to beat Visa V, -0.34% at the point of sale today, you’ll be disappointed. If you look at it as a faster settlement system for financial systems, you’ll also be disappointed.”\n\nJohnson said the cafeteria in the Fidelity headquarters recently began to accept payment in bitcoin—doubling the number of places in Boston that did, she joked. Once, she said, an early bitcoin adopter in the office performed an experiment where he attempted to use it in the way he did traditional money. He was able to purchase a drink, but not return it, a limitation that caused great frustration and underlined the ways bitcoin isn’t yet making things easier for consumers on a daily basis.\n\n“We don’t just need these systems to be technically better; we need them to be more user friendly,” Johnson said.\n\nDespite these issues, Johnson said she was optimistic about the future of these technologies.\n\n“Even we at Fidelity can see that the evolution of technology is setting up our industry for disruption,” she said. “What if this new technology could do for the transfer of value what the internet did for the transfer of information? Blockchain isn’t just a new way to settle transactions; it can fundamentally change market structure, or maybe even the architecture of the internet itself. When combined with things like the Internet of Things or the cloud, there’s no underestimating the potential that’s on the horizon.”\n\nThe price of one bitcoin rose 8.8% to a new record of $2,493.33 on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. It is up 455% over the past 12 months, and more than 150% thus far in 2017.', 'Bitcoin’s dramatic surge may be more than just a speculative frenzy. The recent rally is being driven partially by enthusiasts rotating out of riskier digital assets and into the more established cryptocurrency, according to industry executives.\n\n""A lot of the volume into bitcoin right now is actually not dollar or yen or euro into bitcoin, but is rather alt digital assets,"" said Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of digital asset software platform Blockchain, at an industry conference Tuesday that brought in 2,700 people on the first day. “People do view a lot of these newer assets as more risky, and so when they make big gains there, they’re selling down those gains and rotating into bitcoin.""\n\nNumerous alternative cryptocurrencies, or "" altcoins"" such as ripple, have emerged since bitcoin broke into public consciousness in 2013. Companies can sell new tokens through initial coin offerings, or ICOs. While the cost of one bitcoin has skyrocketed to more than $2,000 from just 8 cents in 2010, you can buy one litecoin for about $30.\n\nThe price of ether, the cryptocurrency tied to the Ethereum blockchain, has almost doubled in the last week.\n\nSome are worried that there’s a bitcoin bubble in the making, but Smith and Erik Voorhees, founder and chief executive officer of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, aren’t too concerned. Booms and busts are a normal part of any economic cycle, they said at the Consensus 2017 conference.\n\n""Every time bitcoin goes through these bubbles, a whole new wave of users come in,"" Voorhees said. ""The reason that bitcoin is taking off is because banks have not been innovating.""\n\nRead more on Fidelity’s Abby Johnson’s view on blockchain barriers\n\nThe surge has also been tied to global political uncertainty and increased interest in Asia. Chinese stocks have slumped in recent months as bitcoin soared. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 6.9 percent from its high this year on April 11 amid concern authorities will step up measures to crack down on leveraged trading. China also may publish bitcoin regulations in June, according to a report earlier this month.\n\n""Bitcoin up 100% in under 2 months. Shanghai down almost 10% same timeframe, compared to most global stocks up. Probably not a coincidence!"" Doubleline Capital CEO Jeff Gundlach wrote in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nShapeShift users, only about 15 percent of whom are in the U.S., are moving small amounts of value between different digital tokens as they speculate about the best place to put their money, Voorhees said. Bitcoin is the ""least speculative"" of the digital assets, he explained.\n\nSmith’s company, which added former Barclays Plc CEO Antony Jenkins as a board member last year, has grown every year regardless of bitcoin’s price, he said.\n\n""One of the beautiful things about bitcoin is you get to see free-market economics at work every day, and bubbles and creative destruction are part of that process,"" added Smith, who said people have been incorrectly writing bitcoin’s obituary as it goes through natural up and down cycles. ""I’m sure we’ll add a lot of obituaries if the market reverses and we go down below $2,000.""\n\n— With assistance by Belinda Cao, and Lee Spears', 'The revolution will not be televised. It\'ll be sent to your inbox by us.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has yet again hit a new all-time high, increasing by more than $200 since the market opened on Monday to exceed $2,260 by midday on Tuesday. Faced with explaining why the price of a single bitcoin continues to balloon beyond expectations, many are looking to the global political situation. In the bitcoin world right now, the emerging conventional wisdom is that when it comes to stability, the world’s loss is bitcoin’s gain.\n\n“Assets” are just places to store your money as safely as possible. This can mean buying gold, or real-estate, or even just making an investment through the bank, but it always involves changing money into something with a greater expectation of gaining or maintaining its value. Obviously, the ascendant price of bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies (collectively called “altcoins) is driving interest through sheer potential for profit — but take a look at how bitcoin has reacted to recent episodes of global unease, and it’s clear there’s a lot more going on than simple bandwagon-jumping.\n\nLast year, when the UK was considering whether to vote to leave the E.U. (the so-called “Brexit” vote) bitcoin prices responded directly to the perceived threat of a successful UK exit. In the weeks leading up the referendum in late June, bitcoin prices surged more than 47%, but they also lost much of this when pre-vote polling suggested that Britons would probably choose to stay. Nobody knew what the E.U. would look like without the U.K., and nobody knew what the world would look like without the E.U. — and so, fewer people felt comfortable having their wealth tied up in a system they perceived to be in danger of a major downturn.\n\nThe worries don’t have to be that specific to effect whole economies, though. When Donald Trump took office last November, the world also reacted with a reflexive fear of the unknown and, once again, bitcoin benefited. Between November 2016 and January 2017, bitcoin surged almost $300 due to widespread fear about coming global instability — and then fell just as dramatically due to a sudden increase in confidence in the Chinese yuan.\n\nThe world had decided that America was becoming a less stable place to park money, and that China was becoming a more stable one; in a very real way, this caused a portion of the American economy to move to bitcoin, and a portion of the bitcoin economy to move to China.\n\nSo, while a huge proportion of the modern rise in bitcoin price can be attributed to its full or partial legalization in Japan and Russia in particular, it’s worth considering why those legal changes seem to matter so much to investors. In Russia, the decision to allow cryptocurrencies came amid a huge investigation into corruption in the banking sector, meaning that many wealthy Russians with money in those banks had a motivation to escape the Russian economy and, via bitcoin and altcoins, the means to actually do it.\n\nIn short, the large-scale movement of value into bitcoin has most likely not occurred because you can now use it to buy things from Starbucks and Amazon.\n\nOverall, there’s every indication of an inverse relationship between the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and global confidence in the world’s structures of economic power. It’s certainly not the only explanation for bitcoin’s price volatility, but it is a major contributor, and one that will likely drive quite a but of animosity from older, traditional economies.\n\nIf there’s a lesson to learn from all this, it’s that the best investment is the one everybody else is about to make.\n\nIf you liked this article, check out this video: ""Finland\'s New Basic Income Experiment""', '\n\nA Bitcoin sign is seen in a window in Toronto, May 8, 2014. (Reuters/Mark Blinch/File Photo)\n\nBitcoin has received a lot of attention over the past few weeks in the wake of the recent malware attacks that impacted dozens of countries and thousands of businesses around the world which required a “ransom” payment to be made in the digital currency to unlock files that were encrypted by the virus. The question for many business owners is that, given its growing acceptance, is it ready for prime time? Should we accept bitcoin?\n\nThere’s no question that it’s been a good investment, particularly if you bought at the right time. According to this report from CNBC, the price of a single bitcoin has recently soared to $2,200 from just $0.003 only seven years ago. We know this because on Monday its fans celebrated the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, spent 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John’s pizzas. Times have definitely changed.\n\nSo what’s driving the run up in price? CNBC’s tech correspondent Arjun Kharpal cites factors such as new legislation in Japan that allows retailers to accept the cryptocurrency (40 percent of all bitcoin trade is in Japan), the resolution of a dispute in the digital community that could’ve created competing currencies and the general market turmoil brought on by global economic uncertainty.\n\nPresident Trump’s stated desire to weaken the dollar and make American goods more attractive overseas may also be contributing. Not only that, but according to this report on CNN.com, a few high ranking members of his administration, like budget director Mick Mulvaney and vice president Mike Pence’s chief economist Mark Calabria, have both supported the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe currency is not backed by any government and can’t be physically held in your hands. It’s just out there–in the ether–and protected by blockchain, a digital recordkeeping system that’s so secure many banks are considering a move toward adopting it as the backbone of their payment systems.\n\nSome small businesses, particularly online retailers, are considering accepting bitcoin as another means of payment. Most investors agree that, although the currency’s meteoric rise is very attractive, it’s also an extremely volatile and risky investment. Once you start accepting bitcoin in your company you’ll have to ask yourself what business you’re really in: your business, or the currency business.', 'It\'s been a roller coaster 24 hours for Bitcoin as the digital currency sold off heavily and then rallied again.\n\nThe digital currency has become the plaything of choice for speculators at a time when global equity markets have lost their upward momentum and become more volatile. Leading U.S. money manager, and Barron\'s round table participant, Jeffrey Gundlach has an interesting theory regarding Chinese stocks as a driver of the crypto-currency. Here\'s CNBC with the details:\n\nIn a Tuesday afternoon tweet, Gundlach noted that bitcoin has doubled in less than 2 months, while the Shanghai composite has fallen ""almost 10%"" over the same time period. In contrast, most major indexes have climbed so far this year — the MSCI World Index is up nearly 8.8 percent.\n\nThe theory is the Chinese search for safe investments outside the country when asset prices fall sends buyers into bitcoin. The Chinese yuan\'s weakness in the last two years has also contributed to capital flight.\n\nOver in the world of fiat currencies, Bloomberg has an insightful commentary by economist Ben Emons looking at what Chinese moves to rein in its runaway leverage means for the yuan. Here\'s his take on why the pressures in China\'s economy could lead to a free floating yuan:\n\nA slower economy is all the more reason for China to allow foreign capital to flow into the economy, putting more pressure on officials to allow the yuan to float more freely, perhaps as soon as this year. Central bank policy stipulates that the yuan is restricted to moves of no more than 2 percent either side of the reference rate. A quicker transition to a market-determined exchange rate would allow China to stem the drop in foreign-currency reserves, maintain control over domestic monetary policy, and deter political criticism of currency manipulation.\n\nThe renewed volatility in China\'s stock market has been partly driven by concerns about stricter new banking rules and a shakeup of the top ranks of China\'s top regulators. Yang Jiacai, assistant chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, is the latest regulator to be investigated for corruption. Here\'s The South China Morning Post with what it all means:\n\nMarket watchers said Yang’s downfall, following the takedown of top insurance regulator Xiang Junbo in April, showed Beijing’s anti-corruption campaign on the financial industry showed no signs of abating.\n\n“Beijing is escalating its war against corruption in the financial sector as we see senior officials being purged from securities, insurance and banking regulatory bodies,” said Hu Xingdou, a professor of economics at Beijing Institute of Technology.\n\n“Corruption in the financial sector ultimately takes its toll in the broader economy, leaving all walks of life paying the price for rent-seeking in the sector,” Hu said.', 'Monday, Cointelegraph has reported that a number of leading players of the Blockchain industry have reached a consensus in regards to the Bitcoin scaling solution. This break in the scaling debate stalemate is a new, highly significant boost for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nAccording to sources, a number of Bitcoin businesses owners, including Barry Silbert (Digital Currency Group), Roger Ver (Bitcoin.com) and major mining players Jihan Wu (Bitmain) and Valery Vavilov (BitFury), have come to a general agreement at the currently ongoing Consensus conference in New York.\n\nThey have agreed to collectively enable the SegWit proposal for Bitcoin scaling, effective immediately. Additionally, their proposed solution includes a countdown to another hard fork, which will enable an increase of the block size limit to 2MB - as opposed to the current limit of 1MB.\n\nThis means that the problem of Bitcoin scaling, that has been unresolved for years, could soon become a thing of the past. This news comes quite on time, as the number of transactions being stuck in the backlog has reached record heights in recent days.\n\nUntil now, the community has been unable to come to a consensus on whether to enable Bitcoin scaling by activating SegWit, Bitcoin Unlimited, or some other technology.\n\nSome steps towards reaching an agreement were made before, including a meeting in February 2016 in Hong Kong. However, it differed in terms, and the discussion then did not include the people who have agreed to the current consensus.\n\nThis time, the new solution has received enthusiastic approval from key members of the community. Regardless of the differences in their technical expertise and ideological outlook, industry members came to realise that a compromise between SegWit and a block size increase may be necessary for further progress.\n\nCointelegraph has reached out to several key leaders of the Bitcoin industry, and asked them to comment on this major event:\n\nSarah Maxwell, Blockchain.com:\n\n""The consensus realized today reflects our collective desire to see the industry move forward. We are grateful to join these partners and are committed to helping Bitcoin reach its full potential to improve the lives of billions across the globe.""\n\nValery Vavilov, CEO BitFury:\n\n""We are glad that consensus has been finally reached. BitFury, along with vast majority, is fully supporting this historic decision. This is a very important moment for the ecosystem with this solution setting the new chapter for the Bitcoin technology.""\n\nBen Peters of Bitso.com:\n\n“I think it\'s an important step forward - it\'s taking Bitcoin over a major hurdle, and facilitating future scaling, while relieving what had become something of a short term crisis. I think the most significant thing about it is, however, that it was possible to reach a compromise within a community of very strongly-held and conflicting views. This bodes very well for Bitcoin\'s future growth and development. Both elements of the agreement contribute to transaction capacity increase, which means greater efficiency with respect to on-chain transaction cost. Segwit in particular helps open the door to the second-tier scaling solutions that will make small/micro transactions viable, so that\'s really exciting. Overall, I\'m really proud that it was possible to navigate this issue. I have always felt that all parties were acting in good faith in this debate, and I think that this agreement proves that.”\n\nDavid Schwartz, Chief Cryptographer at Ripple:\n\n“We’ve been saying that governance is important for many years. That the idea that you could have a decentralized system that just magically governed itself just doesn’t seem to be realistic. There are going to be decisions that have to be made: somebody wants SegWit, somebody doesn’t want SegWit; somebody has to win, and somebody has to lose. And there has to be some process to make that decision, or you are going to have, essentially, a war over every decision. And so I’m very pleased to hear that Bitcoin has reached some sort of agreement, and hopefully we’ll get some resolution to the block size problem. We’ve been focusing on governance from day 1. We have a system that’s governed by users, rather than miners, that we think aligns incentives better.”\n\nCharlie Shrem:\n\n""This is an important event because it represents the larger business and miner community who know what their users want.""\n\nMoe Levin, Director of European Business Development at BitPay:\n\n""I think there’s a lot of disagreement and there aren’t many good forums for people to discuss this without feeling a lot of pressure. And that makes progress difficult. There are some solutions which look more promising than others, and I guess time is the only thing that will be able to tell which is best. There are protocols which support better solutions.""\n\nKonstantin Gladych, CEO at Changelly:\n\n""I appreciate the consensus on the scaling solution. Bitcoin remains the stronghold of the crypto world. Changelly\'s users will be glad to hear the network will soon allow for faster transactions, as the demand increases drastically.""\n\nCharles Hoskinson, CEO & Founder at IOHK:\n\n""Segregated Witness is actually kind of a clever idea. It\'s well-tested, it\'s been around for a few years, it solves a few real problems, like transaction malleability, and it gives us a little bit more runway. It also activates things like the Lightning Network, so I think it\'s overall very good for Bitcoin. I think the holdover was seeing if it worked in practice, and since Litecoin adopted it, it was kind of the last mile, and now there is a lot of support for it. It\'s more of a gradual evolution of what features and functionality does Bitcoin need to adopt, to scale in a more general type of a system. So you think about overlay protocols like Lightning, or if you want to do things like microtransactions, and the system is never really going to be able to do that well with its current design. So being able to open that up is very encouraging. And it leaves the door open for future solutions, such as sidechains. Maybe in two-three years if that proves itself out, and we get better iterations, we\'ll see that work its way into the system as well.""\n\nJuan Llanos, Senior Advisor at One World Identity:\n\n""There\'s two worlds here: there\'s one world that has a vested interest in seeing the capacity of the blocks grow, so that there\'s more transactionality, more users on the platform; rather than just holders of Bitcoin for a storage of value, as investment, as a new asset class. So if you\'re a transactional firm, if you\'re selling services that have to do with the transactionality of Bitcoin - obviously you want more throughput in the technology. You want to compete with other payment networks, you want to become a more viable alternative. And the argument against the growth of the block is that it compromises security, because the point of having a smaller block is that the system is more resilient and less vulnerable to some form of attack. So, the more conservative thinkers, or the less commercially-focused people within the Bitcoin community want to take a more conservative approach, and they want Bitcoin to maintain the structure it has today, and they want to build the transactionality, and the speed, and the throughput on a higher-layer technology that they are building. You could also argue that they have a vested interest in the blocks being small so that their technologies and their solutions become successful. This is the way I see it - I think, it\'s all about commercial interest, or economics, or game theory. It\'s happening, and it happens everywhere, so the question is \'what\'s gonna give?\' and \'who is gonna compromise?\' and \'how is this gonna resolve?\' These are the question marks for everyone - we have no idea, and we\'ve been in the industry for years. But it\'s a very interesting experiment in distributed and non-institutional governors, if you will. It\'s a distributed system, where people are working on technology, they have the building infrastructure, they\'re building services, and there\'s no one making decisions. It\'s a fascinating world, and it\'s part of the new revolution in distributed technology.""\n\nBrian Armstrong, CEO & Founder at Coinbase:\n\n""I was excited to see a scaling solution come out for Bitcoin, combining 2 megabyte hard fork with SegWit. Bitcoin has been really struggling to scale for a while, and I\'m looking forward to seeing a solution for that. It\'s great to see the industry come together and come to an agreement.""\n\nDirk Siegel, Partner At Deloitte Germany, Lead at Blockchain Institute In ZGermany:\n\n""Firstly, it\'s a debate that was obviously necessary, because the block size was being reached. It was very important to have that issue resolved. We were watching this very closely, because we see it as a litmus test for how the ecosystem works. Whether it has the ability to structure, to overcome such situations, and if it can reform from inside. The fact that a consensus has been announced is a very important sign. A large number of important players seem to be on its side, as they have just announced. We believe that it will in all probability go ahead, and that would be a very good sign that the Bitcoin community has the capability to take these decisions. Nobody knows at this stage whether this will lead to some kind of fork - which could, of course, happen, if you don\'t have 100% on your side. It could be a hard fork, but maybe it clears itself out quite quickly, where the 10% or 5% that remain will join the larger community. Overall, we are very bullish and think that this is the right decision, and it will make Bitcoin a viable solution for the future.""\n\nThe significance of solving the problem of Bitcoin scaling cannot be overstated, as it finally enables the cryptocurrency to be used by the vast mainstream audience - something, which was considered impossible before.\n\nUPDATE: the official statement on the Bitcoin Scaling Agreement at Consensus 2017 has been released by the Digital Currency Group.', 'People may well remember 2017 as the year that blockchain broke.\n\nAfter years of development and flickering just outside of mainstream consciousness and acceptance, record high prices for the most popular blockchain-based cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and newcomer Ethereum and an embrace of the technology’s core principles by some of the world’s largest institutions may mean that blockchain technology is ready for its close up.\n\nNothing illustrates this more clearly than the just-announced $107 million financing for R3, the blockchain consortium that includes some of the largest financial services firms and technology companies in the world.\n\nLeading investors included SBI Group, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Intel and Temasek, the company said in a statement.\n\nR3 represents the largest consortium of global financial institutions working on developing commercial applications for the distributed ledger technology that’s at the heart of blockchain technology.\n\nIn addition to the big names that committed the most capital, R3 pulled in additional commitments from ING, Banco Bradesco, Itaü Unibanco, Natixis, Barclays, UBS and Wells Fargo.\n\nR3, which opened the first tranches of the company’s planned $200 million financing exclusively to members of the consortium, is one standard-bearer for the mainstreaming of blockchain technology.\n\nIndeed, the company already counts among its customers the government of Singapore, the Bank of Canada and other national financial institutions.\n\nThe company said it will use the funds to accelerate technology development and grow strategic partnerships for project deployment. R3 has its own proprietary ledger that can be used to develop applications, and it also supports an infrastructure network for financial services firms and technology companies to build their own ledger-based applications and services.\n\n“While still in its infancy stages, the emergence of distributed ledger technology comes at a time when the financial services industry is poised to further embrace technological change and efficiencies,” said C. Thomas Richardson, the managing director and head of market structure and electronic trading services at Wells Fargo Securities, in a statement.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by other financial services executives whose firms were members of the R3 consortium.\n\n“Innovation in digital technologies is reshaping the banking industry, and this investment is reflective of our belief that distributed ledger technology and smart contracts have the potential to significantly enhance capital markets infrastructure. R3’s collaborative approach is key to the progress of this technology,” said Andrew Challis, managing director of strategic investments at Barclays.\n\nNot all big banks and financial services firms have embraced R3. Goldman Sachs and Santander both dropped out of the consortium, perhaps figuring they’d be better off going their own way.\n\nWhere R3 has really shined has been in getting governments comfortable blockchain-based applications. Their approach of enlisting banks and financial services companies for projects is light years from the more subversive mindset of some of the developers of the original and the largest blockchain protocol, Bitcoin.\n\nAs some investors and entrepreneurs see it, there’s room in the market for both the private blockchains developed by communities around Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the sanctioned corporate ledgers that companies like R3 are developing.\n\nFor now, the technology that R3 is developing is focused on business applications like verifying transactions between banks, or automating the things like the establishment of the London Interbank Offer Rates.\n\nIn the future, the company’s technologies could touch consumers more directly — through the creation of a digital fiat currency.\n\nWhile that may be somewhere far off down the horizon, with the company’s connections to the banking industry and to national governments, it’s not beyond the pale.', 'Bitcoin just hit a new high in value, and other non-traditional currencies are rapidly appreciating, but curb your enthusiasm.\n\nSo says Brown Brothers Harriman, acknowledging the rising market capitalization of Ripple, which has surged more than six-fold to $13 billion, and of Ethereum, which was worth about $700 million in January and recently was valued at more than $8.5 billion. But if these so-called crypto-currencies are hoarded, BBH notes, they cannot develop the critical mass of networking to fulfill the other functions of money as a means of exchange, BBH writes. UPDATED: Yet crypto-currencies still are praised by bulls as an alternative to fiat currencies, though neither is typically backed by gold or silver. BBH\'s Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy; Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy; and Masashi Murata, emerging market currency strategist, write:\n\n"" ... There are several factors that may have spurred renewed interest in this space. Geopolitical uncertainty is running high. The seemingly unpredictable U.S. president, who antagonized friends and foes, is escalating the long-simmering confrontation with North Korea, has dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb in Afghanistan, and launched a missile strike on Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. European politics were perceived to be a grave risk. Chinese capital controls may have encouraged some interest in crypto-currencies as a means to circumvent the restrictions. The recent cyber-attacked demanded Bitcoins as payment (and some reports suggested at least $80k of bitcoins were paid). Also, recently demand from Japan followed the inclusion of the Bitcoin under the country\'s regulatory framework ...\n\nThe rising price for crypto-currencies and new interest does not alter our assessment. These are not currencies in any meaningful sense. To the extent that some retailers accept them is a bit of a novelty and marketing fluke. Some of the larger businesses, like Virgin, who previously indicated a willingness to accept Bitcoins as payment, reportedly convert such payments into hard currencies. It is a gimmick, not confirmation of its currency status.\n\nLeaving aside the questions of the origin of money, money, under conditions of modernity facilitates exchange, and is used to pay taxes and settle debts. When crypto-currencies can be used to pay taxes, and/or are generally accepted to retire debt, then their money status needs to be reviewed. Under present condition, none of the functions of money are met by crypto-currencies. They are hardly used as a means of payment. They are poor stores of value. They are not units of account.\n\nPeople can still make and lose money trading them ...""\n\nSubscribers can read Barron\'s latest Read This, Spike That feature, ""Trump and Bitcoin: Two Peas in a Pod"" and Barron\'s columnist Michael Kahn\'s March column, ""The Dollar Is Strong, but Bitcoin Is Stronger."" A few days later in March, the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a bitcoin exchange-traded fund promoted by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\n\nAmong emerging market currencies today, the South African rand is the big winner, up 1.2% against the U.S. dollar. The Argentine peso is stronger by 0.9%. Among weakening currencies, the Indian rupee tops the list, off by 0.5% against the greenback. The euro is fractionally weaker at 1.12 against the dollar today. So far this year, the Polish zloty has strengthened the most among emerging market currencies, up nearly 12%, and the Russian ruble is stronger by more than 9%. Few EM currencies are significantly weaker, though the struggling Turkish lira tops the list with a 1% decline against the dollar.\n\nCurrency isn\'t always a harbinger of equity performance: the iShares MSCI Poland Capped ETF (EPOL) is up 32% this year, while the VanEck Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) is down more than 3% on geopolitical and oil-price worries. The iShares MSCI Turkey ETF (TUR) has rallied 25% following a referendum consolidating President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s power.

A licensing scheme for new exchanges which began in April has already attracted around 20 applicants.', 'Forget Donald Trump or the Federal Reserve. It seems the only thing Wall Streeters want to discuss is the meteoric rise in the price of bitcoin -- and not in a good way. The crypto-currency has soared above $2,200, more than doubling since late March. In fact, if you were lucky enough to buy $1,000 worth of bitcoins in 2010, you\'d have $36.7 million today.\n\n\n\nEven with that jaw-dropping performance, bitcoin is struggling to gain any respect. Brown Brothers Harriman came out with a report today eviscerating bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, saying they are currencies in name only because they contain a fundamental contradiction. According to the firm, if they’re a supposed to be an alternative to fiat currencies, they should be hoarded as a store of value. But if they’re hoarded, they can’t develop the critical mass of networking needed to fulfill the other functions of money, such as a means of exchange. Their volatility also means they\'re not a good store of value. Whereas bitcoin often moves 2 percent to 3 percent or more per day, the dollar usually doesn’t move more than 1 percent. To the extent that some retailers accept them is a bit of a novelty and marketing fluke, not confirmation of its currency status.\n\n\n\n\n\n""These are not currencies in any meaningful sense,"" Brown Brothers strategists led by March Chandler wrote in the report. ""They are currencies to the extent that contacts on Facebook are friends and the \'grande\' means medium size at Starbucks."" About 16.3 million bitcoins exist, with about 1,800 new ones created, or mined, per day. That puts the size of the market at about $36 billion, versus the $5.1 trillion that typically trades daily in the traditional foreign-exchange market. Reasons for the rally vary, but include a decision by Japan last month to recognize bitcoin as a legal payment method as well as enthusiasts rotating out of riskier digital assets and into the more established crypto-currency along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\'s decision to review a ruling it made in March 10 that blocked a proposal for a bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\nSTOCKS RALLY AS \'OVERSHOOT\' BECOMES A REAL RISK\n\nIt wasn\'t pretty, but U.S. stocks managed to eke out a small, 0.18 percent gain to stage their longest rally since February. The S&P 500 Index has risen for four straight sessions, the most since it gained six consecutive days between Feb. 7 and Feb. 15. With a strong earnings season now behind them, investors are wondering what will be the catalyst to keep pushing stocks higher. In one ominous sign, the biggest exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 Index lost $16.2 billion in outflows over the last seven weeks, the largest drawdown for a period that long going back two years, according to Bloomberg News\' Oliver Renick. Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist at Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit, figures stocks are poised for a “speculative overshoot.” Hartnett cited a ratio between the MSCI USA Growth Index, dominated by technology stocks, and the MSCI World Value Index of developed markets as an indicator, according to Bloomberg News\' David Wilson. The ratio surpassed its March 2000 peak and set a record within the past month.\n\n\n\n\n\nWILL THE REAL BOND MARKET PLEASE STAND UP?\n\nThe bond market is sending some very mixed signals these days. A weekly JPMorgan Chase survey of fixed-income clients showed they are net bearish by the most since the start of 2017. Yet, the Treasury Department\'s auction of $26 billion in two-year notes drew the most demand in a year despite the consensus that minutes of the Federal Reserve\'s last meeting to be released Wednesday will bolster speculation that policy makers will raise rates again next month. Investors put in bids for 2.9 times the amount offered. Indirect bidders -- a class that includes pension funds and mutual funds -- bought 57.2 percent, higher than the 42.6 percent average at the previous 10 auctions. This week\'s auctions of coupon-bearing notes continue Wednesday with the sale of $34 billion in five-year notes before wrapping up Thursday\'s $28 billion offering of seven-year notes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBULLISH BETS BUILD ON NATURAL GAS\n\nThe market for U.S. natural gas may be about to break out of a rut, if hedge funds are to be believed. Hedge funds are the most bullish on gas since 2014, when prices rocketed to $4 per million British thermal units after a frigid winter depleted stockpiles of the heating and power-plant fuel, according to Bloomberg News\' Naureen S. Malik. Money managers are betting that forecasts for one of the hottest summers on record will pan out, straining supplies as exports rise and production from shale basins stages a slow recovery. “People are incredibly bullish about the summer overall, that we are going to see a ton of demand and that it’s going to be a hot one,” John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York, said by phone May 9. “$4 is definitely possible in the July and August time period.” Gas futures for June delivery fell 3.3 percent to $3.219 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange, making worst performer in the Bloomberg Commodity Index after sugar.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHINA BATTLES CURRENCY TRADERS\n\nThere\'s a tug-of-war happening with the yuan that illustrates the tension at the heart of China’s currency market. Almost every day, China’s central bank pushes up the yuan and traders push it down. Officials have used the daily fixing to guide the currency higher against the dollar for eight of the past nine days, surprising market watchers with its strength. That’s failed to inspire confidence in the yuan, which has closed lower than the reference rate on all but one of those days, according to Bloomberg News\' Emma Dai and Tian Chen. As a campaign to cut risk in the financial sector weighs on the nation’s bonds and stocks, the authorities are keen to maintain stability in the yuan -- as expressed through the stronger-than-expected fixings -- and limit outflows. Yet, with the deleveraging campaign showing little sign of ending, and an economic rebound looking shaky, traders see a weaker outlook for a currency that’s still slumping against peers outside the dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\nTEA LEAVES\n\nThe big event Wednesday will be the release of the minutes from the Fed\'s May 2-3 meeting. The release of the May post-meeting statement was a relative non-event, as the decision to hold interest rates unchanged was unanimous and the economic assessment was straightforward -- attributing first-quarter economic weakness to transitory factors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence economists. Given the stable outlook at the time of the meeting, officials likely had extra time to evaluate scenarios to start reducing the central bank\'s $4.47 trillion balance-sheet, the BI economists conclude. The minutes are likely to reveal the results of additional staff analysis, as well as signal the evolution of officials\' inclinations toward the timing and speed of any reduction.\n\nIf you’d like to get The Daily Prophet in e-mail form, right in your inbox, please subscribe to this link.

05/24/2017,"['The price of Bitcoin, the most popular digital crytpo-currency, has skyrocketed this year.\n\nAccording to Coindesk, bitcoins are currently trading for $2,483 per coin. The price is an all-time record, and the remarkable valuation blows earlier price spikes out of the water. Bitcoins have more than doubled since the beginning of 2017, when they hovered around $1,000 per coin. Bitcoin broke the $2,000-per-coin barrier on Saturday.\n\nThe run-up has led to increased interest in lesser-known digital currencies, like Etherium and Ripple. Ethereum, which is backed by large companies working on blockchain projects, has jumped in value from $8.24 at the beginning of the year to $203.30, according to CNBC. Ethereum prices began climbing in March, around the time when Bitcoin investors started ""getting jittery"" about whether Bitcoin software would be able to handle the increased level of transactions. Looking at the market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies, Techcrunch notes that Bitcoin now makes up just 47 percent of the total market value.\n\nGuessing what\'s behind the price increase is inevitably speculative. CBS news quotes market watchers who think digital currency value is being pushed up by economic instability in places like Russia, Nigeria, and South Korea. At Fortune, Jeff John Roberts argues that the mainstreaming of Bitcoin means that ""investors see it as a new asset class"" and are backing hedge funds to acquire it. Regulators in Japan and China have taken steps recently to formalize trading in Bitcoins, which has increased investment from Asia.\n\nPrice run-ups like this lead to ""if only"" type of thinking. Marketwatch published one portfolio manager\'s ""regret"" chart, showing that an investment of $1,000 USD in Bitcoin in July 2010 would be worth more than $35 million today. A $1,000 investment in a fund tied to the S&P 500 index would be worth around $2,500.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been highly volatile over the years, and it hasn\'t just moved in one direction. Bitcoins jumped to nearly $1,000 each in late 2013, but then plummeted in value, taking more than three years to rise back to that price point. 2017 is certainly a heady year for Bitcoin fans, but whether the crypto-currency gains widespread acceptance or ends up more like the 17th century Dutch tulip bubble, remains to be seen.', 'Image caption Blockchain\'s Peter Smith speaks at the Consensus 2017 conference in New York\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, a digital currency once located at the fringe of finance, has been rising to new records in recent months as digital assets move into the mainstream.\n\nOn Tuesday, it shot past $2,200 (£1,700), more than doubling from just two months ago. And a newer currency, Ethereum, has climbed even faster.\n\nIndustry members say uncertainty surrounding the value of global currencies, including the pound, is driving demand for alternative currencies.\n\nThe kind of technology that underwrites Bitcoin and newer entrants such as Ethereum, is also gaining, well, currency, as it gets put to new uses by developers and others looking to beef up cyber-security.\n\nPolicy changes in Japan and elsewhere in Asia have made it easier to trade. And of course, when it comes to price, interest generates its own momentum.\n\n""It\'s a promising technology,"" says Joshua Rosenblatt, 34, a Nashville-based attorney at Frost Brown Todd, a midwestern law firm with offices in eight states. He is both an investor and works in the field.

Victims were required to pay a ""ransom"" in the digital currency to unlock files that were encrypted by the virus. The question for many business owners is that, given its growing acceptance, is it ready for prime time? Should we accept bitcoin?\n\nThere\'s no question that it\'s been a good investment, particularly if you bought at the right time. According to a report from CNBC, the price of a single bitcoin has recently soared to $2,200 from just $0.003 seven years ago. We know this because on Monday its fans celebrated the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, spent 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John\'s pizzas. Times have definitely changed.\n\nSo what\'s driving the run up in price? CNBC\'s tech correspondent Arjun Kharpal cites factors such as new legislation in Japan that allows retailers to accept the cryptocurrency (40 percent of all bitcoin trade is in Japan), the resolution of a dispute in the digital community that could\'ve created competing currencies and the general market turmoil brought on by global economic uncertainty.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\'s stated desire to weaken the dollar and make American goods more attractive overseas may also be contributing. Not only that, but according to a report on CNN.com, a few high ranking members of his administration, like budget director Mick Mulvaney and vice president Mike Pence\'s chief economist Mark Calabria, have both supported the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe currency is not backed by any government and can\'t be physically held in your hands. It\'s just out there - in the ether - and protected by blockchain, a digital recordkeeping system that\'s so secure many banks are considering a move toward adopting it as the backbone of their payment systems.\n\nSome small businesses, particularly online retailers, are considering accepting bitcoin as another means of payment. Most investors agree that, although the currency\'s meteoric rise is very attractive, it\'s also an extremely volatile and risky investment. Once you start accepting bitcoin in your company you\'ll have to ask yourself what business you\'re really in: your business, or the currency business.', ""It was the seventh annual Bitcoin Pizza Day on Monday, which, if you haven’t heard, is the day nerds celebrate the very first bitcoin transaction. On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz used 10,000 bitcoin to purchase two pizzas. Seven years later, those pizzas would now be worth more than $20 million.\n\nCompare that to Bitcoin Pizza Day two years ago when the bitcoin pizzas were worth a measly $2.3 million.\n\nIn this way, bitcoin enthusiasts have been tracking the exponential growth of the cryptocurrency—because who doesn’t like money and pizza? At this moment, bitcoin is seeing a particularly large surge in value. CoinDesk estimated bitcoin’s value at more than $2,200 on Tuesday. You don’t need to be a math genius to know that’s a vastly greater sum than the $41 valuation it had back in 2010.\n\nAnd back then, you couldn’t actually buy a pizza using bitcoin; you had to trade your bitcoin with one of the few people using the cryptocurrency. Here’s the original call for pizza Hanyecz posted on a bitcoin forum in 2010:\n\nI'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy! I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire. If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal. Thanks, Laszlo\n\nBut, let’s be real, most people weren’t buying deep-dish meat lovers’ pies on Silk Road, the online black market where bitcoin proved to be especially useful in its infancy. Now that it’s lost some of that initial sketchiness (and still none of its mystery), you can use the cryptocurrency for totally normal, everyday items. According to Business Insider, you can now buy drugs, guns, and tiny cannons with bitcoin. Not bad considering no one really knows how it works."", ""Barry Silbert’s SegWit agreement is already mired in controversy amid confusion as to how to proceed and criticism from Roger Ver.\n\nThe meeting at Consensus 2017 Monday generated much hype, but just two days later the roadmap its participants agreed already has its detractors.\n\nHard fork first?\n\nChief among these is Ver, whose comments Tuesday appear to contradict Bitcoin.com’s place among Silbert’s signees.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited proponent Roger Ver wrote in a Reddit thread:\n\n“I wasn't there in person, but my understanding is that the two MB hard fork must come first. SegWit only activates if it gets 80 percent hash rate support.”\n\nHis version of the roadmap is furthermore the opposite way around to that detailed in an official summary of the meeting by Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, as well as in a circular to the Core mailing list.\n\n“FrankenSegWit” criticized\n\nMajor criticism also came today from MIT’s Jeremy Rubin, who released a 30-point list of reasons why Silbert’s idea was “flawed.”\n\nOther less than supportive reactions came from core developers Greg Maxwell and Eric Lombrozo. While the former referred to the plan as “FrankenSegWit,” Lombrozo in a series of tweets mentioned he had not attended Silbert’s meeting as he was against a closed-door agreement.\n\n“I was invited to that meeting but gave a precondition that nothing is to be signed and no decisions on consensus rules are to be made,” he wrote, adding that he “was not taken up on that offer.”\n\n@s1yz0r I was invited to that meeting but gave as a precondition that nothing is to be signed and no decisions on consensus rules are to be made. — Eric Lombrozo (@eric_lombrozo) May 24, 2017\n\nElsewhere, the roadmap is even attracting ridicule, with the meeting being compared to a similar pseudo-agreement reached by members of a Roundtable in Hong Kong in February 2016."", ""The government of India has fixed May 31, 2017, as the last day by which citizens can express their views of digital currencies on the government portal mygov.in.\n\nThis consultative process seems to be a step in the direction of taking some sort of stand on virtual currencies or digital currencies in India.\n\nAt the moment digital currencies like Bitcoin operate in a gray space in the country and there have been some controversies lately on the legality of Bitcoin in the second most populous country in the world. If the government is now taking on board public opinion it would appear that they are about to take a stand on the matter.\n\nShould Bitcoin be banned, regulated or observed?\n\nAccording to the government of India portal, one of the questions that the Indian government is asking the public is whether Bitcoin and other Virtual Currencies (VCs) should be banned, regulated or controlled.\n\nIn a post made on the government website, the government of India wants to know from people if virtual currencies are to be regulated what measures should be taken to ensure consumer protection and what measures should be taken to promote ‘orderly’ development of such currencies.\n\nThe government is also asking the question which institutions should be involved in the monitoring and regulating of VCs.\n\nInterestingly the government is also asking that if these currencies are not regulated than what should be the effective self-regulatory mechanisms and what measures should be adopted to protect consumers in a self-regulated arena.\n\nExamining existing framework\n\nIn March of 2017, the government of India has already constituted an Interdisciplinary Committee which is chaired by the Special Secretary for Economic Affairs.\n\nOn board, it has representatives from the Department of Economic Affairs, Department of Financial Services, Department of Revenue (CBDT), Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Reserve Bank of India, NITI Aayog and the State Bank of India.\n\nFrom the constitution of this committee, it can be guessed that the government is pretty much serious on examining the status of Bitcoin and other currencies in the country.\n\nSelf-regulation\n\nAt the moment the Bitcoin industry in India is pretty much self-regulated. However, there has been interest in the legal status of Bitcoin in India, which has been building over time.\n\nWe covered in April 2017 how Assocham, one of the oldest and largest trade bodies in India has held a ‘global summit’ which was on the topic of Bitcoin’s status in India. We had also covered the news of the efforts of various Bitcoin players in the country coming together to form the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI) in order to self-regulate the industry.\n\nMost comments positive\n\nThere are a number of positives that can be construed from this latest development in India. One is that the government is finally moving towards taking some sort of stance on Bitcoin, whether positive or negative.\n\nThe second is that there are a lot of positive comments being left on the government portal by common Indian citizens.\n\nTake for example Deep Sharma who writes:\n\n“Legalize Bitcoin in India like other countries, it's was a good step for our economy and provide a boost to the economy or increase GDP rate.”\n\nBisnuram Kramsa writes:\n\n“Cryptocurrency is the future currency so we have to regulate Bitcoin.”\n\nIt would appear that a Bitcoin-related legal framework will be in place in India sometime in the future. How soon and what shape it will take, only time will tell."", 'Earlier this week, CNBC, one of the few mainstream media outlets that have been offering extensive coverage on Bitcoin over the past few months, revealed that $100 worth of Bitcoin purchased in 2010 is now worth $75 mln.\n\nIn a relatively short span of seven years, Bitcoin price surged from around $0.003 to a staggering $2,389. That is a 796,000x return as an investment. In fact, today, on May 24, Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high at $2,392 and is continuously demonstrating a rising demand from both casual and institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin price hits new all-time high again for the second time this week at $2,392. Important to note, China made a strong comeback. pic.twitter.com/S8mceNDTqM — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 24, 2017\n\nThe majority of mainstream media analysts suggest that Bitcoin price is completely speculative in the sense that investors are purchasing Bitcoin solely expecting a massive return in value. However, as Cointelegraph previously reported, prominent investors including GoldSilver.com founder Mike Maloney are encouraging investors to hold Bitcoin as a mandatory asset to hedge against inevitable global economic uncertainty and financial instability, not just as a large return investment.\n\nBitcoin as digital currency and digital cash\n\nOn the contrary, the Japanese Bitcoin industry has been perceiving and considering Bitcoin as digital currency and digital cash. Some of the country’s largest conglomerates have launched fiat-to-Bitcoin exchanges to provide high liquidity for the rapidly expanding number of cryptocurrency investors in the region.\n\nAlso, some of Japan’s most influential companies including Bic Camera, Peach Aviation and Recruit Holdings, the company behind the country’s most widely utilized Point of Sale (PoS) systems are offering Bitcoin as an official payment option to their clients\n\nHence, the categorization of Bitcoin as a “risky investment” as noted by several mainstream media outlets including the Washington Post is not a fair evaluation of the role Bitcoin plays in the global economy. Bitcoin is the alternative financial network which is directly competing with the banking and financial industries. It is one of the only technologies that could render banking and financial industries redundant.\n\nIn an analysis, a Washington Post analyst wrote, “Most investors agree that, although the currency’s meteoric rise is very attractive, it’s also an extremely volatile and risky investment.” However, some of the world’s largest investment firms including Fidelity Investments, an investment firm which brings in more than $15.9 bln in annual revenue and manages $2.13 tln worth of assets, disagrees with the assessment and considers Bitcoin as a safe haven asset that is arguably more reliable than gold.\n\n""I love this stuff – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain technology – and what the future holds. But I am still a believer – and it\'s no accident that I\'m one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services firm that hasn\'t given up on digital currencies,” said Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson.\n\n“Safe haven” asset\n\nMost importantly, Cointelegraph previously revealed that Bitcoin outpaced and outperformed gold as a safe haven asset. A $10,000 Bitcoin investment in 2010 is now worth $200 mln while an identical investment in gold led to a negative return of $9,900.\n\nCointelegraph’s analysis further argued whether gold can be considered as a safe haven asset, if it is not able to hold its value or experience an increase in price amid economic uncertainty since a safe haven asset by definition is an investment that retains or increases its value amidst market turbulence and economic certainty, over time.', 'Guess who’s jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon?\n\nJohn McAfee, the pioneering and controversial anti-virus software developer, who took over as the chief executive officer of MGT Capital Investments Inc. last year and turned the video-game company into a cybersecurity firm. He expects the money-losing company to be profitable as it ramps up its bitcoin mining business, with the goal of becoming the biggest in the world.\n\n""We will definitely be profitable before the end of the year,"" McAfee said in a phone interview Wednesday. ""From bitcoin mining, we will get the experience and expertise to apply the blockchain to our security products.""\n\nMGT Capital announced plans last June for the first phase of its bitcoin operation, which was the company’s only revenue driver in the first quarter. It’s stationed in the mountains of Washington state and employs two people, whose primary job is to maintain the air conditioning system for the computers that are doing the mining, McAfee said. MGT Capital has a dozen employees.\n\nThe bitcoin venture generated $312,000 in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, according to a government filing. The company had a net loss of $5.89 million.\n\nMGT Capital said Monday that it received financing to buy 1,000 mining computers from Chinese firm Bitmain Technologies, bringing the total to around 1,300. It expects to start generating 225 bitcoins per month, up from about 100, which was the most recently disclosed number. The cryptocurrency is currently worth about $2,700 per coin.\n\nSkeptics have warned that there’s a bubble in the making. Bitcoin and other digital currencies like ethereum have surged as more companies embrace the underlying technology and some investors seek financial refuge from political uncertainty across the globe. MGT Capital primarily mines bitcoin, but also has small-scale operations for ethereum and monero, McAfee said.\n\nRead more about the surge in bitcoin and other alternative currencies\n\n""No matter how much government and regulators may scream and complain, there will be a world standard alternative currency,"" McAfee said. ""Bitcoin appears to be the one... It cannot possibly be a bubble.""\n\nBitcoin transactions are overseen by a network of so-called miners whose computers perform calculations to validate each transfer, preventing double-spending. Miners earn a reward of newly issued bitcoin. The pace of creation is limited, and no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever be issued.\n\nMGT Capital grabbed investors’ attention last year after naming McAfee CEO. The news sent its shares into a frenzy, but the euphoria quickly faded after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the company and the stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The company is now embroiled in a lawsuit with Intel Corp. over the use of the McAfee moniker. Intel bought the McAfee computer-security business in 2011, but recently sold its majority stake. McAfee, who wants to change MGT Capital’s name to John McAfee Global Technologies, sued Intel for the right to use his name.\n\nShares of MGT Capital surged as much as 63 percent Thursday to $1.14 in over-the-counter trading.\n\nMGT Capital employees who aren’t working on bitcoin are focused on the cybersecurity business, which McAfee anticipates will ultimately be the main revenue source as it expands product offerings, and the number of bitcoins left for mining dwindles.\n\nThe company’s Sentinel ""anti-hacking system,"" which consists of software and hardware, can reduce the time a hacker has to operate, according to its website. MGT Capital is also developing a "" privacy phone"" that features a kill switch.\n\n""I don’t know anyone more capable than me,"" said McAfee.

Grayscale Investments, a firm run by technology entrepreneur Barry Silbert, filed with the SEC in January to raise $500 million in an IPO for its flagship fund. The trust, which could IPO in October, has since increased its IPO size to $1 billion.\n\nIn the past seven days, the fund has almost doubled in value.\n\nThe SEC has not looked kindly on bitcoin ETF proposals.

Disagreements over the right solution had fueled fears the digital asset would be split into two.\n\nThis week, Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group, posted a pact signed by more than 50 companies on increasing the block size and activating Segregated Witness, a new way of verifying transactions.\n\n“It’s pretty significant to put this forward, have a consensus and move forward with a solution,” said Ryan Rabaglia, head trader at Octagon Strategy Ltd., a digital-currency trading firm in Hong Kong. “It’s always been on the back burner as something that can potentially disrupt bitcoin’s growth.”\n\nWhile the signatories represent 83 percent of bitcoin hashing power, many similar agreements have fallen through in the past, including one that was supposed to be activated in July this year. SegWit, which was released last year, has also drawn ire from some corners of the bitcoin community.\n\n“The whole industry is a bit immature in ways,” Rabaglia said.\n\n— With assistance by Yuji Nakamura', 'South Korean Bitcoin traders are facing asking prices of $4,500 as the virtual currency’s price continues to surge.\n\nOrder books from domestic exchange Coinone list a current price of 4,254,000 won ($3805), with a 24-hour high of 5,025,000 ($4494).\n\nThe wide spreads are unprecedented even compared to other recently inflated markets such as Japan, local exchange bitFlyer listing a price of 333,200 yen ($2980).\n\nOn Coinbase, one Bitcoin is currently selling for $2667.53 as of press time on Thursday.\n\nUsers have presented various theories as to why South Korea’s exchange market is so varied, these ranging from capital controls to en masse arbitrage and even a “debt-fuelled bubble” economy.\n\nBitcoin itself, meanwhile, is continuing to produce new price highs, flying in the face of those concerned that a new bubble has formed.\n\nData from CoinMarketCap on Thursday sees another reverse in altcoin fortunes, with only Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic posting gains over the past 24 hours.\n\nOn the topic of the latter, Barry Silbert is continuing his advocacy, tweeting on Wednesday that his Ethereum Classic Investment Trust “will be donating $390,000 per year to development, marketing & community support for Ethereum Classic (for 3 yrs).”', 'Messaging app Kik Interactive is the latest and potentially most well-established company to delve into a quirky new form of fundraising -- creating its own digital currency.\n\nKik, based in Waterloo, Canada, unveiled plans for an “initial coin offering,” a process by which it sells tokens that can be used to buy services on its platform. The idea is that as more and more people use Kik, the value of those tokens, called “Kin”, will rise in value.\n\nInterest in coin offerings is high, thanks to surging prices of bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Called ICOs, they give a wide range of people the chance to invest in a company or any other endeavor early on. While unregulated, they have proved popular, with investors spending around $330 million on tokens over the past year, according to data compiled by cryptocurrency blog The Control. Earlier this month, cloud-storage startup Storj raised almost $30 million in five days via an ICO.\n\nKik, which has raised about $120 million (in real money) from investors including Tencent Holdings Ltd., could serve to add a new layer of legitimacy to the process.\n\n“Kik will be the largest install base of cryptocurrency users in the world,” Chief Executive Officer Ted Livingston said. “Kin, on day one will be the most-used cryptocurrency in the world.”\n\nThe move comes as Kik finally reveals how many people actually use its app regularly each month: 15 million. That’s a far-cry from the 300 million total registered users number it was sharing around this time last year.\n\nKik has traditionally been most popular among teens because, unlike Facebook Inc.’s Messenger or WhatsApp, they don’t need a phone number to use it. Growth has been tough in the past few years though, as teenagers get smartphones earlier and Kik users switch to Facebook apps once they leave high school.\n\nKik plans to gift a certain amount of Kin to each user. They’ll be able use the new currency to buy games, live video streams and other digital products. The company’s goal is to attract new merchants to sell on the platform, creating a snowball effect where Kin becomes more valuable and more sellers pile onto Kik, increasing its popularity.\n\n“We will create an economy where millions and millions of mainstream consumers are earning in a cryptocurrency for the first time ever,’’ Livingston said. “They’re going to want to spend in that same cryptocurrency as well.’’', 'Coinbase said on Thursday it suffered outages this week as the bitcoin exchange saw “unprecedented traffic and trading,” with the digital currency hitting record levels.\n\nBitcoin fell as much as 6.5% to $2,263.72 at around 1:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, but rebounded shortly after to hit a fresh all-time high of $2,760.10.\n\nBitcoin hit a record on the BitStamp platform on Wednesday, driven by an uptick in demand for crypto-assets, with the creation of new tokens to raise funding for start-ups using blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin.\n\nSo far this year, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled.\n\nCoinbase, the world’s largest bitcoin company with operations in 32 countries, said the heavy traffic had caused outages at its website as well.

A year ago, bitcoin could be purchased for roughly $450. Since then, prices have risen more than six fold, climbing more than 156% in the past two months alone.\n\nWhy? In a note describing the various ""fans and fiends"" utilizing bitcoin, Ed Yardeni, founder of a research firm bearing his name, cites a CoinDesk article that notes the yen is the largest currency being exchanged for bitcoin -- more than 45% of the money flowing into bitcoin gets traded in for the Japanese currency.\n\nThe fact that Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson is a fan of the cybercurrency didn’t escape Yardeni\'s notice. He also remarked that bitcoin is the currency of choice for hackers and other cyber criminals.\n\nBut the real question remains how much longer can bitcoin keep climbing?\n\nOne analyst told CNBC that $2,800 is a key level for bitcoin. Forex Analytix’s Nicola Duke says it could signal a correction that takes the cybercurrency back down to $1,470. That marks a nearly 50% drop in value.\n\nAs CNBC reports, her technical analysis uses what’s known as Fibonacci retracement, a rationale that looks at the highs and lows of past rallies to assess future price movements.\n\nCurrently, the bitcoin world is in ""wave three"" and according to Duke\'s analysis, $2,800 could be the level at which bitcoin begins its fall. The price is likely to hit $1,780, but could even fall as far as $1,470, Duke told CNBC. This would mark a 46.5 percent decline from Thursday\'s high.\n\nAccording to Fibonacci analysis, the way bull markets typically work is that you\'ll have a pullback that stops when it retraces a key percentage of a previous move higher—these key percentages all come from so-called Fibonacci ratios. One of those ratios is 61.8 percent.\n\nSo she expects this particular wave, known as the fourth wave, to last 61.8 percent of how long wave two lasted, which means the rally after the correction would start in January.\n\n""We will see the bottom in start of January, that is when stock markets typically tend to have a correction as well,"" Duke said.\n\nIf bitcoin\'s wild ride wasn\'t strange enough, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) extended its recent eye-popping gains.

We know this because on Monday its fans celebrated the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, spent 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John’s pizzas. Times have definitely changed.\n\nSo what’s driving the run up in price? CNBC’s tech correspondent Arjun Kharpal cites factors such as new legislation in Japan that allows retailers to accept the cryptocurrency (40 percent of all bitcoin trade is in Japan), the resolution of a dispute in the digital community that could’ve created competing currencies and the general market turmoil brought on by global economic uncertainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s stated desire to weaken the dollar and make American goods more attractive overseas may also be contributing. Not only that, but according to a report on CNN.com, a few high ranking members of his administration, like budget director Mick Mulvaney and vice president Mike Pence’s chief economist Mark Calabria, have both supported the cryptocurrency.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

It’s just out there - in the ether - and protected by blockchain, a digital recordkeeping system that’s so secure many banks are considering a move toward adopting it as the backbone of their payment systems.\n\nSome small businesses, particularly online retailers, are considering accepting bitcoin as another means of payment. Most investors agree that, although the currency’s meteoric rise is very attractive, it’s also an extremely volatile and risky investment.

I can’t! But it happened!\n\nThe earliest investors saw a staggering 40,000% gain in Bitcoin prices since this cryptocurrency first went into circulation in 2009. If you\'re a Bitcoin investor looking for a sound Bitcoin price prediction 2018, then rest assured, because some obvious tailwinds are likely to push prices further up north in the coming years. I say this regardless of how many more Bitcoin halving events come and go.\n\nYou see, Bitcoin prices made history this year. Prices rallied to all time highs. There is a reason why, and I’ll get to that shortly.\n\nFirst, let\'s give credit where it\'s due. Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto created this cryptocurrency in the hopes to someday replace fiat currency . Up until last year, that idea seemed merely the figment of a fool’s imagination. It\'s true that naysayers long decried the practicality of Bitcoin as an alternative mode of payment. But, as it turns out, they are on the wrong side of history.\n\nBitcoin has managed to garner significant public interest from around the globe. In fact, the fan base of Bitcoin bugs, who subscribe to the idea of a borderless, free-market currency not controlled by the invisible hands of any central bank or government, is exponentially growing.\n\nTo give you an idea, up until the end of 2016, a Bitcoin price prediction of $2,000 had seemed absurdly high. But today, price targets for 2018 are being raised to five-digit figures, with some quoting a figure as high as $13,000 a bitcoin!\n\nIf you think that number sounds outlandish, wait until you hear the six-digit Bitcoin price prediction for 2030.\n\nSome renowned Bitcoin bugs are forecasting the Bitcoin price to hit a whopping $500,000! No kidding!\n\nYes, $500,000 for one BTC in just 13 years! It may seem bizarre in absolute terms, but if you look at it in percentage terms, that’s just about a 21,000% gain in price—a little over half the stupendous 40,000% return we’ve already witnessed.\n\nCase in point, the market is already flooded with a plethora of wild Bitcoin price predictions for 2018. So I’m not going to follow suit and put another hefty price tag on Bitcoin\'s value in the future. Instead, I’ll go with a different spin for my analysis.\n\nRather than making a Bitcoin\n\nprice\n\nprediction 2018, I’m going to make a Bitcoin\n\ndemand\n\nprediction for 2018. Hopefully, that will help you wrap your head around these high quadruple-digit Bitcoin price forecasts.\n\nIs There More Upside to Bitcoin Prices?\n\nMy one word answer: Yes!\n\nYou see, in the supply/demand price equation, the supply of bitcoins is a constant. Nakamoto wrote the Bitcoin code in such a way that only a total of 21 million bitcoins will\n\never\n\ncome into circulation. So far, a little over 16 million have been unlocked from the code and put into circulation.\n\nWith supply out of the picture, the only other variable that can shift Bitcoin prices is demand. And demand is skyrocketing!\n\nYou may find my clichéd choice of verb somewhat dubious, but hear me out and you’ll realize why this Bitcoin price prediction is not an overstatement.\n\nLet\'s first establish one fact: for Bitcoin demand to keep growing, average people like you and me will have to be given an incentive to transact in this digital currency. Let me give you an idea what these incentives could be.\n\nPeople will be able to make payments for goods and services using bitcoins, with both ease and speed. Countries will legalize and regulate Bitcoin use, then start taxing it like fiat currency. Businesses will start accepting Bitcoin as a mode of payment. Banks will start selling Bitcoin-based financial products and services.\n\nAll of these incentives will create an economic environment suitable for this alternative currency, similar to fiat currency.\n\nNow, what if I tell you that these incentives have already been dished out in certain parts of the world?\n\nTo give you an idea, Bitcoin is already being used as currency in certain remote parts of the world, like far-flung villages in Afghanistan and Somalia, where commercial banks are few and far between. Likewise, technology-savvy locals are choosing to accept remittances to avoid waiting times and banking fees associated with foreign currency transfers.\n\nLikewise, other countries are following suit. Take, for instance, Japan where two of the country’s biggest retailers have started accepting bitcoins as payment.\n\nOn the same lines, central banks and governments are finally becoming a party to the Bitcoin revolution. Many central banks have officially accepted it as a legal currency. Countries like Russia and India, which formerly discouraged its use, are now opening up to it. European governments like Finland and Sweden have formal regulations in place similar to those for fiat currency and are also taxing Bitcoin use. In fact, Sweden’s regulatory body lately incorporated a company by accepting payment solely in bitcoins.\n\nInterestingly enough, banking products and services built for Bitcoin are also becoming popular. Bitcoin debit cards are already in circulation, and now, the first-of-their-kind Bitcoin ATMs are being set up in Japan.\n\nAll in all, Bitcoin is quietly creeping into the mainstream.\n\nMy point is that these incentives are gradually luring more people to this cryptocurrency, ultimately continuing to push its demand skywards, all of which promises a very optimistic Bitcoin price prediction in 2018.\n\nIn a nutshell, demand is on the rise against a finite supply. If I go by economic theory, the sheer supply/demand mechanics suggest that prices should continue to trend upwards\n\nI’m looking at the metaphorical crystal ball in front of me (the Bitcoin price chart, in fact), and a vivid uptrend is obvious. Bitcoin price has already crossed the $2,000 milestone with Bitcoin market cap surpassing $40 billion. The next pit stop might be at $5,000 no later than 2018. So keep your eyes open!\n\nWill Bitcoin Halving Affect Bitcoin Prices?\n\nThe concept of Bitcoin halving is fairly easy to grasp. Nakamoto wanted to ensure that Bitcoin prices couldn\'t be manipulated. So he put certain limits on it.\n\nI like to call Bitcoin the digital equivalent of gold. The similarities between the two are simply uncanny.\n\nJust like gold, bitcoins must also be figuratively ""mined"" in order to be put into circulation in the economy. What Bitcoin mining literally means is to solve the mathematical puzzles, which Nakamoto created, in order to unlock bitcoins.\n\nBut miners don’t do it for free. They are rewarded with Bitcoin wages. For every mathematical puzzle they solve, they get to keep a portion of the unlocked bitcoins as a reward.\n\nHowever, like economic theory suggests, as more and more miners come in, their compensation must fall. So roughly every four years, the amount of bitcoins being released out of each Bitcoin block (the digital equivalent of a gold mine) and the miners’ reward is going to halve. This is what is known as Bitcoin halving.\n\nNow, Bitcoin halving is a boogeyman that scares most miners. In layman\'s terms, halving threatens their mining business.\n\nThat’s because Bitcoin mining is a capital-intensive business just like gold mining. Bitcoin miners not only have to invest in expensive computers with super fast computing power, but they also have to pay hefty electricity bills to keep the servers up and running.\n\nNaturally, if they’re not breaking even with these costs, they’ll go out of business. So, with rewards falling, the incentive to mine will dwindle, demand will fall, and so will prices. Plus, with more bitcoins in supply, prices will naturally face downward pressure.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of the two past halving events and the one upcoming event. The next halving event expected in 2020 will cut down the reward for solving puzzles from roughly 12 bitcoins to about six bitcoins.\n\nHalving Date Post-Halving Reward November 28, 2012 25 July 9, 2016 12.5 Jun 23, 2020 (estimated) 6.25\n\nIn theory, this does sound like a problem. In practice, however, the last two halving events have had little effect on prices. Whatever little price correction was witnessed was countered with an ensuing reversal, as Bitcoin prices made new highs in the following months.\n\nSo should Bitcoin halving scare you as an investor? Definitely not!\n\nBottom Line on Bitcoin Price Prediction 2018\n\nTake note that I’ve backed my claim of higher Bitcoin prices with plenty of reasons that support growing demand for the cryptocurrency. Yet, a fair forewarning is that my Bitcoin price prediction could turn out to be erroneous, should the demand for bitcoins unexpectedly head south.\n\nIn the developed world, a bajillion new Bitcoin startups have propped up in recent years. New Bitcoin-based products and services are being introduced every now and then—like Bitcoin wallets and Bitcoin commerce mobile apps—to make it easy for newbie Bitcoiners to transact in the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, a number of businesses in the U.S.—like(NASDAQ:EXPE),(NASDAQ:MSFT),(NASDAQ:OSTK) and(NASDAQ:DISH)have also started taking bitcoins as acceptable payment, and that number is growing.What’s more, mass-market interest in the currency is on the rise as people seek safe-haven investments beyond precious metals. Plus, Bitcoin is attracting privacy-conscious people who dislike surveilling governments and prying businesses. Beyond Bitcoin, venture capitalists around the world are also funneling hefty funds into Bitcoin’s blockchain technology. Technology heavyweights like(NYSE:IBM) and big banks like(TSE:RY) are also investing in Nakamoto\'s blockchain concept.So do your research before jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Nonetheless, I\'m seeing way more upside to Bitcoin prices in the coming years. With prices hitting new milestones overnight, I foresee the $5,000 mark likely being reached sooner than later.', ""Talking Points:\n\nThe S&P 500 lead US equities with a jump to record highs while VIX edged ever low, but conviction is still half-hearted\n\nDerision at NATO Summit adds to unsteady forecast, G7 ahead will carry more definitive economic and capital implications\n\nCrude oil tumbled despite OPEC's extension of production cuts, Bitcoin's volatility leverages sharp intraday drop\n\nRetail FX trader positioning on EUR/USD is starting to retreat from its extreme net short position while the dive in oil prices has led to relatively little adjustment from traders. How are traders positioned in your favorite assets? Visit the DailyFX Sentiment page to find out.\n\nComplacency remains a hallmark of the global financial system. Yet, what are we to make of this lack of commitment when we see steady extension of risk exposure through benchmarks like the S&P 500 and VIX volatility index on the one hand. While on the other, we witness extreme volatility from crude oil and Bitcoin. It is clear that there are unique developments charging the volatility of these substantial moves, but how resilient are other markets to similar jolts of headline or thematic pressure? From the US equity indices this past session, we saw much the same mentality that has dominated over the past few months: a measured but steady build up of risk exposure. The S&P 500 managed to clear its multi-week range on a sixth-day advance and subsequently close at a fresh record high. The speculative charge for follow through that normally follows a break from range remains conspicuously absent. Further, the foundation for a 'risk' based move hasn't gained serious traction. European equities, carry trades and high-yield assets showed little of the same enthusiasm. For those wanting to take advantage on bullish technical moves for risk-oriented assets, it is better to keep targets, time and exposure down to reasonable levels.\n\nOn the docket, the fundamental event risk looking to combat the seasonal lull included a few important summits. Far more important than the market reaction accounts for, the NATO leaders meeting reminds us that protectionism is still a growing threat to global growth and possible capital flow. The previously unshakable defense collective of countries is under pressure from the US and other forces that are balking at the costs and uneven contributions of its members in an increasingly competitive (economically) world. If safety is compromised by these strained relationships, investors will grow increasingly more cautious about their exposure and question their already-exceptional risk load even more intensely. For sheer market impact, the OPEC meeting proved the more profound event - though not in the way the standard fundamental playbook would suggest. The gathering of OPEC and important non-OPEC producers resulted in a nine-month extension to cuts. Despite the supply constraint, crude tumbled on the day. This reminds us that traditional fundamentals (and technicals) are less important than general market conditions for influence nowadays.\n\nAs remarkable as oil's dive was Thursday, it wasn't the most attention-grabbing move. That distinction would go to Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has been flying to record high after record high this week. The first half of the session opened the same way with an aggressive rally that seemed as if it would close out a ninth consecutive advance. However, the market hit an intraday barrier just below 2,800. The alternative asset flipped quickly and in three hours had lost 14 percent of its value from the intraday record high. This market reminds us the importance of monitoring market composition - or the weighting of participants. In the mixture of speculator, institutional interest and more; we discover motivation and trading style. Looking ahead to the final session of the week, we should keep a weathered eye out for bouts of volatility. Yet, with an extended holiday weekend in the US, it will be difficult to raise the dead (volatility) in the main stream markets. If anything could motivate such a sudden change in the markets though, a breakdown in relationships among the G7 would certainly qualify.

Specifically, are central banks acquiring bitcoin to hold as reserves alongside gold and foreign currencies?\n\nVinny Lingham, a well-known entrepreneur and digital currency enthusiast, predicted last year that a price surge could lead governments to take a strategic interest in bitcoin as an asset.\n\n“If Bitcoin started to surge globally, and as a result of strategic interests from any one government, if other governments decided to own a piece of the limited 21m coins in issue, I believe this would trigger something akin to a digital commodity race. Imagine if China started buying up large amounts of Bitcoin — would the rest of the world governments stand idly by and watch?” he wrote in a blog post.\n\nLingham made the point again on Twitter this week, citing a possible rivalry between Asian countries:\n\nWell, looks like Japan started – same principle applies.

The Central Bank of Barbados, for instance, published a research paper on whether the country should buy digital currency.\n\nAnd other CEOs have made the same suggestion:\n\nI believe some governments will start buying small amounts of bitcoin as reserves in 2017.

Specifically: There’s a limited supply of bitcoin, it’s easy to trade, and its price is not dependent on governments or regular financial markets.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAs to whether Asian governments are actually acquiring bitcoin, there is so far no hard proof. But bitcoin investors have long looked nervously at the extensive mining operations in China, which are effectively under control of the government.\n\nThe prospect of Chinese control, along with the incredible surge in bitcoin’s value, is something that could spur the governments of Japan and Korea—where bitcoin is trading higher than anywhere else—to acquire the cryptic currency.\n\nFinally, some fear bitcoin is still vulnerable to a so-called 51% attack—an existential threat in which more than half of the world’s bitcoin miners join forces, allowing them to manipulate the blockchain records on which all bitcoin transactions are stored. Today, such an attack is considered too big for anyone to pull off—except, perhaps, a nation state.\n\nNational governments jostling for control of bitcoin could also trigger new forms of crime or economic aggression on the Internet. (If that sounds far-fetched, consider how North Korean attackers robbed the central bank of Bangladesh through the SWIFT banking system).\n\nFor now, all of this is just speculation. It’s entirely possible that what we’re seeing is yet another instance of a speculation-fueled bitcoin bubble that will be followed by a crash.

I just got a message from the school informing me that they are pleased to announce that they will now be accepting bitcoins for tuition payments.\n\n\n\nIt\'s a really interesting time to be getting this email given that the value of a bitcoin has gone up 30% in the past week and has doubled in less than two months.\n\n\n\nIf I chose to take them up on their offer I would be paying them about nine and a half bitcoins at the current price. If I had paid my bill in bitcoins a month ago it would have cost over 17 bitcoins. Two months ago I would have owed them nearly 24 coins.\n\nThis seems a bit too speculative for both us and the school.\n\nAre they betting that bitcoins are going to continue to go up? What if they don\'t? This week alone bitcoin saw a massive reversal that — had it continued — could\'ve caused the school a lot of trouble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr are they simply providing a service for extremely tech and finance savvy parents by converting the coins to cash immediately?\n\n\n\nEither way, to me it seems too speculative for just a regular bill paying task. I know there is no difference between me paying with bitcoins I already own, because I can just purchase more at the same price.\n\n\n\nBut if I don\'t replace my bitcoins and the value doubles or triples before the first day of school, I will feel like I paid two or three times as much I should have. This feeling of regret avoidance is a behavioral bias that I should be able to see past — but I simply can\'t.\n\nAnd it seems my husband feels the same. He emailed me immediately saying ""I think we should pay in USD.""\n\nSo, for now, our few precious bitcoins will stay in our account and maybe we can pay next year\'s tuition with one coin instead of ten.\n\nUPDATE: I have heard from the school since this article was published. They have informed me that when the bitcoin is transferred into their Coinbase account it goes directly into their USD wallet and is converted to dollars instantly. According to the school, they are not exposed to any exchange risk.', 'Many investors in Bitcoin believe it has a huge future including an everyday role for all households and businesses. These individuals would certainly not be shocked by the absolutely breathtaking moves we have seen in the digital currency through much of 2017.\n\nOthers have a reasonable understanding of Bitcoin, but never really actively traded the digital currency, preferring more traditional financial markets like the Dow Jones or the DAX. And there are also those who still have very little understanding of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly, and are reluctant to trade something they haven’t researched. After Bitcoin’s 190% rally since 27 March, these individuals may also have little appetite for a financial market that can move with such ferocity.\n\nIG’s client flows show that Bitcoin is not just gaining in popularity but is actually a product that is now firmly ingrained in client’s watch-lists. In a financial market devoid of volatility, and in many cases strong underlying trend and momentum, Bitcoin is looking attractive. One could say it trades akin to a micro-cap mining exploration company that is sitting on a tenement set to rival any of BHP Billiton’s tier one mines. However, we are not talking about a market capitalisation of $20 million. We are talking about a markets cap of $38 billion, where even the institutional players are involved in a big way these days.\n\nIG has been offering Bitcoin for a number of years now, but in the last few weeks trading volumes have lit up. That happens when Bitcoin makes it onto the front pages of mainstream newspapers and on-line publications. Social media is abuzz with traders and financial market participants detailing meaningless random statistics, such as a $100 investment in Bitcoin in May 2010 would now be worth $72 million, and cries that ‘this is it, Bitcoin is going to $10,000.’\n\nBitcoin is a study in momentum trading\n\nThat view may well play out – we shall have to wait and see. But it looks like Bitcoin has almost certainly cemented itself as a case study in trend and momentum trading, and ultimately an exercise in following money flow. The most important aspect is that Bitcoin has schooled us in the concept of letting profits run and subsequently trailing the stop loss – key concepts to any successful trader.\n\nWe will look back in two years and talk of this run in Bitcoin and ask ‘were you in Bitcoin?’ and ‘how long did you hold on for?’ Some would have bought and held on for the price to rally to $100 and even $500 in some cases, before human emotion kicked in and forced traders to take the profits fearing that the exponential move higher comes crashing down. Psychology obviously plays a big part here – as human beings always feel the need to be right and taking profits always feels good.\n\nHowever, instead of simply taking profits for the sake of taking profits, why not adopt a more mechanical mindset that keeps us in the trade for longer, in turn, etching out as much profit as we possibly can.\n\nBitcoin technicals\n\nWe can see that in a number of cases in the last few years, once price closes above the seven-day exponential moving average (EMA) it has a tendency to hug this average on genuinely strong rallies. In the early stages, and certainly when the move is really gaining momentum, every sell-off will be limited by buyers stepping in at this short-term average. It also helps if we see the relative strength index (RSI) rising sharply, showing the rate of change in price heading higher, and we want to see the seven-day EMA accelerating away from the 20-day EMA. One can look to close the trade when the price closes below the short-term average and preferably with the RSI moving back below 70.', 'Is Ethereum on the Rise?\n\nBitcoin may have been the first cryptocurrency, but it’s certainly not the last. Smart investors should be on the lookout for others with more features and faster transaction times, ones that could easily mimic the rise of Bitcoin (BTC) prices.\n\nThe most notable of these is Ethereum (ETH).\n\nEthereum is easily the most talked-about cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, despite being less than two years old. Its newfound fame is probably due to the 13,633% gain since September 2015.\n\nAnyone who had invested $1,000 at that time would have $137,330.00 in their pockets right now.\n\nA lucky few made that bet. But don’t despair, because the Ethereum price prediction still has enormous upside potential.\n\nThe Bitcoin price prediction, on the other hand, is getting a little stale. No doubt that statement will infuriate Bitcoin fanatics everywhere, but it should not be controversial. The math says it all.\n\nIf we see Bitcoin jump $1,000 in the next six months, investors would only make 43.8% returns. That’s because Bitcoin is already priced at $2,283!\n\nInvestors have already drained it of profit, which means further gains would be hindered by “starting from a high base.” Newer cryptocurrencies, by contrast, start from a “low base.”\n\nNone of this changes the fact that Bitcoin has made people very rich. I am not trying to discredit the enormous gains that Bitcoin provided to its earliest supporters. To do so would be ridiculous.\n\nI know full well that early Bitcoin miners turned $100.00 into $72.9 million, and in only seven years!\n\nThere are few, if any, investments that could match those kinds of returns, so I don’t want to sound disparaging.\n\nUnfortunately, that does nothing for investors who stayed out of Bitcoin. Even if they lock in at this moment, it would take a miracle for them to accumulate triple-digit returns.\n\nThat’s why investors must look to younger cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Other Cryptocurrencies Stand Against Bitcoin\n\nThe market for cryptocurrencies is growing rapidly.\n\nTo speed it along, key industry players have developed a pipeline for new currencies. It looks a lot like the stock market’s pipeline for new companies.\n\nFor instance, companies go public through an initial public offering (IPO).\n\nThis grants them a ticker symbol, like “AAPL” for Apple Inc., or “FB” for Facebook Inc. Investors then buy shares of the company on whatever exchange the company decided to list.\n\nCryptocurrencies developed a similar process of going public called an initial coin offering (ICO). (Source: “The Initial Coin Offering, the Bitcoin-y Stock That’s Not Stock—But Definitely a Big Deal,” Wired, March 16, 2017.)\n\nICOs are basically crowd sales for companies whose business models require the native use of a token (otherwise known as a cryptocurrency). Think of Kickstarter or Indiegogo, but throw Bitcoin into the mix and…voilà. You have yourself an ICO.\n\nIf this experiment proves successful, it will threaten the entire venture capital business. Startups could directly reach (and have been reaching) average investors through the brilliance of blockchain currencies.\n\nIn the last two years, for instance, the ICO market volume eclipsed Bitcoin’s market cap.\n\nThis means Bitcoin is facing increasing competition from new cryptocurrencies, many of which are more versatile and computationally more powerful. Here are some of the biggest threats.\n\nSymbol Name Market Cap Price 1-Year Return BTC Bitcoin $37.5B $2,264.04 409% ETH Ethereum $15.1B $164.35 1,204% XRP Ripple $12.7B $0.33 5,478% XEM New Economic Movement (NEM) $2.31B $0.257 14,998% LTC Litecoin $1.58B $30.82 680% ETC Ethereum Classic $1.04B $11.28 1,662% DASH Dash $1.01B $137.75 1,624% BCN Bytecoin $723.31M $0.00395 9,785% XMR Monero $699.55M $48.21 5,172% XLM Stellar Lumens $528.63M $0.0549 3,276%\n\n(Source: “CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations,” CoinMarketCap, last accessed May 23, 2017.)\n\nAny of these cryptocurrencies could give Bitcoin a run for its money. However, the overwhelming majority of analysts would tell you that Ethereum stands the best chance.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nRipple is in bed with the banks. Monero is a favorite of black market dealers. NEM is selling itself as an updated Bitcoin. What makes Ethereum so special?\n\nAnswer: Smart Contracts.\n\nIf you go to Bitcoin’s landing page, it’s obvious they want you to use the currency. That’s the main focus. But on the Ethereum Project, the main focus is something called “smart contracts.”\n\nEthereum’s pitch is this: Build apps on our blockchain platform.\n\nWhat kind of apps? Anything, really. Any app that traditionally runs on the internet can be redeployed on the Ethereum platform. Doing so ensures that your app will have ZERO “downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.” (Source: “Ethereum,” Ethereum, last accessed May 24, 2017.)\n\nBut in order for there to be commerce on the platform, Ethereum tokens will need to be used. Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum platform.\n\nThat’s why speculators are betting on Ethereum. They believe it has far more potential to revamp the current way we live, shop, and do business. Unlike Bitcoin, it’s not just selling a currency.\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention, Ethereum’s transaction times crush Bitcoin’s.\n\nIt takes a few seconds to send money via Ethereum, whereas Bitcoin transactions can often take 20 minutes or more.\n\nA gathering of Bitcoin investors and developers recently came to an agreement that might speed up Bitcoin’s transfer times, but I doubt they can catch up with Ethereum. The gap is too wide.\n\nWill Ethereum Benefit from Bitcoin Hard Fork?\n\nBitcoin is running into some major issues that can’t be avoided.\n\nTo put it simply, there was a bug in the original Bitcoin code. This bug placed an artificial limit on the size of blocks, which led to slower transfer times, backlogs, and an inability to scale up the currency.\n\nIt is effectively a cancer on the entire Bitcoin dream.\n\nOne way to (potentially) fix the bug is a “hard fork.” This would require a fundamental change in Bitcoin’s original source code, a move that many in the community consider sacrilegious.\n\nIt would split the Bitcoin community in two, and more importantly, split the currency in two.\n\nOne would continue trading under the ticker symbol “BTI.” The other would come into existence as “Bitcoin Ultimate” or “BTU.”\n\nThese problems have diverted investors toward its heir apparent: Ethereum.\n\nBut don’t think that Bitcoin developers are sitting idly by, waiting to hand over the top spot. Not a chance. They are trying to work out the kinks as you read this.\n\nSome of the most important players just convened a special meeting. They decided on a “soft fork” that would speed up transactions without altering the source code much.\n\nIt’s a half-measure.\n\nI seriously doubt that a soft fork will hold forever, which means that Bitcoin is probably going to hard fork its currency. It wouldn’t be the first.\n\nLitecoin just did the same thing, and Ethereum itself forked many times in the last year. Both of those cryptocurrencies survived the split, so I expect Bitcoin will survive as well.\n\nThat being said, I expect a bumpy ride. The Bitcoin community is deeply divided over the hard fork, so there’s bound to be some turbulence. In those moments of uncertainty, investors could once again turn to Ethereum as a safe-haven asset.\n\nTo sum up: I don’t think the hard fork will destroy Bitcoin, but it could give Ethereum another tailwind.\n\nWill Ethereum Prices be Higher in 2018?\n\nThis is the hardest question to answer.\n\nMany insiders believe that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble right now. But those people have been wrong before. Ethereum and Bitcoin have powered to new all-time highs even after they predicted a so-called bubble, so listening to them might be a waste of time.\n\nI’m certainly more bullish on Ethereum price prediction than I am on Bitcoin.\n\nIt has the upper hand, in my opinion, because the concept of smart contracts is seeping into the public consciousness. Once it takes hold fully, ETH prices could skyrocket even higher.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is stuck in old debates. Philosophical debates. Is it immutable? Are the mathematical proofs pristine? Never mind that its transaction fees are going through the roof, and its backlog is getting ever-longer. Those concerns aren’t as relevant as the purity of the public ledger. (/sarcasm)\n\nOne of the core Bitcoin developers, Mike Hearn, left the community last year specifically because of these issues.\n\nHe wrote a lengthy post about it, in which he warned that “Bitcoin has entered exceptionally dangerous waters.” (Source: “The resolution of the Bitcoin experiment,” Mike’s blog, January 14, 2016.)\n\nHe argues that Bitcoin’s technology is hitting a ceiling, and that mining new coins is no longer economical. Similar claims are made all the time, but his words carry weight. Naturally, there was vicious strike back.\n\nThose of you with technical chops should read the accusations and rebuttals. (Source: “Whiny Ragequitting,” Medium, January 16, 2016.)\n\nIt makes for interesting reading. For my part, I sympathize with Hearn. He makes an interesting case that Bitcoin has lost its way. I don’t agree with all his points, but it definitely solidifies my case for Ethereum over Bitcoin.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs someone with finance and economics in their background, I’m not a “Kool-Aid” drinking techie. I don’t fall head over heels for new gadgets. I don’t buy into every new startup trend, and I don’t believe cryptocurrencies will replace traditional fiat money.\n\nHere’s what I DO believe:', ""Bitcoin’s wild ride this week stayed wild all the way through Friday.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rocketed higher earlier this week, as did shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which seeks to track bitcoin prices.\n\nSurging Asian demand and mind-bending gains no doubt spurred buying.\n\nBitcoin began the week just above $2,000 and topped $2,700 for the first time Thursday before pulling back to a recent $2,300.\n\nRemarkably, GBTC was up by as much as 158% this week to a peak of $565 on Thursday but quickly tumbled, falling by more than a third in value before ending the day 15% higher. On Friday, GBTC plunged 15% to $405.\n\nAs we begin the long Memorial Day weekend, should the selloff be seen as a buying opportunity? Or is this a recipe for tears and yet more tears? See what Barron’s Next says about bitcoin.\n\nCorrection: GBTC's trading activity was updated to show a gain for Thursday."", ""Talking Points:\n\nConviction continues to elude risk trends even as the S&P 500 hits record highs on its strongest run in 4 years\n\nLate-in-the-week and dramatic reversals from Bitcoin and crude oil tempered their pace but not their volatility\n\nDollar consolidation this past week sets the borders for a possible reversal as a holiday and NFPs test activity levels\n\nShort interest on EUR/USD has been rising steadily as the pair has hit a six-month high. Meanwhile the same group has kept an extreme short view on the S&P 500 despite its record highs. See the IG positioning statistics on the DailyFX sentiment page.\n\nRarely do record highs draw so little fanfare. Major US equity indexes S&P 500 and the Nadaq Composite extended their drives to fresh records through the close of this past week, but there was little enthusiasm for the accomplishment amongst traders and in the financial media. Perhaps this lack of momentum and interest is a side effect of the extended holiday weekend with the US, UK and Chinese markets all offline Monday. However, the gloom seems to have been around for considerably longer than May, so perhaps it is further a feature of the 'Summer lull' and the structural shift to complacency that has developed with time and circumstance. Nevertheless, we have a 7-day S&P 500 advance that matches the longest run for the benchmark since July 2013 yet a notably dry interest in this climb from the headlines (which are more often served to us reflecting our preconceived views so as to generate more traction). A skeptical but persistent market deserves our closer attention and a more active trade approach - not the false comfort of passive investing.\n\nThis past week's volatility highlights were dealt a rebalance before the weekend drain hit, but that doesn't mean we should expect them to return to the inactive fold through the coming week. Crude oil's tumble on the day OPEC and key non-OPEC producers announced an extension of production cuts (Thursday) found its balance Friday. The unexpected deviation from the textbook fundamental response shows this market to be following a more speculative course which may reference more influence to technicals. For Bitcoin, the explosive climb to record highs was tripped up through the end of week; but volatility clearly remained. If this drive has been fueled by largely speculative - versus institutional, financial or official - sources, expect it to maintain it to retain its volatile nature through the coming week.\n\nFor FX markets, Cable (GBP/USD) managed to generate some interest that can hold traders over the weekend. The pair had been carving out one of its smallest monthly ranges in history when its posted a sizable bearish break on the biggest drop since January 18. The motivation was exactly what we expect to be the only capable mover of Pound pairs: Brexit. A Yougov poll reported that Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over her main opponent leading up to the June 8 election had dropped from a 24 percentage point advantage to merely 5 points. This is not a political vote by the market but rather a reflection of how uncertainty can undermine confidence. Given the surprises in the original Brexit vote and the US President election, it is likely the market will be more responsive to these polls which in turn can spell more volatility for the Sterling pairs ahead. For sheer event risk, the Dollar faces the most comprehensive wave - encouraging given the currency's development of a tight range this past week and its staged reversal threat. The Fed's favorite inflation indicator (PCE deflator), a consumer sentiment survey and May NFPs are all due for release. Then there is also the Emerging Markets to keep track of. There are systemic risks like political uncertainty and the threat of rising loan costs with US rates rising. Alternatively, there are also discreet threats like India and Brazil 1Q GDP figures as well as a Brazil Central Bank rate decision expected to deliver a 100 bp cut.

05/27/2017,"['The bitcoin boom is back. This week, the digital currency leapt to record heights, peaking at nearly $2,800 before tumbling back down to around $2,400—by far the most dramatic run in its history.\n\nWhile bitcoin didn\'t maintain its record price for long, it\'s been trading feverishly this year, breaking the $2,000 threshold just last week. Other ""cryptocurrencies"" like Ripple and Ether (the medium of exchange on the decentralized network Ethereum) have also soared.\n\n""People are piling in. I think it\'s fear of missing out,"" says Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University.\n\nThe big question is whether a crash is coming or whether cryptocurrencies have hit their stride. Should investors cash out now while the getting is good, or buy more now before the price climbs even higher? So far, when it comes to bitcoin, the only real rule is volatility.\n\nBitcoin has crashed before. In November 2013, bitcoin jumped from trading at about $200 to more than $1,200. It was trading at less than $600 within three months and took until March of this year to hit $1,200 again.\n\n""This is highly speculative, you need to be prepared to lose everything,"" says Harvey. He says that\'s true for stocks too, but that bitcoin is more volatile than practically any other type of asset, including the stock market. Cryptocurrency is still a young technology, and it still faces many challenges, not the least of which is a potential schism within the bitcoin development community.\n\nBut there\'s reason to be optimistic about the future of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, says Adam White, head of the institutional trading arm at bitcoin exchange startup Coinbase. The 2014 crash was triggered by the collapse of the exchange Mt. Gox. Exchanges have become more stable since then, White says, and regulators are starting to adopt common-sense policies to protect consumers.\n\nAnd while prices have risen and fallen in recent years, the overall trend is upwards. That makes investing in bitcoin and similar digital currencies attractive, especially at a time of political uncertainty and economic unease. Last year, Coinbase—which clearly has a horse in this race, since it makes money facilitating cryptocurrency trades—commissioned a study that compared bitcoin to other financial assets. The research found that while bitcoin is indeed extremely volatile—far more so than real estate, oil, or stock—the rewards are unusually good for the risk. The Sharpe Ratio is a measure used by investors of how risky an investment is compared to its typical returns. According to the report, cryptocurrencies have a surprisingly high Sharpe Ratio—better than any other asset class, including bonds and US equities, depending on the timeframe.\n\nBut Harvey still urges caution. Even assuming the Coinbase study calculated the Sharpe Ratios correctly, there\'s still very little history to base the calculation on. ""For stocks and bonds, we have 100 years of data,"" he says. Bitcoin, on the other hand, only came online in 2009.\n\nStill, when you\'re looking at the sorts of returns bitcoin has provided recently, any amount of risk will look good. ""But do you really expect to keep seeing returns of 200 to 300 percent?"" says David Yermack, a New York University professor of finance. ""You\'d have to have all the wealth in the world in bitcoin to keep that up."" In other words, past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nThat\'s not say that cryptocurrencies are necessarily a bad investment, so long as you know the risks. Just don\'t count on the price to keep rising forever. All gold rushes come to an end one day.', ""In a period of seven days, Bitcoin price surged from $1,900 to $2,700. In some regions such as South Korea, Bitcoin was being traded at around $4,000. Analysts predicted that a bubble was imminent and that a correction would have to occur.\n\nOn May 27, Bitcoin price declined by $500 from $2,500 to $2,000, recording its first sharp since the beginning of May. The next day, it continued to fall.\n\nOver the past month, Bitcoin investors and traders have enjoyed the meteoric rise in Bitcoin price. Based on global average price provided by several cryptocurrency market data providers, Bitcoin price increased twice: from the $1,300 region to $2,700 at its peak. On a monthly basis, Bitcoin has recorded a 35 percent gain.\n\nBased on various measures, including demand from investors, trading volume, an irregular increase in price and search trends, analysts including angel Bitcoin investor Trace Mayer predicted Bitcoin’s fourth bubble earlier this week.\n\nWell, looks like fourth #Bitcoin bubble is now actually starting with new blood. Take a look at actual 'buy bitcoin' search traffic. $BTC pic.twitter.com/2GBz5VGvfd — Trace Mayer (@TraceMayer) May 25, 2017\n\nJames Wang, an analyst at ARK Invest and former researcher at Nvidia, also raised a similar point to Mayer, expressing his concern over a bubble building up in the global cryptocurrency market.\n\nWang explained that Bitcoin’s recent price surge to the $2,500 region also led to 10x gains for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), which encouraged casual traders and investors to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEarly sellers\n\nWang explained:\n\n“Seeing that Bitcoin has crossed $2,500 and other tokens have gone up 10x, every aunt, uncle, and teenager rushes in, pushing total crypto market valuation over $100 bln. As optimism reaches fever pitch, the smart money exits. With new buyers exhausted, the markets unravel faster than non-nitrous oxide establish foam.”\n\nHowever, Wang’s description of early sellers of Bitcoin as “smart money” is inaccurate. As Koji Higashi, a Japan-based analyst and IndieSquare co-founder previously explained, “not-so-smart” money has fueled both Bitcoin and altcoins in Japan, South Korea and other regions.\n\nAltcoin bubble\n\nInvestors who have entered the cryptocurrency market for short-term gains shouldn’t necessarily be described as “smart money” and smart investors.\n\n“Newly entering Japanese investors are driving this great altcoin bubble and not-so-smart money is flowing into space especially into some altcoins at a rather concerning rate,” said Higashi.\n\nAs it did in 2013 and during three other bubbles, Bitcoin price will likely recover soon. In 2013, it took a period of five to six days for Bitcoin to recover."", 'Bitcoin price after a surge towards $2700 against the US Dollar corrected lower, but these dips in BTC/USD are protected by a major support area.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price corrected sharply after trading towards $2650 against the US Dollar, but remains supported on the downside.\n\nThe last week’s highlighted important bullish trend lines with support at $1940 and $1800 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX) are holding well.\n\nAs long as the price is above these trend lines and $1800, it is likely to move back above $2200.\n\nBitcoin price after a surge towards $2700 against the US Dollar corrected lower, but these dips in BTC/USD are protected by a major support area.\n\nBitcoin Price Buy Dips?\n\nIn the last weekly analysis, I mentioned that the overall trend is bullish with chances of a move above $2100 in Bitcoin price against the US Dollar. There was no stopping the price, as it climbed above $2100, $2400 and even $2500. It traded as high as $2684 where it faced sellers and started a downside move. First, it cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1664 low to $2684 high. It called for the start of a correction below $2500.\n\nThe price dived sharply and even broke the $2200 support. The most important break was below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1664 low to $2684 high. However, the downside move was prevented by the last week’s highlighted important bullish trend lines with support at $1940 and $1800 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. These trend lines are acting as a monster support above $1800.\n\nThe price also struggled to close below the 100 simple moving average (H4) at $1988. These are positive signs, and means the price is above a major support at $1800. As long as there is no daily close below $1800, we may see a sharp recovery above $2150 and $2200 in the near term.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is currently in the bearish zone, but recovering.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is heading higher from the oversold levels.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1800\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $2200\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Schlossberg, according to CNBC, sees bitcoin as an addition to an investment portfolio in the wake of political uncertainty.\n\nCNBC’s “Trading Nation” explored ways for investors to hedge against growing political uncertainty following Wednesday’s big equities selloff. Stocks traded slightly higher on Thursday following the market’s biggest sell day of the year.\n\nInvestors are also being advised to look to international markets.\n\nBitcoin The New Gold\n\nSchlossberg sees parallels between bitcoin and gold, and he noted that bitcoin is being called the “new gold,” due to its ability to retain value over time.\n\nHe noted that bitcoin is holding steady following its 92% rally this year. Speaking Wednesday on “Trading Nation,” Schlossberg said the cryptocurrency is holding at steady highs, and that when there is a big move for any type of instrument, there is usually some continuation.\n\nBitcoin is clearly signaling more demand, Schlossberg observed. He favors it as a hedge play moving forward.\n\nAdvisors Bullish On Bitcoin\n\nSchlossberg is one of several investment advisors and investors who is bullish on bitcoin.\n\nThom Lachenmann and Parke Shall, advisors at Orange Peel Investments, have invested in bitcoin and suggest investors take a small position in the asset for the long term.\n\nBillionaire investor Mike Novogratz has said that he is holding ten percent of his net worth in digital currencies such as bitcoin and Ether.\n\nCharlie Morris, the investment director of the Fleet Street Letter, noted following last year’s bitcoin halving that he is buying the cryptocurrency because he sees it as a cheap stock with an opportunity to grow in value.\n\nNeedham & Co.

The investment company believes the price of the cryptocurrency stands to benefit substantially from rising demand for its two main use cases: as an alternative payments channel and as a “digital gold.” The growing demand is driven by market trends such as expanding ecommerce, globalization, and by the pervasiveness of enabling technology like mobile phones.\n\nMany attribute bitcoin’s recent gains as a sign of its improved acceptance as a currency, despite the recent rejection by the Securities and Exchange Commission of a proposed bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nAlso read: Investment advisor explains why he’s bullish on BTC\n\nAnother Option: Global Stocks\n\nMark Tepper, president of Strategic Wealth Partners, points to investments outside the U.S. as a way to find refuge from domestic conditions, according to CNBC. The political risk is shifting toward the U.S., he said.\n\nGlobal growth, Tepper noted, is much stronger than domestic growth. Globally-oriented companies on the S&P 500 are getting at least 50% of their revenues from overseas. These stocks are “completely crushing” domestically-focused companies in the current earning season.\n\nTepper said most investors are overly weighted in U.S. stocks since these stocks have outperformed international markets for years. However, he sees a change coming, making him confident that investing abroad makes sense, even as first quarter earnings have been strong for U.S. firms.\n\nGeopolitical risk has faded following South Korean and French elections, he said, which bodes well for foreign markets.\n\niShares MSCI EAFE ETF, an exchange traded fund that tracks large- and mid-cap equities in developed oversea markets, has gained 13% for the year, Tepper said. The S&P 500, by contrast, has advanced under 6%.\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific index rose 20% year to date, while Taiwan’s benchmark index rose 22% and European markets have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nEmerging markets have also rallied. EEM, an ETF that tracks these markets, has gained 15% this year. The fund did drop 2% Thursday when Brazilian equities fell on account of political concerns in the country.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Litecoin for vertcoin anyone? Bitcoin for litecoin?\n\nSay, you want to trade one cryptocurrency for another. How do you do that? You can either find someone you know and trust to do it in person or, a more common scenario, you go through a centralized exchange.\n\nUltimately, the latter involves risk, because it means taking your funds off the blockchain and putting them in the hands of an unknown third party. If the exchange fails, or simply decides to hold on to your money, for whatever reason, you are out of luck.\n\nBut Lightning Network, an off-chain scaling solution originally intended for bitcoin, is setting the stage for a decentralized option – one that does not require a third party – called atomic swaps.\n\nAlso known as atomic cross-chain swaps, the technology essentially allows two people holding tokens on two different blockchains to trade directly – and instantly – without the risk of one party running off with the other\'s money before the trade is complete.\n\nThat is where the word \'atomic\' comes in. It means that either the trade happens in its entirety, or it doesn\'t happen at all. So, if a Lightning node goes offline or Bob reneges on his end of the deal, everyone gets their money back.\n\nSo far, so good. But there is a catch.\n\nIn order for atomic swaps to work, Lightning has to be up and running on at least two different blockchains. Right now, it is just starting on one: litecoin. But, the hope is, it will be running on multiple chains soon.\n\nAs it stands, several development teams are currently testing their implementations of Lightning on the litecoin blockchain. Further, SegWit (the protocol upgrade that is a prerequisite for Lightning) has been activated on a second blockchain, vertcoin, opening the doors to Lightning on that chain as well.\n\nAccording to Charlie Lee, the founder of litecoin, who is committed to atomic swaps, all that is left is to get Lightning fully operational on litecoin, and then begin testing it on vertcoin. Once those steps are complete, we may see the the first atomic swaps as soon as this year.\n\nCertainly, that is the idea Lee has been kicking around for some time. He wrote about his plans for atomic swaps in a blog post back in January. And, the 2017 litecoin roadmap clearly specifies a plan for atomic swaps between litecoin and vertcoin.\n\nFundamentals\n\nGoing back to the start, the idea of atomic swaps is nothing new – other ways of doing cross change trades have been proposed in the past. But with Lightning, the building blocks are already in place. (Another benefit of Lightning is that it allows for instant clearing, meaning transactions occur on the spot, with no waiting involved.)\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nEssentially, atomic swaps make use of a scheme known as a hashed timelock contract (HTLC). Lightning already uses this same technology to establish bidirectional payment channels on top of a single blockchain, so it is no stretch to open channels across two chains.\n\nHTLC is a merger of two other technologies, a hashlock and a timelock. Both of which set conditions on a multi-signature (or multisig) transaction, which acts like a type of escrow.\n\nFor example, a hashlock uses a cryptographic puzzle to ensure one party cannot release their funds without the other doing the same. And a timelock acts like a safety net if nothing happens, routing funds back to the senders after a certain amount of time.\n\nYou can think of all this as a way of putting funds aside and then using \'if/then\' conditions to stipulate their output.\n\nSo, in short, an atomic swap looks like this:\n\nAlice (on bitcoin) agrees to give Bob (on litecoin) 1 BTC in exchange for 50 LTC. To do this, Alice opens up a payment channel to Bob, and Bob opens up a payment channel to Alice on the other blockchain. Both parties set \'conditions\' on each channel. The first condition uses a timelock to ensure that, essentially, if the trade is unsuccessful, funds will be returned after a certain period of time. The second makes use of a hashlock. Alice generates a piece of data and its hash. She then pays Bob 1 BTC, but includes the hash, and says essentially, ""If Bob wants to claim the payment, he has to provide the pre-image of the hash."" Bob uses his payment channel to pay Alice 50 LTC, but to collect the funds, he stipulates that Alice needs to produce the pre-image of the hash. By claiming the 50 LTC from Bob, Alice reveals the data, allowing Bob to grab the counterpart.\n\nNow, if Bob or Alice fail to follow through, the first condition ensures that they get their money back. In this sense, you don\'t risk losing your money, and more important, you don\'t hand ownership of your money over to a third party escrow service.\n\nMore planning\n\nOf course, Lightning won\'t work out of the box for atomic swaps. But, developers on the project say modifying the code would not require an undue amount of work.\n\n""We don\'t have a standard for doing atomic swaps yet,"" said Christian Decker, a Blockstream developer working on an implementation of Lightning for the programming language C. But he made it clear that, even though they don\'t have the specification laid out, doing so should be pretty straightforward.\n\nMeanwhile, in a recent blog post, Lightning Labs developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun, who is working on an implementation of Lightning for Go called lnd (stands for Lightning Network Daemon), suggested that upcoming releases of lnd would be ""multi-chain aware"".\n\nAnother point to note: now that SegWit has activated on litecoin, users can begin sending test cross-chain transactions from litecoin to the bitcoin testnet.\n\nDecentralized exchanges\n\nOnce Lightning Network is up and running successfully on a worthwhile number of blockchains, we can start thinking about decentralized exchanges.\n\nTo give more detail, these are exchanges that involve no central custodian. Other exchanges, like 0x (pronounced \'zero-ex\') and EtherDelta, only allow you to exchange tokens that are supported by the ERC20 token standard on the ethereum blockchain. Whereas, atomic swaps allow payments across two different chains – an important distinction.\n\nBut, keep in mind, atomic swaps only do one thing: execute the trade. A true decentralized exchange also needs to match up traders (so that Alice can find Bob) and aggregate trades to determine a market value (so Alice knows what sort of deal she can reasonably offer Bob).\n\nThe good news is, those things don\'t require a trustless service like the actual exchange of funds does.\n\nAs Decker explained, you can solve the other problems by simply having websites collect the orders and present them in some fashion, or by creating a broadcast network that announces trade opportunities.\n\nBut, as he told CoinDesk:\n\n""Just like in a centralized exchange, everyone makes their own decision about what their coins are worth and sets their own value. So, basically if Alice announces she\'s willing to exchange 1 BTC for 50 LTC, then Bob can either take it or leave it.""\n\nDecentralized exchanges are a big part of the decentralized dream. They point to a future where individuals take control of their own money, and cryptocurrencies interoperate.\n\nIn other words, one day, it may be possible to pay a merchant who only accepts bitcoin in litecoin, monero, zcash, or whatever. It wouldn\'t matter, because behind the scenes, your money is instantly converted to bitcoin.\n\nAnd, from there, it is not hard to envision a time where centralized exchanges serve only as an onramp to the cryptocurrency world – but everything after that happens on the blockchain.\n\nAtom image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The digital currency is up just under $1,000 in the past week.\n\nWhile it was easy to attribute earlier rises to gamers, or to nefarious dark Web sites trading in drugs, weapons and sex, or, last year, to Chinese investors looking to move cash out of the country, these latest moves — bringing the price to more than $2,750 — are from far more deep-pocketed investors.\n\nAnd that’s who is coming into the market — investors looking to capitalize on these daily 5- to 10-percent jumps.\n\nI took a look at five minutes of bitcoin trading around the globe on Thursday morning and more than 200 bitcoins were traded, with the US taking down 150 of them. China — even though it was the middle of the night there — still bought 40 bitcoins.\n\nIn dollar terms, that’s $55,830 in purchases of bitcoin in a five-minute trading window at 7 a.m.\n\nThe most surprising participating country was South Africa, which had a big presence, accounting for roughly 2.5 percent of the sales recorded over that time.\n\nAlthough this is just a snapshot, it backs up earlier observations made at different times of the global distribution of buyers.\n\nOn the Street last week, Fidelity Investments Chief Executive Abigail Johnson spoke glowingly at a conference about the growth of bitcoin.\n\n“It’s no accident that I’m one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services company that hasn’t given up on digital currencies,” she said. “I am still a believer.”\n\nOther financial firms are not such vocal proponents of digital currencies. Some are quietly offering well-heeled clients the ability to buy bitcoin and other digital currencies through their trading operations.\n\nWhile those firms are not publicly endorsing cryptocurrencies, they realize there’s money to be made there. You would need that type of liquidity in the market to see the price jumps of the recent weeks.\n\nSome cryptocurrency analysts are saying bitcoin has taken on the role of gold and silver as a hedge against the dollar.\n\nEd Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research, sent out a note identifying the yen as the monetary unit most exchanged for bitcoin — more than 45 percent of bitcoin purchases are made with the Japanese currency.\n\nWall Street currency desks are the ones trading bitcoin now. So it would make perfect sense that the unencumbered bitcoin — which has no futures, options or ETFs with the ability to suppress pricing — may have replaced precious metals as the dollar hedge.', 'If you have made money from the recent Bitcoin boom and want to cash out, you will need to pay tax on your earnings.\n\nDue to the unregulated nature of cryptocurrency, though, you may ask how much tax you’ll have to pay and how it can be traced.\n\nMyBroadband spoke to South African Bitcoin exchange Luno, blockchain expert Simon Dingle, and the SARS and SARB about tax on Bitcoin earnings.\n\nLuno\n\nBitcoin exchange Luno states it has high compliance standards with local and international laws and regulations around the world.\n\nLuno Head of Growth Werner van Rooyen said Bitcoin recipients must consult with a registered tax professional regarding tax on their Bitcoin earnings.\n\n\u200b”There are various factors that could impact taxes an individual owes to the tax authorities,” said van Rooyen.\n\n“The short answer is that all income is taxable in South Africa and it is the responsibility of individuals to remain tax compliant.”\n\nLuno said it has simplified Bitcoin payments for businesses by partnering with platforms like PayFast and Bidorbuy in South Africa.\n\nWhen someone pays a partner merchant in Bitcoin, Luno automatically converts Bitcoin into rand to simplify the accounting for the merchant.\n\nVan Rooyen said businesses must also consult with a tax professional if they accept Bitcoin in exchange for goods or services.\n\nSimon Dingle\n\nBlockchain expert Simon Dingle said that when exchanging Bitcoin for rand, the same taxes apply as any other asset disposal.\n\n“It may trigger a capital gains event, or could qualify as income for active traders,” he said.\n\n“All assets are treated equally in terms of tax.”\n\nDingle said the South African regulator is one of the more progressive in the world when it comes to blockchain technology.\n\n“That said, they have not ratified virtual currencies in a way that, for example, the Japanese regulator has.”\n\nSARS and SARB\n\nThe South African Revenue Service said transactions or speculation in Bitcoin are subject to the general principles of South African tax law and are taxed accordingly.\n\nThis applies to income generated from trading cryptocurrency.\n\nSARS did not specify the tax requirements for specific Bitcoin-to-rand transactions and said it does not accept payment in Bitcoin.\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank referred MyBroadband to its position paper published in 2014 when asked about Bitcoin tax and regulation in the country.\n\nThe paper outlines the numerous risks of the use of decentralised currencies such as Bitcoin, including the potential to “exert significant competitive pressure on existing payment systems”.\n\nNow read: How South Africans use their Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin spiked down towards the first main support zone near $1875, and it’s currently trading above the $2000 level again.

Victims were required to pay a ""ransom"" in the digital currency to unlock files that were encrypted by the virus. The question for many business owners is that, given its growing acceptance, is it ready for prime time? Should we accept bitcoin?\n\nThere\'s no question that it\'s been a good investment, particularly if you bought at the right time. According to a report from CNBC, the price of a single bitcoin has recently soared to $2 200 from just $0.003 seven years ago. We know this because on Monday its fans celebrated the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, spent 10 000 bitcoin for two Papa John\'s pizzas. Times have definitely changed.\n\nSo what\'s driving the run up in price? CNBC\'s tech correspondent Arjun Kharpal cites factors such as new legislation in Japan that allows retailers to accept the cryptocurrency (40 percent of all bitcoin trade is in Japan), the resolution of a dispute in the digital community that could\'ve created competing currencies and the general market turmoil brought on by global economic uncertainty.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\'s stated desire to weaken the dollar and make American goods more attractive overseas may also be contributing. Not only that, but according to a report on CNN.com, a few high ranking members of his administration, like budget director Mick Mulvaney and vice president Mike Pence\'s chief economist Mark Calabria, have both supported the cryptocurrency.\n\nRead also: Bitcoin still some growing up to do\n\nThe currency is not backed by any government and can\'t be physically held in your hands. It\'s just out there - in the ether - and protected by blockchain, a digital recordkeeping system that\'s so secure many banks are considering a move toward adopting it as the backbone of their payment systems.\n\nSome small businesses, particularly online retailers, are considering accepting bitcoin as another means of payment. Most investors agree that, although the currency\'s meteoric rise is very attractive, it\'s also an extremely volatile and risky investment. Once you start accepting bitcoin in your company you\'ll have to ask yourself what business you\'re really in: your business, or the currency business.\n\nWASHINGTON POST', 'It is always sad to see bitcoin-related services shut down over time. Although BTCJam did not have the best of reputations, they introduced a new use case for cryptocurrency. Bitcoin lending is an interesting market, albeit there are a lot of risks associated with it. BTCJam will effectively shut down very soon. Customers have until July 1st, 2018 to withdraw any remaining funds.\n\nCurtain Call for BTCJam Not Entirely Unexpected\n\nEver since BTCJam launched a few years ago, the goal was relatively simple. This company aimed to provide people all over the world with access to fair credit. To make that happen, the team banked big on the success of Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is the only global currency in existence today, it seemed like a bright idea at the time.\n\nIt has to be said, the company had no shortage of business either. Over 20,000 loans have been extended to 122 countries. In total, over 64,000 BTC has been loaned through BTCJam, which is quite impressive. However, not all of the loans are paid back. Over the years, the company got a bit of a negative reputation because of this. Then again, that is to be somewhat expected.\n\nThe decision to shut down the Bitcoin lending service was a difficult one. Regulatory challenges regarding Bitcoin remain a very large roadblock. Introducing cryptocurrency to poor communities is not an easy feat by any means either. BTCJam will no longer allow users to issue new loans. All funds on the platform need to be withdrawn by July 1, 2018. It is doubtful any of the outstanding loans will be paid back either, though.\n\nThose who wish to continue paying off their loans can continue to do so without a problem. All functionality remains available until the loan is repaid in full. That is, unless said loan defaults, which is the more likely outcome. On paper, Bitcoin lending makes a lot of sense. It is unfortunate to see this company shut down because they couldn’t capitalize on it. It is unclear if the BTCJam team will explore a different business venture in the future.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
05/28/2017,"['On May 25, the cryptocurrency trading volume hit $4.3 bln. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin and NEM drove the cryptocurrency trading volume to new all-time highs.\n\nBitcoin developer and entrepreneur Jimmy Song compared the cryptocurrency trading volume to the exchange volume of major stock exchanges such as NASDAQ. Although the cryptocurrency market’s trading volume is only a fraction of major stock exchanges such as NASDAQ, it is nearing the exchange volume of smaller stock exchanges such as Thailand and Australian stock exchanges.\n\nIn order for the cryptocurrency market to near the trading volumes of major stock exchanges, particularly the 16 stock exchanges in the $1 Trillion Dollar Club, the cryptocurrency market will need to achieve a multi-trillion dollar market cap. Currently, the market cap of the cryptocurrency market is $71 bln.\n\nCryptocurrency investments\n\nInvestors and traders are investing in the cryptocurrency market for a variety of reasons. Some have invested in Ethereum because of its successful partnership strategy demonstrated by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Others have invested in Ripple, the third largest crypto asset in the cryptocurrency market, due to its partnerships with the Japan Bank Consortium and leading financial institutions.\n\nA large number of both casual and institutional investors have invested in Bitcoin as a safe haven asset to avoid potential economic uncertainty and financial instability. Some investment firms including Fidelity Investments are actively investigating the potential of Bitcoin and Ethereum by mining the two digital currencies and testing two-layer solutions such as Lightning and Bitcoin-based micropayments solution.\n\nIf the demand toward cryptocurrencies continue to increase and investors begin to perceive cryptocurrencies as alternatives to existing financial systems, the cryptocurrency market could surpass the growth, market cap and trading volumes of major stock exchanges in the future.\n\nA phenomenal method of raising funds\n\nFurthermore, similar to the initial public offerings (IPOs) of public companies, Blockchain startups and commercial companies such as Kik have been launching initial coin offerings (ICOs) to sell tokens in a transparent and decentralized manner.\n\nAlthough analysts have raised concerns over the legality of ICOs and potential response from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, ICO, in theory, is a phenomenal method of raising funds for startups without intermediaries. More importantly, ICOs enable anyone within the community to participate in the investment, providing opportunities for small-scale investors.\n\nStartups that raise or complete successful ICOs often have their tokens listed on cryptocurrency market data providers such as CoinMarketcap and on exchanges. Most recently, Gnosis, a Blockchain-based prediction market platform, raised a multi-million dollar funding round in an ICO at a $300 mln valuation.\n\nThe Gnosis token was listed on major US-based Bitcoin exchange Kraken and within a month, it became the seventeenth largest crypto asset in the market.\n\nIn a sense, the cryptocurrency market and the concept of ICO represents similar qualities and characteristics of stock exchanges - a decentralized, transparent and autonomous stock exchange.', 'BITPoint Japan Co., the company behind Peach Aviation Ltd.’s move to let travelers use bitcoin to pay for tickets, is planning to give hundreds of thousands of Japanese retail outlets the ability to accept the digital currency.\n\n“We’re holding discussions with a retail-related company,” Genki Oda, BITPoint’s president, said in a recent interview. “By going through a company providing payment terminal services to shops, we have the possibility of increasing its use at one stroke. It’s easier than talking to lots of individual retailers.”\n\nGenki Oda. Photographer: Akio Kon/Bloomberg\n\nBITPoint is joining a flurry of companies embracing regulations, enacted in Japan last month, that recognize digital currencies as a form of payment. That has helped to make yen trades one of the world’s largest transaction pools, exceeding China’s pole position at the end of 2016, according to Oda. Bic Camera Inc., one of the country’s biggest electronics retailers, began accepting bitcoin at two stores in Tokyo last month.\n\n“We’re also talking to a big convenience store operator about using it,” said Oda, 36, who also runs BITPoint parent Remixpoint Co., which had a market value of about 21 billion yen ($189 million) on Friday. He said he’s aiming to make an announcement by early next year.\n\nThe shares of Remixpoint rose as much as 18 percent to their daily price limit. Last week, Remixpoint said it will convert debt issued to BITPoint into equity, raising its ownership in the subsidiary to 97.7 percent.\n\nBitcoin, which debuted eight years ago, is gaining wider use as a way to pay for goods and services, and lets people transact without oversight from governments, regulators or central banks. The virtual currency has been rallying against the dollar and other fiat currencies and was trading at $2,210 on Monday, near record highs.\n\nWhile BITPoint operates as a bitcoin exchange, it’s pushing to promote the use of the cryptocurrency in stores and other retail outlets, instead of as a speculative instrument. The company currently has ties with tens of retailers and plans to expand that number, Oda said.\n\nBITPoint Japan’s ATM.

At the same time, Japanese investors and day traders are taking a serious look at bitcoin as an asset class, thanks to the new regulations, he said, adding that several large foreign exchange brokerages will begin bitcoin trading in the coming months, boosting volumes.\n\nStill, it’s unclear whether bitcoin payments can become more than a marketing gimmick. The biggest hurdles include long network confirmation times and high transaction fees.

Ethereum’s recent Enterprise Ethereum Alliance deals with large conglomerates such as Toyota and JPMorgan have further validated the value of Ethereum to more local investors and have shifted the trend from Bitcoin to Ethereum.\n\nEyes set on altcoin\n\nMore importantly, because Bitcoin has become a conservative asset amongst other cryptocurrencies, investors in South Korea have started to look into altcoins such as Ethereum and Ripple that are supported by local exchanges.\n\nMost South Korean exchanges are funded by multi-billion dollar corporations within the country. Korbit, South Korea’s second-largest exchange, is invested by SK Telecom, the largest telecommunications company in the country.\n\nTherefore, when exchanges add support for cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple, immediately, investors dive into altcoins. Particularly, investors that believe they missed Bitcoin’s rally invest in altcoins for large short and mid-term gains.\n\nThe demand toward Bitcoin has increased to the point where there always exists a huge arbitrage opportunity for overseas traders. Bitcoin is being traded in South Korea with a premium price of $2,800. That is a 21 percent premium over the global average price and other major markets such as the US.\n\nWhile it is still possible to purchase Bitcoin outside of South Korea with other options such as credit cards to avoid premium rates, it is difficult to trade large amounts of Bitcoin without being flagged by anti-money laundering systems.\n\nIf the current growth rate of the South Korean Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange markets can be sustained over the next few months, South Korea could become a powerhouse for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets.', 'Cryptocurrencies are booming beyond belief. Bitcoin is up sevenfold, to $2,500, in the last year. Three weeks ago the redoubtable Vinay Gupta, who led Ethereum’s initial release, published an essay entitled “What Does Ether At $100 Mean?” Since then it has doubled. Too many altcoins to name have skyrocketed in value along with the Big Two. ICOs are raking in money hand over fist over bicep. What the hell is going on?\n\n(eta: in the whopping 48 hours since I first wrote that, those prices have tumbled considerably, but are still way, way up for the year.)\n\nA certain seductive narrative has taken hold, is what is going on. This narrative, in its most extreme version, says that cryptocurrencies today are like the internet in 1996: not just new technology but a radical new kind of technology, belittled or ignored by most, which has slowly and subtly grown in power and influence over the last several years, and is about to explode into worldwide relevance and importance with shocking speed and massive repercussions.\n\n(Lest you think I’m overstating this, I got a PR pitch the other day that literally began: “Blockchain’s 1996 Internet moment is here,” as a preface to touting a $33 million ICO. Hey, what’s $33 million between friends? It’s now pretty much taken as given that we’re in a cryptocoin bubble.)\n\nI understand the appeal of this narrative. I’m no blockchain skeptic. I’ve been writing about cryptocurrencies with fascination for six years now. I’ve been touting and lauding the power of blockchains, how they have the potential to make the internet decentralized and permissionless again and to give us all power over our own data, for years. I’m a true believer in permissionless money like Bitcoin. I called the initial launch of Ethereum “a historic day.”\n\nBut I can’t help but look at the state of cryptocurrencies today and wonder where the actual value is. I don’t mean financial value to speculators; I mean utility value to users. Because if nobody wants to actually use blockchain protocols and projects, those tokens that are supposed to reflect their value are ultimately … well … worthless.\n\nBitcoin, despite its ongoing internal strife, is very useful as permissionless global money, and has a legitimate shot at becoming a global reserve and settlement currency. Its anonymized descendants such as ZCash have added value to the initial Bitcoin proposition. (Similarly, Litecoin is now technically ahead of Bitcoin, thanks to the aforementioned ongoing strife.) Ethereum is very successful as a platform for developers.\n\nBut still, eight years after Bitcoin launched, Satoshi Nakamoto remains the only creator to have built a blockchain that an appreciable number of ordinary people actually want to use. (Ethereum is awesome, and Vitalik Buterin, like Gupta, is an honest-to-God visionary, but it remains a tool / solution / platform for developers.) No other blockchain-based software initiative seems to be at any real risk of hockey-sticking into general recognition, much less general usage.\n\nWith all due respect to Fred Wilson, another true believer — and, to be clear, an enormous amount of respect is due — it says a lot that, in the midst of this massive boom, he’s citing “Rare Pepe Cards,” of all things, as a prime example of an interesting modern blockchain app. I mean, if that’s the state of the art…\n\nMaybe I’m wrong; maybe Rare Pepe will be the next Pokémon GO. But on the other hand, maybe the ratio of speculation to actual value in the blockchain space has never been higher, which is saying a lot.\n\nSome people argue that the technology is so amazing, so revolutionary, that if enough money is invested, the killer apps and protocols will come. That could hardly be more backwards. I’m not opposed to token sales, but they should follow “If you build something good enough, investors will flock to you,” not “If enough investors flock to us, we will build something good enough.”\n\nA solid team working on an interesting project that hasn’t hit product-market fit should be able to raise a few million dollars — or, if you prefer, a couple of thousand bitcoin — and then, once their success is proven, they might sell another tranche of now-more-valuable tokens. But projects with hardly any users, and barely any tech, raising tens of millions? That smacks of a bubble made of snake oil… one all too likely to attract the heavy and unforgiving hand of the SEC.\n\nThat seductive narrative though! The internet in 1996! I know. But hear me out. Maybe the belief that blockchains today are like the internet in 1996 is completely wrong. Of course, all analogies are flawed, but they’re useful, they’re how we think — and maybe there is another, more accurate, and far more telling, analogy here.\n\nI propose a counter-narrative. I put it to you that blockchains today aren’t like the internet in 1996; they’re more like Linux in 1996. That is in no way a dig — but, if true, it’s something of a death knell for those who hope to profit from mainstream usage of blockchain apps and protocols.\n\nDecentralized blockchain solutions are vastly more democratic, and more technically compelling, than the hermetically sealed, walled-garden, Stack-ruled internet of today. Similarly, open-source Linux was vastly more democratic, and more technically compelling, than the Microsoft and Apple OSes that ruled computing at the time. But nobody used it except a tiny coterie of hackers. It was too clunky; too complicated; too counterintuitive; required jumping through too many hoops — and Linux’s dirty secret was that the mainstream solutions were, in fact, actually fine, for most people.\n\nSound familiar? Today there’s a lot of work going into decentralized distributed storage keyed on blockchain indexes; Storj, Sia, Blockstack, et al. This is amazing, groundbreaking work… but why would an ordinary person, one already comfortable with Box or Dropbox, switch over to Storj or Blockstack? The centralized solution works just fine for them, and, because it’s centralized, they know who to call if something goes wrong. Blockstack in particular is more than “just” storage… but what compelling pain point is it solving for the average user?\n\nThe similarities to Linux are striking. Linux was both much cheaper and vastly more powerful than the alternatives available at the time. It seemed incredibly, unbelievably disruptive. Neal Stephenson famously analogized 1990s operating systems to cars. Windows was a rattling lemon of a station wagon; MacOS was a hermetically sealed Volkswagen Beetle; and then, weirdly … beyond weirdly … there was:\n\nLinux, which is right next door, and which is not a business at all. It’s a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and geodesic domes set up in a field and organized by consensus. The people who live there are making tanks. These are not old-fashioned, cast-iron Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. Army, made of space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from one end to the other. But they are better than Army tanks. They’ve been modified in such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable enough to use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact car. These tanks are being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace, and a vast number of them are lined up along the edge of the road with keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply climb into one and drive it away for free. Customers come to this crossroads in throngs, day and night. Ninety percent of them go straight to the biggest dealership and buy station wagons … They do not even look at the other dealerships.\n\nI put it to you that just as yesterday’s ordinary consumers wouldn’t use Linux, today’s won’t use Bitcoin and other blockchain apps, even if Bitcoin and the the other apps built atop blockchains are technically and politically amazing (which some are.) I put it to you that “the year of widespread consumer use of [Bitcoin | Ripple | Stellar | ZCash | decentralized ether apps | etc.]” is perhaps analogous to “the year of [Ubuntu | Debian | Slackware | Red Hat | etc.] on the desktop.”\n\nPlease note: This is not a dismissive analogy, or one that in any way understates the potential eventual importance of the technology! There are two billion active Android devices out there, and every single one runs the Linux kernel. When they communicate with servers, aka “the cloud,” they communicate with vast, warehouse-sized data centers… teeming with innumerable Linux boxes. Linux was immensely important and influential. Most of modern computing is arguably Linux-to-Linux.\n\nIt’s very easy to imagine a similar future for blockchains and cryptocurrencies. To quote my friend Shannon: “It [blockchain tech] definitely seems like it has a Linux-like adoption arc ahead of it: There’s going to be a bunch of doomed attempts to make it a commercially viable consumer product while it gains dominance in vital behind-the-scenes applications.”\n\nBut if your 1996 investment thesis had been that ordinary people would adopt Linux en masse over the next decade — which would not have seemed at all crazy — then you would have been in for a giant world of hurt. Linux did not become important because ordinary people used it. Instead it became commodity infrastructure that powered the next wave of the internet.\n\nIt’s easy to envision how and why an interwoven mesh of dozens of decentralized blockchains could slowly, over a period of years and years, become a similar category of crucial infrastructure: as a reserve/settlement currency, as replacements for huge swathes of today’s financial industry, as namespaces (such as domain names), as behind-the-scenes implementations of distributed storage systems, etc. … while ordinary people remain essentially blissfully unaware of their existence. It’s even easy to imagine them being commoditized. Does Ethereum gas cost too much? No problem; just switch your distributed system over to another, cheaper, blockchain.\n\nSo don’t tell me this is like the internet in 1996, not without compelling evidence. Instead, wake me up when cryptocurrency prices begin to track the demonstrated underlying value of the apps and protocols built on their blockchains. Because in the interim, in its absence of that value, I’m sorry to say that instead we seem to be talking about decentralized digital tulips.\n\nDisclosure, since it seems requisite: I mostly avoid any financial interest, implicit or explicit, long or short, in any cryptocurrency, so that I can write about them sans bias. I do own precisely one bitcoin, though, which I purchased a couple of years ago because I felt silly not owning any while I was advising a (since defunct) Bitcoin-based company.', 'Bitcoin and major altcoins have recently experienced some significant volatility. While some players in the industry believe that the initial surge in price is as a result of value proposition and reasonable adoption of the entities, others have insisted that the surge is fueled by speculators who only want to recycle the capital to make a profit.\n\nThe recent decline in the price of the aforementioned entities presents an opportunity for further questions about the robustness of the market value of cryptocurrencies in general. These questions arise due to the early history of Bitcoin price which saw a significant crash after previously appreciating in value.\n\nA natural process\n\nJason Cassidy, President of Crypto Consultant, tells Cointelegraph that this development is normal and nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nCassidy says:\n\n“As we witness the birth of a new financial system taking shape, it is natural to witness a certain level of speculation. Organic growth is certainly taking place and progress is being made from the top down. Government recognition and approval, continued merchant and consumer adoption along with innovative services are helping broaden the currency\'s appeal and utility.”\n\nCassidy explains that traders and speculators that have been on the market for several years are going to be focused on locking in profits after a sharp increase in price. This, he says happens each time a new growth spurt takes place. New money enters the market and as the price gets bid up, seasoned and pragmatic traders will look to take a profit.\n\nHe also notes that every market has this dynamic, however with cryptocurrency markets being very much new, the volatility is greater. Over time as Bitcoin\'s price volatility in the market will lessen.\n\nThe network effect\n\nDana Coe of BitLox sees the network effect of Bitcoin and other crypto adoption as having a significant effect on the price fluctuations.\n\nCoe explains that given that a lot of people have at least tangentially heard of Bitcoin, very few of them have actually ""gotten into"" it.\n\nHe also notes that since most altcoins have no actual real-world spending applications, the perceived growth within the altcoin environment appears to be a collective ""bandwagon effect"" rather than a reasonable investment or organic growth.\n\nAccording to Coe:\n\n“Everybody is always searching for the next big thing. This builds a feedback loop driving prices and ‘growth’.""\n\nCoe concludes by explaining that speculation in and of itself is not a bad thing, noting that it is a free market and in all free markets there are some winners and some losers. Organic growth comes from adding more people to the user base of all coins and an exciting market is the best advertisement ever for getting people to sit up, take notice and get on board.', 'The past few days we\'ve looked at the run up in bitcoin. Remember, I said: ""If you own it, be careful. The last time the price of bitcoin ran wild, was 2013. It took about 11 days to triple, and about 18 days to give it all back. This time around, it\'s taken two months to triple (as of today). ""\n\nIt looks to be fueled by speculation, and likely Chinese money finding its way out of China (beating capital controls). And yesterday we talked about the potential disruption to global markets that could come with a crash in bitcoin prices.\n\nI suspect that\'s why gold is finally beginning to move today, up almost 1%, and among the biggest movers of the day as we head into the long holiday weekend--an indication of some money moving to gold to hedge some risk.\n\nRemember yesterday we looked at the chart on Chinese stocks back in 2015 and compared it to bitcoin. The speculative stock market frenzy back than was pricked when the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) devalued the yuan later in the summer.\n\nProbably no coincidence that bitcoin\'s recent acceleration happened as Moody\'s downgraded China\'s credit rating this week for the first time since 1989 (an event to take note of). Yesterday, the PBOC was thought to be buying Chinese stocks (another event to take note of). And this morning, the PBOC stepped in with another currency move! Historically, major turning points in markets tend to come with some form of intervention. Will a currency move be the catalyst to end the bitcoin run, as it did the runup in Chinese stocks two years ago?\n\nLet\'s take a look at what the currency move overnight means ...\n\nKeep in mind, the currency is China\'s go-to tool for fixing problems. And they have problems. The economy is crawling around recession-like territory. The debt was just downgraded. And they\'ve had a tough time managing capital flight. As an easy indicator: Global stocks are soaring. Chinese stocks are dead (flat on the year).\n\nBillionairesPortfolio.com, Reuters\n\nRemember, their rapid economic ascent in the world came through exports (via a weak currency). The move overnight is a move back toward tying its currency more closely to the dollar. Which, if this next chart plays out, will also weaken the yuan compared to other big exporting competitors in the world.\n\nBillionairesPortfolio.com, Reuters\n\nThat should help the Chinese economic outlook, which may help stem the capital flight--which has likely been a significant contributor to bitcoin\'s rise.\n\nInvitation to my readers: Join my premium service at Forbes Billionaire\'s Portfolio to hear more of my big picture analysis and get my hand-selected stock portfolio.', 'This week, I attended one of the most important events in the blockchain world – Consensus 2017.\n\nConsensus is an annual blockchain technology summit in New York where industry leaders discuss all things bitcoin and blockchain, and where new blockchain companies come to pitch their ideas.\n\nRegular readers are familiar with bitcoin and blockchain. Bitcoin is digital money that is created and held electronically. At the core of bitcoin technology is a super database called the “blockchain.” The blockchain contains every transaction in the history of bitcoin and is accessible to anyone.\n\nA lot of people think that blockchain will eventually be used to process everything from stock trades to voting.\n\nI first recommended buying bitcoin back in March. Over the next two and a half months, the price of bitcoin soared 72 percent.\n\nEarlier this week, I reiterated my recommendation to buy by saying: “stop procrastinating!” Guess what? Bitcoin is up another 20 percent since then.\n\nBut the rollercoaster ride isn’t done yet. One of my biggest takeaways from Consensus was that the boom in bitcoin and blockchain is just getting started. Everywhere I looked, conference attendees were on mobile phones and laptops trading cryptocurrencies throughout the course of the conference.\n\nHere are just a few of the things I learned at the summit:\n\nThe bitcoin boom is fuelling more cryptocurrency rallies\n\nThe market capitalisations of the two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, have increased by nearly US$40 billion in the past three months. The total cryptocurrency market cap is up by $65 billion (a nearly 300 percent gain) to US$85 billion.\n\nAs a result, holders of these currencies are sitting on huge wealth and they are now looking to “diversify” into other cryptocurrencies. This means that instead of being 100 percent in bitcoin and/or ether, investors are looking to take 5 or 10 percent of their cryptocurrency portfolio and buy other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is fuelling a boom in second-tier cryptocurrencies.\n\nRampant speculation\n\nAs I listened in on pitches from new blockchain businesses, the most common single question was this: “when is the ICO?” (ICO means “initial coin offering”, the cryptocurrency equivalent of an IPO, or initial public offering, for a stock).\n\nMarket participants are expecting immediate multiples of return on capital, regardless of the business case (if any). ICOs are viewed as near-guarantees of immediate big gains.\n\nI see a lot of parallels here with the tech bubble of the late 1990s. And there will be some spectacular blow ups ahead.\n\nBut let’s be clear: at the peak of the dotcom bubble, the market cap of the NASDAQ index was nearly US$6 trillion. The entire cryptocurrency market cap right now is currently less than 1.5 percent of that.\n\nThe point is, for all the noise in the media, the level of general public participation in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies remains extremely low. Just think about your own group of friends and associates. How many of them even own bitcoin?\n\nSo this bubble is just getting started.\n\nRegulators at the gate\n\nThe legal and regulatory system is far behind what’s actually happening in the cryptocurrency space. How do you treat cryptocurrencies? Are they securities? Currencies? Assets? Something in between? Remember, all cryptocurrencies offer different characteristics. Some offer the equivalent of a coupon or a distribution of profits, for example.\n\nBut at some stage regulators (most likely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)) will step into this market. Especially as the financial stakes increase.\n\nThere are scam-like cryptocurrencies taking advantage of the huge boom. When investors start crying foul, you can expect the SEC to start weighing in. When they do, you can expect increased volatility and big drops in the scammier cryptocurrencies out there. But SEC participation will only make this industry more mainstream, and bring in more money.\n\nIn the meantime…\n\nThis was just a quick wrap-up of what’s going on in cryptocurrencies. I’ll be bringing you more insights on this space in the future.\n\nBut for now, everyone should be accumulating a little bitcoin. A few hundred dollars, a couple thousand… whatever you can afford to allocate in the super-speculative portion of your portfolio.\n\nNow, bitcoin will not keep increasing in value at its current rate of growth forever. At some stage the market price will correct.\n\nBut everyone needs to familiarise themselves with the process of buying, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. Blockchain and bitcoin are here to stay. This technology will only grow in scale and opportunity. And being on the outside (and not understanding it) will limit your ability to profit from it.\n\nRemember, this rollercoaster ride is just getting started. So there’s no reason not to be buying now.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\n\nRead the original article on Stansberry Churchouse Research.

Duke, who recently made a similar prediction for bitcoin, said Ethereum could experience a 38.4% fall from Wednesday’s high of $227 and a 27% drop from Friday morning’s price, according to CNBC.\n\nEthereum has posted a 2,747.9% rise since Jan. 1, when it traded at $8, according to coinmarketcap.com. Ethereum traded at around $191.78 early Friday.\n\nEthereum’s price was $162.46 Friday evening, making a $14.939 billion market capitalization.\n\nDuke looks at historical trading patterns to identify future price moves.\n\nPrice Fall? Rebound\n\nIf Ethereum falls to below $170, it would pave the way to a $140 low, Duke said, marking a 38.4% drop from the $227 high. After falling to $140, it could rally back to $240.\n\nSo far, Duke has been correct with her bitcoin calls. She told CNBC if bitcoin got close to $2,800, the price could see some pullback. Bitcoin hit $2,791 Thursday and declined to around $2,571 Friday morning. She said bitcoin’s decline could continue until January before another rally takes hold.\n\nTrader Jim Frederickson noted yesterday that both bitcoin and Ethereum are currently overvalued, due for a correction, and at the present time, he would not buy them.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum hits $200, outpacing bitcoin in its rise\n\nBitcoin Supports Other Currencies\n\nAccording to Daniel Masters, director at Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, said bitcoin has served as a gateway to other digital currencies that are gaining acceptance. Masters said a diverse cryptocurrency ecosystem is evolving in tandem with fiat currency.\n\nWhile bitcoin’s rise feeds investors’ appetite for Ethereum and other altcoins, a host of factors play into Ethereum’s popularity, especially in the business and financial communities.\n\nEthereum supports smart contracts, contracts that automatically execute according to a computer algorithm when contract terms are met. Several financial institutions have invested in Ethereum technology to be able to use smart contracts.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is still in correction mode from its strong rally in the previous week.\n\nPrice is now testing the ascending trend line connecting the lows since the start of the month.\n\nThis support zone also lines up with several inflection points and might be the line in the sand for this uptrend.\n\nBitcoin price is currently testing an area of interest on its 4-hour time frame and is still deciding whether to bounce or to break.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside. The shorter-term moving average lines up with the rising trend line support, adding to its strength as a floor.\n\nIn addition, applying the Fib tool on the latest swing low and high shows that the 61.8% level lines up with this support area. A break below the $2100 level could lead to a drop to the 200 SMA, which might be the last line of the defense in this climb.\n\nOscillators are giving mixed signals, with stochastic turning down to indicate that sellers are in control of price action. On the other hand, RSI already appears to be turning higher to show that buyers are regaining control of bitcoin price action.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nThe selloff in the past couple of days represents a much-needed correction from the almost nonstop bitcoin price climb in the past week. This signals that several traders have booked profits off the recent highs, especially since geopolitical risks seem to be subsiding and speculations of a bubble are getting stronger.\n\nWhile last week’s rally was also fueled by a couple of big conventions in the bitcoin arena, speculators seem to have run out of steam in terms of taking price higher from here. Keep in mind that a lot of the cryptocurrency’s movements are driven mostly by demand and speculation and there’s nothing new to go on from here so the correction could stay in play for a while.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

05/29/2017,"['Ever since Bitcoin first appeared on the scene several years ago, fans of the cryptocurrency have been searching for a way to apply the idea that might capture the public imagination and broaden the use of the technology beyond just geeks and programmers.\n\nNow, some believe that application has appeared with the rise of the “token” economy, in which companies or startup ventures fund their operations by handing out units of cryptocurrencies. Some companies have even done what are known as “initial coin offerings” or ICOs, in which they distribute tokens instead of shares to investors.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is seen by some as a bubble with hugely inflated prices. Some observers say bitcoin and other similar ventures are similar to Linux, an open-source alternative to Microsoft’s Windows operating system that has never really achieved mainstream success.\n\nBut entrepreneur and investor Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, believes that token-based systems “may eventually create and capture more value than the last generation of Internet companies.”\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nIn an essay published recently on the blogging platform Medium, Srinivasan and his partner Naval Ravikant, co-founder and CEO of a popular online VC community called AngelList, said they believe the token economy has the potential to become “a Kickstarter on steroids.”\n\nThe two men, both of whom have been investing in bitcoin-related technology for several years, argue that using tokens as a financing option has the potential to improve the liquidity options that companies have by several orders of magnitude, as well as increasing the size of the available audience that might want to invest in such ventures.\n\n""token launches occur in any country. coming to the US/Silicon Valley/Wall Street to raise financing will diminish"" https://t.co/oHBedEZOC0 — Fred Wilson (@fredwilson) May 28, 2017\n\nAll of this is possible because of an explosion in the cryptocurrency market over the past few years, they argue, in which Bitcoin has survived internal strife but also given birth to alternative currency systems and platforms such as Ethereum.\n\nInitial coin offerings or ICOs are one way of using these new currencies, Srinivasan and Ravikant say. Canadian messaging-app maker Kik recently announced that it is launching its own cryptocurrency called Kin, and plans to offer units of it to supporters through a crowdfunding campaign. The currency is based on Ethereum’s blockchain technology.\n\nKik plans to issue 10 trillion Kin tokens to developers and users via a separate non-profit foundation called the Kin Foundation, which will ultimately hold 60% of all the Kin tokens and be run by a group of independent directors.]\n\nSrinivasan and Ravikant warn that some uses of cryptocurrency tokens, including some ICOs, may be subject to regulation by governments if they are seen as equivalent to doing a traditional equity offering or IPO, in which investors receive shares of the company. But they argue other uses of tokens for crowdfunding could essentially be unregulated.\n\nToken supporters say they aren’t really equity but more of a digital IOU, which entitles the holder to redeem their tokens in return for access to a platform like Ethereum’s.\n\nThat access has value because it can be used to generate Bitcoin-style currency through a computer-intensive process known as “mining,” and those coins can in turn be exchanged for other more familiar currencies like U.S. dollars. One bitcoin is currently worth about $2,300.\n\nPeople will get fleeced *so hard* if the “token economy” happens. Like railroad bonds in the early 1900’s, but int\'l & more theft/extortion https://t.co/omtasvucsM — (((Ben Doernberg))) (@BenDoernberg) May 27, 2017\n\nSome skeptics say token-based fundraising has the potential to turn into a huge boondoggle if it is unregulated, with unwary investors being fleeced of their savings with little to show for it.\n\nRavikant and Srinivasan, however, argue that tokens will allow companies to raise money much more quickly for new ventures than existing systems do, and will also allow for startups to build valuable services without having to rely on advertising as their only revenue source.\n\nLarge technology companies like Google and Facebook offer “have sometimes come under fire for making billions of dollars while early adopters only receive the free service,” their essay says. “After the early kinks are worked out, the token launch model will provide a technically feasible way for tech companies to spread the wealth and align their user base behind their success.”', 'The price of the world\'s most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin has lost over a fifth of its value from the record high of last week.\n\nRead more\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin was trading at $2,179, down $612 from last Wednesday\'s all-time high of $2,791, according to CoinDesk data.\n\n""The correction was actually quite brief, the prices today are still higher than that of a week ago,"" Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, a major bitcoin exchange, told CNBC.\n\n""I think the pullback was just a profit taking, a correction from the skyrocketing prices of last week,"" he added.\n\nBitcoin\'s market cap fell from $40.49 billion on Thursday to $36.48 billion.\n\nAnalysts\' forecasts for bitcoin differ significantly. While some predict a major correction, others say it\'s going to hit $6,000.\n\n""There is a lot of fresh liquidity flowing into bitcoin, thanks to a surge in interest among investors in Asia, notably Japan and Korea, coupled with a resolution to the scaling debate. I would not be surprised to see the bitcoin price doubling again to around $6,000 by the end of the year,"" Aurelien Menant, CEO of Gatecoin, a regulated cryptocurrency exchange, told CNBC.\n\nREAD MORE: $100 in bitcoin in 2010 now worth almost $73 million\n\nThe value of bitcoin has been on a meteoric rise since the cryptocurrency was launched seven years ago. An investment of $100 in bitcoin in May 2010 is worth over $73 million today.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency, created and held electronically. No one controls it. Bitcoins aren’t printed, like dollars or euros, and they are decentralized. The cryptocurrency is ‘mined,\' using computing power in a distributed network.', 'Bitcoin’s astronomical rally has cryptocurrency bulls feeling vindicated. Not so fast, skeptics say.\n\nThe digital currency’s more than 100 percent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $1,000 for the first time. By Valentine’s Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $500.\n\nThen it absolutely exploded -- jumping more than $1,400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival of blockchain into the mainstream, the coin’s underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient.\n\nBut signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 percent the next day. Bitcoin was down 1.5 percent to $2,255.50 as of 12:35 p.m. in New York. For bears, that kind of volatility shows the asset’s unreliability as a store of value.\n\nHere are some other reasons why they warn caution is warranted:\n\nSafety Questions\n\nThis month’s ransomware attacks serve as a reminder that bitcoin is still beloved by hackers and criminals because of its anonymity. The cryptocurrency plunged in 2014 after Tokyo-based Mt. Gox -- then the largest bitcoin exchange -- said it had been breached and then filed for bankruptcy. Its value sank again in August 2016 after hackers stole about $69 million from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex. The exchange has since repaid its customers.\n\nScaling Debate\n\nThe bitcoin community has been split for more than a year on how to upgrade its blockchain. The time and fees necessary to verify transactions have climbed to record highs, making it more difficult for businesses to use the currency as a means of payment. While bitcoin executives have said that 2017 might be the year the cryptocurrency really starts to scale, others aren’t so sure.\n\nLast week, more than 50 companies signed a pact to speed up transactions, but ideological differences have prevented similar agreements -- like the one reached last year in Hong Kong -- from actually being implemented. The much-touted SegWit upgrade was also released in October, but only a third of the community has embraced it. If the latest proposal fails to gain traction and the deadlock continues, digital currency users may dump bitcoin in favor of alt-coins that offer better blockchains.\n\nRival Digital Currencies\n\nAs the surge sends the cryptocurrency world into a frenzy, it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. While bitcoin’s value has increased more than 100 percent since the beginning of the year, its slice of the pie has shrunk as its digital cousins steal some of the spotlight. There are an estimated 700 rivals, according to Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance.\n\nBitcoin dominated about half of the overall digital currency market as of Friday, down from around 85 percent in February, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s share increased to about 20 percent. Some token fans aren’t sweating it though, as they say bitcoin’s potential demise doesn’t really matter as long as another digital currency takes hold.\n\nNot Recognized By Governments\n\n\n\nThe general public doesn’t understand bitcoin, and many regulators still don’t either, which makes it tough to regulate. In 2015, New York started issuing controversial licenses to cryptocurrency companies, but only three had been issued as of mid-January, according to Coinbase, as many startups couldn’t afford the costs of applying.\n\nIn January, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority asked the public for help identifying the potential risks of blockchain. Two months later, bitcoin plummeted after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a proposal by the Winklevoss twins for a publicly traded fund based on the digital currency.\n\nIn a report last week about blockchain in China, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote that while the technology could benefit Chinese banks, it’s unlikely to start a financial revolution.\n\n""We believe blockchain application is more likely to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary in developing countries like China,"" the analysts said. ""Aside from the conservative regulatory attitudes toward financial innovations, the constraint of confidentiality and performance of blockchain technology would make it best positioned to be enterprise-oriented rather than consumer-end.""\n\nBubbles Burst\n\nWhether it’s Holland’s tulip-bulb craze in the 17th century or the Internet-stock frenzy of the late 1990s, history shows that markets self correct. Speculative markets usually run out of steam at some point. Determining the trigger is always the hard part. Given the breathtaking run in bitcoin as of late, some say it’s tough to believe the oft-cited mantra that this time is different.\n\n— With assistance by Yuji Nakamura', 'A new Bitcoin improvement protocol (BIP) has surfaced from the Core mailing list which includes Barry Silbert’s scaling solution.\n\nThe yet unnumbered BIP proposes a user-activated soft fork (UASF) August 1, as was included in BIP148, with a two-megabyte hard fork locking in six months later.\n\n“This proposal is written under the assumption that the signatories to the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement[1] are genuinely committed to the terms of the agreement and intend to enact the updates described therein,” the introduction to the mailing reads.\n\nSilbert’s proposal for ending the scaling deadlock had faced mounting criticism due to the closed nature of the discussions and its nature as a “compromise” rather than a full-fledged solution.\n\nDespite his Bitcoin.com website and mining pool signing up to Silbert, Bitcoin Unlimited proponent Roger Ver subsequently appeared to state his opposition to the plans.\n\nThe BIP’s author Calvin Rechner was careful to exclude the possibility of infighting while discussing the latest roadmap.\n\n“As such, criticisms pertaining to the chosen deployment timeline or hard fork upgrade path should be treated as out-of-scope during the initial discussion of this proposal,” he continued.\n\nOn Twitter meanwhile, Bitmain CEO and Bitcoin Unlimited supporter Jihan Wu continued to criticize SegWit deployment in Bitcoin, saying the fees using the technology were “unfairly cheap.”', 'Japanese payment gateway BITPoint is set to take Bitcoin payments to thousands of domestic retailers.\n\nHaving successfully partnered with Peach Air to facilitate its Bitcoin acceptance later this year, BITPoint is now seeking a considerably larger rollout.\n\n“We’re holding discussions with a retail-related company,” Bloomberg quotes President Genki Oda on Monday.\n\n“By going through a company providing payment terminal services to shops, we have the possibility of increasing its use at one stroke. It’s easier than talking to lots of individual retailers.”\n\nThe move mirrors those currently underway in Japan aimed at offering Bitcoin as a payment option for the mass consumer market.\n\nSeveral partnerships are in the offing, the combined total merchant reach of which could see Bitcoin come to almost half a million outlets.\n\nThe upbeat Oda also spoke of a further project with a ""big convenience store operator,"" details of which he hopes to announce at the start of 2018.\n\nA law change in Japan in April allowing Bitcoin and similar currencies to be viewed as valid payment saw an explosion of enthusiasm from businesses, despite the consumer market itself still being relatively lacking.\n\nInfrastructure is well underway to support an adoption swing, however, with almost 20 exchanges currently applying for a newly-developed licence as of this month.', 'Facebook\n\nGoogle+\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSeite per E-Mail senden\n\nSeite drucken\n\nSchriftgröße größer\n\nSchriftgröße kleiner\n\nNationalbank-Gouverneur Ewald Nowotny © APA/HERBERT NEUBAUER\n\nNationalbank-Gouverneur Ewald Nowotny hat schon bisher nicht mit Kritik an Kryptowährungen gespart. Gegenüber der Presse bekräftigt er seine Skepsis und verbleicht die aktuellen Kursschwankungen bei Bitcoin mit der Tulpenmanie des 16. Jahrhunderts in Holland. Sie gilt als die erste Spekulationsblase der Geschichte.\n\nDoch, auch wenn Nowotny die Hacker-Währung ablehnt, die Blockchain, die Technologie hinter Kryptowährungen interessiert auch die Notenbanken. Mehrere Zentralbanken würden bereits an eigenen digitalen Währungen auf Blockchain-Basis arbeiten, unter anderem die Bank of England. Für Studien simuliert sie intern die Ausgabe und Freischaltung von Hybridgeld. Für den Echtbetrieb mit Zentralbank-Kryptogeld dürfte es aber noch Jahre dauern.\n\n""Die Antwort der Zentralbanken auf Bitcoin dauert nicht Monate, sondern noch Jahre"", sagten auch Experten am Montag bei der Volkswirtschaftlichen Tagung der Oesterreichischen Nationalbank (OeNB) in Wien. Bei der Tagung ging es um diese Weiterentwicklung im Zahlungsverkehr.\n\nTechnik hinter Bitcoin\n\nDie Notenbanken prüfen schon lang den Einsatz so genannter Blockchain-Technologien für den Zahlungsverkehr, meist mit den großen Geschäftsbanken zusammen. Bekannt wurde das Verfahren vor allem als Technik hinter der Digitalwährung Bitcoin. Bitcoins selbst werden nicht von Zentralbanken bzw. Geschäftsbanken geschaffen. Sie suchen nun eine eigene Antwort darauf, Pläne für eigenes digitales Zentralbankgeld anstelle von Banknoten und Münzen seien aber in einem sehr frühen Stadium.\n\nBevor Zentralbanken selbst virtuelles Geld ausgeben, sind laut OeNB-Gouverneur Ewald Nowotny eine Vielzahl technischer, rechtlicher und vertraglicher Fragen, Sicherheits- und Transparenzthemen, aber auch die Preisgestaltung abzuklären. Bitcoin indes hält Nowotny für absolut intransparent, ein System ohne Kontrolle.\n\nProblem der Kontrolle\n\nAufsichtsrechtlich ist der Ersatz von Bargeld durch Cyber-Geld a la Bitcoin & Co bisher ein Problem. ""Wer kontrolliert den Rechner?"", wird etwa für Vizegouverneur Andreas Ittner eine entscheidende Angelegenheit.\n\nSolange Rechner in China oder Venezuela stehen, weil dort der Strom billig sei, sehen Notenbanker in Europa bisherige Netz-Währungen skeptisch. Bitcoin habe auch ""nichts mit Geld zu tun"", sagte ein Wiener Notenbanker am Montag. Es sei pure Spekulation, habe Sicherheitslücken, sei anfällig für Hacker und Phishing und durchaus oft letztes Vehikel von Leuten, die legales Geld aus gutem Grund scheuten. Vor wenigen Wochen bekam Bitcoin noch den Geruch einer Erpresserwährung ab, als Hacker nach groß angelegten Cyber-Attacken von ihren Opfern Bitcoin verlangten.', 'Major Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi will begin trading for Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, on Wednesday, May 31st.\n\nHuobi, one of China’s ‘big three’ exchanges alongside OkCoin and BTCC, began listing Ethereum (ETH) this weekend. The exchange has implemented the CNY/ETH trading pair, with trading to commence midday Wednesday.\n\nIn an announcement, Huobi stated:\n\nWe are excited to announce the CNY/ETH will be listed on our exchange. Trading will start at 12:00 May 31st (GMT +8). ETH deposit and withdrawal is available from now [then] on.\n\nTo bait users into trading Ethereum, traders of Bitcoin or Litecoin will be rewarded with 5mETH (0.0005 ETH). For our days after launch up to Jaune 3rd, Huobi will charge an introductory commission fee of 0.01% before an increase to 0.05%.\n\nThe exchange pointed to the “many aspects [of] Ethereum that could outperform bitcoin” In its announcement to launch ETH trading. Cost, speed and scalability are underlined, in particular. In its official Chinese notice, Huobi revealed the growing popularity of Ethereum as a primary factor behind enabling ETH trading. Further, the exchange revealed that users had repeatedly called on the exchange to launch ETH trading.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market’s current boom period sees Ethereum grow over 25x since the turn of 2017, outpacing a number of other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin. Last week, Ethereum’s market cap reached half of that of Bitcoin for a brief period. Over the last fortnight alone, Ethereum rose to $100 for the first time, before scaling beyond an all-time high of $220.\n\nThe backing of a number of corporate giants including the likes of Microsoft, Intel, JP Morgan and Toyota – as a part of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance – is widely seen as the most recent driving factor toward Ethereum price gains. The EEA, a working group developing Ethereum-based blockchain solutions for enterprise, added 86 new members last week, nearly tripling its initial founding 30 members at the time of launch in February this year.\n\nAt the time of publishing, Ethereum is trading around $175, with a market cap of nearly $16 billion.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

If you haven’t heard about this groundbreaking event, don’t worry, you're not the only one.\n\nThe pizza wasn’t the important part of the transaction - it was what was used to pay for it. The meal cost 10,000 bitcoins and was the first time the virtual currency was used to buy something in the real world. The day is now celebrated every year by bitcoin enthusiasts as Bitcoin Pizza Day.\n\nThings have come a long way since then. Bitcoin’s use and value have soared. If that diner had held onto those 10,000 bitcoins they may not have made history, but they would be around $20 million better off today.\n\nIn March this year, the price of one bitcoin climbed above the price of one ounce of gold for the first time.\n\nBitcoin’s increasing value is due to the fact that its popularity has rocketed in recent years. In 2009, there were fewer than 10,000 transactions in bitcoin. By January this year that number had trebled. Analysts put this down to the fact that investors think it will hold its value better than some other investments, as well as the fact that it has become increasingly popular in Asia.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\n\nBut let’s take a step back. What is bitcoin?\n\nIt’s a cryptocurrency, which means it exists only in the digital world.\n\nIt was developed in 2009 by someone – we still don’t know who for sure – using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and is based on a payment system that allows one person to pay another, without the need for any middle parties, such as banks.\n\nThere is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nA person holds their bitcoins in a bitcoin wallet - in a mobile app or computer - and can send and receive bitcoins through it.\n\nThey get the bitcoins in the first place by accepting them for a good or service, or from an exchange, where they swap real money for bitcoins at the prevailing exchange rate.\n\nEvery bitcoin user has their own address - a bit like a bank account number - and controls all the bitcoins coming in and out of that address.\n\nThe bitcoin transactions run on a system called blockchain. This is a public ledger, which holds a record of every single transaction.\n\nThe other person receives the bitcoins once the transaction is verified. This verification involves solving a complicated mathematical problem, a process called “mining”, and anyone with a powerful enough computer system can do it.\n\nWHAT DO I DO WITH MY BITCOINS?\n\nYou can spend them, either on the internet at places such as WordPress and Reddit, or at establishments that accept the currency.\n\nWhen you want to turn your bitcoins into real money, you trade them on an exchange.\n\nWhilst you’re unlikely to be able to use them at your local grocer yet, some say it is only a matter of time. There is now a bitcoin Visa debit card which makes spending them easier.\n\nYou don’t have to understand the process of bitcoin in order to start using it, after all, few understand the inner workings of a bank.\n\nTHE PROBLEMS\n\nBut not everything is rosy in the bitcoin world.\n\nThere is a limit to how many transactions can be processed in a given time-frame, and the increase in transactions has meant a slowing down of payments.\n\nFor years, those involved in bitcoin’s software development have argued over how to overcome its capacity problems. That problem is still not solved.\n\nBut there are more mundane problems, like the fact that it suffers from price fluctuations.\n\nAnd, like any software based system, it’s also vulnerable to attack.\n\nThen there is the matter of how different countries treat the currency. Some treat is as a commodity, like oil or gold, but others treat it like money. Some prohibit its use entirely.\n\nGovernments don’t like the fact that bitcoin users are anonymous, and they have concerns over its use for criminal activity and money laundering.\n\nTheir worries aren’t unfounded. In the recent ransomware attack, WannaCry hackers demanded bitcoins as payment, and so far $80,000 has been paid out.\n\nThe EU wants to be able to identify bitcoin users in the name of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nIn addition, the whole system is not highly regulated. Partly, this is because any developer in the world can verify exactly how bitcoin works. The bitcoin protocol itself cannot be modified without the cooperation of nearly all its users, who choose what software they use.\n\nEven where regulation exists it is not always clear.\n\nSome say that the uncertainty over regulations will get in the way of bitcoin growing.\n\nIS IT HERE TO STAY?\n\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency, lots of others have entered the market - over 200 of them. Whilst bitcoin is still the leader, Ethereum, Ripple and NEM and many others also exist.\n\nThe Economist thinks that we’re in a cryptocurrency bubble from where the only way is down.\n\nEven some of those who work intimately with bitcoin say it is going to be a failure.\n\nBut according to a website that tracks bitcoin “obituaries”, the currency has already “died” - ie been predicted to fail - 106 times. And a newly published study says that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are no passing fad.\n\nIn short - no one really knows just yet.\n\nPizza anyone?\n\nWritten by Alex Gray, Formative Content.\n\nThe article was republished courtesy of World Economic Forum."", ""The value of Bitcoin has been soaring uncontrollably over the last few months, especially during last week.

An utterly generic 250GB portable hard drive, already a few years old, with a couple of dings and scratches in its shell and with the beginnings of an audible click that would have eventually killed it.\n\nIt had a data file containing 1400 Bitcoin on it. No big deal, at the time.\n\nToday, those few kilobytes are worth more than four million dollars.\n\nI think I might be a touch emotionally fragile right now. I just checked the Bitcoin exchange rate and got a bit teary.\n\n— Campbell Simpson (@csimps0n) May 23, 2017\n\nTo be honest, the details are a bit foggy these days. My best recreation of my potential brush with incredible riches comes from everything else that was happening at the time. When I moved out of home, when I moved back home, when I broke up with a girlfriend, when I PayPal\'d some random stranger from the other side of the world a few US dollars for a digital transaction of an effectively worthless faux-currency.\n\nAt the start of 2010, Bitcoin trading wasn\'t even really a thing. It was hard to find anywhere that would sell BTC. Mining coins — with your PC\'s CPU, then with your PC\'s graphics card, then with specialised and increasingly expensive hardware — was the easiest way to accumulate Bitcoin out of thin air, with the only investment being electricity and processor cycles.\n\nBut I found a site, or forum — I can\'t remember which — where someone was selling Bitcoin. I think I paid well above the quasi-official exchange rate for the coins; who really cares about the difference between 1.2 cents and 1.5 cents when you\'re only spending $25? I\'d read something fun about them, probably in WIRED, and wanted to understand them better, so I bought some.\n\nEventually, I had the Bitcoin sitting in a cold storage wallet — an offline file, outside of any online bank or exchange or digital storage facility. A text file, basically, with a long string of cryptographic hash that represented an encryption key. I didn\'t trust any online service not to crash and lose my investment.\n\nI put on a hard drive.\n\nI used the hard drive for a whole bunch of things. Storing pirated music and movies and TV series, a portfolio of my best tech writing work, all my uni assignments, photos of friends and family and the couple of holidays that I\'d taken. I took the hard drive with me when I moved out of home with my long-term girlfriend, and used it for all the things you use a portable hard drive for.\n\nIn the year or so that followed, we broke up, and I moved back home. As I was moving out I used the opportunity to clean up some of the accumulated tech detritus that comes with being a technology journalist. USB sticks, 3D glasses, USB cables, PC components — all that sort of literal junk. A pile of junk that went into a skip. That hard drive was in the pile, and it had that damn annoying click. I had better portable hard drives.\n\nI didn\'t need, or care about, anything on it. The photos were backed up to another portable drive, my writing was in Google Drive, the music was on my desktop PC.\n\nSo I threw it away.\n\nThis is probably one of the stupidest things, in hindsight, that I\'ve ever done. And I\'ve done a lot of stupid things a lot of times.\n\n— Campbell Simpson (@csimps0n) May 23, 2017\n\nI think I remembered the Bitcoin a couple of months later. I know that I actually remembered them because of something else on the drive — a terrible quality pirated copy of The Hire, BMW\'s short car-porn vignettes staring Clive Owen, which was and is still hard to find on the \'net. Remembering that on the drive made me think about what else was there — including a little digital marker for 1400-odd Bitcoin.\n\nWhen I remembered that I\'d thrown away my Bitcoin stash, I was a little bit pissed off. In between the time that I\'d frittered away $25 over the \'net and the day I remembered how many BTC I\'d actually thrown away, the price had skyrocketed — relatively — from barely more than a cent to around $2.50 per coin. $4000, give or take, was what my loss was. I was in a bit of debt from a holiday to Japan a while before, and that four grand would have been nice.\n\nIt wasn\'t a big deal. It was one of those ""aw, shit"" moments that happen to everyone on a semi-regular basis. I got a parking ticket, I forgot to send a birthday card to a friend overseas — that kind of thing. Without the benefit of hindsight, of course, it wasn\'t that big a deal. I think I got a promotion around that time that more than made up for my lost investment. Bitcoin was a fun fad.\n\nObviously time and the \'net have proven me wrong.\n\nTime has been kind of the price of Bitcoin. Every now and then since, when I\'ve seen Bitcoin in the news or reported on Gizmodo or mentioned in reference to world events like the WannaCry malware, I\'ve checked the price. Bitcoin has become pretty popular since 2011. And I\'ve done a bit of back-of-the-napkin calculation, and — sometimes, not every time — had a bit of a quiet moment and a shake of my head.\n\nAt the moment, at a historic high price in USD and AUD alike, my 1400 BTC would be worth $4.8 million — and change. The price, always wildly volatile, is skyrocketing at the moment. When I tweeted this story, it was $4.2 million, but in the two days since it\'s up 15 per cent.\n\nIt\'ll probably go higher.\n\nBut, today, it\'s worth $4.2 million, and that stings just a little bit. Because I had too many hard drives and this one had some scratches.\n\n— Campbell Simpson (@csimps0n) May 23, 2017\n\nHonestly, as far as I\'m concerned, my stash of \'coin is gone.\n\nIn the past couple of days, since I told my story, I\'ve been contacted by friends and strangers alike with advice and suggestions — and some hare-brained proposals — on how to retrieve my Bitcoin.\n\nApparently landfill is exceedingly well organised and stratified. And my trash would be with other trash of the same age, with dates and locations and other clues along the path to a dented hard drive in a pile of USB cables. I could contact the tip or the council in the area that I rented that apartment in, and see if they could point me in the right direction. Police do it all the time.\n\nOne friend said that all I\'d need to do is find someone willing to take a quarter stake in it — on spec, of course, I don\'t have a million bucks — to make it worth that person\'s time to track it down. But then that raises questions of its own — what if someone else found the hard drive, that used to be my hard drive, first? What right would I have to that text file?\n\nStrangers on Twitter — quite a few of them, really — have told me to double down and to invest in Eth. I\'m fine, thanks. My dalliance with volatile digital currencies is over. I\'ve learned my lesson, whatever it is. And I still have some Dogecoin, anyway.\n\nI don\'t even especially want to find those Bitcoin, though. I\'m really happy with my life at the moment. I don\'t need them. I\'d like them, sure, but I don\'t need them. This isn\'t trying to get philosophical — the real value was in the friends we made along the way, or some crap like that — but just to say that I\'ve come to terms with losing those Bitcoin. That chapter of my life is over.\n\nI spent $25 on some Bitcoin. When I realised what I\'d lost, they were worth about $4000. If you wanted to put a dollar figure on the anguish that I feel, it\'d be somewhere between those two. Definitely not in the realm of millions of dollars. It\'s mostly a fun story that I trot out every now and then, and occasionally pretend to be mock-upset about, and only occasionally actually upset.\n\nDo you have any regrets? I sure do. But in the scheme of things, this is only really a small one.\n\nThis article first appeared on Gizmodo. See the original article here.\n\nRead more posts on Business Insider Australia »']"
05/30/2017,"[""In 2017, Bitcoin has bounced back from several severe setbacks, so many users believe that there is still a lot of gas left in the tank for the pioneer cryptocurrency.\n\nFresh from attending both Consensus and the Token Summit in New York and hearing from those who have had conversations with fund managers, Timothy Suggs of Expanse is positive that another cryptocurrency market surge is set to happen in the coming months.\n\n“It seems more and more institutional money will be finding its way to the market. This alongside the continued growth of amateur investors who are getting involved after hearing success stories from many of their friends and family members who have enjoyed some incredible returns on their investments.”\n\nFormer CEO and founder of SatoshiLabs,Alena Vranova tells Cointelegraph that new all-time highs can still be reached by Bitcoin this year, noting that she retains a bullish outlook on Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency with the best developed market, code and services.\n\nShe says:\n\n“This year's all-time high may not have been hit yet. I'd expect that resolution of the network combustion and a wave of newcomers to Bitcoin will add to Bitcoin price growth.”\n\nShort-lived crash\n\nThe speedy recovery after every major retracement since the beginning of 2017 is a phenomenon that has introduced some uniqueness in the trend pattern of the Bitcoin market.\n\nKumar Gaurav, Founder and CEO at Cashaa tells Cointelegraph that it seems as if the recent Bitcoin price drop of almost 30 percent down from its all-time high of $2,791 was only a short-time crash like the previous ones in January and March 2017.\n\nBitcoin price recovered from less than $1,900 to over $2,200 within two days. This reminds us of the fast recovery in April after the drop from $1,300 to $900 and then going back to $1,300 within a month. As of the time of writing, over the past week, Bitcoin increased overall by 15 percent.\n\nHe notes that looking at the overall trend of the past two years, if you take out the three short runs leading to the crashes mentioned above, Bitcoin price can be seen as a parabolic curve. What attracts a lot of inquisition is how fast this pattern is moving to an increasingly near-vertical stage.\n\nGaurav says:\n\n“Since April, we have seen a movement towards this stage, with the most recent run being longer and steeper than any run before it. In this case, if Bitcoin continues to quickly recover and resume a fast growth, we would see it around $10,000 within a year. Otherwise, if it goes back to a slower growth more consistent with the past two years`, it would “only” become around $3,000 within a year. In the long term, if the scaling issue gets solved, we may see it well above $10,000 sooner or later in any case.”\n\nBitcoin-altcoin relationship\n\nConcerning altcoins, Gaurav notes that the higher the Bitcoin price, the more a crash is expected. With regard to a consequent hedge with major altcoins, without a longer serious Bitcoin crash having happened as of yet, altcoins are increasingly moving parallel to Bitcoin, whereas prior to this time, major altcoins would move in the opposite direction to Bitcoin.\n\nGaurav adds that in the medium term, as long as the ICO trend continues, Bitcoin and Ether prices will keep receiving an additional boost. Whereas $101 mln were raised via ICO in 2016, this year has $180 mln raised already, with amounts raised per ICO increasing. Bitcoin, therefore, now is not only a cryptocurrency used largely for speculation until recently but is already the fundamental part of a new kind of company.\n\nOther factors\n\nAnother aspect is the fact that Bitcoin is now officially recognized as a means of payment in Japan, which increases demand and with more countries including Australia to follow, whereas Russia and India are aiming to start regulating Bitcoin. There are several countries from which a new Bitcoin popularity can further increase its price."", 'The past few days have seen a roller-coaster ride of such scale and intensity that makes it somewhat rare even for this space. Bitcoin dived nearly $1,000, to then somewhat recover, but still stands around $500 below its all-time high.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, after falling some 50% by $100, has in a very sharp V-shaped recovery gone on to reach all-time high, rising to $218. Its market cap is now above 50% of bitcoin’s while its trading volumes have surpassed bitcoin’s.\n\nDoes that mean the boom times are back? The answer might be different for btc and eth as for bitcoin it never felt like boom time. Although its price doubled and nearly tripled, there wasn’t much celebration of pizza day, with the community seemingly consumed by the scalability debate, shouting UASF, BU, Segwit, BIP-whatever.\n\nFor ethereum, perhaps it’s too early to say, but the party seems to be back on. One reason might be because eth’s price fall on Friday appeared to have little to do with eth and more to do with bitcoin.\n\nThe reason why they would be affecting each other even now when eth has direct access to fiat markets is not very clear, but it may well be the case some still enter ethereum through bitcoin, with Poloniex continuing to handle significant volumes in the ETH/BTC pair.\n\nThat may mean when bitcoin’s price quickly falls, eth’s price may be affected too, either by demand reducing as potential investors may wait to see how low bitcoin goes or perhaps by traders betting that eth’s price will go down too.\n\nSo, eth’s crash didn’t feel real, which might perhaps explain its very quick recovery, not least because the platform continues to attract adoption with new projects, prototypes and tests being launched by both start-ups and household brands.\n\nWhich may mean the boom times might have some more to go for ethereum, but no one can really know these things as far as price is concerned. It may go up, down, or perhaps there will be some sidewaying cool down for everyone to just take a deep breath and relax a bit.\n\nBecause the past three months have been quite a ride, especially for ethereum which has risen from around $15 to a high of $218 reached today, but also for bitcoin which proved its believers correct and rose to nearly $3,000, to the probable dismay of critics like Paul Krugman.\n\nHe hasn’t penned an op-ed on bitcoin yet. Doubt he can beat his 2013 headline which said bitcoin is evil without explaining in the article, even a little bit, how or why.\n\nDinosaurs, they never learn, but some are now wondering whether bitcoin itself has also become a dinosaur. Ten minute confirmation times feel a bit like a relic from the past, while fees now averaging $3 sort of send us back to the last century.\n\nNo wonder they’re hardly partying, while eth seems to have had a hangover on Sunday, after crazy dancing on Friday, a recovery on Monday, and now they are out again, telling themselves they will have no more than four beers this time and no clubbing, just pubs.\n\nSure, we’ll see. Just don’t trip again because that was a bit scary.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'You’ve probably heard about bitcoin’s incredible bull run and how, if you’d bought some a few years ago, you would be a lot richer. Well, it turns out some people did just that.\n\nThose who bet big on bitcoin in recent years are now presiding over the digital equivalent of Scrooge McDuck’s money bin. The currency has given up some of its crazy gains from last week, but is still sitting at around $2,300 as of Monday morning—up about $1,000 from a month ago, and over 300% from a year ago.\n\nNo one knows for sure who has the most bitcoin since the digital currency is hard to trace. But here is a list of those who have a big stake in bitcoin, and are set to clean up if the boom continues.\n\nTim Draper, Venture Capitalist Tim Draper Photograph by Danny Moloshok — Reuters In 2014, billionaire Tim Draper made the sort of bold bet that is the hallmark of famous venture capitalists: he bid for and won all 30,000 bitcoins up for grabs in an auction run by the U.S. Marshals Service. Draper did not reveal how much he made for the bitcoins, which were seized from the drug lord Ross Ulbricht, but the market price at the time was around $600. Today, the 30,000 bitcoins are worth around $70 million and most of that is profit for Draper. (*Correction: an earlier version of this story mistakenly said $7m)\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Investors Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss in Austin, Texas in March 2015. Photograph by Alli Harvey—Getty Images For the longest time, it looked like the Winklevoss twins fate in life was to be known for losing out to Mark Zuckerberg for control of Facebook. But their successful second act (aside from those weird pistachio ads) as bitcoin entrepreneurs mean Cameron and Tyler are now most likely to remembered as cryptocurrency pioneers —and very wealthy ones at that. While they lost their initial bid to create a bitcoin ETF, the twins are likely to win over regulators in the long-run. In the meantime, their 2013 investment of $11 million worth of bitcoin (which reported amounted to 1 percent of all bitcoins in circulation) would now be worth more than 20 times that amount.\n\nBarry Silbert, Venture Capitalist Fortune Photograph by Kevin Moloney/Fortune Brainstorm Barry Silbert is another long-time player in the bitcoin scene, who made big bets when most people laughed that the currency was for kooks. One of his bets saw him obtain 48,000 bitcoins in a second auction held by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014. At that time, bitcoin prices had fallen to around $350, which means Silbert’s stake could now be worth around $110 million. Silbert is currently focused on building a rival financial product to the Winklevoss ETF, and likely owns a lot more than the 48,000 bitcoins he won at auction.\n\nCharlie Shrem, Entrepreneur and Felon Charlie Shrem Photograph by Craig Ruttle—AP Shrem is a colorful figure from the wild west early days of bitcoin. Once a member of the Bitcoin Foundation—a group that was supposed to govern bitcoin but saw several of its members end up on the lam or in jail—Shrem received a two-year prison sentence for charges related to money laundering. Since late 2016, he has been back on the cryptocurrency scene and appears as enthusiastic as ever about its prospects. Shrem hasn’t said how many bitcoins he owns, but he is rumored to have acquired thousands of them back they cost $3 a pop and his new venture, a startup involving crypto-investments, suggests he still has a very big stake.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin Inventor Faceless man Michael Murphy Getty Images Since his 2008 white paper, which described a new type of software tied to a digital currency, the man known as Satoshi has stood as the soul of bitcoin. But no one can say for sure he is. Satoshi has not spoken publicly for years, but he is believed to control large numbers of bitcoin wallets from the currency’s early days. Some reports say he controls more than 5% of all bitcoin in circulation, which means his net worth could be in the billions. It remains to be seen if Satoshi will emerge one day and distribute that wealth (maybe by endowing a bitcoin university?) or if Satoshi and his riches will remain invisible and out of reach forever.', 'A number of Indian politicians are reportedly urging the government not to legalize Bitcoin amid reports that the cryptocurrency could soon be regulated and taxed in the country.\n\nAccording to a report by The Economic Times, India’s biggest financial news daily, ‘many’ politicians across the political divide raised concerns about the possible legalization of bitcoin by the Indian government during a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance.\n\nThe Indian Finance Ministry (FinMin) established an intergovernmental committee to study and research legal frameworks of digital currencies around the world. The committee will ultimately recommend a course of action for the regulatory and legal future of digital currencies like bitcoin in India. The government has also invited citizen comments and discussion on virtual currencies on a government portal. The suggestion box has been open for a week and will close tomorrow, May 31.\n\nThe politicians, also members of parliament (MPs), reportedly claimed that bitcoin ‘could become a parallel money instrument for cycling black money and dodgy transactions and also a source of terror financing.’\n\nStill, bitcoin achieved the considerable feat of uniting politicians from opposition parties toward their misinformed disdain for the world’s most widely known cryptocurrency.\n\nKirit Somaiya, a member of India’s ruling right-wing party BJP, demanded to know if virtual currency committee are ‘properly briefing’ India’s prime minister – the leader of the BJP – about the ‘flipside’ of the cryptocurrency. Somaiya has previously raised the subject in the Indian Parliament in March, going so far as to label bitcoin a ‘pyramid ponzi scheme’. In April, he plainly demanded the cryptocurrency to be declared illegal.\n\nDinesh Trivedi, a politician affiliated with the Congress party, BJP’s traditional rival, reportedly stated during the meeting that “today, data is the new oil and Bitcoin is the ransom finance platform.”\n\nNotably, the MPs also urged finance ministry officials not to legalize the cryptocurrency, according to the report.\n\nAs it stands, Indian authorities are planning a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency which includes taxing adopters. By nearly every account from local reports, bitcoin is set to gain a legal status in India.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin’s astronomical rally has cryptocurrency bulls feeling vindicated. Not so fast, sceptics say.\n\nThe digital currency’s more than 100% surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top US$1 000 for the fist time. By Valentine’s Day, it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $500.\n\nThen it absolutely exploded — jumping more than $1 400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival of blockchain into the mainstream, the coin’s underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient.\n\nBut signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On 25 May, bitcoin surged more than $300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8% the next day. Bitcoin was little changed at $2 310 as of 7.39am in New York. For bears, that kind of volatility shows the asset’s unreliability as a store of value.\n\nHere are some other reasons why they warn caution is warranted:\n\nSafety questions\n\nThis month’s ransomware attacks serve as a reminder that bitcoin is still beloved by hackers and criminals because of its anonymity. The cryptocurrency plunged in 2014 after Tokyo-based Mt Gox — then the largest bitcoin exchange — said it had been breached and then filed for bankruptcy. Its value sank again in August 2016 after hackers stole about $69m from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex. The exchange has since repaid its customers.\n\nScaling debate\n\nThe bitcoin community has been split for more than a year on how to upgrade its blockchain. The time and fees necessary to verify transactions have climbed to record highs, making it more difficult for businesses to use the currency as a means of payment. While bitcoin executives have said that 2017 might be the year the cryptocurrency really starts to scale, others aren’t so sure.\n\nLast week, more than 50 companies signed a pact to speed up transactions, but ideological differences have prevented similar agreements — like the one reached last year in Hong Kong — from actually being implemented.\n\nThe much-touted SegWit upgrade was also released in October, but only a third of the community has embraced it. If the latest proposal fails to gain traction and the deadlock continues, digital currency users may dump bitcoin in favor of alt-coins that offer better blockchains.\n\nRival digital currencies\n\nAs the surge sends the cryptocurrency world into a frenzy, it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. While bitcoin’s value has increased more than 100% since the beginning of the year, its slice of the pie has shrunk as its digital cousins steal some of the spotlight. There are an estimated 700 rivals, according to Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance.\n\nBitcoin dominated about half of the overall digital currency market as of Friday, down from around 85% in February, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Meanwhile, ethereum’s share increased to about 20%. Some token fans aren’t sweating it though, as they say bitcoin’s potential demise doesn’t really matter as long as another digital currency takes hold.\n\nNot recognised by governments\n\nThe general public doesn’t understand bitcoin, and many regulators still don’t either, which makes it tough to regulate. In 2015, New York started issuing controversial licences to cryptocurrency companies, but only three had been issued as of mid-January, according to Coinbase, as many startups couldn’t afford the costs of applying.\n\nIn January, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority asked the public for help identifying the potential risks of blockchain. Two months later, bitcoin plummeted after the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a proposal by the Winklevoss twins for a publicly traded fund based on the digital currency.\n\nIn a report last week about blockchain in China, analysts at Sanford C Bernstein wrote that while the technology could benefit Chinese banks, it’s unlikely to start a financial revolution.\n\n“We believe blockchain application is more likely to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary in developing countries like China,” the analysts said. “Aside from the conservative regulatory attitudes toward financial innovations, the constraint of confidentiality and performance of blockchain technology would make it best positioned to be enterprise-orientated rather than consumer-end.”\n\nBubbles burst\n\nWhether it’s Holland’s tulip-bulb craze in the 17th century or the Internet-stock frenzy of the late 1990s, history shows that markets self-correct. Speculative markets usually run out of steam at some point. Determining the trigger is always the hard part. Given the breathtaking run in bitcoin as of late, some say it’s tough to believe the oft-cited mantra that this time is different. — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP', 'As bitcoin continues its bull run, more U.S. investors are looking for ways to protect their gains from taxation, and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are slowly emerging as a viable option.\n\nWhile holding bitcoin in an IRA has technically been possible since IRS Notice 2014-21, which declared bitcoin property for tax purposes, the process remains complicated and fraught with liabilities.\n\nSome regulators are trying to fix that. On January 9, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report calling on the IRS to better inform taxpayers about the reporting requirements and potential liabilities of holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their IRAs.\n\nBut for adventurous and capable investors who want to bet some of their retirement on bitcoin, there are currently two ways to get the tax protection of an IRA.\n\nFirst, investors will need to find a custodian to administer the IRA. Most IRA custodians allow “unconventional investments” like real estate and precious metals, but do not allow clients to hold bitcoin, at least not directly.\n\nThe alternative is to open an account with an IRA custodian that works with a fund like the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), which holds bitcoin and issues shares based on its value. BIT is an approved investment vehicle offered by IRA custodians like PENSCO, Entrust, Millennium and Equity Institutional. However, there are several disadvantages to this method.\n\nThe first is that BIT shares are only available to accredited investors, those with a net worth of more than $1 million or with an annual income greater than $200,000. The second is that the account owner does not hold any bitcoin directly, only shares in a fund that promises to hold actual bitcoin on his or her behalf. The third is that the intermediary custodian who holds the asset, in this case shares in the BIT fund, charges fees to cover compliance and management costs.\n\nFor non-accredited investors who want to buy and hold bitcoin directly and avoid high custodial fees, there is really only one option, and that’s to set up a Limited Liability Company within a self-directed IRA.\n\nA self-directed IRA LLC allows investors to hold bitcoin directly without giving up their wallet keys to a custodian and without seeking custodial approval for transactions, but it comes with more paperwork and liability risk.\n\nInvestors will still need to find the right custodian. Any IRA custodian that offers “checkbook LLCs” should allow clients to hold bitcoin in an LLC. However, only a few custodians specialize in bitcoin specifically and can streamline the process.\n\nBitcoinIRA, headed by former U.S. Mint director Edmund Moy, specializes in setting up self-directed IRAs for clients who want to invest in bitcoin, but it charges a hefty one-time fee for the service. IRA Financial Group recently announced a self-directed IRA structure that will allow investors to hold bitcoin directly in an LLC, without the intermediary of a fund like BIT.\n\nThere are many risks to holding bitcoin in a self-directed IRA LLC, including a lengthy list of “prohibited transactions” that can disqualify the tax protection of assets within the IRA.\n\nLegally, an IRA and its owner are separate entities and must act separately. The list of “prohibited transactions” is intended to prevent account owners from drawing double benefits from the IRA’s tax protection.\n\nFor example, account owners cannot put up the assets of their IRA LLC as security for a loan, since that would give them the double benefit of tax-protected assets and collateral.\n\nUnder these same rules, account owners cannot sell bitcoin to their own IRA LLC and must buy and store bitcoin in the name of the LLC, not their own names.\n\nFor investors who own bitcoin and want to transfer it into an IRA LLC, there’s only one option: sell the bitcoin, then contribute the proceeds — in U.S. dollars — to the IRA LLC, and then buy bitcoin in the name of the LLC with its own cash assets.\n\nAs with real estate and other unconventional investments, it’s also the responsibility of investors to report the fair market value of their assets to their custodian each year, whether those assets are held in an LLC or not.\n\nFor assets such as stocks and bonds, these values are assessed automatically. For real estate and unconventional investments like bitcoin, a third-party assessment is usually required.\n\nIf an account owner fails to report the value of their assets accurately to their custodian or engages in a “prohibited transaction,” their IRA can be disqualified and all assets distributed and taxed. Last but not least, account owners must also file annual reports and pay fees to the Secretary of State where the IRA LLC is incorporated.\n\nEven if account owners cross all the t’s and dot all the i’s, bad custodians can still get them in trouble.\n\nIn some cases, custodians have failed to update fair market values accurately in their reporting to the IRS, and account owners have had to pay taxes on assets that have gone down in value. However, the potential tax savings still make self-directed IRA LLCs an attractive option for many bitcoin investors.\n\nAs property, investors must pay capital gains tax on any increase in the value of their bitcoin. With a Roth IRA, investors can buy bitcoins with post-tax dollars and avoid paying any taxes on their gains when they cash out. As with any IRA, however, investors can only withdraw disbursements without suffering penalties after age 59 ½.\n\nAlthough holding bitcoin in IRAs has been possible since 2014, regulators are still worried the complicated process could land unwary taxpayers in trouble. As the GAO’s report pointed out, the IRS currently provides no guidance to IRA custodians or account owners about how to properly assess the fair market value of unconventional assets such as bitcoin, even though such assessments are mandatory.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice. Investors should conduct their own due diligence and consult with a qualified tax professional before attempting anything described in this article.', 'BITPoint Japan Co. is reportedly gearing up to enable hundreds of thousands of Japanese retail outlets to accept the digital currency bitcoin, reported Bloomberg News.\n\nIn a Bloomberg report, Genki Oda, BITPoint’s president, said the company is in talks with a retail-related company and that “by going through a company providing payment terminal services to shops, we have the possibility of increasing its use at one stroke. It’s easier than talking to lots of individual retailers.”\n\nBloomberg pointed out that BITPoint is joining a growing list of companies that are embracing regulations enacted in Japan in April that recognize digital currencies as a way to pay for things. Bic Camera Inc., one of Japan’s largest electronics retailers, started accepting bitcoin at two stores in Tokyo in April. “We’re also talking to a big convenience store operator about using it,” said Oda, 36, who also runs BITPoint parent company Remixpoint Inc., which had a market value of about 21 billion yen ($189 million) at the time of the Bloomberg interview, noting the company is aiming to make an announcement by early 2018.\n\nAlthough BITPoint operates as a bitcoin exchange, the company is moving to promote the use of the digital currency in stores and at retail outlets, so it can move beyond being a speculative instrument. Bloomberg noted that Oda said BITPoint has ties to many retailers and plans to add more to its roster.\n\nOn April 1, Japan formalized rules around anti-money laundering and also released standards for security and audits, making the currency more realistic for retailers. Citing the Nikkei newspaper, Bloomberg noted restaurant booking site Gurunavi, Inc., said it will start letting diners pay with bitcoin later in 2017.\n\n“It’s funny how the whole narrative of bitcoin being risky or dangerous has changed, and it is now seen as a form of pride to regulate and embrace it,” said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Gatecoin, in the same report.', 'Recently, the Bolivian Financial System Supervision Authority (ASFI) arrested 60 people for carrying out “training activities” related to the investment in virtual currencies such as bitcoin, according to a press release published by ASFI.\n\nBolivia is one of the few countries in the word in which bitcoin is outright declared illegal. In 2014 the country’s central bank, El Banco Central de Bolivia (BCB) officially banned all currencies that weren’t issued or regulated by a government or an authorized entity. The Latin American’s government and central bank believe virtual currencies are a pyramid scheme that only exists to steal people’s money.\n\nThe Bolivian bitcoiners were arrested for seemingly distributing bitcoin-related pamphlets at the Cine Center of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and possibly planning to sell or mine bitcoin, as according to the statement they were gathered and “carrying out training activities related to the investment of money with characteristics of multilevel schemes”.\n\nLenny Valdivia, Executive Director General at ASFI, stated:\n\nWe confiscated pamphlets relating to business schemes that go around giving training and making business plans regarding virtual currencies that are operating abroad. The Bolivian population should not be fooled, it should not participate in closed [virtual currency-related] groups through WhatsApp. The only thing they are doing is taking advantage of the population, deceiving the people to appropriate their money.\n\nThe ASFI restated in the press release that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are, as of May 6, 2014, banned in the country and that it would continue to go after Bolivians who promote cryptocurrencies. Valdivia asked the population to actively denounce similar cases so that Bolivians can take care of their savings and of the economy of their families, according to the statement.\n\nThe press release ends stating that ASFI is currently working towards drafting regulations that will allow the inclusion of pyramid schemes in the country’s Penal Code, to help fight those who engage in similar virtual currency-related activities.\n\nBitcoin Crackdowns\n\nBolivia isn’t the only country in which bitcoiners are having a hard time. In Venezuela, a country in which cryptocurrencies allow the people to circumvent the government’s currency controls, four bitcoin miners who were allegedly operating over 300 mining machines, have been arrested earlier this year, as they were accused of electricity theft and cyber fraud.\n\nAs a matter of fact, bitcoin has been targeted in the country ever since hyperinflation struck the Venezuelan Bolivar and cryptocurrencies became an alternative. As part of the government’s attacks on bitcoin, Venezuela’s state-owned internet service provider CANTV outright blocked several bitcoin-related websites and mining pools.\n\nVenezuela’s crackdown was followed-up in February, when authorities took down a mining center in Valencia in Carabobo state. At the end of the day, bitcoin continues to be a safe haven for Venezuelans, as peer-to-peer trading volumes in the country have been growing. Just last week, a Redditor claimed that bitcoin is what was keeping his family from starving in Venezuela’s impoverished economy.\n\nFeatured image of Bolivian Police from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'BITCOIN\n\nAfter hitting a record high of over $2,700 last week, bitcoin has gone into a correction—and it’s one that has caused the digital currency’s price to lose nearly 19 percent of its value in four days.\n\nOn May 24, bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $2,760.10 on Bitstamp thanks to an uptick in demand out of Asia. But on Monday, the digital currency traded at $2,260 level, marking a $500 drop since the record high last week.\n\nAnalysts cited a “quite brief” correction as the cause of the price fall, which has also affected other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash and Monero.\n\n“The correction was actually quite brief, and the prices today are still higher than that of a week ago,” BTCC CEO Bobby Lee told CNBC.\n\nPrice fluctuations are normal\n\nSo what caused the recent price fluctuations? A lot of profit taking, according to experts.\n\n“I think the pullback was just a profit taking, a correction from the skyrocketing prices of last week,” Lee said.\n\nWith the total market capitalization of all digital currencies now above $90 billion, traders have started taking money off the table.\n\n“[Traders] took this opportunity to capitalize on the excessive hype that’s been building up over the past few days in the space,” Petar Zivkovski, COO of cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk.\n\nThe price swings aren’t just normal, they’re also “healthy” occurrences as the price of cryptocurrency marches higher and higher. In fact, this isn’t the first time that bitcoin experienced a bump. More than three years ago, the price of the digital currency skyrocketed from $130 to over $1,100, and then down to about $400 in a matter of weeks. That was followed by a steady decline until January 2015, when bitcoin finally began to rally again.\n\nNow, the bitcoin world is in “wave three,” and experts believe we’ll see more rallies and retreats along the way until the blockchain technology reaches its full potential.\n\n“Bitcoin had moved too far too fast. This is a healthy, call it a ‘correction,’ coming on the heels of a very strong move,” Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, told the bitcoin news outlet.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin traded at $2,326.24 early Tuesday morning.\n\nComments', 'The Central Bank of Russia could soon recognize digital currencies like bitcoin as digital commodities and tax them accordingly.\n\nAccording to the central bank’s deputy chairwoman, Olga Skorobogatova, the central bank is in the process of drafting legislation to legally recognize and monitor digital currencies. The preliminary draft regulation could be presented to the Russian State Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament, as soon as June, Skorobogatova was quoted as stating by Interfax.\n\nThe central bank official was speaking at a meeting in the Parliament last week, when she further outlined the apex bank’s plans for digital currencies in Russia.\n\nShe reportedly stated:\n\n[Digital currencies already circulating in Russia will see] certain regulations with regard to taxes, monitoring and reporting, as a digital commoditiy.\n\nShe further revealed that the plan to monitor and tax bitcoin transactions were discussed in a meeting with the Ministry of Finance (which has previously tried to criminalize bitcoin adoption), the Ministry of Economic Development and unnamed ‘law enforcement agencies’ who are all in support of the proposal.\n\nSkorobogatova’s comments coincide with statements that represent a complete U-turn by Russia’s deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev in April. The official, who notably led the effort to ban and criminalize bitcoin activity in Russia since 2014, revealed that authorities could recognize and regulate bitcoin in a legal capacity in 2018. More specifically, he revealed the state’s wish to ‘monitor’ bitcoin transactions, which would see the local cryptocurrency industry being regulated.\n\nThere are no details as to how Russia plans on monitoring all bitcoin transactions. If bitcoin trading and mining are to soon be recognized by legislation, it remains to be seen how authorities plan on taxing the two different activities.\n\nStill, the remarkable shift in stance toward bitcoin, from hostility to a pseudo-recognition, has been telling. In February this year, Russia’s largest online retailer, Ulmart, discarded plans of accepting bitcoin for payments after being strong-armed by the central bank.\n\n“We saw that there was demand [for bitcoin] from some of our customers and so we were considering that seriously. But then, the central bank intervened,” revealed Ulmart chairman Dmitry Kostygin. Three months and a complete shift in approach later, Ulmart announced plans to accept bitcoin from September this year.\n\nPavel Vrublevsky, founder of ChronoPay, one of Russia’s oldest online payments providers, announced plans to integrate bitcoin alongside the likes of VISA and MasterCard. In a conversation with CCN, the executive also revealed plans to open a bitcoin exchange and sees a positive road ahead for bitcoin in Russia.\n\nHe said:\n\nThe central bank last week announced draft legislation for bitcoin as a commodity.

05/31/2017,"['Kay Van-Petersen, an analyst at Saxo Bank, told CNBC that Bitcoin price could hit $100,000 in the next 10 years.\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency market was nearing that of major stock markets. However, the cryptocurrency market’s trading volume is still only a fraction of leading stock markets such as NASDAQ.\n\nIn order for the cryptocurrency market to surpass the trading volumes of major stock markets, it has to surpass a trillion dollar market cap. In an interview with CNBC, Van-Petersen stated that Bitcoin alone will most likely achieve a trillion dollar market cap in the next 10 years and a price of $100,000.\n\nMore to that, Van-Petersen predicted the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency market to account for at least 10 percent of the average daily volumes of fiat currency trades which is a $500 bln trading volume.\n\nMilestone\n\nCurrently, the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency market is around $4.3 bln and for it to surpass 10 percent of the daily volumes of fiat currency trades, it needs to increase by a factor of 100. Considering Bitcoin and Ethereum’s exponential growth over the past few years, it is not entirely impossible for the cryptocurrency market to achieve such a milestone in the next 10 years.\n\nVan-Petersen, who is also a Bitcoin investor, told CNBC:\n\n""This is not a fad, cryptocurrencies are here to stay. There will emerge two to three main ones. Bitcoin will be one of those. And the reason is the first-mover advantage, the scale and the pioneering.""\n\nVan-Petersen also emphasized that Bitcoin is being used as a digital currency in remote parts of the world in countries which lack a stable monetary system and financial networks. In countries such as Venezuela, Bitcoin is a lifeline for citizens who are struggling to finance day-to-day operations.\n\nVolatility\n\nLeading economies such as Japan are also rapidly adopting Bitcoin as a digital currency, with some of its largest conglomerates accepting Bitcoin as payment. Most recently, Japan’s most popular budget airline Peach and largest electronics retailer Bic Camera began to accept Bitcoin as an official payment method.\n\nVan-Petersen says:\n\n""Volumes are going up, volatility is going down. A lot of people talk about the volatility, but if you are in Zimbabwe or Venezuela, this volatility is nothing. This is the interesting thing to me. I think in the West, a lot of people view it is as speculative, but emerging markets will get it, their needs will be different.”\n\nUltimately, Van-Petersen sees the market cap of Bitcoin rising to $1.75 trillion in the next 10 years. For this to happen, Bitcoin needs to mature as a technology, solve all of its scaling issues and become adopted as a digital currency and digital cash system, instead of a safe haven asset and long-term investment.', 'Chinese exchange Okcoin has announced it will launch Ethereum (ETH) trading from Wednesday.\n\nIn a post on its website this morning, the exchange said the decision was the result of “two years [...] constantly reviewing the viability of listing ETH and ETC based on factors including technical maturity, innovation, market liquidity and compliance.”\n\nTrading will go live at 10:00 p.m. local time on May 31.\n\n“Hundreds of applications are now built on Ethereum and a growing number of applications are using smart contracts run on the Ethereum Blockchain,” it continued in support of the decision, also highlighting the major business power behind the recently-formed Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.\n\nAt the same time, Okcoin took the opportunity to call on the wider Bitcoin community to reach a consensus and implement a corresponding solution to the scaling debate.\n\n“...We implore BTC Core developers and relevant Miners to work together and resolve any outstanding technical issues, activate SegWit and solve BTC’s scaling issues,” the exchange continued.\n\n“No matter how dominant, how much market share you have, if you do not adopt the latest technology and fail to constantly improve on the core user value proposition, time will pass you by.”\n\nFellow Chinese operator BTCChina’s CEO Bobby Lee announced May 27 that users had voted to add Ethereum Classic (ETC) to the exchange as its next currency.', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lack of liquidity is keeping U.S.-based mutual fund managers from investing in bitcoin even as the digital currency hits record highs.\n\nOnly four out of the more than 10,000 mutual funds based in the United States have bitcoin as part of their portfolios, according to data from Morningstar Inc. Of those four, three are from the same New York-based firm, Kinetics, which collectively manages $1.2 billion in total assets. The company declined a request to comment for this story.\n\nThe value of bitcoin has more than doubled this year in volatile trading as retail investors in Japan and South Korea have piled into the digital currency. Bitcoin has also been increasingly used in so-called ransomware attacks because of its untraceable nature [L1N1IQ24E]. The price of a single bitcoin peaked at $2,760.10 on the Bitstamp exchange on Thursday, but has since fallen to $2,292.53.\n\nMore funds would likely invest in bitcoin if the Securities and Exchange Commission were to approve an exchange-traded fund that holds the digital currency, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CRFA.\n\nSuch a move would allow fund managers to easily buy and sell shares of bitcoin to either speculate on its price or to use as a hedge, similar to how funds invest in the $34.3 billion SPDR Gold Trust ETF in order to get exposure to gold, he said. “From a mutual fund perspective, liquidity is paramount,” he said.\n\nInvestors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss tried for more than three years to convince the SEC to allow the first bitcoin-focused ETF. The agency’s staff ruled against them in March, yet the commission is now reviewing that decision.\n\nAny U.S.-based mutual funds that do have exposure to bitcoin own it through shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a $797 million closed-end fund sponsored by New York-based Grayscale Investments that trades in the lightly-regulated over the counter market.

Because traders couldn’t withdraw Bitcoin they held on exchanges, the demand for Bitcoin decreased and, ultimately, the majority of traders moved from regulated exchanges to over-the-counter (OTC) markets such as LocalBitcoins.\n\nFor several months, Bitcoin was being traded in China at a value around 25 percent lower than other markets. As a result, the global average price of Bitcoin declined and the Chinese market presented a massive arbitrage opportunity. The Chinese market’s decline in demand toward Bitcoin and decreasing Bitcoin price led to global market instability for Bitcoin and held Bitcoin price down for months.\n\nBack on track\n\nOn May 31, the Chinese exchange market finally recovered, with the OKCoin trading platform’s withdrawal resumption acting as a catalyst to trigger the interest and demand for Bitcoin from local investors.

Since the median transaction size of bitcoin is 226 bytes, the 420 satoshis/byte recommended fee costs users over $2 per transaction. For most transactions, the recommended fee would climb up to $2.14 if users want to see their transactions confirmed faster than others.\n\nA few months ago, until March, the recommended fee for bitcoin transactions was 160 satoshis/byte. In a matter of months, recommended bitcoin fees increased by around three times and the failure to cope with the rising fee market has resulted in many delayed and overturned transactions.\n\nBitcoin payment service providers and wallet operators such as Xapo and Blockchain have started to adopt better, more efficient and accurate fee estimators. Blockchain has started to use the satoshis/byte metric after many of its users had their transactions delayed for days and eventually had transactions overturned even with Blockchain’s previous recommended fees. Because Blockchain did not take the transaction size into consideration, some transactions weren’t able to be confirmed by miners even with a high fee.\n\nXapo is also one of the few bitcoin wallet operators and service providers that have adopted an accurate fee estimator. Although it provides users with two selections of low and high fee, a high fee uses Bitcoin Fee’s 420 satoshis/byte recommendation to ensure transactions of users are included in the first block.\n\nFees for bitcoin have increased exponentially within the past few months. It is $2 at the moment but it could rise to $3, $4 and even up to $5. For users that are sending transactions below $100, the transaction fee of bitcoin would be too expensive and difficult to cope with.\n\nAccording to Blockchain, the mempool size of bitcoin has significantly increased as well since April. In early last month, the size of the bitcoin mempool averaged around 12 million bytes. In May, the size of the mempool increased by a factor of 10, to 120 million bytes.\n\nThe bitcoin mempool holds transactions that are yet to be picked up by the miners. In other words, delayed transactions that haven’t been confirmed by miners are stored in the mempool. Hence, the larger the bitcoin mempool, more transactions are stuck and delayed within the network.\n\nBitcoin scaling talks have seen progress in the last few weeks. Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo vowed to help Barry Silbert and the Digital Currency Group to complete its Segregated Witness + 2MB hard fork scaling solution, or Segwit2MB.\n\nI will work hard with @barrysilbert to make his initiative a success. — Eric Lombrozo (@eric_lombrozo) May 28, 2017\n\nThe validation of a Bitcoin Core developer is an important asset to the 57 companies involved in the Bitcoin Scaling Agreement. Most of the criticisms toward the Bitcoin Scaling Agreement has been the timeline and the deadline of the activation of Segwit. Although the 57 companies agreed upon a September activation of Segwit, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell pointed out that Segwit with a new activation threshold can only be proposed after the previous Segwit proposal (BIP 148) expires, which is in November.\n\nThe bitcoin community seems positive that scaling will be achieved within 2017. If it doesn’t, bitcoin users will suffer and the fee market will continue to rise, making transactions even more expensive. A $2 fee per transaction is already substantially high for the average bitcoin user.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'New information is coming out about a proposal that some hope could lead to a long-awaited increase to bitcoin\'s transaction capacity, a stagnant feature that many in the community believe is holding back the cryptocurrency\'s growth and utility.\n\nAlthough there have been past efforts aimed at putting an end to bitcoin\'s two-year scaling debate, the new \'agreement\' has perhaps earned unprecedented support from companies and mining pool operators, with over 50 bitcoin companies and firms representing more than 80% of bitcoin\'s mining power signing the proposal.\n\nThe goal, according to the announcement blog post released last week, is to move forward with two changes: an optimization called Segregated Witness and a 2MB block size increase. Although, the latter is arguably the main point of contention, since it could potentially lead to the creation of two bitcoin networks if not all users agree with the change.\n\nBeyond that, though, details have been thin. The community and even some of the participants were at least initially confused about aspects of the plan: Which upgrade is supposed to come first? Where\'s the code? Do supporters think it will lead to a network split? (Is that the goal?)\n\nHowever, new details are coming out which might not totally clarify the situation, but help show how companies involved are thinking about these questions.\n\nOne new development is that participants are beginning to put together code – another point that sets the proposal apart from past attempts to come to a consensus on a solution, such as one widely known as the Hong Kong agreement.\n\nFor example, while bitcoin technology company BitGo did not sign the new agreement, the company has ""pledged technical resources"" to formalize it into working code.\n\n""The plan we\'re putting together is laser-focused on building a deployable [minimum viable product] for our mission ... All work will be done in the open, and we welcome constructive debate,"" BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe wrote in a leaked email describing a rough roadmap called \'Segwit2x\'.\n\n(BitGo did not respond to CoinDesk\'s requests about its involvement in the effort.)\n\nThe roadmap tentatively schedules the first software version release for 16th June, at which point the open-source community can give their feedback. If all goes according to plan, bitcoin users will be able to download the new, finalized bitcoin software about a month later on 21st July.\n\nThe three-day-old implementation so far includes contributions from Bloq co-founder and Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik. (Perhaps it\'s worth noting that some of the technical feedback has been critical and partly politicized, so far.)\n\nOther developers, such have Lightning Network co-inventor Joseph Poon, have also expressed an interest in contributing to help build a safe, new version.\n\nStrong agreement\n\nAgainst this backdrop, some participants initially seemed not to agree, or at least were confused by the terms of the agreement.\n\nHowever, when contacted, companies involved largely seem to be on the same page. Though initial feedback from the community was mixed, all companies that responded said that they agree to move forward with the proposal.\n\n""I think it\'s an important step towards breaking a stalemate that is causing bitcoin to stagnate,"" said Joshua Scigala, CEO of bitcoin-gold exchange Vaultoro, though he mentioned that he would have liked to have seen ""a couple of more months to prepare"".\n\nValery Vavilov, CEO of blockchain technology company Bitfury Group, told CoinDesk that the agreement ""has not changed"" in light of community responses, and SFOX co-founder and developer Akbar Thobhani said much the same.\n\nOthers were more diplomatically short on the matter.\n\n""We understand there are different visions for bitcoin among the community, and Coinbase is supportive of both on- and off-chain scaling improvements,"" said a company representative.\n\nThat said, several companies on the list, including DCG and its subsidiaries, Purse, Blockchain and Xapo declined to comment.\n\nBitcoin Core?\n\nFollowing the proposal release, one of the key points of community contention is that Bitcoin Core contributors, the volunteer developers behind bitcoin\'s primary software, were absent from the meeting and the signed agreement. Some of these developers stated in the aftermath of the proposal that they don\'t think the plan is technically viable and that the timeline is too short.\n\nOthers have gone as far as to argue that the agreement is a political move – a way to replace Bitcoin Core developers, who work on a volunteer basis, with another team.\n\nOn this note, some companies mentioned that they are simply frustrated with the lack of scaling progress. For one, since transaction capacity has remained stagnant, transaction fees have swelled, affecting users and businesses.\n\n“Many Bitcoin Core developers stopped listening to businesses, miners and users over two years ago. If they are unwilling to compromise, then the compromise will move forward without them,” said Yours CEO Ryan X Charles, adding:\n\n""We will continue to support the proposal even if developers do not.""\n\nGenesis Mining co-founder and CEO Marco Streng shared a similar sentiment.\n\n""We\'re supporting bitcoin – and it goes without saying that the individuals responsible for bitcoin will change as the project ages. We\'ll support these individuals (or groups), whomever they may be,"" he said.\n\nSFOX\'s Thobhani suggested that the release of the rough proposal is just a first step that could lead to wider consensus.\n\n""This is a process and not a stance,"" he said. ""I am hopeful that through this process we will identify a way to discuss different views and find a path forward.""\n\nOn the other hand, some signed the agreement with the idea that they would like the team to stay onboard.\n\n""We really hope the agreement will ultimately reunite the community. Having the Bitcoin Core developers aboard is a vital part of the plan for Bitwala,"" a representative from Bitwala said.\n\n“We have the utmost respect for the Bitcoin Core developers and we are working to create an agreement and technical roadmap that suits everyone and is best for the future of bitcoin,” Vavilov said.\n\nOnward with a split\n\nParticipants that responded also appear to agree that the proposal, including the hard fork, will happen.\n\n""If a hard fork is the only way to solve the scaling problems – among other issues – then that is how it has to be,"" as Streng put it.\n\nBut, following the change, companies have different ideas about what the outcome will be.\n\n""We believe a hard fork with roughly 75% support from business, miners and users would be strong enough that it would thrive even in the midst of two competing chains,"" Charles said.\n\nOthers think that two chains are unlikely to survive, with the new \'Segwit2x\' coin pulling in the majority of the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n""Strong consensus is needed to initiate the hard fork, so seriously competing chains are unlikely. Probably the less popular chain would remain a niche,"" said MONI marketing lead Ilkka Montin.\n\nSome feel that the 2MB component is a critical piece.\n\n""We\'re at a point where SegWit alone won’t be enough for the current needs of the network,"" said Ripio CEO and co-founder Sebastian Serrano.\n\nOn the other hand, some companies mentioned that they also support other methods of deploying SegWit on its own, which has stalled due to lack of support from mining pool operators. In this way, some see another controversial proposal, called UASF (for \'user-activated soft fork\'), as another potential way forward.\n\nScigala said that his company is looking at how to ""safely participate"".\n\nAlthough it’s complex, the downside, like with a hard fork, is that the method of upgrading bitcoin could also lead to a chain split. One difference, according to UASF advocates (who appear to be moving forward with what they call a bitcoin ""Independence Day"" slated for 1st August) is that a soft fork is a backwards-compatible change, while a hard fork isn’t.\n\n""Nobody in the community would deny that scaling is needed. SegWit had been blocked by some powerful miners and those miners want a higher block size, so now it’s either UASF or SegWit with a higher block size,"" said a representative from Bitwala, who concluded:\n\n""Either way, most parties involved have agreed to activate SegWit one way or the other.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stakes in BitGo, Bitwala, Blockchain, Coinbase, MONI, Purse and Xapo.\n\nColorful rulers image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

They speak on 'Bloomberg Technology.' (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nIf you need evidence that bitcoin mania is getting extreme, look at the lone investment vehicle available to institutional investors.\n\nGrayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trades over-the-counter in the U.S. and offers direct exposure to bitcoin, surged 85 percent last week, compared with the digital currency’s 17 percent increase. Those gains brought the fund known by its ticker, GBTC, to trade at more than twice its net asset value, the highest premium ever.\n\nThat has some long-term advocates of the cryptocurrency pausing.\n\n“We took some profits on GBTC for the first time since 2015 because its premium to bitcoin became too extreme,” said Cathie Wood, the New York-based chief investment officer at ARK Investment Management, which oversees the first exchange-traded fund with exposure to the virtual currency. “There’s a scarcity value in GBTC because for us and for other investors, to buy an instrument, it has to be a financial security. The only way we can own bitcoin is through GBTC.”\n\nGBTC’s premium surged as investors who can’t buy digital currencies flooded the fund as bitcoin climbed to new records. Blockchain assets are surging following multiple factors including, Japan saying it will recognize bitcoin as a legal payment method, Fidelity’s Abigail Johnson endorsing its use, and as evidence shows there’s growing adoption by companies and efforts to scale the technology. This all took place as industry leaders and enthusiasts joined in at least three highly attended conferences in New York last week.\n\nSome of the barriers blocking institutional investors’ access are that Individual Retirement Accounts only accept financial assets, that most funds have internal liquidity or risk limits which bitcoin and other digital currencies may not meet, or that internal compliance or audits don’t approve of the assets. Also, some investors don’t want to go through what they perceive as risk and hassle of dealing with bitcoin wallets and exchanges.\n\nRead more about the skepticism surrounding the surge in the price of bitcoin\n\nGrayscale’s trust, which has just under $400 million in total assets, is one of the few alternatives institutional investors have. Channel Islands-based Global Advisors Jersey Ltd. provides a fund with indirect exposure to bitcoin and two exchange-traded notes that invest in the digital currency, which are listed in Sweden. Global Advisors Chief Executive Officer Daniel Masters says the interest is stronger in the exchange-traded products and his fund has seen rising inflows from wealthy individuals and family offices.\n\nAttempts to list exchange traded funds that track bitcoin were initially rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the grounds that the bitcoin market isn’t regulated, making it subject to “fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” but granted a request to review the decision.\n\nARK’s Wood said that while a bitcoin ETF might make sense in the future, the bitcoin market doesn’t have the volume or liquidity to withstand the demand that would come from an ETF, so GBTC might be the best way to go for U.S. investor in the near future.\n\n“It’s going to be liquid enough, but we’re still in the very early stages,” Wood said. “A lot of people are worried that there’s a bubble, but I think this is just the beginning.”\n\n— With assistance by Justina Lee"", ""Bitcoin recently broke below a short-term rising wedge formation but bulls don't seem ready to give up just yet.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price bounced off support of an ascending channel forming on its 1-hour time frame.\n\nThis signals that buying pressure is coming back into play and may take price back up to the resistance at $2400 or higher.\n\nTechnical indicators, however, are suggesting that bears are still on top of their game.\n\nBitcoin recently broke below a short-term rising wedge formation but bulls don’t seem ready to give up just yet.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA on this 1-hour chart, signaling that the path of least resistance is to the downside. However, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to show a potential upside crossover and return in buying momentum.\n\nStochastic is on the move up, also indicating that buyers are in control, but the oscillator is nearing the overbought zone to reflect rally exhaustion. Once this oscillator turns lower, selling pressure could return and spur another test of the channel support at $2200, which is also close to the 100 SMA dynamic support.\n\nRSI is on the move up but seems to be turning down from its climb, suggesting that bears are eager to get back in and possibly trigger a downside break of support.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nThere haven’t been a lot of developments on the bitcoin front recently, which explains the drop in volatility after last week’s bitcoin price surge. Although market factors such as geopolitical risk and the recent developments in the scaling issue remain in support of bitcoin, investors seem to be holding out for more convincing catalysts before taking the cryptocurrency out for another rally.\n\nSo far, the details on the scaling proposal that supposedly has support of 83% of bitcoin miners are still short. This could be one possible catalyst that might allow bitcoin price to go on a steeper climb. The latest update was that participants are working to put together a code but several startups have yet to pledge their support until their technical resources are aligned.\n\nAccording to the proposal, the first software release is on June 16th so there’s a couple more weeks to go before bitcoin price enjoys more volatility.

A segment of all Bitcoin users is committed to activate a user activated soft fork (UASF) as described in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP 148). Specifically, they will reject any Bitcoin blocks that do not signal support for Segregated Witness (SegWit), the centerpiece of Bitcoin Core \'s scaling roadmap .\n\nIf a majority of miners (by hash power) does not signal support for SegWit on August 1st, but at least some do, Bitcoin\'s blockchain will split in two. In that case, there would be two types of Bitcoin tokens, which we\'ll refer to in this article as ""148 BTC"" for coins on the soft forked chain, and ""Legacy BTC"" for coins on the chain that did not activate the soft fork.\n\nThe good news is that each bitcoin would effectively be copied to both chains. If you hold bitcoin right now, you will hold both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC after the split.\n\nThe bad news is that this coin-split can be messy and risky. And if you\'re not careful, you could lose funds.\n\nThis guide will provide you with the basics to keeping your funds safe during the UASF and will help to make sure you make it to the ""other side"" with all your bitcoins intact.\n\nAuthor\'s note: If you want to play the 148 BTC/Legacy BTC markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you: It\'s a beginner\'s guide.\n\nBefore August 1\n\nFirst off, be aware that a chain-split create a high-risk situation. There is a chance that some sort of cyber-battle will break out between the two camps, perhaps even escalating to the point where bitcoin\'s exchange rate(s) drops sharply, possibly to zero. Make absolutely sure you are not holding more value in bitcoin than what you are willing to lose.\n\nIf you do decide to hold onto your bitcoins, the single most important piece of advice is this: Ensure that you control your own private keys.\n\nIf you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial wallet like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive coins on both ends of the chain. In fact, if these kinds of services aren\'t well-prepared, there could be scenarios where you don\'t get any coins at all. So far, no exchanges have given any kind of guarantee.\n\nSo if you\'re using any of these kinds of services to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet . Send your bitcoins to one or several Bitcoin addresses in this new wallet. This wallet now holds your private keys.\n\nWhat kind of wallet you use is up to you. That said, here are some basic solutions:\n\nIf you don\'t care about transacting with bitcoin (either 148 BTC or Legacy BTC) anytime soon and really just want to keep both as a long-term investment, printing your private keys on a paper wallet is one option. This option, however, is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here . Another option is to get a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure.\n\nMost regular desktop or mobile wallets, as listed on bitcoin.org , are about as secure as your computer or phone is. Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile wallets and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys for you.\n\nIn any case: Be sure to make backups of your keys! Most wallets require you to do this when installing: don\'t skip this step.\n\nOn, and Perhaps (shortly) After, August 1\n\nIf a majority of hash power signals support for Segregated Witness on or before August 1st, the protocol upgrade will activate smoothly. In that case, you\'re fine, even if you didn\'t prepare at all.\n\nBut it\'s also possible that a majority of hash power will not go along with the BIP 148 UASF on August 1st, in which case the chain could split. If you hold your private keys, you will then have both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC.\n\nSuch a chain-split could resolve in several ways.\n\nIf on or after August 1st, the 148 BTC chain becomes the chain with most accumulated proof of work, both BIP 148 nodes as well as Legacy nodes would switch to the 148 BTC chain. As such, the Legacy BTC chain should be discarded, resolving the situation. It would have been a temporary split, and you should be fine if you held onto your private keys. You can now continue to use bitcoin as usual.\n\nBut unless and until this happens (or other types of precautions are taken), there is always at least a theoretical risk that the Legacy BTC chain can be overtaken and be discarded like this. That chance should decrease as time goes on, but will realistically exist for hours, perhaps days, and maybe even longer - even if no blocks are found on the 148 BTC chain.\n\nAs such, buying or accepting (or even holding) Legacy BTC after the split - and especially shortly after the split - is risky. These bitcoins can quite literally disappear if the 148 BTC chain overtakes the Legacy BTC chain. Therefore, it\'s not recommended that you accept any Legacy BTC - if you do, at least be aware of and comfortable with the risk that your money could cease to exist.\n\nBIP 148 nodes will never accept the Legacy chain, so these will not switch. However, it is very risky to buy, accept or hold 148 BTC, too. Most importantly, there is no guarantee that 148 BTC will continue to be used. While that is of course true for any cryptocurrency, due to slow mining difficulty adjustments, a potentially hostile environment, and the continued possibility for SegWit to activate on the Legacy chain after all, it\'s probably more true for 148 BTC. Additionally, block confirmations may be very slow for quite a while, which could make using 148 BTC for transacting impractical.\n\nIf you do want to accept 148 BTC, you need to run a BIP 148 full node as a wallet. You can find more information about that here .\n\n\n\nOn top of the Legacy BTC chain being discarded or the 148 BTC chain withering away, there is another big risk: replay attacks.\n\nIn case of a chain-split, transactions on both sides of the fork will look identical. If a transaction is picked up by both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC nodes - for example, because the receiver of a transaction retransmits that transaction - the transaction may be valid on both chains. This is called a ""replay attack.""\n\nAs such, spending coins on one end of the chain could make you accidentally spend the equivalent coin on the other side of the chain. Instead of paying someone only in 148 BTC, you may unintentionally send Legacy BTC as well or vice versa. 148 BTC and Legacy BTC are initially ""stuck together.""\n\nThe best way to prevent replay attacks is simple: Do not send any transactions. At least not until it is clearer to everyone what the post-fork situation looks like.\n\nAfter the Chain-Split\n\nIn case of the BIP 148 UASF, it is a bit hard to say what ""after the chain-split"" actually means.\n\nIf the 148 BTC chain gets more accumulated proof of work, it should be the only chain to survive, and the split would be over. All 148 BTC would then simply be bitcoins (BTC) again.\n\nBut if that doesn\'t happen fast, and even if the 148 BTC chain appears non-active, a chain-split could, at the very least, linger for a while. Miners could start mining on that chain at any time. As such, the 148 BTC chain can in theory always wipe out the Legacy BTC chain.\n\nAnd there are also possible scenarios where the two chains - 148 BTC and Legacy BTC - coexist. What\'s more, even a scenario where more than two chains emerge can\'t be taken out of the equation. In these scenarios, you will have coins on both (or all) sides of the fork.\n\n\n\nBut as mentioned, it will be tricky to spend coins on one chain without accidentally spending the equivalent on the other(s). And the bad news is that splitting these coins can be a bit complex. (It will require freshly mined or double-spent coins.)\n\nThe good news, however, is that some exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of the complexity behind the screens. You\'d just need to send your bitcoins to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with 148 BTC and Legacy BTC. (They should even replay the transaction for you to make sure they indeed receive both your coins.) At that point, if you want, you will be able to sell or trade your coins.\n\nIf the split persists, there should be wallets for both coins soon enough. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet if and when this happens. This outcome also remains to be seen. Do not accept any transactions on your wallet before this is clear.\n\nFurther specifics on what to do after a coin-split will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine (and most likely on bitcoin.org and other sources of information) if and when a coin-split occurs and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.\n\nSo, to Recap ...\n\n1. Control your private keys.\n\n2. To be on the safe side, avoid any transactions on and shortly after August 1st. (How ""shortly after"" depends on what happens.)\n\n3. If there are still two chains when the dust settles, split your coins into different wallets.\n\nThis article will be updated as news develops.\n\n\n\n', 'Last month, the technology developer Gnosis sold $12.5 million worth of “GNO,” its in-house digital currency, in 12 minutes. The April 24 sale, intended to fund development of an advanced prediction market, got admiring coverage from Forbes and The Wall Street Journal. On the same day, in an exurb of Mumbai, a company called OneCoin was in the midst of a sales pitch for its own digital currency when financial enforcement officers raided the meeting, jailing 18 OneCoin representatives and ultimately seizing more than $2 million in investor funds. Multiple national authorities have now described OneCoin, which pitched itself as the next Bitcoin, as a Ponzi scheme; by the time of the Mumbai bust, it had already moved at least $350 million in allegedly scammed funds through a payment processor in Germany. These two projects—one trumpeted as an innovative success, the other targeted as a criminal conspiracy—claimed to be doing essentially the same thing. In the last two months alone, more than two dozen companies building on the “blockchain” technology pioneered by Bitcoin have launched what are known as Initial Coin Offerings to raise operating capital. The hype around blockchain technology is turning ICOs into the next digital gold rush: According to the research firm Smith and Crown, ICOs raised $27.6 million in the first two weeks of May alone.\n\nUnlike IPOs, however, ICOs are catnip for scammers. They are not formally regulated by any financial authority, and exist in an ecosystem with few checks and balances. OneCoin loudly trumpeted its use of blockchain technology, but holes in that claim were visible long before international law enforcement took notice. Whereas Gnosis had experienced engineers, endorsements from known experts, and an operational version of their software, OneCoin was led and promoted by known fraudsters waving fake credentials. According to a respected blockchain engineer who was offered a position as OneCoin’s Chief Technology Officer, OneCoin’s “blockchain” consisted of little more than a glorified Excel spreadsheet and a fugazi portal that displayed demonstrably fake transactions. And yet, OneCoin attracted hundreds of millions of dollars more than Gnosis. The company seems to have targeted a global category of aspirational investors who noticed the breathless coverage and booming valuations of cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies, but weren’t savvy enough to understand the difference between the real thing and a sham. Left unchecked, this growing crypto-mania could be hugely destructive to one of the most promising technologies of the 21st century. * * * This danger exists in large part because grasping even the basics of blockchain technology remains daunting for non-specialists. In a nutshell, blockchains link together a global swarm of servers that hosts thousands of copies of the system’s transaction records. Server operators constantly monitor one another’s records, meaning that to steal money or otherwise alter the ledger, a hacker would have to compromise many machines across a vast network in one fell swoop. Even as the global banking system faces relentless cyberattacks, the more than $30 billion in value on Bitcoin’s blockchain has proven essentially immune to hacking.\n\nThat level of security has potential uses far beyond digital money. Introduced in July of 2015, a platform called Ethereum pioneered the idea of more complex and interactive applications backed by blockchain tech. Because these systems can’t be altered without the agreement of everyone involved, and maintain incorruptible records of every change, blockchains could eventually streamline sensitive, high-value networks ranging from health records to interbank transfers to remote file storage. Some have called the blockchain “Cloud Computing 3.0.” Using most of these blockchain applications will require owning the digital currencies linked to them—the same digital currencies being sold in all these ICOs. So, for example, to upload your vacation photos to the blockchain cloud-storage service Storj will cost a few Storj tokens. In the long term, demand for services will set the price of each blockchain project’s token. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, ICOs will present greater risks to larger numbers of people. While a traditional stock is a legal claim backed up by regulators and governments, then, the tokens sold in an ICO are deeply embedded in the blockchain software their sale helps create. Knowledgeable tech investors are excited by this because, along with the open-source nature of much of the software, it means that ICO-funded projects can, like Bitcoin itself, outlast any single founder or legal entity. In a 2016 blog post, Joel Monegro, of the venture capital fund Union Square Ventures, compared owning a blockchain-based asset to owning a piece of digital infrastructure as fundamental as the internet’s TCP/IP protocol. Almost all groups launching ICOs reiterate some version of this idea to potential buyers, in part as a kind of incantation to ward off financial regulators. The thinking is that, if they are selling part of a platform, rather than stakes in any company, they’re not subject to oversight by bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But in practice, ICOs are constantly traded across a variety of online marketplaces as buyers breathlessly track their fluctuating prices. In this light, they look an awful lot like speculative investments.\n\nBuyer expectations may matter more to regulators than technical hair-splitting. Todd Kornfeld, a securities specialist at the law firm Pepper Hamilton, finds precedent in the landmark 1946 case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. Howey, a Florida orange-growing operation, was selling grove plots and accompanying “service contracts” that paid faraway landowners based on the orange harvest’s success. When the SEC closed in, Howey argued they were selling real estate and services, not a security. But the Supreme Court ultimately disagreed, establishing what’s known as the Howey test: In essence, if you give someone else money in the hope that their activities will generate a profit on your behalf, you’ve just bought a security, no matter what the seller calls it. Knowledgeable observers tend to agree that some form of regulation is inevitable, and that the term ICO itself—so intentionally close to IPO—is a reckless red flag waved in the SEC’s face. The SEC declined to comment on any prospective moves to regulate ICOs, but the Ontario Securities Commission has issued an advisory that “assets that are tracked and traded as part of a distributed ledger may be securities, even if they do not represent shares of a company or ownership of an entity.” According to Kornfeld, even those who believe they are conducting ICOs in complete good faith could face serious repercussions when regulators do act, especially if prosecutors think they’ve made misleading statements. “If [prosecutors] think that you’re really bad,” he says. “They can say, hey, you deserve 20 years in jail.”\n\n* * * While it’s easy to see the lie in OneCoin’s fictional blockchain, entirely sincere claims about such a nascent sector still can strain the limits of mere optimism. Many experts, for instance, believe that Gnosis’s use of the blockchain to aggregate data could become a widespread backbone technology for managing complex systems from traffic to financial markets. But the $12.5 million worth of GNO sold in the Gnosis ICO represented only 5 percent of the tokens created for the project, implying a total market value of nearly $300 million. Most tech startups at similar stages are valued at under $5 million. That astronomical early valuation alone could become bait for an aggressive regulator. Many founders of legitimate blockchain projects have chosen to remain anonymous because of this fear, in turn creating more opportunities for scams. Much of the money flowing into these offerings is smart, both in that it comes from knowledgeable insiders, and in a more literal sense: Buying into ICOs almost always requires using either Bitcoin or Ethereum tokens (OneCoin, tellingly, accepted payment in standard currency). Jeff Garzik, a longtime Bitcoin developer who now helps organize ICOs through his company Bloq, thinks their momentum is largely driven by recently minted Bitcoin millionaires looking to diversify their gains. Many of these investors are able to do their own due diligence—evaluating a project’s team, examining demo versions of their software, or scrutinizing their blockchain after launch.']"
