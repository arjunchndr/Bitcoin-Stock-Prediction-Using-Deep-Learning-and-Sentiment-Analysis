At press time, the price had dropped slightly to $4,876.\n\nThe market capitalization of the number one cryptocurrency has now reached over $79.7 billion – also a new high – and a market share of 45.4 percent, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nElsewhere today, litecoin has also set a new all-time high of over $78, as has the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies, which now stands at over $175 billion.\n\nClimbing wall image via Shutterstock\n\n\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", ""Bitcoin prices topped $5,000 for the first time today, surpassing this key, psychological level and setting a fresh high.\n\nThe crypocurrency's price had risen to as much as $5,005.26 at the time of report, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). This brought its year-to-date (YTD) return to almost 420%.\n\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nBitcoin's price has pushed higher amid a variety of factors, including technological improvements, growing interest in cryptocurrencies and sustained inflows from investors.\n\nTechnical Upgrades\n\nBitcoin recently implemented Segregated Witness, an upgrade that will increase transaction capacity and help relieve some of the pressure that rising adoption has placed on the network.\n\nIn November, the digital currency will undergo a hard fork that will further increase its capacity for processing transactions.\n\nThis hard fork could split the network into two separate blockchains, and this move would result in three versions of Bitcoin: the two new Bitcoin blockchains and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nIn spite of this uncertainty, the price of Bitcoin has marched higher.\n\nA Growing Space\n\nWhile this digital asset undergoes these technical upgrades, the broader cryptocurrency space has been picking up steam.\n\nA growing number of organizations have been exploring the potential uses of these digital assets, and many companies have been holding initial coin offerings (ICOs), innovative token sales that organizations can use to raise funds.\n\nOutperformance\n\nAs cryptocurrencies have become known to a rising number of people, they have continued to draw money from investors, causing their total market capitalization (market cap) to rise to all-new highs.\n\nToday, this total market cap surpassed $179 billion for the first time, according to figures provided by CoinMarketCap. This measure of value has surged more than 900% this year, causing cryptocurrencies as a whole to outperform many other asset classes, including stocks and bonds.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThis has been a strong year for Bitcoin, which has surged more than 400% in value and hit a series of all-time highs.\n\nWill the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization be able to keep up this torrid growth?\n\nThe currency's potential market is vast, as there are billions of people online.\n\nIn November 2016, The Washington Post reported that 47% - or nearly half - of the world's population was using the internet.\n\nIf even a slim fraction of these people make use of Bitcoin, the digital currency's price could skyrocket.\n\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether."", 'In this article we will try to forecast the cryptocurrency market with the bitcoin as an example.\n\nTempting as it is to analyze several cryptocurrencies, the economic data, regrettably, are only available for one. Even Ethereum and Litecoin, though popular, have too short pricing histories for a reliable projection. So in what follows we limit ourselves to the bitcoin as the most popular cryptoasset (using the BTCUSD ticker, the bitcoin – USD exchange rate) and look at the way its price behaves from different angles.\n\nThe Bitcoin as an Exchange Asset – Wave Analysis of BTC/USD\n\nThere is no point to analyzing the BTCUSD price graph – it is a pure example of “to-the-moon”, only demonstrating how cryptocurrencies have been coming in vogue. An analysis of the graph of a log of BTCUSD is much more informative. The table contains data and graphs for the bitcoin-USD exchange rate in two periods:\n\nThe entire available history since 2011\n\nThe last interval of explosive growth since 01.01.15\n\nWe chose Quandl as our data supplier.\n\nThe data from 17.07.10 to 12.09.11 were taken from archives of the Mt-Gox exchange, after 12.09.11 we use quotations from BitStamp. 5 errors have been fixed and missing intervals 1-3 days long filled with arithmetic projections (all adjustments are shown in the table).\n\nThe big graph shows a 1st wave that ended on 08.06.11 (going with the classic wave theory of Elliott, Frost and Prechter ). It also shows a 3rd wave that ended on 30.11.13 and a period of much slower, logarithmically speaking, growth that continues.\n\nThis slow-growth phase may indicate that we are in a 5th wave, the last wave in the cycle soon to reach the end of its course.\n\nOnce the 5th wave is over, an inevitable correction will follow to terminate around the previous 4th wave (see the graph), which means a catastrophic plunge to somewhere around $150-$450 for 1 BTC (and definitely below $1163).\n\nAll that means that the current exponential growth of BTCUSD is going to lead to a major rebound, which might mean that the public will lose a good deal of interest in 1st generation cryptocurrencies or move on to easier and better scalable protocols than the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nUnlike the bleak general outlook for the bitcoin, its current growth is nowhere running out and promises glorious heights.\n\nThe small graph is a wave structure of a 5th wave that seems to have been rising since 14.01.15. According to this structure, we are in a 3rd wave inside a 5th wave inside an extended 5th wave. The 3rd wave (subwave) should run out before the end of the year in the $6000-$8000 per 1 BTC price range (crazy growth is making exact predictions difficult). It will be followed by a 4-5-5 correction and a finishing 5-5-5 wave. How high the next crest will be is going to depend on the depth of the preceding correction. For now all we know is that the highest point is in no event going to exceed $60 000.\n\nA structure with such a large extension in a 5th wave may seem unusual, but we have witness completely analogous wave dynamics in late fall-winter of 2014 for USDRUR when the ruble was free-falling. It then appeared as if the dollar would grow forever…\n\nSo why can we expect the bitcoin price to swell so before an enormous correction? The answer is easy: current capitalization of the bitcoin under $100 bln is nothing for the global scale, so even a cautious entry into BTC by funds may boost capitalization tenfold. On the other hand, because of volatility BTC will sit in fund portfolios as a risk asset, the first to go as sooner as there is any sign of an impending crisis.\n\nThis makes the bitcoin a poor candidate for a “safe heaven” asset; that role goes mostly to gold and, to a lesser extent, the yen and Swiss frank.\n\nAll in all, the bitcoin is suitable for short-term speculation, but one should keep in mind its huge volatility and a possible major deflation in the mid-term.\n\nThe Bitcoin as a Currency\n\nLet us now consider BTCUSD as a regular currency pair. We see that the swap rate for this pair on various exchanges is quoted at 18-180% of interest for 1-30 periods (here we ignore instant quotations, and there are hardly any quotations longer than a month on the market yet). The BTC in the pair enjoys a large percentile advantage.\n\nThese strange rates have to do with BTC loans that exchanges extend to short- players who want to bet on a fall of BTC. Nobody takes dollars at 100% interest at exchanges, even though BTC is growing faster. And no wonder – cheaper dollars can be gotten locally in any country, the same cannot be said for the BTC, whose market is international, somewhat transparent as far as exchange price dynamics are concerned and visible to all, except in cryptopyramids, of course.\n\nA currency with such a swap rate should lose its value over a long period of time, e.g. as we have seen, historically, on the USDRUR graph. But a looming fall does not mean there can be no lengthy perk-up periods with so-called carry trade. Or let us point to how the Italian lira showed strong vs. The German mark in 1996-1999, when the swap rate reached 11% annual. An even more immediate example is carry trade with USDRUR in 1999-2008 and 2016-2017 at higher interest rates (rates have decreased a bit, but the process continues).\n\nCarry trade cannot go on forever and when it stops, it is sudden. Just think of the enormous price increase of the yen for USDJPY in 1998-1999). In the bitcoin’s case one of the following can be expected to happen:\n\nThe bitcoin will greatly depreciate\n\nThe bitcoin rate will be zero or negative\n\nAll that is needed for one of these scenarios to come true is a civilized market of derivative instruments – forwards, futures, options, derivatives of interest rates. Such a market is already shaping up, and early in 2018 the first professional products from providers more trusted than today’s cryptoexchanges will make an appearance.\n\nFor instance, at a swap rate of 18% on BTCUSD, a very modest rate for the current market, a fair forward rate for the pair a month ahead will be some 1.5% below the going rate. In a situation like that month-long loans in BTC, prohibitively expensive at the moment, will start to make sense, and bitcoin holders’ hope that the currency is going to grow forever will start to crack.\n\nThe Bitcoin as an Energy-Intensive Trade Product\n\nNow let us imagine the bitcoin as an expensive asset to be traded – one that is quite common but requires an insane amount of energy to generate in a way useable for the public.\n\nA historical comparison: when metallic aluminum was discovered by Humphrey Davy in 1807, it cost much more than gold. In 1852 a kilo went for $1200. After Heroult and Hall in 1886 came up with a process to use electrolysis for industrial production of aluminum, the price dropped to $1 a kilo, and most of that was electricity cost. Then again, the 1900 dollar went far – silver then cost $15 a kilo. Things have changed much since then, aluminum costs $2 and silver costs $550, probably because electric power is so much cheaper to churn out.\n\nIf we consider the bitcoin as a sort of high-tech cryptoaluminum, whose self-cost depends on the amount of electricity spent, we will get a new angle on the cryptocurrencies and mining boom. Here is a useful article: http://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption\n\nDescription Value Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption* (TWh) 16.37 Annualized global mining revenues $4,029,787,569 Annualized estimated global mining costs $818,705,008 Country closest to Bitcoin in terms of electricity consumption Cuba Estimated electricity used over the previous day (KWh) 44,860,548 Implied Watts per GH/s 0.338 Break-even Watts per GH/s (based on 5 cents per KWh) 1.661 Electricity consumed per transaction (KWh) 176 Number of U.S. households that could be powered by Bitcoin 1,516,120 Number of U.S. households powered for 1 day by the electricity consumed for a single transaction 5.95 Bitcoin’s electricity consumption as a percentage of the world’s electricity consumption 0.08%\n\nThe same piece makes a comparison with the VISA payment system:\n\nDescription Value VISA annual consumption of energy (TWh) 0.54 Consumption of power per transaction (?Wh) 0.00651 Seconds a U.S. household can be powered by energy of 1 transaction 19 Number of VISA transactions possible for energy per 1 bitcoin transaction 26103\n\nWhat conclusions suggest themselves?\n\nCurrently the bitcoin accounts for over 0.07% of the world’s power consumption, all cryptocurrencies together account for 0.1%\n\nThe economy share the bitcoin or the bitcoin blockchain services is nowhere near as large (we cannot count the blockchain idea itself for development of other products with different consensus protocols)\n\nThe much more common VISA system consumes 1/27 th of the power the bitcoin needs\n\nof the power the bitcoin needs One VISA transaction is 26 000 times less energy-intensive\n\nWe already know that the maximum bitcoin capacity, sans SegWit and other modifications, is around 150 000 transactions a day, or about 2 transactions a second. For comparison, the VISA system can handle up to 56 000 transactions a second.\n\nSo what is this insane amount of electric power, already more than many countries consume, goes to? Maintaining security in the decentralized network that supports the bitcoin blockchain. In 2010 Satoshi Nakamoto came up with an elegant solution to the “Byzantine generals” problem – consensus would be secured by a Proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. This solution demands massive calculations which serve no further purpose once they are known to be correct. Continued calculations just serve to increase entropy (heat). In this connection it might make sense to start producing high-tech “cryptoradiators” that will efficiently warm up apartments and buildings as well as mine.\n\nThe power also goes towards the bitcoin blockchain’s pseudo-anonymity. Is that really worth a loss of capacity to 1/30 000 of VISA’s (without SegWit and Lightning Network) or to 1/1000 with them? Bitcoin owners can decide for themselves, but there is no magic – the numbers above incline us to believe in potential for lowered VISA commissions and a likely change along those lines rather than in bitcoin transactions getting cheaper. In fact, bitcoin payment commissions may well grow.\n\nThe logical conclusion is that the bitcoin blockchain is a reliable, cracker-proof system for expensive operations with equally expensive assets. It is handy for sending an ounce of gold or buying real estate, but hardly for ordering pizza or day-to-day expenses. All this pushes the bitcoin towards a role as a payment medium only for high-end assets.\n\nLet us sum up possibilities for bitcoin use and its rate growth.\n\nThe share of the global economy serviced by the bitcoin and its blockchain will grow faster than consumption of energy required for its upkeep. In this case the bitcoin price will continue to grow, but the currency will become an elite medium for expensive transactions, to service some capital-intensive segments (shares, real estate, precious metals etc.\n\nThe bitcoin economy will slow down for objective reasons. Then the world may give up on 1 st -generation cryptocurrencies that use the PoW consensus protocol, and their price will drop, perhaps to nothing.\n\n-generation cryptocurrencies that use the PoW consensus protocol, and their price will drop, perhaps to nothing. The bitcoin economy will shrink to fit the market share where power is wasted – “smart” “cryptoradators,” smartphones, most of whose computing power is wasted anyway, and so on. Then the coin and the chain will serve this market share with this kind of derived power, and the bitcoin will become much cheaper.\n\nIn the last few years several less energy-expensive consensus protocols have been suggested:\n\nPoS (Proof-of-Stake)\n\nIts modifications (DPoS, PoA=PoS+PoW – Proof-of-Activity)\n\nPoC, PoB – Proof of capacity and of burn\n\nNew ideas from industry leaders (PoET – Proof of elapsed time)\n\nMany others, even more obscure\n\nWe are not going to discuss these protocols in this article but only say that their limitations include a lack of studies of their ability to resist community attacks , security of deployment software, there are other programming and mathematics-related issues. But given the size of the pool of qualified programmers involved in cryptoeconomics today, crypto- and mathematical auditing of these and future protocols will take months, not years or decades .\n\nOne protocol deserves a special mention here – the Intel-developed PoET (Proof of elapsed time). It is used by the blockchain consortium Hyperledger fabric (IBM, Intel, Linux Foundation, many respected experts and, as usual, many are Chinese). The protocol is lite enough compared to the bitcoin blockchain’s PoW, consumes little energy and latest Intel hardware supports it.\n\n1350 transactions per second is not VISA, of course, but much better than the bitcoin. The Hyperledger fabric project only left beta-testing in June of 2017, so the promise is there.\n\nGoldMint and PoS-based Protocol as a Rational Alternative\n\nConsidering the above, we can recommend a new Russian cryptoproject – GoldMint.\n\nIt involves emission of two tokens – GOLD (unlimited and tied to the cost of the gold ounce) and MINT (10 000 000 tokens, owners confirm transactions in GOLD using a PoS-based protocol). In addition, owners of MNT tokens get 75% of income from GOLD transactions as a reward for confirming them (the number of GOLD transactions they can confirm is tied to the number of MINT tokens they own.\n\nThis arrangement, on one hand, guarantees constant growth of MINT as a money-making asset and on the other makes this income active, since owners have to vote on transaction confirmations. This is better than “pseudo-dividend” plans with passive income, where SEC control puts the lucrative U.S. market out of reach.\n\nWe will discuss cryptoassets that tokenize real assets in the next article.', 'Following shipment and setup, and in conjunction with the Company\'s current rigs in operation, MGT\'s Bitcoin mining operations are expected to generate approximate $1.4 million in monthly revenue, assuming current pricing and difficulty rates.

While Bitcoin (BTC) markets have shaken off uncertainty, commentator Oleg Andreev has conversely suggested the hard fork is a “FUD project” hampering Bitcoin prices.\n\n“We would like to honor the agreement that we subscribed to (as one of the first movers, unbeknownst to the fact that most developers would not enter the agreement),” Bitwala had written in a blog post on SegWit2x late August."", 'Earlier this summer, as reported by CCN, BTC-e’s domain was seized by authorities, shortly after a Russian national named Alexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece for alleged money laundering violations. At the time it was believed he was a BTC-e admin, but the exchange’s Bitcointalk account soon stated he was never an employee there, and started to post a series of updates on the situation. It was also revealed that the exchange had been fined for $110 million.\n\nThe admin behind BTC-e’s Bticointalk account soon revealed the exchange has control over 55% of user funds, and that it was going to reimburse users using Bitfinex-like tokens. The exchange’s latest update pointed to a relaunch in September, and to daily updates.\n\nNow, the exchange recently tweeted out that it’s back online, on the https://btc-e.nz/ domain.\n\nAccording to reports, users from various parts of the world, including the U.S., are seemingly unable to access the new domain. For now, users are apparently only able to check their account balances and post messages on the exchange’s chat box.\n\nAt press time, BTC-e’s page has an update telling users to review their security settings as, since data has been seized, there’s a risk it has been compromised. The exchange advises users to not only get a new password, but also to change their two-factor authentication key, and to review the list of IPs used to access their accounts. At press time, accounting to the website’s statistics, there are 2895 users logged on to BTC-e.\n\nRecently, the exchange also published a roadmap through its Bitcointalk account, that details how its service will be relaunched.\n\nBTC-E’s Bitcoin Exchange Relaunch\n\nAccording to the update, BTC-e will relaunch its service in three different stages. In the first one, it will transfer user information to a new unnamed company, in “full compliance with the European directives on personal data and in compliance with European legislation in this field.” The transfer is to be completed by September 15.\n\nThe second stage will involve a previously mentioned unnamed financial investment firm to restructure the exchange’s digital assets, and begin registering the transferred user data. Finally, in the third stage, the financial investment firm will “audit and register personal data in accordance with AML laws and KYC identification procedures.”\n\nThe admin behind BTC-e’s account went on to add that users will be given the chance to “check the integrity of the digital balance” in their accounts, and to change their security settings. Per its deadline, users are now able to login and check their balance (it was schedule to “before 02.09.2017”)\n\nA support team will also be available to help out users. The admin stated:\n\n“The helpdesk system will be operated by the licensed financial company after the start of the digital data transfer procedure.

Bitcoin has been on a strong bull run since its bottom in the $1800s and, despite many technical indicators, has pushed to new highs, week after week. With the international uncertainty surrounding the North Korean conflict and the recent news of Dalia Blass’s recent hire at the SEC, there is plenty of bullish news to fuel the push. However, the current BTC-USD all-time high resides in the lower $4800s, which many market analysts say is the local top of this run.\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Recent Bull Fibonacci Extension\n\nTypical Fibonacci Extensions are 127% and 160% of the total length of the bull run. $2600 (0% retracement value shown above) marks the breakout point of the current bull market BTC-USD is experiencing. There have been 4 attempts made to break the $4480 values (100% retracement value shown above). Due to the prolonged effort to break these values, we can make the argument that $4480s are the local top values; any values that breach beyond the $4480s are extensions of the bull run.\n\nA week ago, BTC-USD made a test of the lower $3600s in a move that would ultimately bounce and push us to our current all time high. However, the move from the local bottom to the $4800s is currently forming a reversal pattern called a “Rising Wedge.” Although a Rising Wedge has a relatively high rate of failure, it is still something BTC-USD traders should keep an eye on:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Rising Wedge\n\nThe Rising Wedge is characterized by higher highs and higher lows that converge about an ascending value. For anyone trading reversal patterns, it is paramount to confirm the breakout before entering a position. In low confidence patterns like Rising Wedges, we must wait for a breakout below the wedge and for strong trading volumes to increase the likelihood of success. Some evidence that points toward a possible reversal is the RSI and MACD divergence.\n\nDivergence is essentially an indication that there is potential bullish momentum loss in the market. It’s important to note that bearish divergence does not guarantee a market reversal and it does not mean the market will pullback. The only thing we are permitted to take away from bearish divergence is the argument that the market has an increased probability of either consolidation or a market pullback. In strong bull markets, bearish divergence can be seen for hours, days and even weeks.\n\nShould the Rising Wedge break to the bottom, we can calculate the expected price move as follows:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Rising Wedge Price Target\n\nIn our case, should the Rising Wedge break to the bottom, we can expect an approximate $500 move downward. However, should the pattern fail to break to the bottom, we can expect a price upward to test the 127% Fibonacci Extension values around $5000 before encountering any significant resistance.\n\nSummary:\n\nGlobal uncertainty surrounding North Korea’s aggression plus ETF optimism give further evidence to support a continued bullish market. A potential Rising Wedge could potentially cause a $500 BTC-USD market retracement. The pattern has yet to be confirmed. Should the Rising Wedge fail to break to the bottom, we can expect a further push toward the 127% Fibonacci Extension values of $5000.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

09/02/2017,"['The price of the world’s best known digital currency briefly crossed the $5,000 mark on a major index for the first time on Friday evening ET, before retreating about 5% in subsequent hours.\n\nThe idea of Bitcoin breaking the symbolic milestone of $5,000 would have been unthinkable to most people at the start 2017, when the price topped $1,000 for the first time. If you’re keeping track, the digital currency is up 500% this year, and nearly 2200% since mid-2015, when it was in the doldrums at around $220.\n\nThere appears to be no single reason for the recent run-up. Instead, it can likely be explained by the same factors driving this year’s cryptocurrency bull run: Publicity-driven speculation; New financial products creating unprecedented liquidity; Trading surges in Asian markets; Institutional investors treating digital currency as a permanent new asset class.\n\nMeanwhile, the $5,000 milestone is likely to trigger a new round of chatter that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in a bubble and vulnerable to a major price collapse. Bitcoin has experienced a series of spectacular crashes in the past (most recently in 2014 when it dropped around 75%) but has always recovered.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that Bitcoin crossed $5,000 on an index used by the trade publication Coindesk, but not by other major indexes. This is significant because Coindesk’s BPI index includes prices from several Asian exchanges, where prices are typically higher than US or European one. Here’s a screenshot showing the milestone (the time shown is GMT):\n\nCoindesk\n\nA more conservative price estimate can be found on an index created by the Winkelvoss twins, are among the world’s biggest holders of Bitcoin. Known as the Winkdex, the index only draws data from U.S.-dollar denominated exchanges. As you can see, the index’s calculation shows how Bitcoin prices approached the $5,000 mark, but did not break it:\n\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency to achieve new highs this week. Ethereum nearly crossed the $400 mark for the first time while another smaller rival, Litecoin, briefly broke through the $90 mark.\n\nAs of Saturday late morning ET, Bitcoin was trading between $4,500 and $4,600.\n\nThis is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance.

Currently, BTC/USD is correcting, but likely to resume its uptrend above $4800 in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Price Crucial Support\n\nIn the last weekly analysis, we discussed the chances of Bitcoin price moving above $4500 against the US Dollar. The price did trade higher and not only broke the $4500 level, but traded close to the $5000 handle. A high was formed at $4966 from where the price started a correction. The price traded below the $4800 and $4700 support levels. However, the downside move was protected by $4460. The mentioned $4460 was a resistance earlier and now stopping losses.\n\nMoreover, a major bullish trend line with support at $4460 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD also prevented declines. The price is currently recovering and already moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $4966 high to $4455 low. It seems like a short-term correction wave is over at $4460. The price might now test the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $4966 high to $4455 low. However, it could face sellers near $4700 in the near term.\n\nOn the upside, there is a connecting resistance trend line with current resistance at $5020. Therefore, if the price continues to move higher, there could be a break above $5000.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is slightly in the bullish zone.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently around the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $4460\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $4700\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

He’s written a dozen books on technology and sees one that could change everything around us. He’s not the only believer. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 20 percent in the past year, Bitcoin, a digital currency, is up more than 700 percent, with a total value of near $80 billion. That’s more than American Express. The surge has people wondering whether Bitcoin is in a bubble.\n\nFor Tapscott, that question is missing the real story.', 'Recent developments lead many to Bitcoin mining and investing in Bitcoin as many tend to believe that it is a great start for investment. Regulators and tax specialists are now looking into cryptocurrencies and how they should be treated when it comes to income taxation.\n\nSince there are currently no set guidelines and procedures as to how cryptocurrencies are being taxed, the recent split of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash has caused many investors to wonder whether profits from Bitcoin Cash will be considered “free cash” in the eyes of the taxman.\n\nA recent report from WSJ explored the question and by the looks of it, it’s still a draw.\n\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency or what people describe as digital cash. It is a centralized ledger and is accessible by all parties involved from any parts of the world. The specifics of Bitcoin Cash is that the BCH is a new cryptocurrency initiated by miners and Blockchain developers in responses to scaling issues.\n\nIn Bitcoin network, the verification process usually takes up to 10 to 15 minutes or even longer - a lot when you compare it to debit cards. Such slow process and often network congestion lead the developers and miners to the idea that the more people are making transactions at the same time, the more its network scalability and speed will be challenged.\n\nThe mining pools agreed to integrate the technology with SegWit or the Segregated Witness.\n\nSegWit2x makes the signature and verification data even smaller. SegWit2x, however, does not fix the problem completely.\n\nIn August, miners and developers initiated a hard fork which resulted in ‘split’ and born of a new currency called Bitcoin Cash. The latest version is claimed to have faster verification process and upgrades the blocks up to 8mb.\n\nIRS on taxing Bitcoin Cash\n\nNow, those who have been holding Bitcoin before the fork happened have received Bitcoin Cash equivalent to the number of Bitcoin in their wallet especially for wallets and exchanges that supported the split.\n\nWhile there are currently no existing guidelines as to how Bitcoin (and now Bitcoin Cash) are treated regarding taxation, according to Bitcoin.tax, what\'s clear with the situation is that there are applicable income taxes whenever you sell either or both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash holdings.\n\nWhile many Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash may think it’s “free money,” hence not necessarily taxable, the IRS thinks otherwise. Several Reddit users chimed in the issue, with one user clarifying:\n\n""The IRS has already stated that Bitcoin is treated like property. Mining is considered income. Hodling is the same as owning gold. A $0 cost basis means that you got capital for free, and if you sell it 100 percent is gains.""\n\nThe treatment for cryptocurrencies can be at zero cost. If the owner sells his Bitcoin Cash and receives the 100 percent profit as capital gains income, it will be taxable.\n\nThus, the declaration should be a normal income as part of his capital gains in 1040 Schedule D. A Bitcoin Cash owner can opt to report his BCH as income and pay the tax amount required.\n\nAccording to 2014-21 Notice of IRS:\n\n""Virtual currency is treated as property for US federal tax purposes.""\n\nThe principle for the General Tax for properties is also applicable to the transactions in virtual currencies.\n\nFor IRS, Bitcoin is a capital asset which is also subject to short term capital gains if sold for less than twelve months or long-term capital gains if sold within a year. IRS applies the 15 percent to 20 percent tax rates as based on income. The fair market value will be the price.\n\nWith sophisticated systems in place by the IRS, US investors, in particular, are recommended to check with their accountants and tax specializing in their specific state regulations in order to ascertain their compliance with their specific federal and state taxes and avoid getting in trouble with the taxman.', 'This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material.

The company is based in San Francisco, California.\n\n""Ripple"" is just the rename of Opencoin. The Ripple Blockchain focuses on banks, global payments, and digital exchange.\n\nPossible entry to Chinese market?\n\nChina\'s has a huge network or connectivity when it comes to business and consumers. It is tempting for Ripple to get involved with the Chinese market because it will be a big hit to the company.\n\nChina aims to widen its connection in the global trade market and the firm growth of China\'s existence across ecommerce will substantially require low transaction fees, cheap and fast flow of payment system. China is known to follow strict regulations and security when it comes to banking and financial transactions. In fact, recent warnings about unregulated ICOs caused certain companies catering mainly to Chinese investors to halt their operations.\n\nRipple\'s business services revolve around bank-to-bank transfers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expects the company to enter consumer market in 5 years.\n\nHow they both will benefit\n\nRipple has already confirmed the expansion of its business with China\'s Central bank. China is now researching on digital currency and the possibility of having its cryptocurrency.\n\nThe fintech company and the China\'s Central Bank officials are having talks about the public Blockchain platform RCL or what they call Ripple Consensus Ledger.\n\nThe delegation is to promote financial tech between China and the United States. Ripple had a presentation with the officials specifically on the nature of the public Blockchain, global payment ecosystem, and how they will benefit in applying the principle of Blockchain platform- its offer of low service fees, and fast pace of real-time transactions.\n\nThough there is no official announcement yet about the expanding business of China Central Bank and Ripple, people are looking forward to the great news and collaboration of the two entities ahead.', 'On July 27th, the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations held a hearing of the full committee to markup several pieces of legislation, including S.1662, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2018. News reports indicate that, during that hearing, the Senate appropriations committee approved an amendment which would reduce the ability of federal-level law enforcement agencies to interfere with state laws on the medicinal use of marijuana. This amendment comes at a time during which the nascent medical marijuana industry looks as though it’s turning to cryptocurrency in response to the questionable legal status of medical marijuana businesses.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) proposed the amendment to allow states to implement medical marijuana laws. The amendment would ensure that none of the funds made available through the appropriations act would be used to prevent any of 46 of the 50 United States from implementing any law authorizing the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana. The amendment does not include the states of Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska or South Dakota, but it does include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.\n\nAn article on the medical marijuana amendment published by Congressional blog TheHill quotes Leahy as saying:\n\n“The federal government can’t investigate everything and shouldn’t, and I don’t want them pursuing medical marijuana patients who are following state law… We have more important things for the Department of Justice to do than tracking down doctors or epileptics using medical marijuana legally in their state.”\n\nA press release issued in early August by financial news and publishing company NetworkNewsWire reflects the positive response of the medical marijuana industry to the news of the amendment to the 2018 Commerce appropriations bill. The press release discusses the business activities of medical marijuana firms across the world and cites to polls conducted by both Gallup and CBS News which reflects the changing views of the American public on the legality of marijuana, a sentiment which has become more positive as more states move to legalize either the recreational or the medicinal use of marijuana.\n\nOne of the companies cited by the NetworkNewsWire press release as being an innovator in the field of marijuana payments is SinglePoint Inc., a full-service mobile technology provider headquartered in Phoenix, AZ, which also operates a cannabis dispensary hub subsidiary known as SingleSeed. SinglePoint reportedly closed upon a $1 million promissory note with an institutional investor this June and plans to invest the proceeds into the development of a bitcoin solution to conduct non-cash transactions for marijuana products. Bitcoin transaction solutions are also being developed by ChineseInvestors.com Inc., a Chinese-language financial information firm with an increasing presence in the global marijuana industry.\n\nBitcoin payments for marijuana and related products seem to be developing in response to an industry-wide issue regarding the bankability of marijuana business activities caused by tensions between state and federal level laws on the subject. Even as states increasingly vote for the legalization of marijuana, the plant is still considered a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) which is enforced by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The tenuous legality of marijuana at the federal level has led to the growth of an industry in which many businesses have to sit on cash without being able to open business accounts with banking institutions which have been concerned with their federal-level legal liability if they accept deposits from marijuana businesses.\n\nThe concerns of financial institutions over federal regulations on marijuana don’t seem to be unfounded given the effects of the CSA and marijuana’s Schedule I status on intellectual property owners in the space. The uncertain status of federal registrations for marijuana trademarks is the result of the confluence of the CSA along with 37 CFR 2.69, the statute governing trademarks sought on the sale or transportation of any product which is regulated by an act of Congress. No such regulatory restrictions seem to affect the patenting of medical marijuana-related technologies, however. Through this January, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued dozens of patents, and published almost as many patent applications, on medical marijuana technologies, including a patent covering a controlled-release chewing gum containing cannabinoids developed by AXIM Biotech.\n\nIncreasingly, bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies are becoming the choice for most financial transactions within the nascent marijuana industry as the sector increases in value. North American marijuana sales reached $6.7 billion during 2016 and were expected to rise up to $20.2 billion annually by the year 2021. This June, Bloomberg published an article discussing how SinglePoint and Seattle, WA-based cannabis point-of-sale firm POSaBIT were utilizing bitcoin strategies to conduct transactions for cannabis products while taking steps to comply with federal and state regulations.\n\nFor marijuana and other industries that may face regulatory risks which could impede their ability to conduct business, bitcoin offers various benefits. A blog post published by payment processing company Bankcard Brokers discusses bitcoin’s anonymity and availability to high risk industries, as well as the fact that bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed except by the party receiving the bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin can be exchanged into a variety of other cryptocurrencies and one such cryptocurrency is designed specifically for the cannabis industry. PotCoin is seeking to position itself as the standard form of cryptocurrency payment for transactions in the legalized marijuana industry. PotCoin has proven to be a volatile investment, seeing a 23 percent dip this March in response to news that PotCoin sponsored a recent trip by Dennis Rodman to North Korea; this major decline came one day after PotCoin’s value increased by a dramatic 97 percent. Other types of cryptocurrencies being developed for the marijuana industry include CannabisCoin and WeedCoin.\n\nBitcoin’s status as a decentralized system for financial transactions stands in some contrast to the current activities being undertaken by a variety of entities seeking patents in the sector. A recent article published by CoinDesk notes that the USPTO published 390 patent applications related to blockchain tech, the underlying distributed ledger technology supporting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, between January and July of this year. That represented a 90 percent increase over the number of blockchain-related patent applications published during the same period in 2016. A recent U.S. patent application filed by bitcoin exchange company Coinbase discusses an innovative security system for digital assets such as bitcoin. This March, Reuters reported that the man claiming to be bitcoin’s creator has filed more than 70 patent applications in the UK to protect blockchain-related tech like medical document storage and WiFi security systems.', '']"
09/03/2017,"['It is difficult to look at bitcoin\'s heady price now without wishing that you had invested in the crypto-currency years ago - or even just a few months back.\n\nBitcoin\'s price surge is nothing short of astounding. A mere US$100 (S$136 ) investment made seven years ago would have turned you into a multimillionaire by now.\n\nEven buying bitcoin six months ago when it shot past the value of one ounce of gold for the first time - hitting US$1,268 per coin - an investor would have quadrupled his money by now. And its gains have rocketed even faster in recent weeks, enabling it to touch an all-time high of US$4,627.\n\nSo what exactly is causing this spectacular price jump?\n\nBefore we delve further into the subject, an explanation of bitcoin: It is a digital currency, not backed by any government or tangible assets such as gold, and it is used to make payment for goods and services online to those willing to accept it as a mode of payment.\n\nIt was conceived as a ""peer-to-peer cash"" system in 2008, by an anonymous hacker who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto, as a means to allow people to do business directly without the need to use an outside institution such as a bank to facilitate payments.\n\n\n\nMany tech start-ups are seeking to raise capital through what have been dubbed initial coin offerings (ICOs), where they issue “tokens” in the form of bitcoin or other virtual currencies. This growing wave of ICOs is built like a house of cards. Take one card out, and the rest of the house could topple, burying the start-ups that have built their dreams on it. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n\n\nAnd because it is seen as being free from government control and the fees that banks charge, it quickly became very popular among people using it to do anonymous transactions - especially those involving illicit trades such as drug-dealing.\n\nThat said, bitcoin would have been confined to the arcane corners of the world\'s financial markets if it had not been for the proliferation of the technology that led to its creation in the first place - the blockchain.\n\nLet me explain: The blockchain is essentially an online ledger keeping a record of events such as messages and transactions.\n\nBut unlike most data, which has to be kept in a physical location or a computer server, a blockchain is stored and maintained by a network of users. New transactions cannot clear the books without achieving a critical mass of third-party acceptances.\n\nThis makes the system impervious to fraud, as any changes to the database must be verified by all of its users.\n\nIf you listen to advocates of the blockchain, it would seem to be the most significant invention since the birth of the Internet.\n\nEntrepreneurs are finding more and more uses for it - such as drawing up legal contracts or conducting elections safely online - to name a few possibilities.\n\nThis potential that investors are seeing in the blockchain is what is propelling bitcoin to sky-high levels in price.\n\nTypically, start-ups would have raised money by seeking investments from venture capitalists or crowdfunding websites, but blockchain start-ups are shunning this route in favour of a new phenomenon known as the ""initial coin offering"" (ICO).\n\nFor these complex arrangements, start-ups do not issue new shares in exchange for fresh capital. Instead, they issue their own ""tokens"" - online assets that are similar to bitcoin and that are created with the same blockchain technology on which it operates.\n\nThe tokens don\'t work quite like shares or bonds, as they do not offer their buyers any voting rights or repayment for the money forked out. As with shares, however, their value is dependent on the success of whatever the issuer does with the money.\n\nUnited States cable TV station CNBC estimated that, in April, ICOs had raised under US$100 million. The figure more than doubled to US$250 million in the following month. By June, it had hit US$550 million. It had almost trebled to US$1.3 trillion as at the end of July.\n\nThat might seem like a vast sum. But most of the time, the investors aren\'t really buying into the projects with hard cash. They are using - you can guess it - bitcoins and other virtual currencies to make payment and, when they cash out, they are getting the same virtual currencies for the proceeds.\n\nOne theory says it is this swathe of transactions that is helping to drive up the price of bitcoin itself as demand for it among investors surges with the proliferation of ICOs and it becomes the reserve crypto-currency for the rest of these offshoot blockchain projects.\n\nWhat is more, existing bitcoin owners could be using their already inflated assets to invest vast amounts of their paper wealth in all these highly speculative ICOs, with little real money changing hands.\n\nThat then is the situation in which the US$90 billion crypto-currency market finds itself, as the irrational exuberance, sweeping over blockchain start-ups, threatens to inflate a big bubble in the price of bitcoin and other virtual currencies.\n\nNow, you might think this has nothing to do with Singapore, but the prevalence of financial technology start-ups here means that ICOs have taken root in the Republic as well.\n\nAs a gauge of how hot ICOs can be among investors, the co-founder of one robo-adviser here told me he spent months talking to hundreds of investors before he could get funding for his project. Yet, a Hong Kong rival was able to raise US$30 million in a day through an ICO.\n\nBut the potential for grief in ICOs was serious enough for the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Commercial Affairs Department to issue a joint statement last month to warn consumers to be mindful of the potential risks of digital tokens and virtual currency-related investment schemes.\n\nThere have been more than 100 police reports relating to such investments since 2015.\n\nIn his latest book , The Curse Of Cash, economist Kenneth Rogoff notes that it is quite naive to believe that bitcoin can replace the US dollar any time soon.\n\nHe writes: ""As currency innovators have learnt, it is hard to stay on top of the government indefinitely in a game where the latter can keep adjusting the rules until it wins.""\n\nGovernments worldwide are likely to regulate crypto-currencies more aggressively.\n\nFor me, one big issue is what happens if there is a run on bitcoin for whatever reason, causing it to crash from its current sky-high levels.\n\nAt least, in the case of a currency backed by a government, there would be a central bank to help organise a bailout and act as ""lender of last resort"". In the case of bitcoin, the state would not be riding to the rescue.\n\nThe current euphoria over ICOs is built like a house of cards. Take one card out - for instance, if there is a sudden big drop in bitcoin\'s price - and the rest of the house could topple, burying the start-ups that have built their dreams on it.\n\nThe bitcoin party could continue for a while yet, but what happens when the party ends, as all parties do eventually? It is a question that investors should seriously ask themselves.', 'Makers of the world’s most advanced graphics cards — the hardware that lets gamers experience photorealistic action and immersive virtual reality — have had a hell of a year. In August, market leader Nvidia announced a 56% rise in year-over-year revenue. Competitor AMD’s revenue saw an 18% rise over the same period.\n\nBut neither company has been eager to crow about what’s driving all that growth, and investors haven’t exactly been overjoyed about it.\n\nWhy? The answer is one word long: Bitcoin.\n\nActually, it’s a little longer than that. Graphics cards (also known as GPUs) were once used to ‘mine’ Bitcoin, or solve the cryptographic riddles that effectively secure billions of dollars worth of virtual currency in exchange for digital cash. That’s no longer true, with Bitcoin now mostly mined using a more specialized chipset known as an ASIC — and on an increasingly industrial scale.\n\nBut, as Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed this year, dozens of lesser-known cryptocurrencies have also become more and more valuable. And those blockchains – including Litecoin, Monero, and, especially, Ethereum – can still be profitably mined by part-timers using off-the-shelf graphics cards. In locales with cheap electricity, a single card can generate roughly a hundred dollars in profits per month.\n\nThat has led to huge demand for graphics cards. Nvidia said it made around $150 million last quarter off miners. Analysts speaking to CoinDesk estimated that a sizable proportion of AMD’s revenue is also now coming from miners.\n\nOn the consumer side, prices for graphics cards have surged, frustrating consumers who want to use them as intended – for playing games.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nBut investors haven’t been eager to pile into the stocks, precisely because of their dependence on cryptocurrency. Despite the rising value of Bitcoin and others, the space is still very speculative, with actual working applications for blockchain tech relatively rare.\n\nTo put the risk in perspective, CoinDesk looked back to 2013, when the bottom dropped out of Bitcoin’s price. Miners, still using GPUs at the time, quickly dumped their hardware on eBay. AMD’s sales slumped drastically in the following year, before slowly recovering in 2015.\n\nThough the cryptocurrency ecosystem is much more robust today than it was in 2013, the bubble could certainly pop again, making mining unprofitable and putting chipmakers against a wall. An even clearer mid-term risk is that Ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency, is trying to move away from hardware-dependent security.\n\nBut there’s potential upside, too. If and when cryptocurrency becomes truly widely adopted, AMD and Nvidia may have lucked into a large new market. The potential is suggested by a thriving traffic in guides and tools to help new would-be miners set up rigs in their bedrooms, calculate their potential profits, and manage their digital assets.\n\nWhen exactly to fully embrace that market, at the risk of appearing too bubble-dependent, will be a tricky question for GPU makers.', 'Fintech firm Stargroup has signed a joint-venture agreement with fellow Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)-listed company Digital X to provide a ""two-way"" ATM solution for buying and selling bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Stargroup, there are currently only 20 ATMs in the country that can facilitate bitcoin transactions; however, conversion fees are in the range of 4 to 8 percent of the transaction value. Additionally, the vast majority are ""one-way"" ATMs, which means users can only purchase bitcoin and add it to their bitcoin wallet.\n\nTwo-way ATMs will allow users to both acquire bitcoin and instantly convert their bitcoin into Australian dollars so they can withdraw cash from the ATM, the companies explained.\n\nUnder the agreement, Stargroup will be developing the ATM software to process the two-way transaction, while Digital X will be charged with developing an API to facilitate the transactions. The Perth-based companies will share the transaction fees charged at the ATM.\n\nAccording to a statement released to the ASX on Monday, the process for bitcoin users looking to cash out their money can currently take a number of days using online digital currency exchanges.\n\nStargroup operates approximately 500 ATMs in Australia and manages another 2,400 ATMs via its wholly owned subsidiary StarLink. As Digital X has developed a secure ledger system based on blockchain technology, the two companies expect to roll out the two-way ATM offering across Stargroup\'s entire Australian remit.\n\nStargroup also has a direct ownership interest in NeoICP Korea Inc, a private South Korean company that manufactures ATMs, back-office, coin counting, banking, and casino settlement solutions. NeoICP Korea has approximately 16,000 ATMs and back-office machines in South Korea.\n\nIn June, Melbourne-based Blockchain Global made a AU$4.35 million investment in Digital X, paying AU$300,000 of the total by way of a convertible loan in bitcoin. The investment sees Blockchain Global hold a 40 percent stake -- approximately 1.6 million shares -- in Digital X.\n\nBlockchain Global scooped up Digital X\'s Digital X Direct liquidity desk customers in February, onboarding them onto its own bitcoin exchange platform, ACX.io.\n\nACX.io was touted at the time by Blockchain Global\'s CEO Sam Lee as Australia\'s largest bitcoin exchange by volume and order book, claiming 60 percent of the bitcoin market trade volume in the country.\n\nAs part of the deal, Blockchain Global took over the management of Digital X Direct\'s clients, leaving Digital X to reap 50 percent of the revenue over a five-year term from new customers introduced to the ACX.io exchange as a result.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2017, Digital X said it generated revenues of approximately AU$11,000 related to Blockchain Global\'s referral fees, and AU$2,000 from foreign exchange fees.\n\nDigital X became listed on the ASX after performing a reverse takeover of investment firm Macro Energy three years ago. Digital X only emerged in October 2015 after DigitalBTC -- trading as Digital CC -- underwent a name change and shift in business model.\n\nAfter rebranding, Digital X announced its focus would be on its app-based cash remittance product AirPocket, saying at the time that the new name and direction represented a strategic change from a focus on bitcoin as a mechanism in order to store value, to a focus on software development.\n\nIn April, Digital X entered into a partnership with fellow Perth-based software development firm Lateral Pty Ltd to create blockchain and distributed ledger-based products for large enterprises across Australia and several targeted regions in Asia.\n\nFor the first half of the 2017 financial year, Digital X posted an operating loss of $1.06 million, taking a $591,000 hit in the second quarter.\n\nStargroup reported a statutory loss of AU$1.5 million for the six months to December 31, 2016, on revenue of AU$4 million.', '', 'Bitcoin cash price is slowly recovering above $580 against the US Dollar.

BCH/USD has to settle above $620-650 to maintain bullish bias.\n\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance\n\nRecently, there was a decent upside move above $630 level in Bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded as high as $676 before facing sellers and starting a correction. The price declined and traded towards a bullish trend line with support at $580 on the hourly chart. Later, it consolidated for some time above the $580 level before starting an upside move.\n\nHowever, the upside move was protected by a bearish trend line at $640. The current resistance now stands near $620. On the upside the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $676 high to $575 low also acted as a barrier. It seems like a contracting triangle pattern with resistance near $620 forming on the hourly chart of BCH/USD. As long as the price is above $580, there is a chance of BCH breaking the $620-630 resistance area in the near term.\n\nBuyers need to make sure there is no close below $580 else there can be more declines. Buying dips can be considered in the near term with stop below $575. On the upside, a break and close above the $620 level is needed for the price to gain further.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is heading lower towards the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $580\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $620\n\nCharts courtesy – Trading View, Kraken\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Cox, Associate Advisor at Nestlerode & Loy, Inc.\n\nIn a world where we can control just about anything with our cell phones, virtual money is becoming more popular. It started with putting our store loyalty cards in our phones to create a virtual keychain. Now we are entering in our credit and debit card numbers so we can wave our phones in front of the card reader and not have to pull out our wallets.\n\nWell, the next new way to pay is here: virtual currency.\n\nVirtual currency is a type of unregulated, digital money which is issued and usually controlled by its developers. It is used and accepted among members of a virtual community.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of virtual currency, maybe you’ve heard of Bitcoin? Its surge in value has put it in the news recently. Bitcoin is a virtual currency created in 2009. The ideas were set out in a white paper by Satoshi Makamoto, a pseudonym for whom an identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin promises lower transaction fees than traditional online payment methods and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies.\n\nYou may have seen photos of Bitcoin, but in fact, there are no physical Bitcoins. The balance is kept on a public ledger in the cloud. Bitcoins are not backed by any bank or governments. While government issued money can be inflated at will, Bitcoin is mathematically limited to 21 million bitcoins which can never be changed. Currently, one Bitcoin is equal to $4,572.77 USD.\n\nIt is now possible to have a Bitcoin app on your phone to purchase this virtual currency and then use it to purchase goods and services. It is important to note that your “digital wallet” which is stored on the cloud could act as your Bitcoin “bank account.” However, it is not insured by the FDIC like a traditional U.S. bank account. This has spawned an increase in hacking of cell phones and devices by people who are stealing bitcoins.\n\nTransactions in Bitcoin are anonymous and you will not know the identity of the person on the other end of the exchange and they will not know you. Since transactions are private, you may guess that this has become the currency of choice for the purchase of drugs and other illicit activities.\n\nYou can also “mine” Bitcoins. This is a competition type setup where people use computers to solve complex math puzzles and are awarded with new Bitcoins. Currently, mining is the way in which Bitcoins are created. They are pumping out at a rate of 25 Bitcoins about every 10 minutes. I assume this will slow down as more are created since there is a cap of 21 million.\n\nWho accepts Bitcoins? The list of retailers who accept Bitcoins is growing, but you can’t shop just anywhere. The most popular way to buy goods with Bitcoins is to use them to purchase gift cards for the places you want to shop. To do this, you will pay about 5-10 percent more for the gift card than if using Bitcoins themselves to pay for the goods. Some popular places that have begun to accept Bitcoins as payment are Subway, Dish Network, Overstock.com and Expedia. It is possible to use Bitcoins for purchases at many other retailers with the use of other apps and workarounds similar to purchasing gift cards.\n\nMany claim that Bitcoin is the riskiest investment available today. While the internet is flooded with articles and people claiming to have made a fortune from them, there are many of us who remain skeptical.\n\nThere are some primary concerns surrounding Bitcoin. First, as mentioned, it is not backed or regulated by the government, a bank, or any other entity. Some people have compared Bitcoin to Monopoly money since it is not an actual currency nor is it based on anything tangible. That means that its worth is based on what people “think” it is worth. While not untrue for other forms of currency, Bitcoin is in a more precarious position due to its unregulated nature.\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin is not traded on Wall Street. They cannot be bought or sold through a brokerage. Instead they can only be bought in an account exclusively for Bitcoins. This makes Bitcoin less liquid than equities. It also is much more volatile with more rapid swings in value.\n\nFinally, there are higher rates of theft and fraud through uninsured Bitcoin exchanges. If your Bitcoin is stolen or there is fraud in your account, you cannot call your banking institution and report the fraud and receive a refund as you can with your “traditional” bank account.\n\n*Nothing contained in this article should be interpreted as a promise or guarantee of earnings or investment results nor a recommendation for the purchase or sale of any security or sector.', 'News\n\nGoogle has analyzed cryptocurrency-related search queries of Russian residents for the first half of this year. Searches for bitcoin, ethereum, cryptocurrency, as well as cryptocurrency mining, have all increased substantially. Google has also pinpointed the regions in Russia with the most search growth.\n\nAlso read: Moscow Stock Exchange Prepares to Trade Cryptocurrency\n\nGoogle’s Analysis\n\nGoogle has performed an analysis on search queries of Russian residents for the first half of 2017 for information related to cryptocurrency, according to local publications. The company revealed its findings on Thursday, stating that:\n\nDespite the fact that the first cryptocurrency was launched in 2009, the greatest surge of interest of Russian users to this industry came in the first half of 2017. Just imagine, from January to June the number of requests for the industry as a whole increased by more than 250%.\n\nGoogle revealed that the highest growth recorded in searches was Ethereum-related, which increased more than 760%. Bitcoin-related searches were up more than 220%.\n\nIn addition, users also searched for cryptocurrency mining information more frequently, resulting in the total number of mining-related searches increasing by 560%. “Cryptocurrencies and mining also fell into the top 100 queries with the words ‘how’ and ‘what is’,” Rusbase detailed, adding that the number of requests for specific cryptocurrencies also increased by the same percentage.\n\nFurthermore, Google noted that in the first six months of the year, the number of requests for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) “significantly increased,” but did not name specific figures.\n\nHighest Growth Regions\n\n“There is an opinion that the trends are spreading from the center of Russia to the regions, but not in this case,” Vestifinance quoted Google, adding that:\n\nThe biggest increase in interest in the industry was seen in the Khabarovsk Territory (+ 309% of requests). At the same time, the increase in the number of requests for individual cryptocurrencies – Ethereum (+ 1114%) and Bitcoin (+ 317%) – also turned out to be above the national average in this region.\n\nMeanwhile, Kaliningrad residents were entering mining-related search requests over 674% more in the first half of 2017, the news outlet detailed.\n\nLast week, the head of Kaliningrad Region Development Corporation, Vladimir Zarudny, talked about attracting cryptocurrency mining operations to Kaliningrad. He believes that by 2018 cryptocurrency will be legal in Russia, and its production will become a new type of business, according to a post on the corporation’s website.\n\nIn February, Klops.ru reported that Presidential Commissioner for Entrepreneurs’ Rights Boris Titov suggested that Kaliningrad should be chosen as the pilot site for bitcoin to be used as a currency. “For example, you can pay for gasoline with bitcoins,” the publication quoted him saying.\n\nWhat do you think of Google’s findings? Let us know in the comments section below.', 'You might be tantalized by the shocking rise in the value of bitcoin, but don’t let it sweep you off your feet.\n\nThis week bitcoin, a relatively young synthetic currency that people use to buy items over the web, made headlines after it hit an amazing peak in price of $4,726. During this year alone, an investment in bitcoin gained 358 percent. You read that right. While the stock market is up about 10 percent for the year — which is a nice gain for stocks in just eight months — the money people have made in stocks is puny compared with what’s been made in bitcoin.\n\nA quick 358 percent gain in anything is a rarity, and it gets people talking and longing for the bygone days when they could have made the same investment and achieved that return. If you have a friend who ventured into bitcoin early this year, he or she is probably giddy and eager to talk about the newfound riches. A chat about bitcoin may make you think it’s time to join your friend; to get in as quickly as possible and enjoy a no-brainer.\n\nBut beware. This copycat approach to investing has led to crushing losses for people tantalized by astronomical gains in the past.\n\nDo you remember the housing crash of 2008, when the innocents who bought homes thinking they’d make a fortune on soaring prices ended up losing 30 percent on plunging home values? Do you remember the technology stock bubble of early 2000? Until the technology bubble burst, people were euphoric about the pioneers of the fledgling Internet in the 1990s, and figured the gains in technology stocks would never end. Some beloved stocks soared 100 percent within weeks of people buying them. Then reality set in, companies went bankrupt, and technology stocks as a group lost about 70 percent of the money people had assumed was theirs for keeps.\n\nRemember, also, the Japanese Nikkei 225 stock market. In the 1980s, Japan was the envy of the world, with an economy on fire. But hot turned into overheating, and when that happened the market that had grown investors’ money six-fold over a decade destroyed about 82 percent of it. Now, even after almost three decades, people haven’t recovered what was lost as the Nikkei plunged.\n\nAll of these bubbles and crashes have one thing in common: If you tracked them on a line graph, the sharp price gains people made day after day on the investment would form what’s called a “parabolic curve” — one of the most reliable warning signs that an investment may be overheating amid hype and euphoria. And currently the enormous rise of bitcoin shows up as a dramatic parabolic curve, making analysts suspicious about future gains.\n\nA parabolic curve looks like the left side of a steep mountain, shooting straight up into the air from the flat horizon. It’s powered by the belief that gains will keep on going; that there’s something special about a certain investment that will not end.\n\nThe trouble is that mountains have two sides. So the parabolic curve climbs into a mountain peak, but then there’s a tremendous plunge down the other side of the mountain. As money evaporates in the plunge people wonder why they were wounded so badly. The plunge after a parabolic curve often wipes out about two-thirds of what people had at the peak, when they thought they had a no-brainer.\n\nRecently, Bespoke Investment Group, a research firm, warned about the potential risk in bitcoin. It ran a picture of different investments that suffered the delight and pain of parabolic curves. Bitcoin’s climb is the most dramatic of any. See www.tinyurl.com/yc93kma3.\n\nOf course, the fact that some analysts now are watching bitcoin’s rise skeptically does not mean all is over for bitcoin. Amid euphorias and parabolic curves, no one knows when the peak will come. Also, the awareness that astronomical gains don’t continue forever doesn’t mean that bitcoin won’t last as a digital currency and as an alternative to using dollars and other currencies to make purchases.\n\nBitcoin recently had a market value of $77 billion, and bitcoin has been accepted by legitimate businesses ranging from Expedia and Dish Network to Microsoft and Paypal. It’s also been used by criminals interested in hiding their transactions in so-called cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin, one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, is popular with millennials who are comfortable with operating in the digital environment, noted John McGinnis, a Northwestern University law professor. The digital currencies are also popular, he said, with people around the world who worry that their governments will manipulate the value of paper money. The extent of the new digital currency market can be seen here: www.coinmarketcap.com.\n\nRegardless of the long-term interest in digital currencies, however, McGinnis does not think people should be investing in them without realizing that they could be very volatile.\n\nContact Gail MarksJarvis at gmarksjarvis@chicagotribune.com.', 'After setting new highs in the last day, the crypto market, led by bitcoin, has given back some of its record gains in the last 24 hours, although valuations remain close to record highs.\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.16 points in the last 24 hours to $4,499.35, falling from a record $4,964.54 the previous day.

However, once it touched that mark, traders initiated a massive sell-off. Within a couple of hours, the bitcoin price plunged to about $4,600 on Bitstamp. The movement was even more drastic on Bitfinex, where it dropped as low as $4,550.\n\nWhile the majority of cryptos lost value in the last 24 hours, total market capitalization of $163.9 billion today remains close to yesterday’s record $166.3 billion.\n\nBitcoin now holds 45.94% of the total crypto market, while runner-up Ethereum holds 19.92%.\n\nEthereum fell from a $388.66 on Sept. 2 to $343.11 today, although it was making a comeback, rising 9.84 points in the last 24 hours.

Are cryptos in a bubble? Yes, absolutely. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily.”\n\nBitcoin’s current market performance and other Lasher predictions\n\nBitcoin has continued to perform strongly in the market and achieved another record on August 31 to bring its total cap to more than $78 bln. The leading cryptocurrency has already surpassed the likes of Starbucks in terms of market cap. The phenomenal upward trajectory has understandably led to speculations of a possible bubble that is about to burst.\n\nLasher, meanwhile, has issued a warning to neophyte digital currency investors to proceed with caution in their investments. He advised that the investors should do extensive research before getting involved with the cryptocurrencies.\n\n“I wouldn’t recommend any investor get involved with cryptos without extensive research beforehand. It’s not a get-rich-quick scheme, and people who blindly throw money at it are likely to a) risk too much, b) buy too high, and c) sell too soon.”\n\nMoreover, Lasher projected that there will be 10 virtual currencies worth over $25 bln within 10 years. The data from Coinmarket.com, however, showed that only Bitcoin and Ethereum have surpassed that level so far.']"
09/04/2017,"['Bitcoin—the biggest and best known cryptocurrency—is falling along with stocks and other assets following a provocative nuclear test by North Korea over the weekend. If you believe non-state-controlled digital currencies are the havens of the future, traders aren’t treating bitcoin like one today.\n\nGold and even the Japanese yen (Tokyo is about 800 miles from Pyongyang) are outperforming bitcoin during the latest bout of global tension about North Korea’s nuclear program:\n\nThe recent drop in cryptoassets has also been attributed, in part, to China’s crackdown on initial coin offerings, with the central bank calling crypto token sales an “illegal fundraising practice.” Bitcoin’s sensitivity to the news doesn’t bode well for its future as a reserve asset. Its price peaked on Sept. 2, around the time of North Korea’s hydrogen bomb detonation and has since fallen. China published its statement on ICOs on Sept. 4.\n\nTo be fair to cryproassets, the US dollar is a global reserve currency and it hasn’t behaved much like a haven, either. That’s because anything that reduces the likelihood of US president Donald Trump’s proposed tax cuts—like the distraction of North Korea launching missiles—increases the probability that the Federal Reserve will try to stimulate the US economy (via lower interest rates), according to Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments. (All bets are off if a nuclear-tipped rocket actually leaves the launchpad, of course.)\n\nBitcoin seems to offer respite during smaller-scale, localized crises: Venezuela is the latest country to embrace the cryptoasset as its economy and currency cratered. One reason bitcoin may not offer safety during times of broader turmoil is that the market is simply too small. A large institution probably wouldn’t be able to buy enough of the cryptocurrency to hedge its portfolio against geopolitical risks.\n\nThis may not always be the case. While the amount of bitcoin in existence is limited by its own algorithms, the supply of derivatives linked to bitcoin is theoretically infinite. Derivatives exchange CBOE is developing futures tied to bitcoin, and the financial industry has been trying to develop an exchange-traded fund linked to it. If, or when, institutional money throws its weight behind the cryptocurrency on a big scale, bitcoin may behave differently during times of crisis.', ""Just two days after achieving a historic high of over $5,000 on September 2, bitcoin's price has plummeted to below $4,400.\n\nThe notable sell-off – the biggest in the crypto markets since July 15 – began immediately after the record high of $5,013.91 had been reached Saturday, and has continued today, according to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nStarting the session at $4,631, the digital asset traded sideways for a time (with a high of $4,636), until around 07:00 UTC, when a sharp drop was observed taking bitcoin to a low of $4,345 for the session.\n\nAt press time, the price had recovered a tad to $4,367 – a drop of 5.7 percent ($263) for the day so far.\n\nThe downwards movement reflects a general drop in the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nA glance at CoinMarketCap data reveals that most digital assets are down today, with only a couple of cryptocurrencies showing in the green.\n\nAmid losses across all the top 10 cryptocurrencies, notably, ethereum is down 14.53 percent, litecoin is down 15.37 percent, and monero has dropped 12 percent.\n\nLooking at the markets as a whole, since reaching a record high of around $180 billion, the combined market cap for all cryptocurrencies is now $152 billion – a drop of $28 billion.\n\nJumping BMX bike image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin is the virtual currency challenging governments, circumventing banks and threatening to blow old-school currency out the water.\n\nJust 10 years ago, Bitcoin was another office joke in Africa. The rare few who took it seriously have made millions.\n\n“One year and seven months ago. November 2015. That was the month I started with R3,500 ($260) and now it’s worth R37,000 ($2,800). A Bitcoin was $260. Exactly one year later that Bitcoin was $900. It grew over 300%. Today it’s $2,800.”\n\nThis was the moneymaking turning point for communications and marketing employee Shireen Ramjoo who, at the age of 32, was so taken by Bitcoin she left her job in the bank to start her own consultancy, Liquid Crypto-Money.\n\nFrom humble worldwide beginnings Bitcoin, a digital currency, otherwise known as cryptocurrency, was born from blockchain technology – a mass linking of computers. The midwives are an estimated 5.8 million users generating a market value of $27 billion, which represents a level of value creation on the order of Silicon Valley success stories like Airbnb, according to the 2017 Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.\n\nThe impact of Bitcoin has been compared to the day paper money replaced gold and silver. It is so new that like there were no computer technicians before computers, there are few Bitcoin experts, more educated guessers.\n\nBitcoin is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to blockchain technology. Many financiers argue it will transform the world money system and maybe be the next dotcom-style boom in Africa. Up for grabs are billions more as peer-to-peer networks spark new business platforms and threaten to wash away established business practices that have been around for centuries.\n\n“The first time I heard about Bitcoin, I had to write a press release for Standard Bank. It must have been early 2012. At the time I didn’t understand it, it just went over my head. I thought it was too technical. After I left the industry I wanted to be my own boss. I was looking for an opportunity and came across Bitcoin,” says Ramjoo.\n\nShe has made a business out of educating clients on Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency – topics that leave many baffled.\n\n“We are in an evolution of money here. What people don’t realize is when the internet first started some governments were against it. As more countries started adopting it, more countries got involved. That’s the same phenomenon happening here,” says Ramjoo.\n\n“We keep hearing of [blockchain] from a more technological point of view. Remember the topic of money is social… when you understand that this is actual money that you can use – I can go and buy bread and put petrol in my car – then you start wanting to find out more.”\n\nRamjoo’s venture is just one small example the business generated by the rise of this cryptocurrency. Since Bitcoin, more than 800 cryptocurrencies have blossomed in this unregulated market.\n\nCash is falling out of fashion – will it disappear forever?\n\nSo what is blockchain and bitcoin?\n\nWhen you transfer cash your money goes through the bank to another person. The bank, who acts as a central mediator, charges you a service fee and makes a record of the transaction.\n\nUntil recently, the bank was the only keeper of these records, which in turn is proof of your transaction. This is called the ledger system. The process of verifying the information takes days and also means banks are able to dictate the cost of these transactions.\n\nBlockchain short-circuits the ledger system in the blink of an eye, by decentralizing it. In 2008, a paper published under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto suggested instead of your transaction being in one single computer server at the bank, you could store a transaction on thousands of computers around the world at the same time – rent-a-crowd worldwide.\n\n“There are a whole lot of people logged onto this network and confirm all these transactions all day long. What do they get as a reward for it? The answer is Bitcoin. The reason why Bitcoin exists is to reward these people that make their computers available to store data and to become a world super computer that looks over transactions,” says Ran Neu-Ner, Johannesburg entrepreneur and Co-Founder of the Creative Counsel.\n\nThe Emperor’s New Coins\n\nNot only does this mean there are literally millions of back-ups, so that you cannot delete the transaction should the bank be hacked, but also the bank is no longer needed to make the transaction. In effect blockchain cuts out the middleman making all the rules, all the money and protecting your privacy.\n\n“The Bitcoin isn’t important. The piece of tech that’s important is the blockchain that gets tech around the world to become a super computer to transfer money to store contracts or whatever else,” says Neu-Ner.\n\nImagine a world where people go from place to place in driverless cars, where there are no stop streets, or traffic lights, and machines decide how fast you get to your destination. If you can dream it, Neu-Ner can see it.\n\n“Think 10 years from now, when there are only driverless cars on the road. You don’t have to have anything on the roads created for human nature.”\n\n“Imagine the scenario: we’re driving in driverless cars, we both need to get to work. Your car is in front of my car. You want to pass, so you would normally flash your car’s lights. But in a driverless car you’re not able to flash lights at each other and say move over.”\n\nThe solution will be for driverless cars to set up smart contracts and you’ll pay in [cryptocurrency].\n\n“The guys who are working on driverless cars are working on that blockchain right-of-way system right now.”\n\n“The keyword when you are thinking about the blockchain is decentralization… Just keep asking yourself, if something is centralized, how is it going to be disrupted? Because it’s going to be disrupted. It’s a new economy, where everyone who contributes earns their fair share in tokens,” says Neu-Ner.\n\nTrading and spending\n\nBecause it is an international currency, the Bitcoin, as well as the world, is your oyster. You can travel the world by spending Bitcoin. In Japan, for instance, over 200,000 stores now accept Bitcoin.\n\nThis is how it works.\n\nWhile on the way, a Bitcoin can be purchased on exchange sites when you are starting out. All you need to do is download an app, load up some cash and then start buying. Some financial brokers will even purchase Bitcoin fractions on your behalf.\n\nThe exchanges vary but we’ve found bitcoinzar.co.za offers a number of companies that will accept PayPal, your credit or debit card, and person-to-person. There is even a BTM (bitcoin ATM) at a business called Metroman in Kyalami, Johannesburg, that accepts rand in exchange for Bitcoin.\n\nIt is even possible to get your salary in Bitcoin; it’s as simple as a shopping cart on an online store.\n\nThere are, however, pitfalls. You must research the apps and look for realistic returns when investing in cryptocurrency, especially ones you are not familiar with. Schemes, such as Pipcoin, offered high returns of 35% a month and many fell for it.\n\n“Millions were invested in it and many lost money, because they couldn’t tell it was a scam. It was plugged as the coin of Africa. So if you don’t understand how coins are generated, you won’t know how these schemes operate,” says Ramjoo.\n\nBitcoinzar.co.za also recommends you don’t leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. Hackers know that exchanges are mostly honey-pots, with private user information, and, more importantly, Bitcoin that can be instantly stolen and transferred away to an anonymous Bitcoin wallet.\n\n“People are losing their money very quickly. They are believing that if they buy into this hype today, tomorrow I’ll come away with a lot of money,” says Neu-Ner.\n\nIf you are looking to invest, ensure you have a Bitcoin/cryptocurrency wallet where you can keep your data offline and private. You should always question the authenticity of these wallets and the company should be transparent.\n\nIt is even possible to mine you own Bitcoins, although this method of earning is considered to be going out of date. At the current rate of exchange, you would be spending more money on equipment and electricity, unless the price escalates substantially.\n\n“You can compare it to when the internet first came and emails. The whole process of us writing a letter, going to the post office, then waiting for the letter to get to the person. When the email came, the postal service became a third party, and not being used as much as we used it before,” says Ramjoo.\n\nBanks are transforming\n\nAfrica is looking at adopting blockchain-based currency. In February, the South African Reserve Bank said it is open to issuing a national digital currency, which would likely be based on blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Senegal is set to roll out its eCFA, a digital version of the West African franc, later this year, and there are even plans to extend distribution across the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).\n\n“There is going to be a new generation for banks. We are starting to see it play out in the market – governments starting to issue out their own cryptocurrency. Tunisia was the first country in the world to have its own government-issued digital currency… Some people are old school and will keep their money in the banks. But the bank of the future will not be the same as it is now,” says Ramjoo.\n\nThis is just the beginning of a new system that will transform the world and make billions in the process. Many people don’t understand what’s happening; those that do will likely become even richer.\n\nCoin Collection?\n\nCryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, is generated in the form of data strings. Only computers can solve the complex mathematical equations. For every completed equation, a coin is created and the coin that follows requires more data and processing power to add to the string, which in turn keeps a record of every transaction ever made.\n\n“Bitcoin is not a company, nor does a single person or organization issue or control Bitcoins; therefore, it has no central point of failure. For this reason, nobody can inflate the currency supply and create hyperinflation crises, such as those that occurred in post-World War I Germany and more recently in Zimbabwe. In 2008, the government of Zimbabwe printed so much of its currency that in a single year, a loaf of bread increased from $1 to $100 billion. In both cases, any savings that people had in the form of national currency were completely destroyed.” – extracts from Bitcoin for the Befuddled by Conrad Barski and Chris Wilmer\n\nA previous version of this story stated that there are two licensed exchanges in South Africa. This was incorrect and the article has been updated.', 'Australia could gain up to 500 two-way Bitcoin ATMs following a partnership between two native fintech firms.\n\nUnder the deal between Stargroup and Digital X, bespoke ATM software will run in tandem with a special API to ‘retrofit’ Stargroup’s standard ATMs with Bitcoin purchase and sales functionality.\n\nOnce complete, a full roll-out would see the number of Bitcoin ATMs increase in multiples from the current nationwide total of just 20 machines.\n\n“This development may also be able to be applied to other cryptocurrencies and be distributed internationally,” Stargroup’s CEO Todd Zani said in an accompanying press release.\n\nAustralia has been comparatively quiet in the ATM sector until now. In the US, competition has heated up among manufacturers aiming to corner the market with roll-outs of dozens of machines across the country this year.\n\nThe move marks a show of confidence from Digital X, which in June received a $4.35 mln investment package from local consortium Blockchain Global.\n\n“... We view this opportunity as a suitable fit to offer ordinary Australians exposure to cryptocurrency,” CEO Leigh Travers commented.\n\nAt legislative level, Australia has only now taking formal steps to regulate cryptocurrency, having approved Bitcoin as a legal currency last month.', 'Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

In practice, however, developers have stated that they’ll be more likely to see 1.7 to 2.1 megabytes blocks. 80 wallet developers, exchanges, pools, and other Bitcoin projects indicated that they were ready for Segwit prior to activation, out of a of 137 entities listed on bitcoincore.org.\n\nThe first block larger than Bitcoin’s original 1,000 kilobyte block size limit was mined on August 25, weighing in at 1032.119 kb. Large blocks have continued to trickle in, and today we commonly see as many as six blocks in a row all larger than the old limit. SegWit transactions now account for a little over one percent of transactions, as users, companies, and wallets have each had to make changes to facilitate the new format.\n\nPercentage of SegWit-formatted transactions in each of bitcoin’s recent blocks\n\nWhile bigger blocks have become a reality, there was little indication that any reduction in fees had been delivered to Bitcoin’s users. Fees have occasionally been as large as US$9 per transaction, and larger blocks should alleviate fee pressure.\n\nIn order for the fees to shrink, Bitcoin transactions in the mempool, which holds pending transactions before they are added to blocks, had to be emptied of more than 100 megabytes of backed-up transactions that existed just before SegWit’s activation.\n\nHowever, transactions in the Bitcoin mempool size dropped off sharply on August 29, and it’s been around four megabytes since. Clearing the backlog has also made the average size of Bitcoin’s blocks far smaller. Starting on Sunday at block 483,286, many blocks have been half-full or smaller, and fee sizes have dropped to their lowest in a year.\n\nThe original purpose for SegWit was to patch a vulnerability called Transaction Malleability, (TxMal) which first became famous when Mark Karpeles blamed it for the MtGox hack in 2013. The patch that fixes TxMal also adds a framework that helps Bitcoin scale in other ways, namely by making these layer-two applications easier to implement, such as the Lightning Network and Sidechains.\n\nThere are a further eight distinct changes that are manifesting themselves in different ways at different times. Only one of them affected the block size limit, while others work to increase the system’s efficiency so that the number of transactions that Bitcoin can process increases, without increasing the blocksize. Still other changes work to raise Bitcoin’s security.\n\nOne change, called ‘linear scaling of sighash operations,’ is an efficiency gain that changes the calculation of the transaction hash for signatures. “Each byte of a transaction only needs to be hashed at most twice,” states the Bitcoin Core development website. It more efficiently does the same job as before, so that large transactions can still be generated without running into problems due to signature hashing, even if they are generated maliciously.\n\nAnother change, called ‘script versioning,’ promises to enable lots of smaller efficiency gains which will be enabled in future versions of Bitcoin. The patch makes improving Bitcoin’s code safer by simply adding a version number to all script improvements. This allows individuals to opt-in to particular versions.\n\nScript versioning allows many future projects like Schnorr signatures, key recovery, smaller signature sizes, sidechains, drivechains, and smarter smart contracts using Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) all possible without another contentious hard fork.\n\nIn the meantime, version 0.15 of Bitcoin is slated for release within the next few days, and has many small and medium-sized improvements. Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell recently gave a presentation focusing on the changes in 0.15, and it included many system efficiency tweaks. Among them was a new fee estimation system.\n\nWallets are currently estimating the appropriate fee for a Bitcoin transaction, and it’s often too high. All types of Bitcoin wallets, including internally-hosted wallets on exchanges, face this problem. Maxwell explained that the new 0.15 wallet is “smarter about not producing change which would be uneconomical to spend and will slightly overpay fees to avoid doing so.”\n\nBitcoin developer Jameson Lopp has already integrated the new software into his statistics tracking website, and stated on Sunday that he has seen a huge improvement in fee estimates for the new Bitcoin wallet clients. In some cases, it shows that users can send extremely small fees of just a few satoshis, and at worst, the fees were estimated at around one fifth of their previous highest estimation.', 'South Korean regulators are reportedly strengthening the regulation and monitoring of digital currencies including bitcoin.\n\nSouth Korea’s digital currency task force – a group comprising of the country’s central bank, financial regulators and digital currency companies – have discussed increased regulatory oversight into trading and business practices as a means to further consumer protection efforts.\n\nAccording to Business Korea, the task force held a joint meeting on Sunday where authorities planned to introduce these increased regulations for trading among the country’s domestic exchanges. The meeting, which was attended by the National Tax Service (NTS) and the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) also saw plans drawn toward strengthening user authentication procedures at exchanges as well as ‘suspicious transaction reporting’ systems at banks for transactions related to digital currencies.\n\nFinancial Services Commission (FSC) chairman Kim Yong-beom, who chaired the task force meeting, reportedly stated:\n\nAt this point, digital currencies cannot be considered money and currency, nor financial products.\n\nFurthermore, bitcoin remittance foreign currency FinTech firms will also have to put up with increased monitoring from authorities. This, despite the South Korean government lessening the burden for bitcoin-based FinTech firms to operate in the country by issuing permits to act as foreign currency transfer services.\n\nSouth Korean authorities will also reportedly recommend digital currency exchanges to include consumer protection measures when providing services.\n\nICO Ban?\n\nNotably, the report also suggests that authorities will “punish” initial coin offering (ICO) fundraising platforms for violating the capital market act by raising funds through stock issuance using digital currencies.\n\nAn FSC official added:\n\nWe will clearly state the foundations of the Act on the Regulation of Conducting Fund-Raising Business Without Permission for illegal fund-raising impersonating digital currency investment and strengthen levels of punishment.\n\nThe need to examine lax cybersecurity practices that has already led to a significant customer data breach and theft of funds in a major South Korean bitcoin exchange was also discussed, with ‘severe disciplinary action’ for any violations by exchanges.\n\nA KFTC official further added that the task force will look into other concerns like the “character of digital currency traders, taxation and permits’ by studying regulatory practices in other countries before forming new policies.\n\nAs reported in July, a set of bills leading to a regulatory framework for digital currencies could soon see the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum legalized and regulated in South Korea.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Russia is considering a ban on Bitcoin mining in private homes, despite electricity companies holding talks on giving miners spare capacity.\n\nAccording to Russia Today and local news outlet RIA Novosti, the governmental Informational Democracy Fund will recommend banning participation in mining pools from private addresses at an upcoming meeting of a working group on Internet growth.\n\n“Anything [mining-related] that continues inside the country is a waste of electricity,” RIA quotes the Fund’s president Ilya Massukh as saying.\n\n“It’s somewhat doubtful in terms of efficiency for the Russian economy.”\n\nRussia continues to prevent mixed signals on cryptocurrency and Blockchain regulation. Last week, Cointelegraph reported that the country’s two major electricity giants were discussing options for miners to use spare capacity at 70 sites for Bitcoin mining purposes.\n\nAt the same time, an organization co-founded by Russia’s Internet ombudsman is attempting to raise $100 mln to fund a major mining project which ostensibly aims to take market share away from China, which has higher electricity costs.\n\nAlleged hazards\n\nMassukh meanwhile alluded to alleged safety hazards involved in private mining of Bitcoin, including regular “ventilation systems being unable to mitigate the heat generated” by the necessary equipment.\n\nHis words mimic security concerns of a different kind voiced by finance ministry deputy Alexey Moiseev, who last month recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrency sales to “ordinary people” who were not “qualified” to handle it.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""The cryptocurrency market is a sea of red today, a development skeptics will no doubt quickly use to make the case against bitcoin as a 21st century gold.\n\nIn times of economic or political stress, investors prefer to hold safe haven assets, and while many experts believe bitcoin is the new safe haven, today's dismal performance contradicts such claims. The cryptocurrency dropped 5 percent over the last 24 hours, even while North Korea's nuclear test and heightened geopolitical tensions pushed up traditional safe haven assets like gold, Japanese Yen.\n\nOverall, bitcoin (BTC) clocked an intraday low of $4,253 earlier today, and was trading around $4,335 levels on news China has banned initial coin offerings, one of the main trends powering this year's boom.\n\nStill, the price decline comes amid an uptick in trading.

A correction here would calm market nerves and help restore confidence in the bitcoin rally.\n\nIs heightened curiosity for real? The stellar rally in bitcoin led to increased curiosity about bitcoin and crypto space in general. Investors who missed out on the rally would want to board the bitcoin freight train during a technical pullback. Strong dip demand would indicate the heightened curiosity is for real… investors are not just curious but are willing to allocate a part of their portfolio to virtual currencies. Weak dip demand or absence of dip demand would be bad news.\n\nBigger uptrend is still intact\n\nDaily chart\n\nThe rising trend line from the July 16 low is still intact and could offer support at $4,133 levels.\n\nThe chart above shows a bearish price RSI divergence, which is formed when prices form higher highs while the oscillator (in this case an RSI) forms significantly lower highs.\n\nThe bearish price RSI divergence suggests a short-term top in place around $5,000, although only an end-of-day close below $4,133 today would abort the bullish view and signal potential for more losses towards $3,769 ( 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement ).\n\nA potential for a revisit to record highs around $5,000 exists if the prices rise above the daily high of $4,611.6.\n\nBig gains above $5,000 levels cannot be ruled out if we see a sharp rebound over the next few days from the rising trend line support.\n\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

09/05/2017,"['Interest in initial coin offerings (ICOs) is increasing rapidly. But is this latest method of raising capital through token sales a fad or a long-term funding method of the future?\n\nTo date, approximately $1.7 billion has been raised through this novel funding model, with more than $500 million in July alone.\n\nVenture capital firms are also increasingly recognizing this new trend and giving it traction, some claim this method of capital raising breaking down the barriers associated with traditional methods.\n\nMax Kordek, co-founder and business lead at Lisk, a blockchain applications platform, explains with the introduction of token sales, entrepreneurs are now watching as projects promptly receive funding enabling them to begin development to bring their idea into fruition instantaneously.\n\n""In the long and arduous process of traditional capital raising by accelerators and VC models, start-ups find themselves in a hamster wheel of building a POC then urgently trying to find the next client, or attempting to survive while the wheels of large corporates churn."" said Kordek.\n\nKordek explains his firm has seen some record token sales receiving upwards of $200 million, but even the smaller sales of $5 to $10 million eclipse the typical seed rounds for most startups.\n\n""Not only have we seen a huge rise in the number of token sales taking place, but there has also been a giant shift in the type of token sale participants, moving from solely cryptocurrency enthusiasts to everyday people. On a stage previously defined by anonymity, we now see respectable, reputable names backing these crowdfunding campaigns - instilling additional confidence in potential participants and adding credibility to the projects."" said Kordek.\n\nWe will also see regulations around ICOs come into force. In July, we saw the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission move in on the ""Wild West"" world of ICOs. Recently, the Israel Securities Authority has announced its own plans to form a panel to regulate ICOs.\n\nAaron Lasher, co-founder and CMO of Breadwallet, explains after the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, companies and individuals slowly realized that it was possible to tokenize any asset in a trust-less peer-to-peer fashion. This meant that anything from car titles to house deeds to stocks could, in theory, could be replaced by a blockchain token.\n\n""There were many before it, but the first modern-era token sale was the Ethereum pre-sale in 2014, in which the Ethereum foundation raised over 25,000 BTC (then worth about $15 million),"" Lasher said. ""The second important innovation was the invention of the ERC20 token standard which rides on the Ethereum blockchain. This token standard allows anyone to quickly and efficiently exchange tokens that they have created for Ethereum.""\n\nHe explained that since the ERC20 token standard, there has been a Cambrian explosion of ICOs, many of which have raised over $100 million.\n\nAccording to Lasher, there are two dominant factors driving the phenomenon: ""One is a very low barrier to entry. Many of the successful ICOs did a full raise with little more than a white paper and a website. Second is the enormous latent demand for growth investments, particularly from unaccredited investors who previously had few options for high-risk speculation.""\n\nLasher believes that the ICO phenomenon is the beginning of a new standard methodology for raising funds quickly and efficiently and has even defined a new term to describe it called ""Cellar Capital.""\n\nHowever, in the short-term there are two risks. Lasher explained that all tokens are sold under the assumption that they will generate demand and, in turn, value. Some are a form of synthetic equity, tied to the performance of an organization. Others are what is known as ""app fuel"" meaning that the tokens will have a use within a specific ecosystem that is expected to grow.\n\n""For instance, imagine an ICO for a company that plans to monetize and incentivize spare computing cycles, allowing users to spin up a virtual super-computer with relative ease,"" he said. ""That token would serve as the bartering tool within that economy, and would have a floating market price determined by exchanges. Although some ventures will likely succeed, not all tokens are properly designed, nor will all of the ecosystems flourish. As such, the value proposition of all ICO tokens should be examined with shrewd skepticism.""\n\nThe current paradigm does not prioritize the interests of investors. Laser explains, in traditional markets, investors sign on to a certain level of risk depending on their liquidation preference. This permits appropriate recourse in the event that an investment goes south.\n\n""For instance, if an organization needs to wind down, the typical pecking order is senior creditors, junior creditors, and then shareholders,"" he said. ""Within this ladder, there are many nuances. For instance, mezzanine capital is a form of high risk debt allocation that is senior only to that of common shares. Because of the current ICO flurry and exuberance, many investors do not realize that they are granted almost no rights through token ownership.""\n\nAs you move down the ladder, the risk-reward profile moves gradually. Bond holders have limited upside, but also limited downside. Shareholders have exposure to equity gains, but are the first to lose. Until recently, there existed no options below the liquidation preference of shareholders. But with the advent of ICOs, a new capital rung has emerged.\n\nGoing forward, Lasher expects significant turbulence and downside risk in the current ICO market.\n\nMore of What\'s Trending on TheStreet:\n\nStick with TheStreet for updated storm coverage as Hurricane Irma moves the market:\n\nEditors\' pick: Originally published Sept. 5.', ""On Monday, Labor Day in the United States, China announced an outright ban of ICOs and recommended money collected by Chinese ICOs be refunded to investors. Although Bitcoin itself is not directly involved with most ICOs, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, have benefited from the ICO boon by bringing new eyeballs to the nascent space. While this regulation has almost no effect on Bitcoin directly, new investors are likely to be spooked by the news.\n\nChina has a history of introducing regulations — often at the peak of large movements in price. In January this year, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced regulatory changes on domestic Bitcoin exchanges which sent the Bitcoin price tumbling 36% in a week.\n\nThose regulations were also in line with capital controls at the time. While the new regulations are aimed at reducing scammers, there is undoubtedly an effort to prevent money from leaving the country. The PBoC will continually try to retain control.\n\nHong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission has released a cautionary statement in regards to ICOs rather than an outright ban. The statement was similar to a report released by the United States Security and Exchange Commission, a notice released by the Canadian Securities Administrators, and a release from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nAs hype is generated, more and more regulators become aware, and the regulations themselves are often unable to keep up with the largely permissionless innovation that cryptocurrency allows. Although Bitcoin has a decentralized ecosystem, unfriendly regulations coming from any large nation with many investors should be seen as bearish.\n\nEven though most of us abreast of ICOmania and aggressive ICO marketing knew an ICO ban was in the Chinese pipeline, the news was far from priced in. Bitcoin has dropped over 10% on the news, now down almost 12% from its graze of $5000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market capitalization as a whole has shed around $45 billion since the new Bitcoin all-time high and has since attempted to rebound.\n\nThe health of the Bitcoin network, which had been a concern following the Bitcoin Cash split and mining profitability spike, has recovered. The transaction backlog has reduced greatly and average transaction fees are declining.\n\nBlock times and network hashrate have also stabilized.\n\nUS exchanges still lead global trading volume, but Japan, China, and South Korea hold a substantial 56% of trading volume. Bitfinex continues to hold the majority share of USD volume.\n\nGlobal Over The Counter (OTC) volume is back to all-time highs, which is no surprise considering OTC volume largely follows movements in price.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nWith fundamental bearish news occurs, such as a government ban of a large percentage of trade volume, price will react accordingly and rather obviously. In these cases, technical analysis takes a back seat until the shock from the news clears. As the ashes settle, traders turn to technical analysis for support and resistance targets, as well as trend determination.\n\nUnsurprisingly, price found resistance at the 1.618 Fibonacci extension drawn from the previous local high to local low. This price zone also represented the psychological resistance of $5000. Coincidental or not, this technical resistance was aligned with the fundamental resistance of the China ICO ban. When technicals and fundamentals are confluent in one direction, there is usually a strong price reaction.\n\nOverall, the trend as a whole remains intact. Three ways to measure this are Pitchforks, Ichimoku Cloud, and EMAs.\n\nEach diagonal of the Pitchfork (PF) can be thought of as a potential reversal zone or support/resistance line. The upper yellow diagonal zone being ‘most overbought,’ or the top bounds of the trend, and lower yellow diagonal zone being ‘most oversold,’ or the bottom bounds of the trend.\n\nThe PF below, drawn on data from the $BLX, has an anchor drawn in 2015. The median line (red) of the PF gives the expected mean of the trend, which was continually found as resistance until mid-2017. Price will continually attempt to return to this diagonal, now below $3000. Although the amount of data above the PF suggests that this PF is currently invalid or price is significantly overbought based on the rate of the trend beginning in 2015.\n\nAnother PF can be drawn using more recent data. This shows a similar reversal zone surrounding the median line.\n\nThe second indicator, Ichimoku Cloud is a constant, auto-drawn indicator which quickly offers an immense amount of valuable information on any time frame. The Cloud is best used at higher time frames as more data generally provides more accurate signals and less false positives.\n\nThe indicator uses moving averages and dynamic support and resistance to make projections of key zones, as well as capturing 80% of any given trend. As long as the price remains above the Cloud, sentiment remains bullish. Price in the Cloud indicates a neutral trend, and below the Cloud indicates a bearish trend.\n\nWhen the Tenkan (T) is over the Kijun (K) sentiment is bullish. K over T would indicate bearish sentiment. When the Lagging Span (LS) is above the Cloud and above the price sentiment is bullish, below the Cloud and price would indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nOn the daily timeframe, despite the distance from price to the Kijun, which signals heavily overbought conditions, a Kijun bounce has yet to occur. There have been multiple Tenkan bounces, which traditionally signals strong continuation, ie, the trend is so strong, mean reversion cannot even occur. It is important to consider price as overbought despite an attempt at new all-time highs. The Kijun remains a valid pullback target if/when that should occur. The previous all-time high zone, around $3000, also holds as strong support.\n\nOn the four-hour timeframe, price is slightly above cloud with a bearish TK cross. The previous bullish TK cross around August 25th was a strong sign of bullish continuation, which thrust price up to $5000. There is no current bullish entry on this timeframe. Should price remain above cloud, TK will eventually re-cross bullish, which would be considered a bullish entry signal. Price may also dip below the cloud which would trigger short entry conditions. Overall, this timeframe is mildly bullish but leaning neutral.\n\nThere was a hidden bullish divergence and tweezer bottom which signaled an interim reversal in the bearish move. This is purely retrospective at the moment, but these are markers to watch while trying to find weakness in any countertrend move.\n\nThe third indicator we’ll look at is exponential moving average (EMA), a type of moving average that is similar to a simple moving average, except that more weight is given to the latest data.\n\nThe one hour 50/200 EMAs showed a bearish cross and have yet to recross bullish. Similar to the TK lines of the cloud, a bullish 50/200EMA cross would be a long entry signal, similar to the bullish cross on August 23rd.\n\nWhen price is not pushing all-time highs, the upside targets are simple: the local high and the 1.618 fib extension of the most recent high and low. Using a fib extension from the previous low, this yields a resistance zone of $5500-5800.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs with any over reactionary regulatory news, price will react in a bearish manner. This coupled with timing around an already overbought market only amplifies the downward move. Cryptocurrency is no stranger to this, as it occurred in January of this year as well in a similar fashion. Trend remains strongly intact, but even with the significant pullback, support on the daily chart is about $1000 down, around $3400. Should price hold this range, expect a test of $5500-$5800."", 'This may be why bitcoin still accounts for a minuscule proportion of financial transactions worldwide. The capitalization of the bitcoin market — that is, the 16.5 million bitcoins in existence multiplied by $4,350 each — comes to just under $71.8 billion. The worldwide stock of ""broad money,"" which includes notes, coins and financial accounts, was placed at $82 trillion by the CIA as of the end of 2016. In market cap, bitcoin ranked just ahead of the Romanian leu, in 60th place — and that was only after its quintupling in price this year. For comparison\'s sake, the market value of all U.S. dollars alone as of Dec. 31 was $13.2 trillion.', 'Could bitcoin be the next gold?\n\nThe idea has a lot of intuitive appeal. Gold bugs and bitcoin fetishists tend to share a deep distrust of fiat currency and the nation state, an impregnable bullishness about their favored asset class, and an obsessive attention to details of market movements combined with a blithe disinterest in bigger-picture issues.\n\nThe idea has become particularly popular as the value invested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has marched upward over the past year. Even after this week\'s selloff, prompted by China declaring initial coin offerings illegal, the value of all cryptocurrencies in circulation is around $155 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.com.\n\nDigital Revolution The value of all bitcoins in circulation is moving close to the value of gold held by ETFs Source: Blockchain.info; Bloomberg; Gadfly calculations\n\nThat may sound small compared to the $7.8 trillion notional value of the world\'s 187,200 metric tons of gold. At the same time, it\'s already about a tenth the value of the 40,000 tons of yellow metal used for investment as bullion bars and coins, and has overtaken the amount held in gold exchange-traded funds. At more than $78 billion, Bitcoin alone isn\'t far from overtaking the $90 billion-odd invested in all gold ETFs.\n\nThere are two main reasons to doubt bitcoin\'s viability as an investment. One is an engineering issue: Its creaky infrastructure is likely to be a turn-off for all but the hobbyist fringe. Another is more philosophical: Digital currencies have no fundamental value, so have no place in a portfolio.\n\nBoth objections are weaker than you might think.\n\nTake infrastructure. It\'s certainly true that bitcoin\'s operations are surprisingly clunky. Just confirming a single transaction typically takes more than an hour or longer -- it briefly took more than a day at one point last month, according to software company Blockchain.info.\n\nCreeping Toward the Future Confirming transactions in bitcoin can take longer than a day Source: Blockchain.info\n\nHaving said that, financial markets are generally built on similar Rube Goldberg foundations. It\'s comically difficult for ordinary investors to buy an actual barrel of crude oil, as Tracy Alloway of Bloomberg News found out a few years back. The economist John Maynard Keynes, according to one possibly apocryphal story, once measured up the storage capacity of the chapel of King\'s College, Cambridge after coming perilously close to having to take delivery of a month\'s worth of the U.K.\'s wheat supply. Completing transactions in the real world is often so clunky that some banks are already exploring using, um, blockchains instead.\n\nWhat makes markets investable for the most part is not their physical foundations, but the superstructure of derivatives contracts, exchanges and clearing houses built on top.\n\nTo date, the world of bitcoin exchanges has been the wild west. When Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014, it said it had lost 850,000 coins worth more than $450 million. Another $70 million-odd was stolen in a hack of Bitfinex last year. The likes of Deribit and Bitmex have been offering bitcoin futures and options for some time, but major institutional investors are only going to participate if they think the clearing and settlement process is rock-solid and the exchange itself reliably solvent.\n\nChange on that front is imminent. The Chicago Board Options Exchange is planning to start offering cash-settled bitcoin futures by next April, CNBC reported last week. Trading platform LedgerX LLC last month won regulatory approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to act as a clearing house for derivatives settled in digital currencies. The ability to short or take leveraged positions in digital currencies could open them to a far wider array of investors.\n\nMirror Image Gold and equities were pretty closely correlated with each other during 2012 Source: Bloomberg\n\nWhat, though, is the value of a digital currency?\n\nIt\'s a fair question, but one that could equally be leveled at gold. Since Richard Nixon ended the fixed $35 an ounce convertibility of gold in 1971, its value has risen at times (the 1970s, the 2000s) and fallen at others. The best argument to justify investing in gold these days is not that it\'s an eternal ""store of value"" but that its very weirdness makes it special: According to modern portfolio theory, you should buy the shiny stuff not for its superior investment returns, but because it doesn\'t correlate much to other asset classes such as stocks, bonds and commodities.\n\nGive and Take The correlation between returns on the S&P 500 index and alternative assets doesn\'t display a strong pattern Source: Bloomberg, Gadfly calculations\n\nHowever, while gold did exhibit weak or negative correlations to returns on the S&P 500 for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, it\'s been positively correlated for extended periods since then. During gold\'s 2012 run-up, the two moved more or less in tandem. If gold deserves investment dollars because its inconsistent correlation with equities helps diversify portfolios, the same argument can be made for bitcoin, too.\n\nDigital currencies may be as vulgar as the original barbarous relic, but neither is going away any time soon. If that makes investors in both look less like seers and more like problem gamblers betting on where a fly will land -- well, welcome to financial markets.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.', 'Technology\n\nThe second largest independent ATM deployer in Australia Stargroup has signed a joint venture agreement with blockchain payment solutions company Digitalx to convert their existing ATMs into Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs). The agreement is for Stargroup’s entire global network, starting with Australia, where it has deployed over 500 ATMs and manages 2,400 more via its subsidiary Starlink.\n\nAlso read: Australia Introduces Bill That Regulates Bitcoin Exchanges\n\nDigitalx & Stargroup\n\nDigitalx Limited has signed a joint venture agreement with Perth-based Stargroup Limited. The two companies will “jointly offer and tailor a ‘two-way ATM’ solution for buying and selling bitcoin,” they announced on Monday.\n\nUnder the agreement, Stargroup will develop software for their ATMs that allows users to buy and sell bitcoin. Digitalx will develop an API to facilitate bitcoin transactions using this software. The two companies will share in the transaction fees charged at the ATMs.\n\n“Stargroup is pleased to partner with Digitalx on this project and leverage its unique ownership of its ATM manufacturer to develop a two-way ATM where a bitcoin owner can not only buy bitcoin but more importantly can cash their bitcoin out,” CEO Todd Zani commented, adding that:\n\nThis development may also be able to be applied to other cryptocurrencies and be distributed internationally.\n\nIn May, Stargroup reported that it had become the number two independent ATM deployer in Australia, second only to DC Payments limited. The third largest is Next Payments, followed by Cash Connect, Bendigo Bank, and Suncorp.\n\nStargroup ATM Network\n\nStargroup is the only ASX-listed company deploying ATM machines in Australia, according to the company’s website. The announcement detailed:\n\nThe joint venture agreement is for the entire global network of Stargroup ATMs, with the initial roadmap to focus on Australia…Within Australia, Stargroup has deployed approximately 500 ATMs in Star Payments and manages approximately 2,400 ATMs via Starlink.\n\nStarlink is the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. Stargroup also has a direct ownership interest in Neo ICP Korea Inc, a Korean ATM manufacturer. “Neo ICP Korea has approximately 16,000 ATMs and back office machines in South Korea, bringing the total number of ATMs managed approaching 19,000,” according to the announcement.\n\nCurrently, there are fewer than 20 ATMs in Australia that can facilitate bitcoin transactions, the group described, adding that their fees range from 4% to 8% of the transaction value. Additionally, most of them are one-way ATMs, so users can only buy bitcoin but cannot cash them out. Coinatmradar, a website that tracks the locations of bitcoin ATMs, lists only 16 BTMs in Australia.\n\nWhat do you think about Stargroup turning their ATMs into Bitcoin ATMs? Let us know in the comments section below.', 'India’s central bank has told a parliamentary panel on virtual currencies that bitcoin and digital currencies are “susceptible to misuse”.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s central bank, has warned a governmental parliamentary committee tasked with studying and developing a framework for digital currencies about the potential of their misuse by terrorists and fraudsters.\n\nAs reported by the Times of India, the RBI believes bitcoin and digital currencies could be abused by criminals for laundering money. The comments come within months of India’s Supreme court – the highest court in the land – pushing the RBI to check for bitcoin transactions in relation to terrorism funding and money laundering.\n\nThe RBI reportedly told the committee:\n\nIt is true that while virtual currencies may have legitimate uses, some of their characteristics like anonymity make them susceptible to misuse or abuse.\n\nIndia’s central bank has long maintained a hands-off approach to bitcoin and digital currencies, cautioning adopters and users that they will be doing so at their own risk. After issuing a public notice warning users in late 2013, the central bank followed up with a near-identical warning earlier this year as bitcoin adoption gains traction in India. Such has been bitcoin’s explosion in popularity and awareness that India’s finance minister Arun Jaitley – the country’s foremost financial official – admitted that India’s bitcoin market had shown “notable growth” in recent years.\n\nAfter years of looking the other way, India’s finance ministry established an inter-governmental committee to study and propose a framework for the regulatory and legal future of digital currencies in the country.\n\nTheir tasks include:\n\nTaking stock of the present status of Virtual Currencies both in India and globally;\n\nExamining the existing global regulatory and legal structures governing Virtual Currencies\n\nSuggest measures for dealing with such Virtual Currencies including issues relating to consumer protection, money laundering, etc; and\n\nExamine any other matter related to Virtual Currencies which may be relevant.\n\nThe committee submitted an early report to finance minister Jaitley last month but few details are known. As such, all signs point toward Indian authorities preparing regulations and taxation laws for the local bitcoin industry and adopters respectively. A ban is highly unlikely.\n\nFeatured image from Wikimedia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""It is a first for the UK that Bitcoin can now be used as a down payment in the property market. Co-living pioneer The Collective have announced that they will be accepting the digital currency as a deposit from prospective tenants.\n\nThey are also eyeing out rental payments in Bitcoin, but that will only be implemented later in the year.\n\nIt is the first time a UK property developer has opened its doors on the famous digital currency, stating that the demand actually came mostly from international customers.\n\nThe Old Oak\n\nThe Collective's online booking form for its Old Oak living scheme, an ambitious co-living development with 550 rooms, will be accepting Bitcoin as a deposit on the flats.\n\nThe standard deposit is £500, which equates to about 0.148 at time of publishing. Additionally, with the volatile nature of Bitcoin seemingly holding back its ability to be utilized as a currency, The Collective has pledged “spot conversion,” which means it will bear any financial risk while holding the deposit, returning it at the original value when the tenancy finishes.\n\nExpect it to be used for life’s essentials\n\nThe Collective’s chief executive and founder, Reza Merchant said of this bold move for the UK property market:\n\n“The rise and adoption of cryptocurrency globally, particularly Bitcoin, is a fascinating development in how people store value and transact for goods and services worldwide. With many savers and investors now choosing and becoming more comfortable with cryptocurrency, people will expect to be able to use it to pay for life’s essentials, including housing deposits and rent.”\n\nIndeed these are bold steps in the infant steps of Bitcoin’s walk to be an acceptable and usable currency, and for The Collective, there are barriers, but they are looking to be involved in breaking them down.\n\nThe Collective’s head of technology, Jon Taylor, said:\n\n“One of the biggest barriers to the popularity of Bitcoin is making it more consumer-friendly, and we believe this will become established as an easy and convenient way to pay deposits.”\n\nPrivate property tool\n\nThere have been many instances where private property owners have attached their whole price tag for their property in Bitcoin in the hopes of attracting buyers, as well as accumulating the valuable digital currency.\n\nA well regarded Miami trader recently placed his house for sale in Bitcoin after first trying to entice the seller to buy it in the same digital currency back in 2014."", 'Cryptocurrency still up more than 50 percent since July\n\nBitcoin steadied after its biggest drop since June as investors and speculators reappraised the outlook for initial coin offerings.\n\nThe cryptocurrency pared a decline of as much as 6 percent on Tuesday and was at $4,390 as of 9:39 am. in London.

Indeed, even an aide to Russian president Vladimir Putin has said he is moving to hold an ICO of his own.\n\nThe statement notes the ""high risks"" of exchanging cryptocurrencies, as well as participation in ICOs (described as ""a form of attracting citizens\' investments"").\n\nThe central bank went on to say that, at this stage, it won\'t greenlight any cryptocurrency trading on any official exchanges, nor would it approve the use of the tech for infrastructure purposes. At the same time, the Bank of Russia doesn\'t serve as a financial regulator in Russia; that role falls to the State Duma and the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThe Bank of Russia said (in a translated statement):\n\n""Given the high risks of circulation and use of crypto-currency, the Bank of Russia considers it premature to admit crypto-currencies, as well as any financial instruments nominated or associated with crypto-currencies, to circulation and use at organized trades and in clearing and settlement infrastructure on the territory of the Russian Federation for servicing transactions with crypto-currencies and derivative financial instruments on them.""\n\nThe statements come on the heels of China\'s move to ban ICOs and more tightly control the ecosystem of exchanges offering access to those token sales.

The arrested individuals were being investigated for processing a high volume of trades without a license and for not paying taxes on their profits.\n\nBased on a report by the Vedomosti newspaper, the three men have allegedly traded more than 500 million Russian rubles worth of Bitcoin without securing a license to do so. The authorities are reportedly in the process of building a criminal case against the “illegal” Bitcoin sellers.\n\nHow the men were arrested\n\nAccording to the investigators, they noticed unusual activity in bank accounts linked to about 300 bank cards and SIM cards. They claim that all of the monitored trades have links to Bitcoin activity. Some money from the trades was allegedly transferred into bank accounts owned by family members of the arrested individuals.\n\nState of digital currencies in Russia\n\nThe Russian government is increasing its efforts to scrutinize activities involving digital currencies due to their growing popularity. The aim of the investigations is to prevent tax evasion related to digital currencies. The arrest of the three Bitcoin sellers is viewed as a first step in the revitalized effort by authorities to bring tax evaders to justice.\n\nIn previous years, Russian authorities launched campaigns to ban Bitcoin exchanges and websites where the cryptocurrency can be converted to rubles. The authorities, however, have failed to file criminal charges to the operators and participants in said exchanges despite having the information about them in hand. The case filed against the three sellers is the first Bitcoin-related one in the country so far.', 'My back hairs go up when I see an unregulated financial vehicle that few really understand. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, I have a lot of concerns.\n\nAlthough I understand the concept behind Bitcoin-like currencies, there\'s always an issue with how something involving money is regulated. With public companies, for example, you know exactly how many shares are outstanding and what they are worth.\n\nCryptocurrency values are subject to coding. Blockchain is certainly a worthwhile technology, although I don\'t think it\'s as transparent as it should be.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong. I like the fact that alternative currencies don\'t need banks as intermediaries. Banks have certainly done their fair share of mucking up the world financial system.\n\nYet bank rules have never been tougher in the wake of the 2008 credit meltdown. That\'s a good thing. Cryptocurrencies are on the other side of that fence. They certainly need some regulation to curb bubbles, scams and crashes.\n\nRegulators are at odds over how to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, though. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an agency that\'s never been known for its strict regulation, has no guidelines. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission, in contrast, may green light futures trading on Bitcoins.\n\nWhere does that leave you, the individual investor? Well, you have to trust the encryption software and market participants that they are pricing cryptocurrencies correctly.\n\nAre some investors driving up the price to speculate? I think that\'s a fair bet, although that\'s a problem in any market.\n\nHow do you know if Bitcoin or similar currency is in a bubble? Since thousands are entering the market every day and Bitcoin is being ""mined"" around the world, it\'s hard to tell. There have been massive sell-offs and there\'s more irrational exuberance than knowledge ruling that market.\n\nBitcoin recently passed the $5,000 mark and is up more than 700% as of last week. I even saw an ad that offered a Bitcoin for a magazine subscription. Merchants are beginning to accept them in transactions.\n\nProf. Robert Shiller, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who\'s one of the world\'s experts on manias and bubbles, recently weighed in on the Bitcoin narrative in MONEY magazine:\n\n""It starts with Satoshi Nakamoto—remember him? The mysterious figure who may or may not be real. He’s never been found,"" Shiller said.\n\n""That has a nice mystery quality to it. And then he has this clever idea about encryption and blockchain and public ledgers, and somehow the idea is so powerful that governments can’t even stop it. You can’t regulate this. It kind of fits in with the angst of this time in history.""\n\nTo Shiller, to follow the money -- and track a bubble unfolding -- you need to follow the popular narrative and certain telltale statements:\n\n-- This time is different. Yes, cryptocurrencies are unique because they are created through blockchains. But does that make them immune to human nature? I doubt it.\n\n-- Greed and Fear Don\'t Apply. Well, I don\'t know when that\'s ever been the case. Although computers around the world are monitoring encrypted transactions, it won\'t block out speculators.\n\n-- The idea is bulletproof. And they said that about tulips, swampy real estate in Louisiana/Florida and tech stocks. Blockchain will change the world in its own way, but it won\'t curtail greed, which overrules common sense. And crashes will happen.\n\n-- Bubbles Can\'t Be Seen in Real Time. I\'ve heard a lot of economists say this. The last one was Alan Greenspan, who refused to say there was a credit bubble in 2006-07. We all know what happened in 2008.\n\nI\'m not saying that you shouldn\'t invest in cryptocurrencies, just treat them like the volatile vehicles they are.\n\nWould you load up your entire portfolio on tech stocks or mortgage derivatives? If the answer is no, then I think you\'ll have some degree of protection against the next bubble bursting.', 'The litecoin price [LTC to US dollar exchange rate] surged to an all-time high of over $90 on September 1, taking its year-to-date gains above 2,000 percent.\n\nBut while the cryptocurrency was riding high on technological advances, China’s abrupt ICO ban delivered a blow to momentum. Ethereum, bitcoin, bitcoin cash and so on tanked, and litecoin was no exception, dropping more than 15% on Monday to a 5-day low of $64.\n\nSince then, the cryptocurrency seems to have regained poise. Tuesday’s bullish inside day candle has been followed by a rise to $80 levels today.\n\nThe development is notable as an inside day candlestick pattern occurs when a security trades within the high and low range of the previous day. It works as a bullish signal if the price action on the following day is positive. On the contrary, a negative price action on the following day is read as a bearish signal.\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap, litecoin has seen the third biggest gains among the top 10 cryptocurrencies over the last 24 hours, ranking only below bitcoin cash [up 15.37 percent] and IOTA [up 13.72 percent]. LTC/USD traded at $78 at press time.\n\nWeek-on-week, the currency is trading largely unchanged. On a month-on-month basis, LTC is up 75.46%.\n\nWhat\'s behind the rally?\n\nLitecoin\'s rally is best seen not as an isolated event, but part of an increased institutional interest in the cryptocurrencies, triggered by a major rally in bitcoin this year. As it remains best known as the ""silver to bitcoin’s gold,"" the focus of the team behind litecoin has been to promote it as a payment method, especially as bitcoin continues to underperform in this area.\n\nAs LTC creator Charlie Lee said recently, ""Litecoin will provide a niche where it will be more used for payment, whereas bitcoin will be more used for storing.""\n\nYet, while it has a smaller network, with fewer merchants and miners, it\'s also showing signs its technology is advancing more quickly.\n\nLitecoin was the first major currency to activate a code upgrade called SegWit on May 10, moreover, SegWit activation opened doors for the Lightning Network on litecoin, which would allow for faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nOn September 1, Litecoin Foundation tweeted that the first Lightning Network-based litecoin transaction was successful.\n\nWill the rally continue?\n\nIn the short-run, everything depends on what bitcoin does next. In the long run, as with all cryptocurrencies, the fate of litecoin depends on how efficiently it creates a niche for itself.\n\nMany are also of the opinion that litecoin acts as a bitcoin-hedge. However, a crash in bitcoin will be a net negative for cryptocurrencies as bitcoin is the gold standard in the nascent market.\n\nLooking ahead, however, there are few signs of stress on technical charts.\n\nDaily chart\n\nThe sell-off from the record highs above $90 levels was pretty much in line with the overbought 14-day RSI in which price moved to the upside.\n\nSellers ran out of steam near the support offered by the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level of the rally from the August 8 low to September 1 high.\n\nAs discussed earlier, yesterday\'s bullish inside day candle and a positive action today is bullish. Thus, one can expect litecoin to revisit $90 levels.\n\nTrend reversal [bullish to bearish] would be confirmed only after a break below the September 4 low of $64.00.\n\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

It\'s comically difficult for ordinary investors to buy an actual barrel of crude oil, as Tracy Alloway of Bloomberg News found out a few years back.\n\nThe economist John Maynard Keynes, according to one possibly apocryphal story, once measured up the storage capacity of the chapel of King\'s College, Cambridge after coming perilously close to having to take delivery of a month\'s worth of the UK\'s wheat supply. Completing transactions in the real world is often so clunky that some banks are already exploring using, um, blockchains instead.\n\nWhat makes markets investable for the most part is not their physical foundations, but the superstructure of derivatives contracts, exchanges and clearing houses built on top.\n\nTo date, the world of bitcoin exchanges has been the wild west. When Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014, it said it had lost 850 000 coins worth more than $450m.\n\nAnother $70m-odd was stolen in a hack of Bitfinex last year. The likes of Deribit and Bitmex have been offering bitcoin futures and options for some time, but major institutional investors are only going to participate if they think the clearing and settlement process is rock-solid and the exchange itself reliably solvent.\n\nChange on that front is imminent. The Chicago Board Options Exchange is planning to start offering cash-settled bitcoin futures by next April, CNBC reported last week.\n\nTrading platform LedgerX last month won regulatory approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to act as a clearing house for derivatives settled in digital currencies. The ability to short or take leveraged positions in digital currencies could open them to a far wider array of investors.\n\nWhat, though, is the value of a digital currency?\n\nIt\'s a fair question, but one that could equally be leveled at gold. Since Richard Nixon ended the fixed $35 an ounce convertibility of gold in 1971, its value has risen at times (the 1970s, the 2000s) and fallen at others.\n\nThe best argument to justify investing in gold these days is not that it\'s an eternal ""store of value"" but that its very weirdness makes it special: According to modern portfolio theory, you should buy the shiny stuff not for its superior investment returns , but because it doesn\'t correlate much to other asset classes such as stocks, bonds and commodities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, while gold did exhibit weak or negative correlations to returns on the S&P 500 for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, it\'s been positively correlated for extended periods since then.\n\nDuring gold\'s 2012 run-up, the two moved more or less in tandem. If gold deserves investment dollars because its inconsistent correlation with equities helps diversify portfolios, the same argument can be made for bitcoin, too.\n\nDigital currencies may be as vulgar as the original barbarous relic, but neither is going away any time soon. If that makes investors in both look less like seers and more like problem gamblers betting on where a fly will land -- well, welcome to financial markets.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\n* David Fickling is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

The FCA said on Wednesday it was keeping a close eye on ICOs, which have proliferated over the past 12 months. Rapid price rises of digital tokens issued in the past year have brought a surge of speculative interest. In a discussion paper published in April, the FCA said rules that protect investors and stipulate what must be disclosed by an issuing company could apply to ICOs, depending on their structure. It added that more analysis was merited. It is expected that the FCA will publish further work this year. “Initial coin offerings [\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.] have various parallels with Initial Public Offerings, private placement of securities, or crowd sales. Depending on how they are structured, they may, therefore, fall into the regulatory perimeter,” the FCA’s discussion paper reads. A spokesman said on Wednesday that ICOs “are an issue that the FCA is aware of and has been looking at”. Earlier this week, the Chinese central bank outlawed ICOs. The activity is “essentially a form of unapproved illegal public financing behaviour” that also “[raises] suspicions” of illegal securities issuance, financial fraud and other “criminal activity”, according to a statement on Sunday from a group of seven agencies led by the People’s Bank of China. China has among the biggest demand for ICOs and virtual currencies. It is also trying to clamp down on capital flight. The announcement from Beijing has pushed down the value of bitcoin, the world’s best known cryptocurrency. It fell as much as 12.6 per cent to $4,046 following the announcement but has since recovered to $4,309. Regulators in Hong Kong and the US have taken a similar line to the FCA: rather than banning ICOs, they have warned some of them are likely to face regulatory scrutiny. Recommended Regulators move in on digital tokens after investor scams A currency designed for digital nomads Lex: Initial coin offerings — tales from the cryptos The US Securities and Exchange Commission warned in July that some ICO promoters had skirted securities laws by issuing digital tokens on behalf of “virtual” companies, rather than selling traditional securities. SEC scrutiny could force issuers to register their tokens with the regulator, while also drawing exchanges that trade them into the agency’s remit. The UK authorities have generally welcomed innovation and financial technology in the wake of the financial crisis, as one way to encourage competition with the biggest banks. The FCA has started to approve businesses that use the blockchain software that underpins digital currencies like bitcoin. The Bank of England, meanwhile, has recognised that the technology behind bitcoin might improve central banking services, and is at the early stages of examining a digital currency. But Mark Carney — the BoE governor who is also chair of the Financial Stability Board, which proposes rules for the G20 nations — has put “fin-tech” companies on notice to expect more regulatory scrutiny.

09/07/2017,"['NEO has gained 50 percent this Thursday, after a major cryptocurrency exchange announced it would add the asset for traders.\n\nThe Chinese platform’s token, which plummeted following the People’s Bank of China’s ban on ICOs, is currently trading around $34, up from lows of near $17.\n\nBitfinex announced the move on Twitter and its blog earlier today.\n\nWe are happy to announce that $NEO is now available for trading against USD, BTC & ETH!\n\n\n\nFull announcement here: https://t.co/dgZeJjgQSW — Bitfinex (@bitfinex) September 7, 2017\n\n“Bitfinex is excited to support the NEO ecosystem and the team behind the token, and to experience first hand the growth and development of the project,” it commented.\n\nAltcoins have staged a broad comeback in the days following the initial crackdown in China on Monday.\n\nChina ICO story not over\n\nBitcoin has also reversed its previous losses, continuing to trade at around $4600 as of press time from lows of $4008 earlier in the week.\n\nNEO had received mixed support following the events, with commentators eagerly awaiting reactions from developers as to how the platform would continue operating under a ban or future restrictions.\n\nThe latest information from the PBoC meanwhile suggests the story is not over for ICOs in China, and that a regulated environment could surface. This, as witnessed earlier this year, would be a similar approach to that taken by Chinese regulators to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n“This current ban is a ‘stop’ but not a ‘forbidden,’” a source close to regulators told a Chinese TV station in an interview.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'The transparency of Bitcoin goes a long way in determining the price of the digital currency, as much of the market movement can be put down to where the money is moving. However, it is a lot harder to figure out to whom the money is moving.\n\nFinancial markets are determined by supply and demand factors, as well as information on who owns an asset and who wants to buy that asset. This of course relies on market transparency, as traders and insiders watch what hedge funds and pension funds are doing with their equity holdings.\n\nBitcoin is obviously slightly different as the digital currency is transparent - but anonymous.\n\nBitcoin ownership is not transparent\n\nWhile transactions and the movement of Bitcoin is open and available on the ledger, the name behind those transactions is anonymous, just a string of usually untraceable letters and numbers.\n\nThis of course makes it a bit more difficult to determine who owns Bitcoin, and where money is moving or staying, but this is seen as a positive for the digital currency.\n\nIn this digital world where cybercrime and hacking is always around the corner, those with sizeable investments in Bitcoin would prefer to remain anonymous so as to not set a target on their backs - additionally, they can spread the wealth across a number of wallets.\n\nBamboozling the IRS\n\nOf course, not being able to tie mass fortunes down to certain individuals makes it frustrating for financial regulators trying to keep tabs on money for legal and illegal uses.\n\nThe IRS has had to rely on the trust of Bitcoin users in declaring taxable gains, but when in 2015 only 802 individuals claimed profits or losses in relation to Bitcoin transactions, it was clear that anonymity was being abused.\n\nHowever, there are motions in play to help governmental institutions to track users and their Bitcoin, but it’s being met with resistance.\n\nThe Bitcoin rich list\n\nThe website BitcoinRichList, suggests that the top 100 Bitcoin addresses own around 17 percent of all Bitcoins.\n\nThis figure stood closer to 20 percent in August 2016, so one can assume that the ensuing 800 percent rally in prices since then has seen some larger holders taking profits amid increased and broadening participation.\n\nBreaking the anonymity\n\nOf course, while it’s easy to hide behind the anonymity afforded by Bitcoin, many come out and show off proudly their investments in the digital currency.\n\nThe biggest names in the business that are loud and proud are Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who once said they owned one percent of all Bitcoins. That would be around 1.65 mln at the current level that has been mined.\n\nIt is also believed that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who is rumored to have over one million coins, has spread his coins across wallets.\n\nThe other big players in Bitcoin include those involved in its creation, mining, or exchanges of the digital currency.\n\nNames like Tony Gallippi, the Chairman of virtual currency processor Bitpay, who is said to have $20 mln invested in Bitcoin, or Dave Carlson, a software engineer who set up Bitcoin mining company MegaBigPower.', 'You read that title right. In a PR stunt of the decade, a real estate company called Aston Plaza Crypto is riding the Blockchain mania in Dubai and has partnered with BitPay to sell property for Bitcoin in Dubai’s Science Park, a district 20 minutes away by car from downtown Dubai.\n\nCrypto-mania\n\nIt looks like 2017 is shaping up to be the year of crypto: first, we had Paris Hilton advertising ICOs, and now we have apartments being sold for cryptocurrencies in Dubai. I think we can all agree that Bitcoin is finally hitting mainstream audiences with all this news.\n\nCurrently under construction, the 250 mln sterling pound project is set to be home to two towers and a mall. The 40-floor towers will include luxury studio apartments as well as one and two bedroom open plan apartments. As of this writing, the cheapest studio is going for 28.15 BTC (approximately $127,500), while the largest two bedroom apartments are selling for around 75 BTC.\n\nThe Baroness\n\nAston Plaza is a joint venture between the Isle of Man based Knox group and Baroness Michelle Mone, a British member of the House of Lords. In an interview with CNBC news, the Baroness said that Bitcoin is “the currency of the future.”\n\nShe added:\n\n“I think because everything is logged and registered, everything\'s transparent, that I wouldn\'t be getting involved in it — especially from the House of Lords element, I\'m a Baroness — so I wouldn\'t be getting involved in it if it was a kind of \'dodgy\' industry.""\n\nBy mimicking a real-life ICO, the joint venture has offered up to a 20 percent discount on these under-construction properties to early birds paying in Bitcoin. Of the 1,133 apartments, 480 have already been sold in fiat, while the remainder are up for grabs for Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nReal estate on the Blockchain\n\nAcross the globe, the business behind real estate has always been traditional and boring, but this is all about to change as more and more countries are looking into testing a way to buy and sell land and house deeds more securely and efficiently on the Blockchain.\n\nAston Plaza is not the first to take advantage of the Blockchain’s hype factor for real estate. Take Omar Kassim for example: In 2011, he founded JadoPado, a UAE-based e-commerce platform that was recently acquired by the Dubai billionaire Mohammad Al Abbar as part of an effort to launch a competitor to Amazon in the Middle East.\n\nToday, Omar is working on an open source real estate asset management business platform called Esanjo.\n\nAnd Omar is not the only one. In fact, there have been rumors that Smart Dubai, the initiative created by Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashed, is working on a way to transfer property ownership directly over the Blockchain.', 'Bitcoin wallet and technology giant Blockchain.info is entering the Indian market via a partnership with leading Indian bitcoin exchange Unocoin.\n\nBlockchain, the world’s most widely used bitcoin wallet, is now available for users in India to buy and hold their bitcoins. In an announcement today, Blockchain revealed it has integrated Unocoin within its wallet dashboard to enable Indian users to buy the cryptocurrency.\n\nSpeaking to CCN, Unocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath revealed details of the partnership, stating:\n\nThe entire idea is – whenever a customer buys bitcoin through Blockchain.info, the bitcoins will get delivered directly to their blockchain wallet. A user will not be holding their bitcoin balance with Unocoin, where we control their funds.\n\nIn essence, Unocoin will process the fiat transactions locally in India for Blockchain users where purchases will see bitcoin(s) bought and stored directly in the user’s Blockchain wallet, where the user holds the private keys.\n\nThe process entails linking a user’s bank account details before submitting KYC forms to buy bitcoin through Blockchain.\n\nOf the 16.6 million users on Blockchain’s wallet service, Vishwanath also claimed that 1 million or so were Indian registrant. While\n\nThe new partnership will provide “an entry” point for Blockchain in India, he further added.\n\nVishwanath told CCN:\n\nFor Unocoin, it is millions of users that are gaining exposure to us. It is a win-win-win, for customers, Unocoin and Blockchain.\n\n“India is our 35th market and after demonetization, there has been an unprecedented surge in people using Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies,” Blockchain co-founder Nicolas Cary told the Economic Times. “For the past eight years, using bitcoins has been difficult with not many knowing about it. There have been issues on delays, verification issues and two-faced providers.”\n\n“Users will have full control of their bitcoins [with their private keys at Blockchain],” Vishawanath said, “as opposed to we [Unocoin] holding and having full control of their bitcoins.”\n\nBlockchain, one of the industry’s earliest and best-funded startups, recently raised a record $40 million in a fresh round of funding. Blockchain hit a milestone with 10 million wallet users in November 2016 and is quickly accelerating toward the 20 million user mark.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller has told CNBC viewers Bitcoin might “burst” again but could also “take off again.”\n\nSpeaking in a televised debate with host Brian Kelly, the well-known bubble ‘specialist’ appeared to soften his previous comments that Bitcoin was the “best example of a bubble.”\n\n“I don’t mean to demean the innovation and the technology… but it seems to me the enthusiasm for Bitcoin is a little bit out of proportion,” he commented.\n\n“Maybe in the future, there will be some great application of (these) cryptocurrencies.”\n\nShiller is the latest high-profile traditional finance figure to come out in skepticism of Bitcoin’s growth as prices circle $5,000, up four times since the start of the year.\n\nICO regulatory turmoil in China produced only temporary backtracking, with prices dipping to $4,000 before rebounding over 50 percent within days.\n\nSpeaking to famously bullish Kelly, the Yale professor reiterated his theory that Bitcoin’s popularity was nonetheless due to its “story,” including the “mysterious” nature of its creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n“It’s the quality of the story that’s attracting all this interest,” he hypothesized.\n\nKelly retorted that as a source of return on investment, Bitcoin held too much promise to overlook, regardless of its future implementations.\n\n“Worst case scenario, if all it ever becomes is digital gold and it can only capture five percent of gold’s market cap, then Bitcoin’s price will be $25,000,” he said to Shiller.\n\n“So for me, on a risk-reward basis, I’ll take that risk-reward … all day long.”\n\nLast month during a spate of volatility caused by Bitcoin Cash, Kelly told CNBC viewers to buy Bitcoin at what he predicted was a “floor” of $3,600.', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\nBTC/USD 07.09.2017\n\nChinese ICO ban was this week’s hot topic. The news hit the market and it instantly reacted. Bitcoin looked stronger than the rest of the market but was going down as well.\n\nThe $4400 support level was easily hit, even though it used to be a key level in August.\n\nCurrent situation:\n\nSince the downfall was caused by the big news, the resistance zones did not work out. As a result, a local $4400 support zone has been formed.\n\nFollowing the news, BTC hit a strong uptrend line. A strong downtrend formation could have started, but the price has recovered really fast. It’s a rather bullish sign.\n\nThe major news flow is expected later this year in November.\n\nScenarios:\n\n$5000 high test. BTC will probably test high if the rest of the market will show strong growth. For now, no strong triggers that could cause movement.\n\nIn case of the market being stable, $4400 level can show its strength. During possible slight corrections watch for volumes around the $4400 zone. This level has been rather strong in August, so it’s possible that buyers’ consolidation will happen there.\n\n$4000 test. Round levels are traditionally very strong. $4000 level is no exception. If the general market correction happens, then this level will become a key one for a second time in a row.\n\nGenerally, after the previous strong movements $5000->$4000->$4500 there will be a volatility decrease in BTC and next week will be rather calm.\n\nETH/USD 07.09.2017\n\nIf Bitcoin was slightly influenced by the ICO ban in China, the news has impacted ETH directly. Just in a few hours the price dropped from $375 to $280. Very strong downfall stopped at $280 resistance zone, that had been in place since the beginning of August.\n\nGenerally, the news from China has been overvalued by the market. The same as in the SEC case, the recovery has been quite fast.\n\nCurrent situation and scenarios:\n\n$280 support zones have remained. If there’s more negative news, this level is the most important.\n\nIn September, many new ETH announcements are expected. The closer the Metropolis release, the more news buzz we’ll see.\n\nThere’s global $395 resistance zone and $395 high tests look very logical.\n\nThe volume of transactions and number of ICOs continues to grow.\n\nThe current situation in ETH is fine, a strong downfall has been bought out and movement towards $395 goal has continued. The market is growing easily, as there is no strong resistance from sellers.\n\nIf nothing out of the ordinary happens, we will see $395 tests closer to the middle of the month.\n\nLTC/USD 07.09.2017\n\nLTC has been making investors happy in the latest days. Strong basis and literate PR from the project leader has led to a strong movement in LTC and new historic maximum.\n\nTechnical situation\n\nThe historical maximum above $90 has formed. This zone is resistance right now.\n\nNews feed, heated by Charlie Li, is very strong.\n\nLTC is one of the leaders in trading volumes over the last couple of days. Mortgage rates are at a very high level.\n\nLTC also fell down a bit following Chinese news, but right now it is a recovery leader.\n\nLTC shows really bullish moods, because of the Lightning Network news. In case of full-blown LN implementation, the strong price rally will follow. This news attracts many long term investors.\n\nIf we talk about the next week, the most likely turn of events is high tests. The closest resistance is around $90 zone. If there is no negative, maximums tests are very likely.\n\nIf there is not enough buyers to make a full blown test, then volatility decrease and consolidation is possible.\n\nTraders should watch for volumes and control the risks.', ""Bitcoin's returns have had almost zero correlation with US equities, gold, and the Euro, which makes it attractive as a diversifier.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's volatility has been decreasing over time and during certain periods is less than that of some individual stocks.\n\nIt is hard for any investor not to have their curiosity piqued by the meteoric rise in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But, such a rise obviously leads to talk about bubbles and comparisons with tulipmania of the 1630s and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. In this article, I look at some data for the top ten market capitalization cryptocurrencies and see what the data seems to tell us.\n\nTable 1 shows a list of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization as reported by the website coinmarketcap.com on September 1, 2017. Bitcoin is still the dominant currency with its market cap exceeding the total value of the other nine. Two of the ten have a severely limited history. Bitcoin Cash came into existence on August 1, 2017, and Iota came into existence on June 13, 2017.\n\nThe coinmarketcap.com website provides historical data on all of these currencies and has information about where they obtain the prices. I used their historical data in the analysis that follows. Bitcoin came into existence in January 2009; however, the coinmarketcap.com data starts on April 28, 2013. The cryptocurrency market is fast-moving with many transactions on various exchanges. Serious problems have occurred on many exchanges. While I used the price data to perform various calculations, I think the reader should keep in mind that the data are actually a bit “fuzzy.”\n\nI will focus on returns rather than prices. As an example of a return calculation, Bitcoin increased 4.48% in value (based on the “closing” price) from 4382.66 on August 28, 2017, to 4579.02 on August 29, 2017. So 4.48% was the daily return for August 29, 2017. Note that since Bitcoin is continuously traded the concept of “closing” price is not strictly meaningful.\n\nVolatility damages long-run compound returns. Let’s say you purchase an asset at $100 and there is a 50% drop in value, resulting in a value of $50. To get back to your starting value of $100 then requires a 100% return. Figure 1 shows the volatility history for Bitcoin. It is a graph of the 30 calendar day standard deviation of daily returns. As can be seen, volatility itself has been volatile with some recent spikes. However, the overall trend is downward. While the dollar swings in the price of Bitcoin have become greater with the huge increase in price, the percentage fluctuations have generally been declining.\n\nThe three largest volatility spikes in Bitcoin occurred in December 2013, January 2015, and August 2017. The 2013 spike coincided with an announcement that the Chinese government was prohibiting Chinese financial institutions from using Bitcoin. The 2015 spike was driven by the hacking of the Bitstamp exchange. The most recent spike occurred as Bitcoin forked with the creation of Bitcoin Cash.\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap and while it is younger than Bitcoin does have a history dating back to August 7, 2015. Figure 2 shows its volatility history. Its volatility has also been generally declining although not quite as steeply as Bitcoin. If you look at the vertical scales of the graphs, you can see that Ethereum has actually been generally more volatile than Bitcoin.\n\nIn such fast-moving markets, history may be somewhat irrelevant if you are trying to invest today. The top ten crytpocurrencies only share a common history going back to August 1, 2017, so one month of data isn’t much. Table 2 below shows the mean daily return and standard deviation of their returns over the month of August. While Bitcoin’s advance from $2,718 to $4,7013 over August has attracted much attention, its return performance was about middle of the pack at 5th. IOTA and XMR actually had average returns of over twice that of Bitcoin. From a volatility perspective, Bitcoin did well with only Ethereum Classic having lower volatility. Bitcoin Cash’s volatility has been extremely high.\n\nThe basic inputs for standard portfolio theory calculations are returns, standard deviations, and correlations. Assets with low correlations are especially desirable from a risk-reduction viewpoint. Table 3 is a correlation matrix for the eight cryptocurrencies that have a history going back to July 25, 2016. Since lower correlations are more desirable they are highlighted in green. Ripple (XRP) has very low correlation with all of the other six. Since Ripple is used mostly by financial institutions and less by individuals this is understandable. Most of the other correlations, in the 0.2-0.4 range, are typical of publicly traded common stock. From a correlation perspective, two randomly chosen cryptocurrency pairs behave somewhat like pairs of randomly chosen stocks. This suggests that holding more than one cryptocurrency in a portfolio has good benefits in terms of risk reduction.\n\nSo far we have considered cryptocurrencies by themselves as possible investments. But, how do they behave compared to traditional investments? Since Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency and has the longest history, I will focus on it in the coming analysis. For comparison assets I chose the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOGL), the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and the Euro (denoted as EURUSD, the Euro-US Dollar exchange rate quoted as the cost of a Euro in US dollars). Since cryptocurrencies are types of currencies it seemed appropriate to compare it to another currency and the Euro seemed a logical choice.\n\nStocks are not traded on weekends, so I used Bitcoin closing prices on stock trading days for the calculations. Again, I focused on daily returns. Table 4 shows the average daily returns and the standard deviation of the daily returns calculated over April 29, 2013, to August 31, 2017, time period.\n\nAs can be seen, even though Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix enjoyed big run-ups in price over this period, Bitcoin far out-surpassed them. However, Bitcoin’s volatility was the greatest by a wide margin. The value of the Euro declined slightly over this period, but it had about 1/10th the volatility of Bitcoin.\n\nFigure 1 showed that Bitcoin’s volatility has declined over time. To compare changing volatilities over time I calculated 20-day standard deviations of daily returns. Twenty trading days is approximately equal to one calendar month. Figure 3 shows the ratio of Bitcoin’s standard deviation of daily returns divided by that of SPY. Bitcoin’s volatility has generally been about 5-10 times that of SPY but has been declining over time. There have been 2 huge outlier time periods. The first was around December 2013 and the second was around August 2017. Both of these periods were discussed above.\n\nDoing a similar comparison between Bitcoin and Facebook shows a different picture. Figure 4 shows that while Bitcoin’s relative volatility has been higher than FB, the ratio has generally been about 1-4 times. Since individual stocks are far more volatile than a stock index, this is not surprising. During certain periods of time Bitcoin’s volatility has actually been less than that of Facebook. But, its relative volatility has been increasing slightly over time. There was also a huge spike in relative volatility that occurred around April 2017, which was a period of unusually low volatility for Facebook.\n\nBitcoin has been described as a store of value related to fear, somewhat like gold. Figure 5 shows the comparison to GLD and is quite interesting. The relative volatility, while experiencing some variation, has overall remained quite steady at about 5 times that of GLD.\n\nFigure 6 shows the relative volatility comparison with the Euro. While the volatility has generally been 5-20 times for Bitcoin, there has been a reasonably steady decline in its relative volatility.\n\nTable 5 is very interesting. Gold and the Euro were negatively correlated with the equity assets over this period. The equity assets were also mildly positively correlated. However, Bitcoin had almost zero correlation with all 8 of the other assets. From a portfolio risk reduction viewpoint, this is quite attractive. Bitcoin is a unique asset.\n\nMy main conclusions are:\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s volatility has been extremely high, it does seem to be generally declining (the same is true for Ethereum). The standard deviation of Bitcoin’s daily returns has generally declined over time although it has spiked recently. Its volatility has also declined relative to SPY and the Euro.\n\nOf the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, recently Bitcoin has had the third lowest volatility. Ethereum classic has been the least volatile while Bitcoin Cash, the youngest of the bunch has been greatest by a wide margin.\n\nRipple (XRP) is somewhat of an outlier in terms of correlations with the other nine cryptocurrencies. It is basically uncorrelated with the others, which would make it desirable from a portfolio risk reduction viewpoint.\n\nCompared to equities, gold, and the Euro, Bitcoin’s volatility has been extremely high. However, during certain periods its volatility has been less than that of Facebook.\n\nBitcoin’s daily returns have had almost zero correlation with US equities, gold, and the Euro.\n\nCryptocurrencies are clearly very high-risk investments, however, their volatility will probably decline over time and their weak correlations with other assets offer desirable portfolio risk reduction possibilities. In addition, the technology (primarily blockchain) behind these cryptocurrencies may fuel non-speculative demand, but that is perhaps the basis of another article. I think that the time will come (perhaps in the next five years) when a substantial number of investors may be willing to place 1-5% of their portfolio into cryptoassets (cryptocurrencies, cryptotokens, publicly-traded funds, crytpto-related stocks, private equity, etc.).\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long BITCOIN AND ETHERUEM.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Jared Polis (D-Co) and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Az). Titled “The CryptoCurrency Tax Fairness Act,” the bill calls for Congress to create a so-called de minimus exemption for transactions under $600.\n\nIf the bill is passed, it would subject digital currency to a similar tax regime as what currently exists for foreign currency. It would also eliminate a disincentive for people to use bitcoin (and other digital assets like Ethereum and LiteCoin) in day-to-day transactions.\n\nThe taxing of digital currencies has become a big issue in the last year, in part because the price of digital currencies has soared so dramatically. Bitcoin, for instance, has soared from $1,000 at the start of 2017 to a recent high of $5000—meaning that anyone who has sold it or exchanged it or goods at retailers like Overstock is on the hook to declare capital gains.\n\nThe proposed exemption would thus eliminate this concern for small transaction. Meanwhile, the bill also calls for the Treasury Department to provide guidelines for reporting on profits and losses tied to digital currencies, which could create a regime that makes it easier for citizens to keep track of their tax obligations.\n\nAccording to the Coin Center, an advocacy group for digital currency, the current system requires cryptocurrency owners to keep track of all their transactions—and the related tax implications.\n\nGuidelines from the Treasury could, the Coin Center suggests, require digital currency exchanges to act more like conventional brokerages, which are obliged to create forms that describe their customers’ tax obligations.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe proposed CryptoCurrency Tax Fairness Act also comes amid a bitter and ongoing legal feud between the IRS and the country’s most popular digital currency exchange, Coinbase. The dispute flared up last year when the agency asked Coinbase last year to hand over detailed information about millions of customer accounts as part of an investigation into unpaid taxes (the IRS claims only 802 people declared bitcoin-related gains or losses in 2015.)\n\nIn response, Coinbase customers sued the IRS while senior Republicans in Congress warned the agency its investigation was too intrusive and overreaching. The IRS has since scaled back its demands though the legal fight continues.\n\nIt’s unclear if the bill, which so far lacks a companion piece of legislation in the Senate, will get anywhere given the current crowded agenda and political dysfunction in Washington. One hope may be for Reps. Polis and Schweikert to attempt to attach the measure to the larger project of tax reform.\n\nIn an email to Fortune, the Executive Director of Coin Center, Jerry Brito, said the process was still in early stages.\n\n“This bill was just introduced so I don’t think the strategy for its passage is very far along. But its promising to see that this bill is bipartisan, shouldn’t be controversial, and fits with the majority’s top priority for the year, which is tax reform,” said Brito.\n\nThis is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance.

It is more than $3 million, and not more than $300 million as originally stated.\n\nGMO Internet Group, based in Tokyo, normally does incredibly boring things like registering domain names and hosting web services. But it, too, has caught the bitcoin fever, one that some people think has created a bubble in valuations.\n\nGMO announced today that it plans to spend more than $3 million to start mining bitcoin in the first half of next year. Some $10 million is available for bitcoin miners to accumulate each day, at the current bitcoin price of around $4,600. The firm says cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will evolve into “universal currencies” that will create a global “borderless economic zone.”\n\nGMO plans to develop its own mining chips, claiming they will operate at an unprecedented degree of efficiency. If GMO successfully introduces the chips, it would trigger an arms race within the bitcoin mining industry. The proposed chips will use 7 nanometer nodes, which would be four times more energy efficient than the current industry standard 16 nm nodes. Because bitcoin mining is a competition, once 7 nm nodes are in use, all other miners will have to upgrade to stay in the game. “It’s clearly the next generation of miners,” said Diego Guiterrez, chief executive of RSK Labs, which develops software for miners.\n\nGMO’s business model for its mining unit resembles that of established players in the field, such as China’s Bitmain. GMO plans to operate its own mines, rent them to others, and develop its own chips that it will sell packaged as mining rigs. It plans to locate its mine in northern Europe, presumably some place with cheap, excess electric power. It says it will invest more than 10% of its non-current assets, which stood at around $32 million at the end of last year. Bitmain had no comment.\n\nA major new bitcoin miner could shake up the industry. Miners who haven’t fully paid off the costs of their current machines could wind up with obsolete mining rigs, with little chance of recouping the cost in future. “The ones at risk are the ones still trying to recover their investment because they will be four times less productive,” Guiterrez says. He expects most major players will be able to upgrade as the technology for 7 nm chips becomes generally available to the foundries who do much of the work of fabricating the chips. “The other [mining chip makers] will surely follow and create their own 7 nm chips if they are not already doing it,” he says. “As [chip fabricators] get the new technology, everybody can access it.”\n\nGMO’s arrival will allay fears that bitcoin mining had grown too dependent on Chinese chip designers and operators. Bitmain, for instance, operates mining pools that account for some 30% of all the processing power on the bitcoin network.\n\nRead next: China’s Bitmain dominates bitcoin mining.

09/08/2017,"['Bitcoin fell as much as 7.3 percent in the U.S. after a report claimed Chinese regulators ordered the nation’s digital exchanges to close, the second blow to the $150 billion cryptocurrency market after the country earlier this week outlawed initial coin offerings.\n\nA document has been issued for local Chinese regulators to implement the shutdown, Caixin reported today, citing unidentified people close to the nation’s internet financial risk prevention team. Earlier, bitcoin prices dropped 18 percent on the Chinese trading platform Huobi.com.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how the order is being conveyed to bitcoin exchanges in China. Wu Xing, a spokeswoman for Huobi, said the company hasn’t received such notices and is still in operation. Tian Ying, a spokeswoman for Okcoin, said the company hasn’t received such notices to shut down its exchange either.\n\nBitcoin fell 3.9 percent to $4399.54 as of 11:05 a.m. in New York, according to Coinbase.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China said on its website Monday that it had completed investigations into ICOs, and will strictly punish offerings in the future while penalizing legal violations in ones already completed. The regulator said that those who have already raised money must provide refunds, though it didn’t specify how the money would be paid back to investors.\n\nDigital startups use ICOs to raise money to fund their development and to create digital coins that are necessary to access the applications they are building. More than $2 billion has been raised through ICOs this year, according to Autonomous Research LLC.\n\n— With assistance by Belinda Cao, and Linly Lin', ""(This September 8 story was refiled to include full name of law firm in paragraph 3, to Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer from Arnold and Porter)\n\nBy John McCrank\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for exchange-traded funds that would provide exposure to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is strong, but regulators will likely wait until the underlying market matures more before approving such products, a panel of securities industry experts said on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the first U.S. ETF tracking bitcoin in March after a three-year review process, but a month later the regulator said it would revisit the ruling.\n\n“I didn’t see an outright, ‘bitcoin, we hate it, we won’t do it,'” said Kathleen Moriarty, a partner at law firm Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer who helped develop the first U.S. ETF.\n\n“It was more, ‘it’s bitcoin, it’s still a little funky, let’s wait,'” she said at an ETF event in Washington DC hosted by the SEC and New York University.\n\nVirtual currencies can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Bitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, France, May 27, 2015. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nBut they also present risks to investors given their limited adoption, a number of massive cyber security breaches affecting cryptocurrency owners and exchanges, and the lack of consistent treatment of the assets by governments.\n\nFor instance, China on Monday banned initial coin offerings (ICOs), where digital currencies are sold publicly and then often traded on secondary exchanges, and the price of bitcoin plunged more than 10 percent as a result.\n\nThat sort of price volatility is at the heart of the problem of creating cryptocurrency-tracking ETFs, said Ananth Madhavan, head of global ETF research at Blackrock (BLK.N).\n\nThe SEC in July deemed tokens issued through ICOs, which have help startup companies raise more than $1 billion this year, can be considered securities, making them subject to disclosure laws and regulatory scrutiny to protect investors.\n\nThe SEC also said this week it has a number of active investigations into firms that have claimed to be in the digital currency business.\n\nDespite such hurdles, interest in creating cryptocurrency-based ETFs is strong, said Laura Morrison, Global Head of Exchange Traded Products at CBOE Holdings Inc’s (CBOE.O) Bats exchange, the would-be listing venue for the bitcoin ETF under review by the SEC.\n\nShe said she gets three to five calls a week from prospective issuers wanting to explore cryptocurrency-based ETFs.\n\n“The progress seems slow, there is no doubt about it, but the importance of proper regulation will help to pave this road,” she said."", 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s finance ministry wants to regulate the circulation of crypto-currencies involving Russian citizens and firms, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Friday.\n\nRussian financial authorities initially treated any sort of money issued by non-state approved institutions as illegal but later accepted the globally booming market of crypto-currencies.\n\n“The state understands indeed that crypto-currencies are real. There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them,” Siluanov said.\n\nBy the end of this year, the finance ministry will finish working on a law that would define a procedure for buying crypto-currencies, which would also include registration of those willing to buy the virtual money, Siluanov said.\n\nBuying of crypto-currencies should be similar to buying securities, such as treasury bonds for households launched by the finance ministry this year, Siluanov said.\n\nHe did not explain what the criteria would be for establishing which crypto-currency transactions would be subject to Russian regulations.\n\nSpeaking at a financial forum in central Moscow, Siluanov warned that investments in volatile crypto-currencies are risky and insecure. Previously the Russian central bank said such currencies were used in illegal operations, such as money laundering, and promised to crack down on the instrument.\n\nBitcoin, the most well-known virtual currency that emerged in mid-2010, is increasingly popular worldwide and in Russia as it promises substantial profits. One bitcoin last traded at around $4,460 BTC=BTSP, up from its initial price of less than $1.\n\nSiluanov said investors should be aware of risks related to virtual currencies. He said his ministry’s task was to “make investments into such instruments regulated.... We must make an organized market out of the black market.”', 'Oaktree Capital founder Howard Marks has bitcoin on his mind.\n\nMarks, who called bitcoin, the digital coin up over 350% this year, a ""fad"" in a July memo, has warmed up to it after receiving backlash from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nMarks revisited his thoughts on the digital coin in a wide-ranging memo sent out to clients on Thursday. The long and short of the note: Marks has changed his mind, but he still has reservations about the red-hot cryptocurrency.\n\nMarks said he might have been too quick to dismiss the idea that bitcoin can be considered a currency akin to the US dollar.\n\n""What bitcoin partisans have told me subsequently is that bitcoin should be thought of as a currency – a medium of exchange – not an investment asset,"" Marks wrote. ""Given that the evolution of bitcoin is so topical, I think further discussion is in order.""\n\nAfter exploring the key characteristics of a currency, Marks concedes that bitcoin does, in fact, share characteristics of money. Specifically, its use as a form of legal tender and a store of value.\n\n""So my initial bottom line is that I see no reason why bitcoin can’t be a currency,"" Marks said.\n\nBut this doesn\'t mean Marks is completely on board with the bitcoin trade. According to Marks, just because bitcoin can be considered a currency, doesn\'t mean it\'s not in a speculative bubble. Here\'s Marks (emphasis ours):\n\nBeing willing to agree that bitcoin may become an accepted medium of exchange is not the same as saying you should buy it now to make money. Think about the fact that the price of bitcoin has risen more than 350% so far this year and 3,900% in the last three years. To the degree people argue that bitcoin is a currency, then (a) why is it so volatile? and (b) is that desirable? You might want to consider whether a real currency can do that, or whether speculative buying is determining bitcoin’s price. And whether what’s gone up can come down.\n\nThat said, Marks, a self-professed ""bitcoin dinosaur,"" is open to further debate.\n\n""I’m willing to be proved wrong,"" he concluded.', 'Bitcoin-friendly congressman Jared Polis has introduced legislation that could allow US citizens to pay in cryptocurrency without reporting it for tax.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act, a bipartisan effort with Republican David Schweikert, aims to give everyone a $600 leeway to use crypto without needing to submit a tax return to the IRS later.\n\nBitcoin and virtual currencies are still classed as property in the US, obligating users to report any form of gains or losses on holdings each tax year, regardless of amount.\n\nThe issue is especially poignant in 2017, as the US’s largest exchange Coinbase battles the IRS in what consumers and politicians alike have criticized as an “overly broad” tax investigation.\n\n“To keep up with modern technology, we need to remove outdated restrictions on cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and other methods of digital payment,” Polis said in a press release Thursday.\n\n“By cutting red tape and eliminating onerous reporting requirements, it will allow cryptocurrencies to further benefit consumers and help create good jobs.”\n\nWashington is currently home to the Blockchain Caucus, a joint initiative begun in February by Polis aiming to increase education and awareness of virtual currency among the echelons of US politics.\n\nCommenting on the new act, Coin Center CEO Jerry Brito, who worked with Polis on the Caucus, said it would create a “level playing field.”\n\n“We applaud Representatives Polis and Schweikert for their leadership in introducing the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act, which would treat cryptocurrencies similarly to how foreign currency is now treated and relieve users from having to keep track of small personal transactions,” he said.\n\n“Not only will this create a level playing field for digital currencies, it will also help unleash innovation on applications like micropayments, which can consist of dozens of transactions per minute and thus are difficult to square with the current law.”', 'The Week of the Altcoins\n\nThis graph show how prices have changed since the midnight December 7th with prices at that point being rebased to 100\n\nPrices as of 11:59 PM UTC 13/12/17 (Source: coinmarketcap)\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen another week of volatility.

XRP has also been riding the wave, seeing a 50% price hike from last week.\n\n1. Bitcoin Futures Live on Cboe\n\nThe Story\n\nPlans to launch bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange have gone ahead as contracts began trading at 23:00 GMT on Sunday. The contracts will allow investors to bet on the future value of bitcoin. On the news bitcoin’s price rose significantly.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThe contract allows individuals to bet on bitcoin’s price at a specified time in the future. Given bitcoin’s rise of over 1,000% this year, many investors are keen to get in on the action; CBOE’s Bitcoin futures contract will enable investors to do so without actually owning the cryptocurrency. Additionally, it will be possible to short sell the digital asset for the first time, allowing investors to profit from price falls.\n\nThe move suggests the cryptocurrency is now becoming a mainstream investment, however, Bitcoin remains to be traded on unregulated markets. Consequently, its price is likely to remain volatile.\n\nHigh Volatility\n\nIn an effort to ease volatility, the CBOE decided it would suspend trading for two minutes for price fluctuations of more than 10% and five minutes for more than 20%. In the contract’s first session, trading was stopped twice: once for two minutes and once for five minutes. While bitcoin remains traded on largely unregulated markets, it is questionable whether this policy will have any effect on the underlying cryptocurrency’s volatility.\n\nThe Future\n\nBloomberg’s Adam Haigh said the futures contracts was “an incremental step that allows Wall Street and indeed the professional finance community to make a bet either way on bitcoin.” The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is expected to list a similar contract next week, and Nasdaq has announced plans to host such trading too.\n\nLast week Revolut’s decision to facilitate the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could increase demand for the underlying asset.\n\nAllegations that 1,000 people own 40% of all bitcoins in circulation suggest its price could be manipulated by a relatively small number of individuals.\n\n2. 1,000 People Apparently Own 40% of Bitcoin\n\nThe Winklevoss twins invest $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. (Attribution: By cellanr [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Story\n\nRoughly 40% of the cryptocurrency is owned by 1,000 people, claims Aaron Brown, head of financial markets research at AQR Capital Management. In such an unregulated market, Brown said large holders of bitcoin could potentially be working together to orchestrate price changes. Given bitcoin’s recent spike, now could be a great opportunity for these users to part with a portion of their bitcoins, locking in the near 1600% price increase since the start of the year.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nBitcoin appears to be making its way into mainstream investing. Last Friday the US regulator gave the CME group and CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch bitcoin futures. Just yesterday, London-based digital banking company Revolut launched Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether trading for their users.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency becomes a more mainstream investment and demand for it rises, these bitcoin ‘whales’ will be able to part with their bitcoins for a hefty profit. This could leave new investors with an asset in the midst of a bubble.\n\nRoger Ver, a well known early adopter of bitcoin said, regarding ‘whales’ working together, “I suspect that is likely true, and people should be able to do whatever they want with their own money.”\n\nWhile the question of whether Brown’s allegation is true must be approached with scepticism, there is evidence of some very large investors in the space. Bloomberg recently reported that on November 12th, “someone moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, worth about $159 million at the time, to an online exchange.” Bitcoin’s market cap is roughly $270bn at the time of writing, but if this investor was to sell on a single exchange, it could potentially crash the market.\n\nLarge Bitcoin Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who gained fame for attempting to take control of Facebook, invested $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. This amount has many times over.\n\nTim Draper, a billionaire venture capitalist best known for his investment in Skype – during the companies early days – bought 30,000 bitcoins back in 2014. He has since invested in Tezos’ ICO.\n\nBarry Silbert, the founder of the Digital Currency Group, picked up 48,000 bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was worth $350 a piece.\n\n3. Ethereum Wallet Scam Closed Down\n\nThe Story\n\nDigital wallet provider myetherwallet.com announced yesterday that it had no affiliation with an iOS-based cryptocurrency wallet app using its name. The app, which became the third most popular on the finance section of the App Store, allows users to import and open a digital wallet to store ether. Fake digital wallets could lose investors their cryptocurrencies permanently, so it is important investors (and app stores) keep an eye out for scams.\n\nSecurity and Ethereum\n\nIn July, a developer error on the ethereum network meant a hacker pocket $31m worth of ether. While the technology is still in its infancy mistakes are bound to be made. However, several digital wallet hacks have emerged since cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and users need to take security seriously while safeguards are not in place.\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies security, the owness is with the users. Sending ether from a digital wallet means I am responsible for my transfers. If I make a mistake when typing in the amount, or address of the receiver, I cannot call my bank and ask them to void the transaction. Consequently, user’s wallets are being targeted by scammers.\n\nSo far there have been no reports that the fake wallet stole from anyone. The company may have simply used the name for its familiarity in the ethereum community.\n\nMyetherwallet.com have since announced the removal of the app from the iOS store.\n\n4. San Francisco ICO Closed Down by SEC\n\nThe Story\n\nSan Francisco-based restaurant reviewing app Munchee has been forced to stop its initial coin offering (ICO) and reimburse investors after regulators raised concerns over the company’s tokens not meeting securities regulations. Munchee was looking to obtain $15m to “improve an existing iPhone app centred on restaurant meal reviews and create an “ecosystem” in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens,” according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHowever, “in the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasized that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens,” they added. The regulator felt investors were led to believe they would gain a return on their tokens, however, the tokens did not meet the authority’s standards. The company was not fined due to its quick response to the SEC’s requests.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nLast week PlexCoin’s founders were charged with defrauding investors. This was the first time the SEC’s newly established Cyber Unit filed charges. The regulator issued a statement back in July saying ICOs will be subject to US security laws.\n\nBoth cases suggest a serious commitment to ensuring investors are not mis-sold securities, particularly in the ICO space.\n\n5. Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Not A Substitute for Gold\n\nSource: Tradingeconomics.com\n\nThe Story\n\nThe simultaneous rise of bitcoin and relatively poor performance of gold has provoked many to ask whether the two assets are in competition. The short answer is no, they are not.\n\n“Bitcoin has real potential, if it were to become digital gold it might have tremendous space to grow,” said Gabor Gurbacs, Vaneck Securities Director of Digital Asset Strategy. It is this sentiment which has put the two in contest. However, the investor pool for each is “vastly different”, according to Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.\n\nGold based exchange-traded funds are currently at close to their highest since May 2013, suggesting the metal remains part of investor’s portfolios, and not that investors have not cashed out and moved over to bitcoin. The reason this is not the case lies in comparing the function each asset serves and the investors it attracts.\n\nComparing Bitcoin and Gold\n\nBitcoin attracts more speculative investors looking for quick returns, while gold is often held as a portion of investment portfolios to spread risk. In times of economic downturn gold tends to go up in price, balancing any losses from stocks and bonds. The two assets currently serve distinct purposes. Consequently, bitcoin’s price rise is unlikely to have turned investors away from gold.\n\n6. Jamie Dimon Eases Hostility Towards Bitcoin After Futures Contracts Go Live\n\nSource: By Steve Jurvetson (Flickr: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Story\n\nSource: CNBC\n\n“I remain highly skeptical of it,” said JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon, when recently asked about bitcoin. “I’m open-minded to uses of cryptocurrency if properly controlled and regulated,” Dimon added. The executive, who famously called bitcoin a “fraud” appears to have softened his opinion just days after the bitcoin-based futures derivative began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThis is the first time Dimon has spoken about bitcoin for two months. The timing of Dimon’s comments might suggest JPMorgan will offer the bitcoin derivative to its clients. The contract would allow clients to take long or short positions on bitcoin’s price.\n\nSimilar contracts will trade on the CME and Nasdaq exchanges in the near future.\n\n7. Cryptocurrency as Collateral for Loans\n\nThe Story\n\nA growing number of early cryptocurrency adopters, who have seen astronomical gains, will now be able to use their cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans. London-based Nebeus is helping third-party lenders create loans guaranteed by cryptocurrency collateral. The company created 100 of these loans on its first day and has made 1,000 more since says Nebeus’ Managing Director Konstantin Zaripov.\n\nGiven bitcoin’s market cap of almost $300bn, and a total cryptocurrency market cap of over $500bn, the market for these loans could be colossal. However, some worry that these assets are in a bubble, and their collapse makes these loans hugely risky for lenders.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nAround 40% of all bitcoins are held by 1,000 people, Bloomberg reported last week. Prior to this innovation, these users would only be able to cash in on their gains by selling their cryptocurrencies. “I can see a lending industry in the tens of billions of dollars,” said Aaron Brown, former managing director at AQR Capital Management.\n\nThe loans could attract attention from cryptocurrency miners, who earn tokens for processing blockchain network transactions. This group are typically ideologically attached to the idea of decentralised currencies, and such loans could allow them to hold on to their cryptocurrencies while they cover their overheads.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s 1700% rise since the start of the year has caused many to stay clear. A collapse of these digital assets would leave lenders in a tough position.\n\nMust Read Articles\n\nBitcoin, Ripple and Cryptocurrencies: Here to Stay and Prosper\n\nIt is nigh on impossible to observe financial news without hearing about the rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which recently surpassed the $15,000 mark and is continuously setting new all-time highs. ..

Almost immediately after the legalization of Bitcoin by the Japanese government, GMO and its forex exchange prepared a full systematic adoption and integration of Bitcoin.\n\nIn May, within merely five months since the company made its first announcement to target the Bitcoin industry, it launched the Z.com Coin exchange to address exponential increase in demand toward Bitcoin.\n\nIn a public statement translated by BraveNewCoin, the Z.com development team announced that it will aim to serve institutional and retail investors by providing a more stable and efficient trading platform.\n\nThe Z.com team said:\n\n“We will provide customers with a stable trading environment and judge whether it is necessary to conduct additional service verification and system adjustment for the platform to be used with confidence. The start date of the service has been postponed to May 31, 2017.”\n\nUpon the completion of the construction of its Bitcoin mining center in mid-2018, the GMO Group will have established a full Bitcoin infrastructure, beginning with a Bitcoin exchange targeting institutional investors and a mining center.\n\nWhy is GMO trying to establish a Bitcoin infrastructure?\n\nTo this date, the vast majority of investors, analysts and users within the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community are not aware of the level of mainstream Bitcoin adoption in Japan. Some of the largest and most influential companies in the country in the retail, electronics and hotel industries have integrated Bitcoin as a currency and a payment method.\n\nThe demand toward Bitcoin from both casual and institutional investors have been increasing at such a rapid rate in Japan, South Korea and China that multi-billion dollar companies in all three countries have either invested in or led large-scale Bitcoin projects.\n\nMore importantly, the Bitcoin mining sector is dominated by only a handful of companies including Bitmain, Bitfury and BTC.com. With its resources and capital in hand, the GMO Group likely felt that it could evolve into a key player in the Bitcoin mining industry by competing with Bitmain and other leading companies.\n\nBut, Bitmain also recently secured a $50 mln investment from Sequoia Capital and IDG Capital, further solidifying its position as the leading Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer and pool operator in the global market.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Bitmain claimed that its valuation is in the billions of US dollars if it was to go public via an IPO or raise a major funding round.', 'Securities regulators in the Canadian province of British Columbia have granted an official registration to an investment firm that plans to launch a bitcoin-tied fund.\n\nThe British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) granted the registration to cryptocurrency investment firm First Block Capital Inc.

This in turn has impacted the Bitcoin market.\n\nSince then, many reports have surfaced on how the Bitcoin bubble has now officially burst. Only time will tell.\n\nMore of What's Trending on TheStreet :"", 'Composizione dell\'autore\n\nIt\'s time to stop talking about Bitcoin as if ""one bitcoin"" is a normal thing that anyone uses or even owns. It\'s bullshit.\n\nOne bitcoin, indicated as ""1.0"" in the system, is worth more than $4,000 USD right now. What you may not know, though, is that ""one bitcoin"" can actually be divided into one million bits and sent one bit at a time, if you want. In fact, ""one bitcoin"" doesn\'t really exist. What does exist are granular entries on a digital ledger that can be bundled together until they add up to whatever amount of bits that you want to send—usually something like .0035, which is equal to $15 USD.\n\nThink of it this way. If Bitcoin were ever used as a normal currency (and this is seeming more and more like a long shot), you\'d go to your coffee shop and say, ""One coffee, please,"" and the barista would say, ""That\'ll be .00057."" If you buy a domain name using Bitcoin today, the service will ask you to pay .00274, give or take a decimal place. A pair of Yeezys costs .0568 BTC. Even if you paid your rent in Bitcoin, which is most people\'s largest lump sum expense in a month, it would still be just .3 bitcoin. If you really want to pay a whole bitcoin for something, you\'d have to buy a used car. Practically speaking, with Bitcoin\'s present value it just doesn\'t make sense to treat a whole coin as the basic denomination and break it down from there.\n\nThere was a time when you could talk about whole coins as something people own and use. Specifically, around 2012 when one bitcoin was worth between $1 and $5 USD. That was a base denomination that made sense. But now, that same denomination—""one bitcoin""—is equivalent to more money than many of us see in a month. Estimates for how many Bitcoin addresses actually hold a whole coin illustrate what this means in practice: around 95 percent of all Bitcoin addresses contain less than one bitcoin. Some people may have more than one Bitcoin address, or even several, but the existence of a ""Bitcoin one percent"" has been a specter in the community for years. If a person of average means decides to pony up and invest $1,000 of their hard-earned dollars in Bitcoin, they\'d still have just .23 of a coin.\n\nImage: Reddit\n\nBitcoin\'s present value makes ""one bitcoin"" useless as a base denomination, but over the years there\'ve been several proposals for other denominations as Bitcoin\'s value rose and transactions became more fractional. Some units, like the satoshi, have made their way into semi-common parlance. One satoshi is worth .00000001 BTC, or a fraction of a cent at current prices. There\'s also the milli-bitcoin (.001), the micro-bitcoin (.000001), and more. Some have even proposed simply going by bits, making one bitcoin a denomination of one million bits being sent through the Bitcoin network. Which to choose?\n\nBitcoin\'s volatility makes this choice extremely difficult. A denomination of bits that are equal to $1 USD today could be worth $10 tomorrow, or much less. Regardless, the current situation is clear: whole bitcoins aren\'t for normal people, and so if Bitcoin is ever going to be a mass payment system, we should be talking about something more realistic.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.']"
09/09/2017,"['After all, according to the three largest Chinese bitcoin exchanges OKCoin, Huobi and OKCoin themselves, China-based cryptocurrency trading platforms are not being banned by local financial regulators.\n\nEarlier today, on September 9, state-owned financial news publication Caixin reported that the Chinese government is planning on shutting down bitcoin exchanges within its local market. Bitcoin expert and Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow clarified that Caixin failed to provide any relevant sources in regard to its report and that it is likely not true. However, many analysts suggested the possibility of Caixin obtaining insider knowledge from Chinese financial regulators, considering its connections to the government.\n\nWhether the report originated from an insider source or was simply not a factual report, OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC denied receiving directives or requests of any sort from PBoC and local financial regulators. More to that, in an announcement published in online bitcoin communities and Chinese social media platforms, OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC reassured their users that they have always successfully complied with the government’s requests and policies regarding bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nA statement from OKCoin translated by CnLedger read:\n\n“We (OKCoin) have not received any notice from regulators, and therefore cannot confirm the validity of the report. OKCoin will always comply with local regulations. If the report turns out to be true, we’ll accept it, while keeping users’ funds secure. In the [Caixin] report, BTC & P2P trades were not described as an illegal currency and an illicit method of facilitating transactions. If the report is true, we’ll stop BTC/CNY trades & become a P2P platform for digital assets.”\n\nIn essence, the three largest bitcoin exchanges stated that the government has clarified on the legality of bitcoin in the beginning of 2017 and as a result, bitcoin exchanges should and will not be shut down by local regulators. Furthermore, OKCoin emphasized that the company along with other trading platforms have strictly complied with the requests from the government.\n\nInitially, upon the release of Caixin’s report, bitcoin price plunged to $4,075 within hours. Almost immediately after the statements of the three bitcoin exchanges were published, bitcoin price recovered swiftly to $4,310 in a single day.\n\nOver the past few days, bitcoin has demonstrated strong resilience towards the Chinese market and the government’s ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs). Even after the Chinese government’s declaration of ICOs as an illegal fundraising method and bitcoin price dropped by $500, it recovered to $4,550 within a 24-hour period.\n\nBut, as Mow explained, ban on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by the Chinese government is having less impact on the global ecosystem than it did a few years ago. Mow went as far to explain that if China does ban bitcoin and its local exchanges, it will not work on bitcoin and it will continue to sustain its upward trend.\n\n“Real or not, I doubt anyone wants to go down in history as the person who tried to ban Bitcoin. Honey badger doesn’t care either way. When has any ban on anything ever worked by the way? There are really only two choices here: embrace cryptocurrencies or get decentralized exchanges faster,” said Mow.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin’s buzz is gone, for now. It was crushed by the heavy-handed intervention of the Chinese government, which is cooling off investor enthusiasm for the digital currency.\n\nThat’s just the beginning rather than the end of recent efforts by big governments around the world to turn Bitcoin back into what once was -- an exotic currency for the tech savvy and romantic radicals, as we wrote in a previous piece here.\n\nThe news out of China about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is going from bad to worse. After banning Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) early in the week, Beijing is now considering shutting off cryptocurrency exchanges, sending the major players into another tailspin.\n\nCoin/Investment Trust Change 24H* Bitcoin (BTC) -9.84% Ethereum (ETH) -21.74 Litecoin (LTC) -24.92 BitConnect -32.10\n\n*As of Monday September3 at 2 pm\n\nSource: Coinranking.com\n\nCoin/Investment Trust Change 24H* Bitcoin (BTC) -9.66% Ethereum (ETH) -11.22 Litecoin (LTC) -16.92 BitConnect -7.81\n\n*As of Friday September7 at 9 pm\n\nSource: Coinranking.com\n\nTo be fair, Chinese and other governments, big and small, have a few good reasons to step in and regulate the process of creating and exchanging cryptocurrencies, as they do with the issuing and trading of conventional financial products and instruments -- to protect the public from market manipulation; and to ensure financial stability.\n\nBut shutting off ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges altogether, as China is doing, goes beyond traditional regulation. It questions the very legitimacy of Bitcoin, and its prospects for gaining broad acceptance as medium of exchange, an asset, and a means of different payments. To become money, that is, like national currencies.\n\nFor a good reason: governments do not want to see competing currencies. They threaten their monopoly to create money and control the financial system and the economy.\n\nActually, the reason China is the first big government to take such action isn’t an accident. China more than any other country wants to have firm control of its banking system, and allocate credit according to a political agenda. This means that a competing currency like the Bitcoin would threaten its political system. Why not crush it sooner than later?\n\nWhile it is still unclear whether the Chinese government will achieve its real objectives, one thing is clear: the buzz for the digital currencies is gone, at least for now.', 'Russia is developing a legal framework that would regulate the purchase of cryptocurrencies, Russia’s finance minister says, adding that the government wants to legitimize cryptocurrencies and wind down the black market.\n\nRead more\n\nSpeaking at the II Moscow Financial Forum, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov reassured Russian fans of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that the government has no intention of outlawing cryptocurrencies.\n\n“The state understands indeed that crypto-currencies are real. There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them,” the minister said.\n\nInstead, the Russian financial authorities are now working to bring operations with cryptocurrencies into compliance with Russian law. The legislation, to be ready by the end of the year, envisions registration of would-be buyers and a clear definition of buying procedures and rules of circulation.\n\nExplaining the need for tighter regulation, Siluanov pointed out that those investing in virtual money are subject to greater risks due to the lack of external regulation.\n\n\n\n“We must make an organized market out of the black market,” he said.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘US wanted him for his intellect’ – wife of Russian arrested for alleged Bitcoin fraud to RT\n\nWhile not disclosing details of the proposed law, Siluanov said the ministry’s goal is to make the purchase of cryptocurrencies covered by law to the same degree as buying treasury bonds and other securities.\n\nEarlier it was reported that Russia is mulling prohibiting the mining of cryptocurrencies in apartments. The procedure is deemed unsafe, as substantial increases in power consumption may result in fire.\n\n‘Bitcoin plunges over news of looming exchanges shutdown in China’\n\nRead more\n\nMeanwhile, unconfirmed reports emerging on Friday that China’s financial regulator plans to close major Bitcoin exchanges caused Bitcoin to fall. The reports were spread by Chinese financial publication Caixin, citing sources within the country’s cross regulators committee, but remain unconfirmed.\n\nSpeculation over a crackdown on cryptocurrencies in China is rife due to a recent decision by The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to outlaw the practice of raising funds through ‘initial coin offerings’ (ICOs).\n\nICO fundraising has experienced a surge in popularity in China, with 65 IOCs raising a total of 2.62 billion yuan ($394.6 million) from over 100,000 individuals since the beginning of the year.\n\nPursuant to the PBOC decision, individuals who have already completed fundraising should make arrangements to return the money.', 'Russian newspaper Izvestiya has reported that the Russian government intends to subsidize the cost of electricity for cryptocurrency miners.\n\nThe report indicates that the Russian government, through the Institute for Internet Development (IRI) and the Russian Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (RABIK), have laid out plans to make electricity costs lower for Russian Bitcoin miners.\n\nWhile the report does not give location specifics, it does explain that the cost of mining in Russia is high even though Russia has a substantial electricity oversupply. The report states:\n\n“The largest cryptocurrency farm in Russia consumes in aggregate 4.5 mWh, or 3240 mW per month. The cost of 1 kWh depending on the region is from 2 rubles to 5.3 rubles. In addition to the legalization of cryptocurrency in Russia, it is necessary to create the most favorable conditions for the work of miners.”\n\nThe report shows Russia’s continued dedication to cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology, in spite of recent statements that cryptocurrencies are not for ordinary people.', ""Reuters out with a story earlier 9 Sept\n\nspokeswoman for Beijing-based OK Coin said the platform has not received any notification from regulators\n\nspokespersons at Beijing-based Huobi and Shanghai-based BTCC said they were still waiting for further official clarification.\n\nThe need for clarification follows yesterday's report that China plans to shut local Bitcoin exchanges that Greg posted here and which resulted in prices tumbling.\n\nThat news came after the announcement on Monday to ban ICO financing that I reported here.\n\nInteresting times for Bitcoin/others.\n\nHow many of our readers are holding/trading these ? What do you make of the latest developments?\n\nBitcoin under threat"", 'Billionaire investor and market pundit Howard Marks made news in July when he called Bitcoin a ‘fad’ in one of his famous investor memos, joining with other prominent investing experts. Marks famously predicted the dotcom bubble in 1999, and now manages approximately $99 bln in assets.\n\nHowever, in his most recent Oaktree Capital memo, Marks retracted his position after being educated by some of his Bitcoin-loving friends regarding the cryptocurrency. After detailing a substantial part of his recent education, Marks concludes that Bitcoin is no different than US dollars, adding:\n\n“There’s absolutely no reason why Bitcoin – or anything else – can’t serve as a currency if enough people accept it as such. While I’d point out that no private currency has gained widespread use in a long, long time, there’s nothing to say it can’t happen.”\n\nThe conclusion sums up Marks’ original concerns regarding a lack of fundamental intrinsic value, and rebuffs them.\n\nStill not buying it\n\nMarks hasn’t come around fully, however, and continues to be concerned about what he sees as widespread speculation. Even though he accepts that Bitcoin can function as a currency, he believes that Bitcoin’s outsized returns over the past three years could be the sign of a speculative bubble. The Bitcoin portion of the memo concluded:', 'Bitcoin price is finding it hard to stay above $4200-4100 against the US Dollar. More declines towards $3900 is likely in BTC/USD in the near term.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price is struggling to remain above the $4100 support area against the US Dollar.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line with support at $4150 forming on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nThe pair is heading towards the trend line support at $4150 and might attempt a downside break.\n\nBitcoin price is finding it hard to stay above $4200-4100 against the US Dollar. More declines towards $3900 is likely in BTC/USD in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Price Crucial Support\n\nThere were a couple of swing moves in Bitcoin price towards $4500 against the US Dollar this past week. The price declined on a couple of occasions, but the $4000-4100 support area held the downside. The price recently recovered from the $4018 low. It traded above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $4966 high to $4018 low. It even moved above the $4500 level and the 100 simple moving average (H4).\n\nHowever, the upside move faced sellers near $4650. Buyers failed to place the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $4966 high to $4018 low. The price moved down and traded below the $4500 support and the 100 simple moving average (H4). On the downside, there is a key bullish trend line with support at $4150 forming on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD.\n\nThe pair is approaching the trend line support at $4150 and remains at a risk. If sellers manage to break the $4150 support, there can be more declines. The next target could the $3950 level, which is a crucial support. On the upside, the 100 simple moving average (H4) and a connecting trend line at $4450 are major barriers.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is now placed well in the bearish zone.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $4150\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $4450\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The crowdsale launch will coincide with the release of the source code for the blockchain and client application on GitHub.\n\nXenio is a distributed, decentralized, open access gaming platform and blockchain based on a code fork of Ethereum. Xenio runs on its own dedicated blockchain, optimizing its use for gaming without the bloat of the generic Ethereum blockchain.\n\nXenio uses a novel adaptation of Proof of Stake called Proof of Networking (PoN), where network nodes are rewarded for providing services to the rest of the network. Anyone can mine Xenio coins by operating multiplayer gaming servers on the Xenio blockchain through the Xenio implementation of Proof of Networking. The system provides payments to game server operators in the form of Xenio coins within the 20 minute PoN superblocks, based on the product of active players and how many Xenio coins the server has staked. The on-blockchain Xenio coins allow smart contract transactions to track and transfer digital ownership of in-game assets\n\nGame developers can tokenize any object that their online game uses, from accounts to in-game assets to community badges and awards; even the game license itself can be tokenized. The Xenio blockchain is a distributed, serverless application, so there is no centralized database like Steam to be hacked or taken offline.\n\nThe value of the Xenio coin is proportional to its utility – as more services come online and more users enter the system, the coin becomes more valuable due to scarcity and an increase in the superblock mining difficulty.\n\nFor full information visit https://Xenio.io to download the whitepaper.\n\nPress Contact Email Address\n\nnikola@xenio.io\n\nSupporting Link\n\nhttps://xenio.io', 'Kathleen Moriarty, partner at the law firm who helped to develop the very first Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), Arnold and Porter, says the SEC is still waiting on Bitcoin or cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nThe first Bitcoin ETF attempt, submitted for approval by the Winklevoss twins in March of this year, was rejected by the Commission.

09/10/2017,"[""As usual there is a massive overreaction from news coming from China. It’s possible to say that the basis of latest announcement that China is banning ICOs and exchanges is unreliable as there has been no formal statement from a government official.\n\nThe origin of the news was a Google translated article from a Chinese journalist, who apparently had spoken to some official. So the news is three layers from the original source.\n\nLast time China banned or wanted to stop Bitcoin, they reversed the situation some months after.\n\nRemember, China have many laws preventing capital flight, money leaving China, and we are not used to laws being verbal unsubstantiated statements, from non-government officials.\n\nAre some people having an agenda to pump Bitcoin and spook the market? This news may actually be doing everyone a favour, as it is likely to be the last time you can buy Bitcoin at these levels. We have just had it gifted to us, a 30 percent return as BTC will dipped below $4000 and then returned to business as usual.\n\nHowever Ether may not be so lucky\n\nBitcoin isn’t the issue here. It’s Ether, which is largely the hub of the ICO community, that is likely to take a pounding, with the Ethereum network struggling to keep pace with demand. ICOs are, after all, the pump for Ether, and it is likely that ETH will continue to rise for the time being.\n\nMany ICOs are founded on poor ideas, and big ones could expose the market when founders fail to deliver what was promised, because they lack experience and have never run a business.\n\nMany ERC20 token launches in the past six months are based on bad ideas and flawed thinking where tokenomics don't work for investors.\n\nFirst ICOs get called out, run out of money, and many have delivered nothing to users or investors. But for the time being, ICOs will pump ETH and in 2018 we will see 5000 ICOs.\n\nRemember, remember\n\nRemember, Chinese investors are still out there, still buying into ICOs, and above all China is not the market, it is not Bitcoin, and the world of crypto will push on with or without them.\n\nChina has and will reverse the decision, they are pumping mining pools like everyone else, Russia, America, India and the enterprise takeover continues…\n\nChina banned Bitcoin, then changed its mind. China’s rules to prevent capital flight isn’t working. China cannot pick and choose the things it likes from capitalism, it’s capitalism that is paying to build China into what it is today."", 'China plans to ban trading of bitcoin and other virtual currencies on domestic exchanges, dealing another blow to the $150 billion cryptocurrency market after the country outlawed initial coin offerings last week.\n\nThe ban will only apply to trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private. Authorities don’t have plans to stop over-the-counter transactions, the people said. China’s central bank said it couldn’t immediately comment.\n\nBitcoin slumped on Friday after Caixin magazine reported China’s plans, capping the virtual currency’s biggest weekly retreat in nearly two months. The country accounts for about 23 percent of bitcoin trades and is also home to many of the world’s biggest bitcoin miners, who use vast amounts of computing power to confirm transactions in the digital currency.\n\n“Trading volume would definitely shrink,” said Zhou Shuoji, Beijing-based founding partner at FBG Capital, which invests in cryptocurrencies. “Old users will definitely still trade, but the entry threshold for new users is now very high. This will definitely slow the development of cryptocurrencies in China.”\n\nWhile Beijing’s motivation for the exchange ban is unclear, it comes amid a broad clampdown on financial risk in the run-up to a key Communist Party leadership reshuffle next month. Bitcoin has jumped about 600 percent in dollar terms over the past year, fueling concerns of a bubble. The People’s Bank of China has done trial runs of its own prototype cryptocurrency, taking it a step closer to being the first major central bank to issue digital money.\n\n“There has been a general tightening of the screw on regulating financial and monetary conditions,” said Mark McFarland, chief economist at Union Bancaire Privee SA HK in Hong Kong. “All of these things suggest a longer term process of tightening scrutiny of activities that aren’t in the normal sort of monetary realm.”\n\nOKCoin, BTC China and Huobi, the country’s three biggest bitcoin exchanges, said on Monday that they hadn’t received any regulatory notices concerning bans on cryptocurrency trading. All three venues reported transactions on Monday, with bitcoin rising 7.6 percent on OKCoin as of 5:09 p.m. local time.\n\nRead more about last week’s ban on initial coin offerings here.\n\nWhile bitcoin users will still be able to trade cryptocurrencies in China without exchanges, the process is likely to be slower and come with increased credit risk, analysts said.\n\nThe exchange ban is unlikely to have a major impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies globally because venues outside China will continue trading, according to FBG Capital’s Zhou. The country’s role in the bitcoin market had already started shrinking in recent months as authorities tightened regulation. At one point, exchanges in China accounted for more than 90 percent of the world’s bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe bigger risk for global traders may be the massive rally in bitcoin prices, according to McFarland.\n\n“Whenever you start to hear about Hong Kong taxi drivers becoming millionaires from buying bitcoin, you start to think this is not necessarily driven by fundamentals,” he said. “So you will get quite substantial pullbacks at some point.”\n\nWatch more\n\n\n\n\n\n— With assistance by Steven Yang, Gary Gao, Yinan Zhao, Yuji Nakamura, Justina Lee, and Eric Lam', 'Russia is in the midst of legitimizing cryptocurrencies. It is developing a legal framework that will govern transactions using digital currencies like Bitcoin, RT reports.\n\nRussian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov conveyed this at a recent financial forum in Moscow. He assured Russian users of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that the government will not outlaw nor penalize people who use cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt is a complete turnaround from the Russian Ministry’s stance last year, emerging after President Vladimir Putin signified approval for digital currencies.\n\nPutin helps\n\nPutin had met with Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin, who ingrained the merits of Russia’s usage of the Blockchain, the technology underlying Bitcoin. Thereafter, a consortium of lenders have mulled over the possibility of using the technology to cut costs. Meantime, a presidential aide had announced plans for an initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nFinance ministry wobbling\n\nThe Russian Finance Ministry had previously balked on and considered prohibition of the use of cryptocurrencies in apartments which it deemed unsafe. Now that it has gotten backing from Putin, and the state has realized that digital currencies are part of the new economic realities, Siluanov said there is no point in outlawing them. He said the next move is to draw up a bill before yearend to regulate cryptocurrencies.\n\nSiluanov has yet to disclose further details, but merely said that the Russian Ministry’s goal is to make the purchase of cryptocurrencies covered by law to in the same manner as buying treasury bonds and other securities.\n\nBank of Russia Governor balks\n\nAs with other technology trends, digital currencies have not won over everyone. In Russia, there are still non-believers. Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina, for instance, referred to the global commotion over digital currencies as a “gold fever” sweeping nations, and expressed misgivings over their use as a surrogate for money.\n\nIn other news, China has not been as receptive to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies. In fact, its financial regulator plans to shut off major Bitcoin exchanges has led to Bitcoin’s price plummeting.\n\nThere has also been much speculation over cracking down on cryptocurrencies, following a recent decision by The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to outlaw fundraising through ICOs, which have surged in popularity.', 'After previously slamming Bitcoin and other digital currencies as “not real”, “fad”, and “a pyramid scheme”, billionaire traditional investor Howard Marks made a spectacular U-turn on his views on the new financial technology in his latest memo to Oaktree Clients.\n\nHoward Marks’ 180 Degree Turn\n\nIn his July memo, Howard Marks explored the world of cryptocurrencies and leveled heavy criticism at them. However, after receiving significant backlash from various media outlets for his ‘dinosaur’ views and lack of understanding of the new financial technology, Marks decided to revisit the topic to get ‘enlightened’ and ‘educated’ on the subject. In his new September memo, he claims that Bitcoin partisans encouraged him to think of Bitcoin as a currency – a medium of exchange – rather than as an investment asset.\n\nThe billionaire investor acknowledged his ‘mistake’ as he had been looking at Bitcoin the wrong way, and humbly conceded that much of the arguments he made against the cryptocurrency were applicable to the dollar as well. Marks subsequently made the case for qualifying Bitcoin as a currency and concluded that although he sees no reason why Bitcoin can’t serve as a currency and “become an accepted medium of exchange”, he warned against getting caught up in the hype and buying it with the sole view of making money off it.\n\n1/ Marks received more feedback from his July #bitcoin memo than any other memo he published over the last 28 yrs. https://t.co/0XgWenlWYt — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) September 10, 2017\n\nWarning Signs\n\nBitcoin’s volatility, which has seen it rise over 350% in 2017 alone, concerned Marks, who was quick to point out that the lack of an upper ceiling for Bitcoin which sees limitless appreciation fails to make sense to him. He asks, “Would you sell your house for euros that are said to be worth two or three times as much as the dollar?”\n\nAlthough this represents a risk averse and extremely conservative outlook, it does provoke thoughts pertaining to long term stability of currencies. Marks also shares his other major concern, that the low barriers to entry give rise to many competing transaction systems. Would Bitcoin’s utility as a payment mechanism be hampered if Amazon announced its own? He asks, “Would you rather transact in Bitcoin or Amazonians?”\n\nThe Bottom Line on Bitcoin\n\nIn the new memo, Marks makes it clear that he advocates for Bitcoin as a currency and warns against “lottery-ticket thinking”, which seduces people towards the cryptocurrency as it offers the possibility of vast wealth. Although some elements or “seeds for a boom” that contributed to past historical economic bubbles are evident in Bitcoin’s surge, Marks emphatically makes it known that none of them make Bitcoin a ‘mistake’. He also mentions that with the existence of tons of cryptocurrencies and the possibility of endless more, the winner will be hard to call.\n\nAs evidenced by the hundreds of e-commerce start ups during the tech bubble, most of which ended up worthless, putting all your eggs in one basket might not be the wisest thing to do. Although Marks said that he still considers it a speculative bubble and therefore still doesn’t “feel like putting my money into it”, he also said that he was “willing to be proved wrong.” For such a juggernaut in the field of traditional financial investing, this is as close as anyone can get to singing the praises of the very technology that might be the cause of their own downfall.\n\nHoward Marks is coming around on bitcoin, but says ""I still don’t feel like putting my money into it."" https://t.co/KXgoYyNmDx pic.twitter.com/syZsne7RD7 — Bloomberg (@business) September 8, 2017\n\nWhat do you think of Howard Marks’ new memo and shift in position on Bitcoin? Do you agree with his bottom line? How would you respond to his apprehensions? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImages courtesy of Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg', 'Computer scientists from the Swiss university ETH Zürich have found a way to make off-blockchain payment networks even more scalable.\n\nAt the heart of this work lies bitcoin\'s years-old scaling debate, which comes down to the fact that bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies today have limited transaction capacity. To get around this, cryptocurrency protocols have developed payment channel networks that push transactions off-blockchain, such as bitcoin\'s Lightning Network, first proposed in 2015.\n\nBut researchers Rami Khalil and Arthur Gervais believe payment systems like the Lightning Network don\'t go far enough, and they\'ve proposed the Revive payment channel model, an idea that would enable longer-lasting payment channels that interact even less with the blockchain.\n\nThe paper explains:\n\n""Except in the case of disputes (similar to conventional payment channels), our solution does not require on-chain transactions and therefore increases the scalability of existing blockchains.""\n\nAt its core, Revive allows users to securely move money from one channel to another off-blockchain, a departure from the Lightning Network\'s model.\n\nRebalancing act\n\nAs proposed, all Lightning-style networks need to use on-blockchain transactions (and the accompanying fees) to set up and close payment channels.\n\nUsers with multiple payment channels open – for example, one could stay open with a coffee shop, while another could pay for streaming TV – normally have to ""rebalance"" the channel via on-chain transactions every time a channel runs out of bitcoin.\n\nRevive, on the other hand, allows money from the coffee channel to be sent to the TV streaming channel if its funds become depleted.\n\n""As such, instead of refunding a channel (which incurs costly on-chain transactions), a user should be able to leverage his existing channels to rebalance a poorly funded channel,"" the paper explains.\n\nIt might seem like a small change, but every optimization could matter, especially at a time when on-chain transaction fees are increasing (and could increase even more if the cryptocurrencies become more popular).\n\nThe researchers go on to explain that Revive can be used for any Lightning Network-like project on any blockchain, including Raiden Network, an in-progress payment channel model for ethereum, where the researchers have released a Revive proof-of-concept.\n\nHigh voltage sign image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

One of these solutions: reducing travel time and solving traffic jams. For example, companies such as Tencent and Freigeist are funding Lilium, a German start-up company, to develop the first all-electrical vertical take-off five-seat flying taxi.\n\nAlso read: Japanese Airline Accepts Bitcoin As Cryptocurrency Fever Spreads Across the Region\n\nHeralding the End of Traffic Jams\n\nLilium, a Munich-based company, promises to enable passengers to travel five times faster than by car. Lilium’s mission is to introduce “the world’s first all-electric vertical take-off and landing jet: an air taxi for up to five people. You won’t have to own one; you will simply pay per ride and call it with a push of a button. It’s our mission to make air taxis available to everyone and as affordable as riding a car.”\n\nLilium promises to end traffic jams. “By traveling through the air you’ll be able to avoid time-consuming traffic jams while enjoying a magnificent view,” says the company website.\n\nLilium reports that it has already secured US$90 million Series B funding round. Members of the funding group include Tencent, LGT Banking Group, Atomico, and Obvious Ventures.\n\nFlying Taxis, Blockchain, and Bitcoin\n\nEntities funding Lilium’s flying taxi enterprise have direct or indirect connections with Bitcoin, blockchain, and other digital currencies.\n\n“Tencent believes that the third big change is brewing with Bitcoin and its underlying technology – the blockchain entering the scene,” Investopedia reports.\n\nThus, using blockchain-based technology, Tencent, the giant Internet enterprise, is developing the TrustSQL platform to provide “enterprise-class block chain infrastructure, industry solutions, and secure, reliable and flexible blockchain cloud services,” according to Investopedia.\n\nTencent has long been involved in initiatives involving cryptocurrencies, such as Q Coin and Kin. Moreover, Tencent’s Wechat Pay which is incorporated into the Wechat app, is one of the major Chinese mobile payment services. Wechat lets users perform transactions in Bitcoin. For example, OKCoin, a major Bitcoin exchange, allows users to use Wechat to trade Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, according to Lilium’s press release, Freigeist were Lilium’s seed investors. Freigeist (formerly e42) also invests in Outbank, a multi bank app that integrates Bitcoin. “Outbank allows users to manage and overlook their bitcoins in the same app as their regular bank accounts,” states the company website.\n\nBitcoin Rides the Skies\n\nSo, will Bitcoin be soon one of the payment options of the flying taxis?\n\nBitcoin is already riding the skies. For example, the Daedalus Drones offer its services for Bitcoin. Daedalus is one of the first drone services companies to accept the cryptocurrency.\n\nAirBaltic and Polish Airlines LOT already accept Bitcoin payments. Airbaltic claims to be the first airline to accept Bitcoin as payment. Cheapair.com also declares itself to be the first online travel agency to accept Bitcoin.\n\nRecently, additional air traveler companies are moving forward to accept Bitcoin, such as BITPoint Japan, a company linked to Peach Aviation Ltd. According to Peach CEO Shinichi Inoue, through this initiative, “We want to encourage visitors from overseas and the revitalization of Japan’s regions,” Bloomberg Technology reported.\n\nSmartest Minds, Smartest Companies, and Bitcoin’s Blockchain Technology\n\nMIT Technology Review has named Lilium CEO, Daniel Siegand, as one of the Innovators Under 35 of the year 2017.\n\nTencent is considered one of the world’s smartest companies in 2017. According to an MIT Technology Review report, Tencent is 8th, while Alibaba is 41th. The first spot goes to Nvidia, a chipmaker that also produces cryptocurrency mining products.\n\nFlying taxi services represent innovation. So, the question is, will these smart minds and companies develop innovative, expeditious, and secure payment applications for their new business model? If so, we can look forward to seeing Bitcoin play a predominant role as a payment option in the flying taxi business.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about flying taxi companies accepting payments in Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nImages courtesy of Lilium, Shutterstock', 'Blockchain asset and cryptocurrency wallet platform Jaxx has announced they will soon be releasing support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on their platform, soon should mean this upcoming week as relayed in their latest update.\n\nJaxx reportedly uses Insight Server, which is the same service used by several other major platforms. Insight decided not to support Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThis left Jaxx developers with an extra ordinary amount of work to sync and reindex the BCH blockchain on a completely new system. This process has taken the team longer than expected.\n\nRegardless, Jaxx is now almost finished with BCH integration.\n\nThrough the past weeks testing, the team says they are still seeing some performance issues which they want to be resolved before going live.\n\nCEO of Jaxx, Anthony Di Iorio said:', 'Bitcoin has been around the fringes of financial markets for less than a decade, but is slowly gaining prominence as an alternative asset class. Can the government of any major country step in and do the unthinkable – ban Bitcoin?\n\nFlashback – Holding Gold Bullion is a Crime\n\nThose who think that no government (except those run by tinpot dictators) would take the extreme step of banning Bitcoin need a lesson in history. There was a time when holding gold bullion was a crime in America, punishable by a sentence of up to ten years in prison. In 1933, American President Franklin D Roosevelt issued an order requiring all Americans to hand over their gold holdings to the Federal Reserve Bank. The ban on owning gold remained in place for more than four decades, before President Ford legalized gold ownership. This move was made easy by the fact that America had abandoned the gold standard a short while prior and hence had no need to own vast quantities of gold to back up the amount of currency it printed.\n\nThe Great Chinese Firewall\n\nAnother oft-repeated argument against a ban on Bitcoin is that in the age of the globalized internet economy, individual governments lack the authority and power to act against a decentralized currency like Bitcoin. However, we only have to look at how China has bent even the Internet to realize that this is not the case. By a mix of government legislation and the blocking of popular foreign websites by the Chinese internet service providers, the Chinese government has tried to limit the Chinese to a walled garden, instead of viewing the whole world wide web. Traffic monitoring tools are used by the government to stifle political dissent. Taking a step to ban Bitcoin would not be too large a leap for the Chinese government.\n\nIndia and Demonetization\n\nIf you think that fiat notes, printed by the Government and certified by the Central Bank, would be the last thing to be banned, think again! The Indian Government issued a decree in November 2016, stating that high denomination notes would cease to be legal tender almost immediately. Indian citizens had to queue up in banks to deposit old currency notes. Getting hands on the replacement currency was not easy, leading to huge queues at ATMs. This demonetization was touted as a means to curb income tax evasion and solve most of the government’s problems. Almost a year later, it has become evident that demonetization has failed to achieve the government’s objectives and has only resulted in an increase in the demand for Bitcoins.\n\nEnforceability Issues\n\nIf a government decides to make trading or possessing Bitcoins illegal, questions will be raised about how exactly it will enforce such a ban. It is impossible for a government to seize your Bitcoins, unless you decide to handover your private keys. However, the majority of citizens and institutions like to stay on the right side of the law. So the demand for Bitcoin would plummet if the government decided to ban it. All exchanges in that country would also be shuttered and buying/selling Bitcoin would be difficult and risky. This would suffocate Bitcoin in that country and the government’s objectives might be achieved.', 'This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material.

With its platform, and the SPARC token participants will be able to engage in distributed computing through a variety of devices and get paid for it. This ICO is an opportunity for those interested in the field of distributed computing, and the scientific research industry. Researchers and research institutions around the world will be using that idle or unused computing power to conduct their research. They will be paying for it through this platform. The whole payment and idle computing power usage will go through the SPARC distributed computing platform.\n\nHow does SPARC Work for Users?\n\nTo explain how the whole concept works, it is helpful to borrow an example from day to day life:\n\n– A person sitting at a bar, runs out of battery on their phone.\n\n– That person, turns to someone sitting right beside them and asks to use their phone.\n\n– In exchange for a call, this person is willing to pay the lender of the phone.\n\n– The exchange takes place when the lender of the phone realizes that the phone is idle, so he or she can lend it without affecting their own usage.\n\n– In exchange, the borrower pays the lender, and the lender derives additional utility from that idle phone.\n\nSPARC Distributed Computing\n\nThe SPARC platform works like a global bar, in which at some point anyone will have an idle device that someone might need temporarily. When researchers within the platform, need that computing power, they ask to borrow idle devices – unused computing power on phones or computers – within the network. In exchange, the researchers will pay those willing to lend their computing power to them, with SPARC.\n\nThe fact that the SPARC platform can do this, while allowing the owners of the devices to control the amount of computing power they want to rent out, and making sure they get paid, will create a network of distributed computing. Researchers, who are always in need of more computing power to manage, calculate and compile more data, will be willing to pay for that computing power on demand. This means they do not have to purchase too much computing power upfront, and can instead use their grant money more efficiently.\n\nThe Peer to Peer Research Network Works with Integrated Research Software\n\nThis distributed computing platform thus creates a true peer to peer computing experience, in which researchers can advance human knowledge and get competitive prices for the computing power they need, and any individual can profit while they help researchers on their next big discovery. Everyone wins.\n\nThe integration of well-known and widely used software platforms, that researchers in the fields of mathematics and physics use, is they next key building block that will enable the platform to function as designed. The SPARC platform will be able to interact with the following research programs:\n\n• MatLab & Maple – Widely used by students and researchers. Students with little network experience will be able to use it.\n\n• COMSOL – Industry leader in modeling and simulation software for Multiphysics. This kind of software requires a considerable amount of computing power, that thanks to SPARC researchers will have access to.\n\n• Blender – for model pre-processing and WebGL files.\n\nWhere does SPARC come from and why did its founders decide to Launch it?\n\nThe origins of this project reveal its potential for success and the familiarity of its founders with the research industry. SPARC is a project that started out in Kingston Ontario, Canada. For those who are not familiar with this part of Canada, Kingston Ontario is a city built around its renowned research institutions. The founders of this project have seen first-hand how researchers struggle to purchase enough computing power on their grants. They realized that the solution was to lend those researchers unused computing power.\n\nSPARC: More than Just a Distributed Computing Project\n\nBesides putting idle computing resources on the platform, anyone can join and support this project by buying some SPARC tokens, and contribute to humankind. SPARC will also take a part of the funds it raises from the sale of the token and will release its own research grants for those researchers who need money to conduct their research. This makes anyone who buys SPARC a potential double contributor to research and the advancement of knowledge. Platform users will be able to rent their unused computing power, while those who also bought SPARC during the ICO will know they contributed to researchers, enabling research that otherwise wouldn’t have found sufficient funding.\n\nThis is an opportunity to be part of a project that can help humankind and integrate buyers into the research economy. Participants at the pre-ICO stage can get more SPARC when they contribute, which will give them another reason to consider this ICO opportunity. The pre-ICO stage has already sold over 350 ETH worth of SPARC of the 1,000 ETH cap set.\n\nMedia Contact: info@sparc.network\n\nSupporting Link: http://sparc.network/', 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has formed lower highs and found support around $4060, creating a descending triangle pattern.\n\nPrice just bounced off support and could be due for a test of resistance soon.\n\nMost technical indicators on the 1-hour chart hint that the top of the triangle could keep gains in check.\n\nBitcoin price is consolidating inside a descending triangle pattern and could stay within the formation until a catalyst triggers a breakout.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. These moving averages are close to the top of the triangle to add strength to the ceiling.\n\nStochastic is turning lower from the overbought zone to signal that selling pressure is returning. RSI is still on the move up so there may be some bullish momentum left for an actual test of resistance.\n\nA breakout in either direction could last by $400, which is roughly the same height as the chart formation. Bitcoin price could also encounter resistance at the record highs near $5000 and support at the $3800-4000 area of interest.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nGeopolitical risks appear to have faded recently as traders are awaiting the next updates from North Korea. There appear to have been no provocations over the weekend, although another batch of sanctions could trigger a reaction.\n\nMeanwhile, dollar demand continues to weaken ahead of this month’s FOMC decision as cautious remarks are expected. This week, the catalysts for the currency include the US CPI and retail sales, both of which are expected to come in weak.\n\nAs for bitcoin price itself, reports that China is shutting down exchanges have kept a lid on gains in the past few days. This follows the report that China has banned ICO funding, leading many to speculate that more restrictions are in the cards.\n\nKeep in mind that China has been one of the largest bitcoin markets in the world, although the likes of the US, Japan, and South Korea have caught up. With that, there doesn’t appear to be much worry on the part of investors for the time being.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

09/11/2017,"['The bitcoin-US dollar exchange rate (BTC/USD) may have climbed back above $4,000, but it might be ready to push higher even though China uncertainty reigns supreme.\n\nFollowing reports the country\'s regulators may be seeking to shut down domestic bitcoin exchanges, the bitcoin price fell to a low of $3,977 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) this weekend. The rumor comes a week after the People\'s Bank of China (PBOC) banned initial coin offerings (ICO), suddenly outlawing the practice of creating and selling cryptocurrency to investors to finance startup projects.\n\nThe confusion about what might lie ahead cut short bitcoin\'s ascent on Friday following a repeated technical failure around $4,650 levels, and the subsequent sell-off was exacerbated by the bearish news out of China.\n\nSo far, Bloomberg and the Wall street Journal are out with the reports today, suggesting the ban will be limited to exchange-based trading and will not affect over-the-counter transactions.\n\nFurther, wires are reporting that the price of bitcoin could drop below $4,000 if China bans trading on continuous order books of the larger exchanges. China\'s biggest exchanges and traders across the globe are still waiting for official confirmation.\n\nInvestors aren\'t buying it\n\nAll in all, it\'s no wonder the trading is subdued this Monday morning.\n\nHowever, bitcoin has been successful in defending the psychological support of $4,000 – meaning price action indicates investors do not think China would shut down bitcoin exchanges, or that if they did, it would only have a limited impact.\n\nFurthermore, it appears any ban on exchange-based cryptocurrency trades will not extend to over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, meaning markets could still move.\n\nAs per Wall Street Journal, ""A ban on crypto exchanges won\'t mean the end of trading in digital currencies.""\n\nNo news is good news\n\nIt\'s been 72 hours since the news of a China exchange ban broke out, and we are yet to hear official confirmation or denial. The broader market sentiment remains positive, hence, no news (official confirmation or denial) will be taken as good news.\n\nThus, investors may start snapping up bitcoins at current levels, although in such a case the digital currency would take a big hit if China, following a prolonged silence, suddenly confirms the ban.\n\nDaily chart\n\nBears may be salivating at the idea of a big sell-off following the breach of the rising trend line, although, what we have now is a symmetrical triangle pattern.\n\nThe symmetrical triangle, which can also be referred to as a coil, usually forms during a trend as a continuation pattern. The pattern contains at least two lower highs and two higher lows. Prices typically breakout in the direction of the prior trend, i.e. in BTC\'s case, an upside breakout will signal resumption of the rally from the June 16 low of $1,826.\n\nOne may feel tempted to bet on the direction of the breakout, however, it may be advisable to stay on the sidelines and only trade the breakout.\n\nOne reason is that the 5-day moving average and the 10-DMA moving average are now capping the upside in bitcoin. The 14-day RSI is dangerously close to being bearish.\n\nA downside break [an end of the day close below the symmetrical triangle floor] would mean bitcoin has made a near-term top at $5,000. The subsequent move lower could be extended to $3,164 (200-day moving average).\n\nA bullish move is seen gathering pace following a break above $4,500. The level marks the confluence of the rising trend line resistance and symmetrical triangle resistance. Fresh record highs could be seen if prices break above $4,500.\n\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Among those is an integration with The Onion Router (Tor) network, enabling anonymous access to the marketplace network, as well as upgrades intended to boost overall up-times and access to storefronts.\n\nIt\'s a major development for the project, which seeks to decentralize online retailing in the way bitcoin decentralized value transfers. Back in February, Brian Hoffman, chief executive of OB1 (the startup behind the project), said that one of the goals for the 2.0 release was to make the user experience akin to popular e-commerce platforms like Etsy.\n\n""Our goal with OpenBazaar 2.0 is to get it to be, with the exception of using bitcoin, ... an identical experience of what you’d see on Etsy. I think the 2.0 [version] is close to that,"" he said at the time.\n\nThe new OpenBazaar is built on the InterPlanetary File System, a protocol for decentralized file storage and sharing. This means that its listings can be re-uploaded, by other users, allowing purchases to be made even when a store isn\'t directly connected to the internet.\n\nWhile it displays real listings of goods and services offered for real bitcoins, the 2.0 version of OpenBazaar is, as advertised, still in the beta phase. In a blog post accompanying the release, the team cautioned that the system tends to overestimate fees and contains others other bugs they are working to fix.\n\nThird-party search engines such as Duo can now be accessed in the OpenBazaar client in the new version. Previously, users had use a separate browser to use such tools, and then connect to OpenBazaar when they wanted to make purchases.\n\nThe new version also adds tools for vendors such as variants (e.g., is that sweater size small, medium or large?), inventory tracking and expanded shipping options.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in OB1, the company formed to further development of the OpenBazaar software.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, one thing is missing from these stories: the tax man.\n\nYes, Virginia, Bitcoin is taxable\n\nThe IRS began issuing guidance on taxation of Bitcoin in March 2014. At that time, the agency announced that Bitcoin would be treated as property, with loss or gains being treated as capital loss or capital gains for tax purposes.\n\nReaders are probably familiar with the many “rags-to-riches” stories about Bitcoin investors becoming millionaires almost overnight. Such stories abound, from the Idaho teenager who turned $1,000 into $1.1 mln and the Norwegian engineer who made $800,000 in profit off a $24 investment.\n\nNone of these stories mention the taxes these individuals paid...or didn’t pay.\n\nCatch me if you can\n\nGiven Bitcoin’s crypto-anarchist roots, it’s perhaps not surprising that some seem to take the idea of taxation lightly. Many believe that since Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, there’s no way the IRS will find out about their taxable gains. Yet they may be wrong.\n\nBitcoin isn’t as anonymous as many think, as evidenced by the number of people in federal prison who paid in Bitcoin for child pornography or illegal drugs. There are a number of companies that scour the Blockchain, seeking to link Bitcoin accounts to their actual owners.\n\nEarlier this month, the IRS was found to have been partnering with a company called Chainalysis to double down on its efforts to monitor Bitcoin traders who engage in high frequency and volume trading.\n\nThe IRS has recently been focusing on Coinbase, demanding that the exchange reveal the identity of anybody who traded more than $20,000 in Bitcoin per year between 2013 and 2015. The IRS is probably correct in their belief that many Bitcoin owners are evading taxes. In the year 2015, only 802 Americans told the IRS about their Bitcoin-related capital gains or losses, according to Fortune.\n\nHow can Chainalysis help IRS?\n\nFounded in 2014, Chainalysis is an anti-money laundering software for Bitcoin. Through its formal partnerships with Europol and other international law enforcement agencies, Chainalysis’ investigative tools have been “used globally to successfully track, apprehend, and convict money launderers and cybercriminals.”\n\nIt’s important to remember that Bitcoin’s Blockchain is, by its very nature, totally transparent. Every transaction that has ever occurred is listed in that decentralized ledger, and transactions can be followed through the Blockchain using sophisticated software. The only thing that gives Bitcoin any semblance of privacy is the fact that it uses random addresses which are not necessarily associated with a user’s real-world identity.\n\nIt’s wise to remember, though, that people leak information about themselves all the time. Many people even publicly post their Bitcoin address on Internet forums. If they were to turn around and use this same address, or one associated with it, for illegal activity then their identity could be unmasked.\n\nGiven that 2017 has been a banner year for cryptocurrencies, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Bitcoin and other digital currencies high on the IRS’ list of priorities.', ""After Police seized 216 Bitcoins from an individual that was suspected to be involved in illegal activities with the digital currency, it was ruled by a South Korean court that the seizure was illegitimate.\n\nThe Suwon district court set a groundbreaking precedent in legitimizing the seizer, by ruling that Bitcoin and associated digital currencies are not subject to confiscation.\n\nSending a message to regulators\n\nWhile South Korea is one of the more progressive nations towards Bitcoin and its legalization, as well as its regulation, this move by the courts could send shockwaves through regulatory bodies in the country as well as across the globe.\n\nThere are contrasting attitudes towards the digital currency, as China’s recent foray into its regulation has seen the socialist country take a hardline stance towards this innovative technology.\n\nHowever, with the judiciary in Korea setting a precedent indicating its belief that Bitcoin should not be a confiscatable commodity, it could set a trend for many other nations to follow.\n\n‘Cannot assume an objective standard value’\n\nAccording to local reports from Kyunghyang Shinmun, it seems as if Bitcoin's volatility may well be its saving grace in this matter, as the confiscation was deemed illegitimate because:\n\n[it is]“not appropriate to confiscate Bitcoins as they cannot assume an objective standard value.”\n\nFurthermore, the indication is that Bitcoin, as a digital currency, has no physical representation, and thus there is essentially nothing to be confiscated, according to the courts.\n\nThis also seems to suggest that the courts see Bitcoin as having a value, but it is an ever changing one, which could well mean they would be looking to instate certain rules surrounding digital currencies on their own.\n\nPornography Bitcoins\n\nThe case in which those judgement arose from involved an individual who was charged with running an illegal pornography website. The site had many members, but the operator never reported the membership fees which, may or may not, have been directly collected as Bitcoin - or perhaps transferred into digital currency at a later date."", 'A notice to people using Bitcoin for illicit purposes: you can run, but it’s getting a lot harder to hide. Law enforcement officials are using Bitcoin’s public ledger, called the blockchain, to follow the digital money and track down suspected criminals using it.\n\nAs the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has helped fuel the rise of ransomware attacks—extortion schemes, like the recent WannaCry cyberattack, in which hackers hold the contents of a victim’s computer hostage until they get paid. Criminals can use Bitcoin to collect ransoms easily and without having to reveal their identities. The currency has also been associated with online drug sales, money laundering, and sex trafficking.\n\nBut while Bitcoin users can withhold their identities, they can’t avoid revealing other information that can be useful to investigators. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on its blockchain, a publicly accessible record of all transactions made using the currency. Blockchains “provide a really useful source of truth,” says Jonathan Levin, cofounder of Chainalysis, which develops software tools for analyzing blockchain data. Its products can help investigators draw inferences about how people are using the currency.\n\nWhat is a blockchain and what is it for?\n\nChainalysis combines its analysis with other publicly available information to identify users through the unique strings of numbers they use on the blockchain, called addresses, and then map how they move funds around. This technique can be used to do things like identify the Bitcoin exchanges where the users of a gambling site are converting their bitcoins into dollars (see “Mapping the Bitcoin Economy Could Reveal Users’ Identities”).\n\nChainalysis’s tools are clearly valuable to criminal investigators. Since 2015, the company has supported investigations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Europol. In most cases, says Levin, investigators turn to Chainalysis when they already have some kind of lead, like a Bitcoin address they found among a suspect’s possessions. If they can determine that a suspect is using a particular exchange, they can use a court order get more information from that exchange.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads Our guide to stories in the archives that put technology in perspective.

In many places it’s unclear the degree to which exchanges are required by law to know their customers and make sure they aren’t laundering money, as is required of traditional banks. But it’s difficult for exchanges to open bank accounts if they don’t understand who their customers are. And if the government is able to see that criminals are using certain exchanges, the exchanges want to be able to see that too, says Yang.\n\nThe news isn’t all good for law enforcement, though. There are ways to confuse investigators, such as using so-called mixing services, which take bitcoins from many users and mix them up before sending them back out to different addresses at different times. More important, some newer cryptocurrencies, prominently Zcash and Monero, are designed to conceal the information that Chainalysis, BlockSeer, and others use to follow the money.\n\nSavvy criminals are already migrating to these untraceable systems. Last month, Chainalysis confirmed that WannaCry hackers were able to convert a portion of their ransom payouts from Bitcoin to Monero before the service they were using blacklisted their addresses.', 'Cryptocurrency is a complicated mixture of several different fields, which contributes to the difficulty people have in understanding it. Even the term is confusing and often leaves novices scratching their heads. However, the multidisciplinary nature of digital currency is also probably one of its greatest strengths.\n\nThree different types of people are drawn to cryptocurrency: cryptographers/computer scientists, crypto-anarchists and finance professionals. Each of these types brings their own unique insights and perspectives.\n\nThe first wave: cryptographers and computer scientists\n\nBitcoin was invented and developed by the truly brilliant Satoshi Nakamoto. Although nobody knows Satoshi’s identity, we do know that the genius was exceptionally skilled in both cryptography and software development.\n\nCryptography is a rather eclectic field, the forte of mathematicians and codebreakers. Satoshi possessed a strong knowledge of cryptography, and when he combined it with his understanding of computer science, he discovered the solution to a vexing problem.\n\nFor years, some rather brilliant people had tried to devise a way to enable the transfer of value among a network of people who don’t trust one another. Such trustless transactions would have the potential to disintermediate the finance world completely.\n\nSatoshi’s solution was the Blockchain, which serves as a perfect, trustless, distributed ledger of all transactions done on the currency network he created: Bitcoin.\n\nSatoshi announced his development on the cryptography mailing list, an obscure forum frequented by some of the best cryptographers in the world. Hal Finney was one such person, and he worked with Satoshi very early in the Bitcoin’s history. In fact, the first Bitcoin transaction that ever took place was when Satoshi sent funds to Finney to verify that the software actually worked.\n\nOver time, more and more cryptographers and computer science gurus became associated with Bitcoin, and sometime in 2012, Satoshi vanished. Others carried the torch and continued developing the protocol.\n\nThe computer scientists and cryptographers are the founders and maintainers of Bitcoin.\n\nThe second wave: crypto-anarchists\n\nThe second wave of digital currency enthusiasts were the crypto-anarchists. They saw Bitcoin as a way to liberate the world from the grip of oppressive governments and their fiat-based financial systems. This group tended to be politically motivated and unwilling to compromise on their basic principles.\n\nMuch of Bitcoin’s anti-establishment, decentralized culture comes from this group. Satoshi himself likely sympathized with their philosophy, based on posts he made to the mailing list and on BitcoinTalk.\n\nBecause of their nature, this group abhors all attempts to regulate digital currency. To them, cryptocurrency isn’t about becoming rich or achieving mainstream adoption. It’s a social and political movement.\n\nThe crypto-anarchists are the heart and soul of Bitcoin. They work hard to ensure the project remains decentralized and true to its founding principles.\n\nThe third wave: finance experts\n\nSomewhere around the end of 2013, the digital currency sector caught the notice of finance professionals. This group is generally less politically motivated and more willing to compromise on issues such as regulation and taxation. They seek mainstream acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\nThese finance specialists, many of whom have Wall Street credentials, have been highly successful in increasing the adoption of digital currency. With their help, Bitcoin has made significant inroads into the traditional financial system, and its value has boomed.\n\nSome, like the Winklevoss twins, have sought to establish options for mainstream investors to participate. Though their proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) application was denied earlier this year, they have appealed the ruling. Recent changes in key SEC personnel could aid their cause.\n\nLikewise, Barry Silbert founded the Digital Currency Group which has full or partial ownership of a number of important Bitcoin-related companies. The Digital Currency Group owns Grayscale Investments, which sponsors the Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nThis trust is publically traded under the GBTC ticker, and its value is backed by sizeable Bitcoin holdings. GBTC is one of the only ways that US investors can expose their tax-advantaged retirement accounts to the price of Bitcoin.\n\nEntire currencies, such as Dash, have been created when finance professionals discovered something that was missing in existing cryptocurrencies. Dash was founded by Evan Duffield, who himself holds a Series 65 license, and who realized that proper incentivization was missing from Bitcoin and other currencies.\n\nRather than relying on altruism to get people to run full nodes (as is the case with Bitcoin), Duffield thought these “masternode” owners should be paid for maintaining a copy of the full Blockchain (and performing other services for the network.)\n\nWhile the number of Bitcoin nodes has been declining over the last several years, the number of Dash nodes has been rising.\n\nA company called LedgerX will soon release a regulated market for the trading of Bitcoin futures, following the CFTC’s approval of their request this summer. This will allow traditional, mainstream investors to expose themselves to Bitcoin more readily, and will likely prove a crucial step in an ultimate ETF approval.\n\nThe finance group is responsible for much of the Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance to date. They have brought in institutional money and are continuing to build on-ramps for traditional investors to gain Bitcoin exposure.\n\nMulti-disciplinary\n\nBitcoin’s strength comes from the fact that so many disparate groups are interested in developing the project.\n\nAt first glance, it might appear that the programmers and cryptographers are solely responsible for Bitcoin’s success, but this isn’t so. Crypto-anarchists, financiers and others have all played meaningful roles.\n\nOther talented individuals and groups will likely be attracted to digital currency in the future, and they likely have unforeseen roles to play as well.', 'As bitcoin is turning into a mainstream currency, a lot of new players are trying to get in the mining industry. In 2017 alone, the cryptocurrency saw its biggest rise ever and with the meteoric rise along came new investors and new players eager to have their share of the Bitcoin pie.\n\nTokyo-based GMO Internet Group announced on September 7 it was entering the Bitcoin mining industry. The GMO Group is about to invest more than $3 million to begin its mining operations in the first half of 2018. The Group says it will invest more than 10 percent of its non-current assets, which stood at around $32 million at the end of last year.\n\nFounded in 1995, GMO is well-known for its high-quality registering domain names and hosting web services. But recently, it has caught Bitcoin fever. In January 2017, the Japanese company announced an entrance into the bitcoin wallet market. The GMO Group believes that digital currencies like bitcoin are the future which will eventually create a global “borderless economic zone” and evolve into “universal currencies.”\n\nA New Mining Arms Race\n\nAccording to the announcement, GMO is also making plans to develop its own mining hardware, claiming they will operate at an unprecedented degree of efficiency. So far it was revealed that GMO chips are going to use 7-nanometer (nm) nodes, which make it by far the most efficient chips ever produced, able to be four times more energy efficient than the current industry standard 16 nm nodes.\n\nIf the group successfully introduces the new hardware, it can trigger a new mining arms race in the bitcoin industry. Since Bitcoin miners compete to find a block and get the biggest reward, once these new chips are introduced, the rest of the miners will have to start looking for an upgrade otherwise, they will not be able to compete. According to experts in the field, this will streamline the development of the next generation of mining chips and take the industry to higher grounds as new and strong players begin to hop in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nA new Bitcoin mining solution is capable of shaking up the industry; this means that miners who have not reached the Return on Investment (ROI) using their current mining rigs until then may end up with obsolete mining rigs on their hands.\n\nDiego Guiterrez, the chief executive of the mining software company RSK Labs, commented:\n\n“The ones at risk are the ones still trying to recover their investment because they will be four times less productive. The other mining chip developers will surely follow and create their own 7 nm chips if they are not already doing it.”\n\nGuiterrez expects to see most major players going for an upgrade as the technology for 7 nm chips becomes generally available to the foundries who do much of the work of the production of the chips.\n\nCutting Costs\n\nThe company is looking to cut the costs of the whole operation and already designated its mining operation site to be located in northern Europe. The location was selected because the weather is colder and where, in some countries, an excess of electric power is produced thus making the input cheaper. This way, the group looks to deliver competitive prices as an attraction to get more people in.\n\nThe business model the GMO group is seeking to apply is very similar to many that are already in place such as Bitmain. The company is planning to manage the business from its production phase to the end consumer. GMO will develop its own chips and assemble them into mining rigs, operate its own mines, and rent or sell them to the end consumer.\n\nGMO’s arrival on the scene will certainly cause tension in between competitors in the industry. Nevertheless, competitive pressures will benefit both the integrity and stability of the network. That means that there will be lesser chances for a 51 percent attack to happen with more players stepping in.', 'This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others.

The forked BCH cryptocurrency has struggled to gain momentum after a roller coaster first week of trading back in early August.\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nBCH: Stuck in a Range\n\nBitcoin cash appears to have settled after a fresh weekend selloff wiped billions from its market value. The BCH/USD exchange rate climbed more than 7% during Asian trading to reach $552.00, according to CoinMarketCap. More than $372 million worth of BCH traded hands over the past 24 hours.\n\nBCH’s dollar-denominated market cap is roughly $9.2 billion. The token lost roughly $2 billion over the weekend on fears that China’s ICO attack would extend far beyond the new crowdfunding model.\n\nBitcoin cash settled at $767.76 in its first 24 hours of trading on Aug. 2. Prices have yet to regain that level. Since hitting $707.83 on Aug. 19, the token has mostly fluctuated between $500.00 and $700.00.\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace.

The token is likely to face strong resistance in the mid-$600.00 range. Prices remain highly volatile, as evidenced by the recent rollover.\n\nBCH Struggles to Catch On\n\nBitcoin cash has struggled to earn support from a large segment of the blockchain community. Coinbase executive Brian Armstrong recently shared his thoughts on bitcoin cash in a Twitter post.\n\nArmstrong said Coinbase is “agnostic” on which assets are included on the currency exchange, but that it won’t “rush anything out.”\n\nAccessing BCH remains a principal concern for many of its proponents, so much so that they threatened to sue Coinbase for refusing to support it. Low hash power and difficulty estimating its intrinsic value have also stunted BCH’s growth.\n\nHowever, the news isn’t entirely negative. Bitcoin cash is the third most popular cryptocurrency by market cap, and was recently integrated into company wallets by Bitcoin.com. This suggests that the newly forked coin is slowly being integrated across the blockchain spectrum.\n\nBitcoin cash has has also been added to Bitcoin IRA, a Los Angeles-based company that allows Americans to access cryptocurrency in an IRS-approved retirement account. Bitcoin IRA also announced it will be supporting Ethereum Classic and Litecoin alongside existing support for Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP.', 'Posted on September 11, 2017 at 1:19 PM\n\nA new version of the 2016 malware Rogue.Tech-Support has emerged, where infected users are asked to pay US$50 in Bitcoin to unlock their Windows.\n\nThe infamous malware with a system message ‘Your Windows is Banned’ is back. Those who fall victim to this new malware are asked to pay US$50 in Bitcoin so that the ‘tech support personnel’ can unblock their Windows.\n\nThis malware is a new version of the Rogue.Tech-Support malware that emerged in late 2016. Victim computers would receive an error message on the lock screen on Startup, and the message would say that their installation of Windows has been banned. The users then see a US phone number which the message says they can call on to resolve the issue. The original malware requested users to pay US$99 to get their Windows unblocked by a trusted support person.\n\nWhile many would think that no one would fall for such a gimmick, a surprising number of users paid the amount. It is plain to see that a trusted company would never require you to pay such an amount to a support personnel. Besides, those with valid Microsoft keys can always dispute the company’s decision to temporarily block someone’s key on grounds of suspicious activity.\n\nWhat’s more, one could call the number given in the message, contrary to what most people would believe. However, no one got tech support. Instead, they received offers for a number of useless services.\n\nThe new version of this malware now asks the user to pay US$50 in Bitcoin. There is no mention of a phone number to call on since the creators of the malware themselves would know that no one would believe a trusted company would demand payment in Bitcoin. Besides, not a lot of people would call the number, so it didn’t have much value for the malicious users. Again, the message is shown on the lock screen, and users are requested to pay US$50 in Bitcoin so that they can use their Windows system again.\n\nThis is a type of scam tech support malware that is growing increasingly popular these days. Over the past couple of years or so, the number of such malware on the internet has grown rapidly. The thing about these is that the damage is done before you get the error message on your lock screen. Since you get the message, it means that the malware is already installed on your system. The best thing to do is do a malware check and full system scan.\n\nOf course, these malware almost always make their way into your system through the internet. Clicking on suspicious links in emails is the primary entry point of malware in your system. A lot of articles on the web warn users about refraining from doing so, yet these malware continue to flood the internet because people just don’t learn.\n\nIf you aren’t too familiar with using the internet and don’t know about the different kinds of threats you face while browsing the web, you should read a few informative articles. Staying up to date on the latest kinds of malware circulating on the internet is the best way to protect yourself. If you know how these malware infects your system, and know what happens once they lay siege in your system, you can be vigilant for protection and quick action in case of infection.\n\nAll in all, any message which seems to come from a legitimate and trusted company and demands you to pay them money is surely a fraudulent message. These companies will never require you to pay money to an individual to resolve your issue.\n\nIf you are unsure, it’s best to contact the customer support of the organization that apparently sent you the message. But in all probability, the message is fake, and your system is almost certainly infected with malware. So, it’s up to you to heed caution and not fall prey to such ridiculous attempts to steal money.']"
09/12/2017,"[""JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he would fire any employee trading bitcoin for being “stupid.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency “won’t end well,” he told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday, predicting it will eventually blow up. “It’s a fraud” and “worse than tulip bulbs.”\n\nJamie Dimon. Photographer: Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg\n\nIf a JPMorgan trader began trading in bitcoin, he said, “I’d fire them in a second. For two reasons: It’s against our rules, and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous.”\n\nBitcoin has soared in recent months, spurred by greater acceptance of the blockchain technology that underpins the exchange method and optimism that faster transaction times will encourage broader use of the cryptocurrency. Prices have climbed more than four-fold this year -- a run that has drawn debate over whether that’s a bubble.\n\nWatch Next: Elevation's McNamee Says Bitcoin Is Probably in a Bubble\n\nBitcoin initially slipped after Dimon’s remarks. It was down as much as 2.7 percent before recovering. Last week, it slumped after reports that China plans to ban trading of virtual currencies on domestic exchanges, dealing another blow to the $150 billion cryptocurrency market.\n\nTulips are a reference to the mania that swept Holland in the 17th century, with speculators driving up prices of virtually worthless tulip bulbs to exorbitant levels. That didn’t end well.\n\nIn bitcoin’s case, Dimon said he’s skeptical authorities will allow a currency to exist without state oversight, especially if something goes wrong. “Someone’s going to get killed and then the government’s going to come down,” he said. “You just saw in China, governments like to control their money supply.”\n\nDimon differentiated between the bitcoin currency and the underlying blockchain technology, which he said can be useful. Still, he said banks’ application of blockchain “won’t be overnight.”\n\nRead a QuickTake: The excitement over bitcoin and blockchain\n\nThe bank chief said he wouldn’t short bitcoin because there’s no telling how high it will go before it collapses. The best argument he’s heard, he said, is that it can be useful to people in places with no other options -- so long as the supply of coins doesn’t surge.\n\n“If you were in Venezuela or Ecuador or North Korea or a bunch of parts like that, or if you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than U.S. dollars,” he said. “So there may be a market for that, but it’d be a limited market.”\n\nTo be sure, Dimon later noted that his daughter purchased some bitcoin.\n\nGundlach’s Concerns\n\n“It’s interesting that somebody with that high profile of the establishment is out there with that bold statement,” Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital, said on a webcast Tuesday after Dimon’s remarks.\n\nGundlach said he doesn’t have a view on bitcoin but that he’s concerned it may be more vulnerable to manipulation than enthusiasts admit. “Maybe I’m just too old, but I’m going to let this mania go on without me.”\n\nOne place where cryptocurrencies and traditional finance are coming together is at CBOE Holdings Inc., the owner of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Last month, the firm teamed up with Gemini Trust Co. -- the startup created by the Winklevoss twins made famous by the 2010 Facebook film “The Social Network” -- with a plan to offer bitcoin futures.\n\nCBOE’s chairman and CEO, Ed Tilly, defended such efforts after Dimon’s remarks.\n\n“Like it or not, people want exposure to bitcoin,” Tilly said. Believers can bet on its rise, and Dimon is welcome to take the other side, he said. “We’re happy to be the ones in the middle.”\n\n— With assistance by John Gittelsohn"", 'Amid a swirl of speculation and assumptions, mainstream media outlets in the West are reporting that China will indeed be banning Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nThis comes after the Chinese government placed a blanket ban on ICOs earlier.\n\nThe reports in publications like the Wall Street Journal and others are quoting ‘anonymous’ sources that were not providing too much detail.\n\nAnonymous sources\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, and their unverified and anonymous sources, the regulators were not even sending clear messages on the details of the ban - such as when it would occur.\n\nApparently, one regulator told an exchange that the decision had already been made, while another said that it could take a few months.\n\n""Despite the foggy nature of these proclamations, the Bitcoin price has taken a second dip after recovering from the news of the ICO ban in China.""\n\nBloomberg also reports on the claims about exchange bans but says:\n\n“The ban will only apply to trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private.”\n\nThe apparent reason for the exchange ban?\n\nBitcoin has been a major disruptor in China and its socialist monetary policies.\n\nAs such, it is believed that the Chinese government has perceived the growing interest of the digital currency as a threat especially as Chinese investors have been seen to buy up Bitcoin and bet against the yuan.\n\nThe anonymous source cites “too much disorder” as the reason for the alleged shutdown, echoing the Chinese central bank’s words last week criticizing ICOs for disrupting the country’s financial order.\n\nHighly skeptical\n\nMany hardline beliefs in Bitcoin are rightly skeptical about the perceived ban from China as there has been no official word, and no one brave enough to put their name on the news.\n\nCEO and founder of Chinese exchange BTCC has put up a twitter poll asking if people believe that the ban is real with over 80 percent of people saying no.\n\nOKCoin responded to this news saying:\n\n“‘Till now we haven\'t been informed by any authorities about closing BTC exchanges, if that happens, we will show notifications on our website in no time. Even if that\'s the case, we would be running offline trading for users, and your balance of coins in your account will be absolutely safe.”', 'China’s move last week to ban initial coin offerings (ICO) has caused chaos among start-ups looking to raise money through the novel fund-raising scheme, prompting halts, about-turns and re-thinks.\n\nChina is cracking down on fundraising through launches of token-based digital currencies, targeting ICOs in a market that has ballooned this year in what has been a bonanza for digital currency entrepreneurs.\n\nThe boom has fueled a jump in the value of cryptocurrencies, but raised fears of a potential bubble.\n\n“This is not unlike the dotcom bubble of 2000,” said a partner at a venture capital fund in Shanghai, who didn’t want to be named because of the issue’s sensitivity. “There are a lot of companies raising a lot of money for not very good ideas, and these will eventually be weeded out. But even from the big dotcom bust, you still have gems.”\n\n“One of the reasons regulators stepped in was that the ICO fever extended beyond the traditional crypto community. The timing was an attempt to pre-empt this before it goes into a much broader mass market in China,” the partner said.\n\nInvestors in China contributed up to 2.6 billion yuan ($394 million) worth of cryptocurrencies through ICOs in January-June, according to a state-run media report citing National Committee of Experts on Internet Financial Security Technology data.\n\nPre-ICO roadshows featuring elaborate standing room-only presentations at 5-star hotels drew a diverse crowd, including grandmothers – a likely tipping point for regulators.\n\nThe hype and subsequent crackdown came as China focuses on economic and social stability ahead of next month’s congress of the Communist Party, a once-in-five-years event.\n\nBeijing is also waging a broader campaign against fraudulent fundraising and speculative investment, which analysts attribute to China’s underdeveloped financial regulation and lack of legitimate investment options.\n\nWhile several start-ups said the exuberance had got out of control and they had expected Beijing to act, they said last week’s move panicked investors and caused confusion.\n\nMi Huijin, for example, said he had just got off a train to Shanghai after closing a deal for his Singpay blockchain start-up when he switched on his phone to a flood of messages about the ban. He summoned the host of a popular live-stream channel to the railway station to calm his followers in a 40-minute broadcast.\n\n“Everyone shouldn’t panic. If you’ve nothing to be guilty of what’s there to be scared of?” he told the roughly 800,000 viewers. “After reviewing the regulations, I feel it’s a good thing.”\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter\n\nNot everyone was convinced. While some comments below his video asked if Singpay would offer refunds, others warned that some users had reported the start-up to police.\n\nChina’s position – which differs from regulators elsewhere, who say ICOs may be securities and thus subject to regulation – remains open to interpretation.\n\nHu Bin, deputy director of the finance institute at the China Academy of Social Sciences, an institution directly under the State Council, or cabinet, has said this is a “stop on ICOs, not a ban. What are we stopping? Illegal ICOs.”\n\nHu said China recognized there is real demand for ICOs, but wants to prevent them being used for speculation.\n\n“It’s entirely proper for the Chinese government to seek protection for consumers and prevent fraud, (but) confining capital raising to a specific established sector of finance … is to ignore the enormous societal value that blockchain technology can present,” said Alex Bessonov of BitClave, a Silicon Valley-based blockchain company, which, he said, is now discouraging Chinese investors.\n\nCancelled ICOs, Returned tokens\n\nLi Yuan, CEO of Selfsell, a start-up hoping to build a platform for retail investors, said he had to cancel a planned ICO for last week, and return all pledged coins.\n\nFor those who already conducted their ICO, things are even more complicated.\n\nDa Hongfei, founder of Neo, a public blockchain which raised 30 million yuan ($4.65 million) through an ICO last year, said it was extending to next month an offer for participants to return their Neo coins in exchange for bitcoin.\n\nWhile the government announcement appeared to require all funds be returned to investors, Da said he can’t force people to exchange their tokens as they would lose out at bitcoin’s current rate. Bitcoin traded around $4,350 on Tuesday, according to Bitstamp, down from nearly $5,000 earlier this month.\n\n“We offer the option, but we can’t point a gun at the user and ask them to refund,” Da said.\n\nThat said, nearly all the ICO organizers interviewed by Reuters agreed the ICO market was getting out of control and needed change.\n\nMore than 100,000 investors acquired new cryptocurrencies through 65 ICOs in January-June – a frenzy that attracted both investors seeking a quick trading profit and individuals and firms able to raise funds with little more than a plan and a website.\n\n“Many people have not been very discerning on whether the project is actually good or bad,” said Daniel Wang, founder of blockchain start-up Loopring, adding he asked Chinese ICO investors to return their tokens, though it’s difficult to recall tokens already trading on the secondary market.\n\nPlatforms in limbo\n\nIndeed, the ban has left around five dozen platforms in China – websites that promote and list the tokens, usually in return for money or a portion of the offering, so they can be traded – in limbo.\n\nMore than 40, including ICO365 and Bitbays, have shut down or suspended new ICO activity. Some also took their websites offline.\n\nBinance, which said that over 80 percent of its users were based overseas, said it would restrict all Chinese IP addresses from trading.\n\nFor those companies serious about raising funds, there are other options.\n\nXiaoning Li, CEO of VCCoin, said he returned 2,000 bitcoins to investors and was figuring out what to do next. “We have angel investors. We will probably still do an ICO, but have to look at where and how to do it,” he told Reuters.\n\nThe co-founder of another platform said they were re-thinking their strategy outside China, and “will shift our focus to markets which are not banning ICOs, but rather trying to put in place higher standards and regulatory supervision” – such as the United States, Canada and Singapore.', 'JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday he would fire any employee trading bitcoin for being “stupid.” The cryptocurrency “won’t end well,” he told an investor conference in New York, predicting it will eventually blow up.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday he would fire any employee trading bitcoin for being “stupid.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency “won’t end well,” he told an investor conference in New York, predicting it will eventually blow up. “It’s a fraud” and “worse than tulip bulbs,” Dimon said.\n\nBitcoin has soared in recent months, spurred by greater acceptance of the blockchain technology that underpins the exchange method and optimism that faster transaction times will encourage broader use of the cryptocurrency. Prices have climbed more than fourfold this year .\n\nTulips are a reference to the mania that swept Holland in the 17th century, with speculators driving up prices of virtually worthless tulip bulbs to exorbitant levels. That didn’t end well.\n\nIn bitcoin’s case, Dimon said he’s skeptical authorities will allow a currency to exist without state oversight, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nDimon differentiated between the bitcoin currency and the underlying blockchain technology, which he said can be useful. Still, he said banks’ application of blockchain “won’t be overnight.”', ""Count large fund managers among those unable to resist the allure of bitcoin's massive returns.\n\nOwning the scorching-hot cryptocurrency — which has surged more than 350% this year — is seen as the most crowded trade to a pool of 214 fund managers overseeing $629 billion, according to a survey conducted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nTo be specific, 26% of investors surveyed in September said they viewed being long bitcoin as the most crowded position. Coming in second place and being dethroned from the top spot was the long Nasdaq trade, with 22% of responders mentioning it, BAML's data showed.\n\nBut while bitcoin has seen unbelievable gains in recent months, its price has fallen from a record high reached on September 1 amid a Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges. The reported ban comes after China decided to halt initial coin offerings, a hot new way for startups to raise funds by generating their own virtual currency.\n\nFurther, Nobel-winning author Robert Shiller, who predicted the two biggest speculative markets in recent history, recently doubled down on his view that bitcoin is a bubble in an interview with Quartz. BAML's survey shows large fund managers have yet to heed his warning — a choice made at their own potential peril.\n\nRounding out the top three most crowded trades in BAML's study is the short US dollar trade. The greenback has slid almost 10% in 2017, and hedge funds in particular have been keen to position for further weakness, according to recent Commodity Futures and Trading Commission data.\n\nThe prevalence of shorting the dollar marks a major shift for fund managers, for whom going long the currency was the number one investment as recently as April, capping off a five-month streak as the most packed trade.\n\nThe following chart shows the evolution of the BAML survey's most crowded investment, with bitcoin taking the reins in September:"", 'MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has a group looking into cryptocurrencies as legal tender, a senior official said on Wednesday, but emphasised the central bank’s discomfort with bitcoin which has recently come under intense global regulatory scrutiny.\n\nA man checks his phone outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai, India June 7, 2017. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade\n\n“Fiat will be when the Reserve Bank, for example, starts issuing digital currency which you can carry in cyberspace, you don’t have physical currency in your pocket,” Sudarshan Sen, an RBI executive director, said at a FinTech conference in Mumbai.\n\n“As regards non-fiat cryptocurrencies, I think, we are not comfortable with them,” Sen added.\n\nThe central bank had not previously disclosed its plans on cryptocurrencies and Sen did not provide any details on where discussions on the issue stand.\n\nIt was unclear whether the group at the RBI plan to issue a recommendation on cryptocurrencies to the government, or if the review is at an early or advanced stage.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that enables individuals to transfer value to each other and pay for goods and services by-passing banks and the mainstream financial system.\n\nBitcoin slid 6.6 percent on Friday, after reports that China was about to shut down local crypto-currency exchanges. On Tuesday, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned that initial coin offerings (ICOs), the practice of creating and selling digital currencies to finance start-up projects, are “very high risk” and speculative.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co, also came out strongly against bitcoin this week dubbing it a “fraud”, and adding that it will blow up. The virtual currency, not backed by any government, has more than quadrupled in value since December to more than $4,100.', 'The Swiss municipality of Chiasso is going to let residents pay their taxes in bitcoin, its mayor has announced.\n\nThe community, on Switzerland’s southern border with Italy, is vying with Zug to be the country’s cryptocurrency hub. Zug, which styles itself as “Crypto Valley,” launched a pilot last year in which it started accepting bitcoin payments for municipal services. The pilot was apparently a success, so Zug has kept the program running.\n\nChiasso—sorry, “CryptoPolis”—is going one further by accepting bitcoin for small tax payments, up to a value of 250 Swiss francs ($261).\n\n“Chiasso is recognised internationally as an epicentre of a growing technological and economic growth for both the canton and in Switzerland,” Mayor Bruno Arrigoni said, according to local media. The move is apparently part of Chiasso’s drive to make up for contraction of the traditional financial sector after the financial crisis.\n\nZug’s scheme also caps bitcoin payments fairly low, only accepting them for a value of up to 200 Swiss francs. At the time of writing, one bitcoin is worth 4122.94 Swiss francs (and $4306.01).\n\nWhile there may be something for these towns to gain by enticing cryptocurrency fans to set up shop on their turf, their caution makes a lot of sense too.\n\nThe value of bitcoin, along with other virtual currencies, has been particularly volatile in recent weeks, largely because of China’s cracking down on initial coin offerings (ICOs)—a trendy but risky form of fundraising that involves issuing new types of tokens—and possibly banning bitcoin exchanges altogether.', 'The internet is replete with people referring to bitcoin as a “bubble.” They are spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt galore. They believe bitcoin’s high price spells impending doom, but their criticisms move beyond mere skepticism. It seems like they just hate cryptocurrency. Yet many of these pundits do not fully grasp bitcoin…or even economics.\n\nAlso read: BTC-e Exchange Comes Back Online With Limited Functionality\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with what a bubble is, investopedia refers to it as an asset driven by unwarranted, but exuberant, market behavior. It is basically a hike in price that has resulted in a lie or “false truth” about the actual value of an asset, and therefore presages a massive selloff.\n\nPeople are Confused About Bitcoin\n\nCommentators like Peter Schiff and others have routinely said bitcoin is a “bubble,” and that it will collapse any moment. They make these claims, but do not seem to understand how bitcoin works. Everyone sees headlines like this all over the internet: “Bitcoin is a false truth, warns analyst,” and this CNBC article, “Bitcoin’s nearly five-fold climb in 2017 looks very similar to tech bubble surge.” There is even a site dedicated to collecting these FUD and clickbait claims the mainstream media repeats.\n\nIn a recent Chicago Tribune op-ed article called “Why Investors Should be Wary of Bitcoin,” writer Gail MarksJarvis, also compared the bitcoin boom to various historical bubbles:\n\nDo you remember the housing crash of 2008, when the innocents who bought homes thinking they’d make a fortune on soaring prices ended up losing 30 percent on plunging home values? Do you remember the technology stock bubble of early 2000? Until the technology bubble burst, people were euphoric about the pioneers of the fledgling Internet in the 1990s, and figured the gains in technology stocks would never end.\n\nShe went on to say that bitcoin is not special or different in this regard. She implied it is a “volatile bubble” that could burst at anytime and leave investors gasping for air. Her comparisons — and all comparisons mentioned — are erroneous, though. The currency is not comparable to any of the aforesaid history lessons.\n\nBitcoin is Special\n\nBitcoin is special. It is not a company that could lose profitability and fail. It is certainly not a speculative real estate scam that could crumble as a result of government and bank-induced chicanery. Bitcoin is another animal.\n\nIts value is not increasing because of marketplace lies. It is increasing because it is a life-changing financial invention. It is increasing because more people are adopting it. The “network effect” is in full swing.\n\nIt is true investors are rabid to get on board and this excitement is causing bitcoin’s price to explode, but do not confuse this with an artificially inflated bubble based on a “false truth.” In accordance with the network effect, the more people that continue to get involved with bitcoin, the higher the price will climb.\n\nBasic Economics\n\nBitcoin is also growing as a result of basic economics. The supply is limited to 21 million units and this necessarily makes bitcoin a scarce asset. When things are scarce and people want those things, their value will ultimately rise. Supply and demand at work.\n\nThus, when economics and the network effect intermingle, you have a recipe for explosive growth within an asset. Bitcoin is not some new version of the 17th century tulip bulb. It is a groundbreaking advancement in accounting and money.\n\nBubbles versus Technological Failures\n\nWith that said, this does not mean Bitcoin is guaranteed to succeed. The price could be affected if something bad were to happen to the protocol that underlies it. If this kind of event ever occurred, people would certainly lose faith in bitcoin and its price would collapse.\n\nHowever, this is not the same thing as an artificially hiked price or “bubble.” It is the result of a technological or community failure, but not a market failure. For instance, Bitcoin just upgraded to Segwit. However, Segwit does not necessarily align with Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision that Bitcoin should be a scalable, peer-2-peer cash system. Instead, it turns bitcoin into a settlement layer, which could do harm to the currency.\n\nThis illustration is not intended to spread panic. I am just saying bitcoin is susceptible to failures and crashes. It is just that these potential crashes are not the result of a “bubble.” They would occur because the community failed to make bitcoin economically viable. In either case, many people hope Segwit will work over the long run and that there will not be a technological failure.\n\nConclusion\n\nPoint being: if people want to call bitcoin a bubble, they ought to explain why exactly it is, instead of incompetently comparing it to past bubbles that do not share any characteristics with bitcoin other than a big price tag. If bitcoin were a bubble, it would be the largest one humankind has ever witnessed (not counting the 6,000-year old gold bubble, of course). But that is unlikely. It is more likely that bitcoin is just an amazing creation. Its value and potential dwarfs any fintech idea heretofore imagined, and the blockchain communities are just getting started.\n\nWhy do people believe bitcoin is a bubble?

Here is an overview weighing the good, and the bad, in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nThe bad.\n\n1- Crypto-currencies have become a tool for money laundering and criminal activities. As the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has helped fuel the rise of ransomware attacks—extortion schemes, like the recent WannaCry cyberattack, in which hackers hold the contents of a victim’s computer hostage until they get paid. Criminals can use Bitcoin to collect ransoms easily and without having to reveal their identities. The currency has also been associated with online drug sales, money laundering, and sex trafficking.\n\n2- North Korean regime appears to be stepping up efforts to secure Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that could be used to avoid additional trade restrictions. North Korean hackers are increasing their attacks on crypto-currency exchanges in South Korea and related sites. They also breached an English-language bitcoin news website and collected Bitcoin ransom payments from global victims of the malware WannaCry.\n\n3- In the meantime, China plans to ban trading of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies on domestic exchanges, dealing another blow to the $150 billion cryptocurrency market after the country outlawed initial coin offerings last week. The ban will only apply to trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges, according to Bloomberg. Authorities don’t have plans to stop over-the-counter transactions, the people said. China’s central bank said it couldn’t immediately comment.\n\n4- JPMorgan CEO, Jamie Dimon hit the wires on Tuesday with comments that were not Bitcoin-friendly. Dimon said that he ‘would fire any trader trading Bitcoin for being stupid,’ and that the move into Bitcoin ‘won’t end well.’\n\nThe good.\n\n1- On the other hand, in the other side of the world, researchers at Finland’s central bank have praised Bitcoin’s economic system as “revolutionary”. However, this praise has not been enough to divert Bitcoin prices in the past weeks. Despite all the drama, the growing crypto-currency market is evident that Bitcoin is here to stay.\n\n2- Nasdaq survey sees ‘Long Bitcoin’ as the world’s most crowded trade, which means the majority of traders disagree with JPMorgan. Only time would tell.\n\nTechnical Points\n\nBTC/USD is approaching the 4,065 support level and the 23% Fibonacci retracement level on the daily time frame. From a technical point of view, this retracement is NBD as the pair has previously seen pullbacks within the general uptrend. Previously the pullbacks have bottomed out at 50% Fibonacci retracement level. This is something that could very well happen again.\n\nThe pair remains above the daily Ichimoku cloud, with the Tenkan line turning down towards the Kijun line.\n\nWith that, and as the fundamental volatility continues in the cryptocurrency world, we could see further drops in the pair towards 3,636.\n\nBTC/JPY chart shows that the Kijun line has officially crossed below the Tenkan line of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo moving averages. This marks the first Ichimoku-based bearish signal, indicating we could see further drops towards the 38% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels at 420,000 and 390,000 respectively.\n\nThis drop is despite the JPY weakness across the board, indicating that Bitcoin is losing to JPY at this point in terms of strength.\n\nDisclaimer (1): You must calculate your risk tolerance before deciding on which trading strategy is suitable for your portfolio.

09/13/2017,"['Comparing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Other Cryptos\n\nView the high resolution version of today’s graphic by clicking here.\n\nUnless you’ve been hiding under a rock, you’re probably aware that we’re in the middle of a cryptocurrency explosion. In one year, the value of all currencies increased a staggering 1,466% – and newer coins like Ethereum have even joined Bitcoin in gaining some mainstream acceptance.\n\nAnd while people like Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan and famed value investor Howard Marks have been extremely critical of cryptocurrencies as of late, many other investors are continuing to ride the wave. As we’ve noted in the past, the possible effects of the blockchain cannot be understated, and it could even change the backbone of how financial markets work.\n\nHowever, even with the excitement and action that comes with the space, a major problem still exists for the layman: it’s really challenging to decipher the differences between cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Ripple, and Dash.\n\nFor this reason, we worked with social trading network eToro to come up with an infographic that breaks down the major differences between these coins all in one place.\n\nA Description of Major Coins\n\nHere are descriptions of the major cryptocurrencies, which make up 84% of the coin universe.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the original cryptocurrency, and was released as open-source software in 2009. Using a new distributed ledger known as the blockchain, the Bitcoin protocol allows for users to make peer-to-peer transactions using digital currency while avoiding the “double spending” problem.\n\nNo central authority or server verifies transactions, and instead the legitimacy of a payment is determined by the decentralized network itself.\n\nBottom Line: Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency with the most liquidity and significant network effects. It also has brand name recognition around the world, with an eight-year track record.\n\nLitecoin\n\nLitecoin was launched in 2011 as an early alternative to Bitcoin. Around this time, increasingly specialized and expensive hardware was needed to mine bitcoins, making it hard for regular people to get in on the action. Litecoin’s algorithm was an attempt to even the playing field so that anyone with a regular computer could take part in the network.\n\nBottom Line: Other altcoins have taken away some of Litecoin’s market share, but it still has an early mover advantage and some strong network effects.\n\nRipple\n\nRipple is considerably different from Bitcoin. That’s because Ripple is essentially a global settlement network for other currencies such as USD, Bitcoin, EUR, GBP, or any other units of value (i.e. frequent flier miles, commodities).\n\nTo make any such a settlement, however, a tiny fee must be paid in XRP (Ripple’s native tokens) – and these are what trade on cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBottom Line: Ripple runs on many of the same principles of Bitcoin, but for a different purpose: to serve as the middleman for all global FX transactions. If it can successfully capture that market, the potential is high.\n\nEthereum:\n\nEthereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.\n\nIn the Ethereum blockchain, instead of mining for bitcoin, miners work to earn ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network. Beyond a tradeable cryptocurrency, ether is also used by application developers to pay for transaction fees and services on the Ethereum network.\n\nBottom Line: Ethereum serves a different purpose than other cryptocurrencies, but it has quickly grown to displace all but Bitcoin in value. Some experts are so bullish on Ethereum that they even see it becoming the world’s top cryptocurrency in just a short span of time – but only time will tell.\n\nEthereum Classic:\n\nIn 2016, the Ethereum community faced a difficult decision: The DAO, a venture capital firm built on top of the Ethereum platform, had $50 million in ether stolen from it through a security vulnerability.\n\nThe majority of the Ethereum community decided to help The DAO by “hard forking” the currency, and then changing the blockchain to return the stolen proceeds back to The DAO. The minority thought this idea violated the key foundation of immutability that the blockchain was designed around, and kept the original Ethereum blockchain the way it was. Hence, the “Classic” label.\n\nBottom Line: As time goes on, Ethereum Classic has been carving out a separate identity from its bigger sibling. With similar capabilities and a different set of principles, Ethereum Classic could still have upside.\n\nDash:\n\nDash is an attempt to improve on Bitcoin in two main areas: speed of transactions, and anonymity. To do this, it has a two-tier architecture with miners and also “masternodes” that help the network perform advanced functions such as near-instant transactions and coin-mixing to provide additional privacy.\n\nBottom Line: The innovations behind Dash are interesting, and could help to make the coin more consumer-friendly than other alternatives.\n\nBonus: Bitcoin Cash\n\nAlthough not included in the graphic, we also wanted to add a quick word on Bitcoin Cash. This new currency “hard forked” from Bitcoin about a month ago, as a result of miner disagreements about the future of Bitcoin. Here’s a detailed summary of the announcement.', 'A previous version of this story gave an incorrect day for when bitcoin prices peaked above $5,000. The story has been corrected.\n\nGetty Images Dimon may have just made bitcoin owners feel this small\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. boss Jamie Dimon just leveled one of the harshest criticisms about bitcoin and the broader digital-currency sector to date.\n\nSpeaking at a banking industry conference organized by Barclays BCS, +0.46% Dimon compared the rapid ascent of bitcoin BTCUSD, +7.20% with the 17th century mania over tulip bulbs — viewed as a classic, textbook bubble — and predicted that things may end just as badly for investors in the decentralized currency, which has been surging over the past year.\n\n“Bitcoin will eventually blow up. It’s a fraud. It’s worse than tulip bulbs and won’t end well,” Dimon said.\n\nDimon also said he would fire any trader trading bitcoin for being “stupid.”\n\nSpeaking at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference late Tuesday afternoon, Dimon reiterated that “bitcoin is not a real thing and it’s solely speculative and that there’s no need for it in the US.”\n\nRead: Bitcoin is now the most crowded trade around: Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nBitcoin prices fell about 2% to trade at $4,107 on Tuesday, according to digital-currency site Coindesk.com. Bitcoin prices peaked at above $5,000 on Sept. 1, but plunged 18% since then following unverified reports about plans by Chinese authorities to shut down bitcoin exchanges in the country. China’s regulators last week declared so-called initial coin offerings illegal, dealing a blow to all digital currencies.\n\nWall Street reacted swiftly to the verbal bashing from one of the world’s more prominent bankers about the upstart digital-currency market.\n\nBitcoin’s biggest rival, Ether tokens, trading on the Ethereum blockchain, were down nearly 3% Tuesday at $289.\n\nStill, the year-to-date gains for bitcoin are stunning. Bitcoin is up more than 300% since the start of 2017.\n\nBut Ether’s 3,600% gains since January dwarfs traditional stock returns.\n\nComparatively, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.31% is up nearly 12% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.41% is on track for a more than 11% return thus far.\n\nshots fired: DIMON: WOULD FIRE ANY TRADER TRADING BITCOIN FOR BEING STUPID — zerohedge (@zerohedge) September 12, 2017', 'Earlier this week, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, went on a notable, vociferous tirade against Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that has been associated over the years, fairly or not, with the Silk Road drug ring, the Winklevoss twins, and, more recently, mind-blowing returns. Over the years, Bitcoin has become a preferred Dimon nemesis. In 2015, when it was worth around $400 apiece, Dimon predicted that the cryptocurrency wouldn’t survive. This summer, Bitcoin briefly reached a value of $5,000 per unit.\n\nNevertheless, Dimon appears relentless in his criticism. The normally genial C.E.O., who also recently indulged in an unrelated rant about the state of the American experiment and all the “stupid shit” our country is engaged in, appeared uniquely peeved about the recent Bitcoin rally. He called Bitcoin a “fraud.” He said it was “worse than tulip bulbs”—an arcane reference to the tulip mania that seized 17th-century Holland, a favorite of Wall Street types—and “limited.” His apoplectic screed didn’t end there, either. He said that Bitcoin was only used by drug dealers and murderers. This wasn’t going to end well, he suggested.\n\nDimon is obviously a very smart guy. He’s worth an estimated $1.15 billion. He makes around $30 million a year. He went to Harvard Business School, and survived both the financial crisis and a bout with throat cancer while running one of the world’s biggest banking institutions. So I was more than a little surprised to hear someone of his intellectual caliber explain that he would fire an employee “in a second“ for being “stupid“ enough to trade in digital currencies. (It’s particularly confusing because JPMorgan helped create the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a competing cryptocurrency initiative, and developed its own cryptocurrency product built on top of Ethereum.) But Dimon was unequivocal. “It’s against our rules, and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous,” he said.\n\nI have a different theory, however, for why Dimon feels so skeptical about this particular market. I suspect that Bitcoin, and other similar digital currencies, intimidate Wall Street. And if they don’t, they probably should. Putting aside Dimon’s limited understanding of use cases for cryptocurrencies—if you’re a drug dealer or murderer, for example, the preferable currency is actually Monero, which (so far) is truly anonymous and virtually untraceable—Bitcoin has remarkable benefits that have spiked demand. Bitcoin, which can be acquired on a number of online exchanges, disrupts the need for a bank to intermediate transactions. It isn’t controlled by any single person; instead, it’s controlled by the peer-to-peer software that allows people to own Bitcoin. Unlike typical financial institutions, you don’t need a driver’s license to open a Bitcoin account; you don’t pay a “bank” to store your money in its vault; and anyone with an Internet connection can access it, use it, and easily buy and sell it across continents, just like all other digital entities.\n\nPerhaps more important, when I ask people in Silicon Valley which seminal technological advance they think will change the world most in the coming decade, the answer is almost always “the blockchain,” which is the ledger that tracks all transactions for a cryptocurrency. Unlike a traditional bank or corporation, which can be hacked, the blockchain, which is sometimes described as a global spreadsheet, is impossible to break into, and while it’s public, it protects people’s privacy and identities. That technology, people often say, can be applied to anything in the future. For example, you can imagine tracking the financial transactions associated with a politician’s presidential campaign. Or you could imagine buying a skirt steak at Whole Foods, which is part of the blockchain, and being able to see which cow it came from in Portland, and what that cow ate when it was alive. It truly keeps everyone on the blockchain honest.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: there are plenty of things to worry about when it comes to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. There’s theft, massive and volatile fluctuation in pricing, the government’s attempt to dissuade people from using them, and even increased regulation to deter the growth of the platform. There are people who forget their passwords and then there’s no way of getting a new one. (One friend of mine lost his password and therefore lost connection to tens of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency.) Most notably, though, cryptocurrencies, unlike cash, are still incredibly confusing to use. And as a result, the market continues to oscillate.\n\nDimon’s rant sent the value of Bitcoin plummeting several hundred dollars on the exchanges. But even after that drop, the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is close to $140 billion, half of that belonging to Bitcoin. Perhaps most threatening to Dimon is that these cryptocurrencies add up to 40 percent of the valuation of JPMorgan Chase, which is currently valued at $332 billion.\n\nChase is, of course, the biggest bank in America, and in no danger of being usurped any time soon. But as the digital revolution continues to upend our world, it’s worth noting that no institution is permanent any longer. As we watch car companies in Detroit relent to Silicon Valley ride-sharing start-ups, or see Amazon truly eviscerate what is left of retail, one wonders if a full-scale disruption of the banking system is not far in the offing. One thing is abundantly clear: the current financial institutions that we live with today are ripe for disruption. (As my colleague William D. Cohan recently noted, JPMorgan Chase paid $13 billion, in part, to suppress a document alleging a number of improper practices in the run-up to the financial crisis.)\n\nThe banking system has been contorted to make a select few richer, and give way too much control to a handful of ultra-wealthy bankers and C.E.O.s. The same has not yet been proven for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. And for some on Wall Street, that might be pretty scary.\n\nJamie Dimon FOLLOW Follow to get the latest news and analysis about the players in your inbox. See All Players\n\nVideo: Why is Lying the New Normal in the Trump Era?', 'Richard Waters in San Francisco SEPTEMBER 13, 2017 87 The ambition that gave birth to the InterPlanetary File System is as immodest as the name. The brainchild of a Silicon Valley start-up called Protocol Labs, IPFS aims to give anyone the chance to buy and sell unused computer storage space. There is even a made-up unit of exchange for this proposed market: a digital currency called Filecoin. Speculators do not seem concerned that this spot market for global computing resources is still only a plan embedded in a piece of open source software. Or that, if it catches on, it will be competing with corporate giants such as Amazon, the leading cloud computing provider. Despite these obvious obstacles, Protocol Labs raised more than $250m in an open online sale of its invented currency that ended last week. So-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, like this have turned into the year’s most striking financial craze. More than $1.8bn has been raised by software developers from the sale of new currencies with names such as Tezzies, Atoms and Basic Attention Tokens. In unofficial online markets where these and other digital tokens are traded, the mania has hit even more bizarre levels. The value of Ripple — at five years, a cryptocurrency veteran — soared this year on a wider boom that was led by bitcoin. Ripple’s notional value, including coins held by the company for later sale, jumped from $500m at the start of the year to more than $35bn, before falling back to $19bn. Share this graphic The boom in cryptocurrency prices has been fed by uncontrolled speculation, leading regulators to act. In recent days, Chinese authorities have banned ICOs and are now reported to be on the brink of shutting down all cryptocurrency exchanges. The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, warned anyone thinking of buying coins in an ICO that they should only do so if they are prepared to lose everything. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, sent bitcoin prices down 10 per cent on Tuesday when he called the currency a “fraud” and threatened to sack anyone at his bank caught trading it. But cryptocurrencies’ promoters argue that beyond the speculative mania, something profound is taking place. It has created a new way for start-ups developing platforms based on blockchain and other technologies to raise money, using online crowdfunding techniques. Networks such as IPFS are based on a vision of decentralised online services where ordinary users interact directly with each other, rather than through internet companies that set themselves up as gatekeepers to the online world. According to the enthusiasts, many of the most popular internet applications could be remade in this way, leaving the control — and the profits — in the hands of the users. A man uses a smartphone to buy a bitcoin from an ATM in Tokyo, Japan. More than $1.8bn has been raised this year by software developers from the sale of cryptocurrencies with names such as Tezzies, Atoms and Basic Attention Tokens © Bloomberg “This is much like the internet was early on. It could be bigger than anything we’ve seen,” says Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who was one of Silicon Valley’s first cryptocurrency advocates. For investors like this, the new networks have rekindled the libertarian dream of an internet that operates beyond ossified social institutions. “Society is being transformed by this,” says Mr Draper. “We are going to be a much more affluent and fair world when the dust settles here. ICOs are filling in where governments have failed.” But there is another view that draws on a different aspect of internet investment history. “There’s a tendency to turn the brain off and jump in. It’s like Pets.com [which shut down in 2000],” says Mark Williams, a lecturer in financial risk management at Boston University. The speculation is being fed by a hype that is as insidious as the dotcom craze of the late 1990s, he says: “People are treating it like a lottery ticket.” For the unwary, ICOs represent an even bigger risk, as uncertainty about how they should be regulated means most lack even basic protection of securities laws that governed the dotcom IPOs. As pure digital events, the online fundraisings are also exposed to familiar internet frauds, from phishing scams used to rip off the unwary to the hacking of the underlying software underpinning the new ventures — the fate that befell the first prominent ICO last year, for a company called the DAO. Supporters agree that naked speculation accounts for much of the money that has been pouring into ICOs, as buyers are drawn in by the massive notional profits made by the earliest investors — though how many have been able to cash in at the prices quoted on unofficial online exchanges is an open question. Share this graphic The value of the best-known digital currency, bitcoin, has risen eightfold in the past year. That has led to a hunt for the next untapped markets, lifting the notional value of all cryptocurrencies to more than $130bn. With nothing more needed to launch a coin sale than a “white paper” — the document that coin promoters use to lay out their grand plans — and the promise of some computer code, the steady flow of ICOs in the past year has turned into a flood. The boom, which began in early summer, is already exhibiting many of the characteristics of other speculative crazes. New coins have proliferated: more than 150 token sales have been conducted or announced this year. CoinMarketCap lists prices for about 1,100 coins, with more than 120 ICOs planned before the end of September. Celebrity endorsements have followed. Paris Hilton used Twitter to boost LydianCoin, a currency for a mooted advertising market that its backers hope will raise $100m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather got there before her, using the run-up to his late August bout with Conor McGregor to promote the prediction market Stox.com and content marketplace Hubii Network. Like the dotcom boom, an all-encompassing tech vision has been used to justify valuations that make no sense on any other yardstick. In the case of ICOs, the Big Idea is that the technology on which the cryptocurrencies are based will enable a new generation of online applications and markets that will end up dwarfing today’s internet giants. Like selling spare computer storage, the rules for these networks would be set — and the profits made — by the users, not some huge corporation. Olaf Carlson-Wee, founder of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Polychain Capital, believes that if any of the protocols underpinning blockchain networks ‘becomes ubiquitous on the internet, the upside is phenomenal’ © Bloomberg Some of these applications will one day be worth “trillions of dollars”, says Olaf Carlson-Wee, whose cryptocurrency hedge fund Polychain Capital is one of the investors leading the charge into ICOs. Given the potential scale of these future markets, he argues, even bets that look like they have a low chance of success make sense. Just as the dotcom craze was stirred up by extravagant hopes for the world wide web, the ICO boom is the product of another supposedly transformative technology: the blockchain. First used as the backbone for processing bitcoin transfers, blockchains are open, distributed ledgers where transactions between any two parties on a network are authenticated and recorded. Underpinning new blockchain-based networks such as IPFS are protocols, or rules, embedded in software that govern how participants interact. At least in theory, many of the interactions that happen online, such as those on social networks, ecommerce sites and search engines, could take place between willing users on decentralised networks. Cryptocurrencies in focus © Bloomberg >$130bn The notional value of all cryptocurrencies; bitcoin alone has risen eightfold in value this year 150+ Number of initial coin offerings held or announced already this year, according to CoinMarketCap 10% Fall in the value of bitcoin this week after Jamie Dimon described it in an interview as a ‘fraud’ “If any of these protocols becomes ubiquitous on the internet, the upside is phenomenal,” says Mr Carlson-Wee. He contrasts it with the opportunity exploited by entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, who created services that ran on top of the platform created by the world wide web. Decentralised social networks or ecommerce would leave ownership in the hands of those who control the underlying protocol, not an application such as Facebook or Amazon. “Users can own their data and own the network,” he adds. Mr Carlson-Wee’s enthusiasm is a sign of the coin mania that has been sweeping Silicon Valley, drawing in the familiar mix of ideologues, entrepreneurs and opportunists. Though only 27, he has raised $250m from four of the best-known venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital. Lex analysis: bitcoin v tulips Play video  What supporters see as a profound financial innovation, however, others warn can be an easy route to creating funny money. When buyers have been so willing to purchase currencies issued on nothing more than the promise of a future market, it’s not surprising that so many are trying to mint new ones. “There is this hype that blockchains can change the world,” says Mr Williams. “It’s like the hype of the dotcom bubble, when you had to put a ‘dotcom’ on the end of everything.” Sceptics argue that creating a separate currency for each application is unnecessary and that any digital currency, including bitcoin, could be used. Forcing people to buy app-specific tokens traps them with a holding that has a high chance of ending up worthless. Proponents of the coin boom say this misses the point. If a market succeeds, then its currency will be more in demand. Since their supplies are capped from the outset, anyone holding a currency would benefit from its increasing value. This chance to profit from the growth of a network also provides a built-in incentive, making people who own tokens more likely to make use of the new networks. It would be like a social network where early adopters make much of the profit if the business takes off, says one venture capital investor, who refuses to speak publicly for fear of being seen to add to the hype. “I’m getting Facebook bucks that grow with the network,” the person says. Paris Hilton uses Twitter to support LydianCoin, a currency for a mooted advertising market that its backers hope will raise $100m Selling coins has another advantage that the ICOs are less keen to highlight: it exploits a regulatory loophole. By selling a currency rather than shares they stay outside the scope of securities regulation, removing any constraints on how they market their offerings. This is one reason given by FunFair, a blockchain casino based in London, for creating its own Fun tokens. In a rare admission of the regulatory attractions of coin sales, it admitted at the end of August that it “could’ve been easier” to let people use cash and then pay them a dividend based on the company’s profits, but added: “Our lawyers rightly warned us not to do this as it would’ve risked us being classed as an unregistered security.” Regulators are working on closing this loophole. The US Securities and Exchange Commission said in July that it had determined that many coins were in fact a type of security, and would look at the underlying nature of each ICO to determine whether they should be regulated as securities. Recommended Bears target ways to bet on cryptocurrency mania imploding SEC looks to deflate bubble in ‘Initial Coin Offerings’ Bitcoin and tulips: right bulb moment Alphaville’s ICOmedy series Listen to the Big Read podcast – Digital coin mania For their creators, ICOs have another obvious attraction. They have made it possible to raise far larger amounts than start-ups can usually tap, at least as long as enough investors can be persuaded to suspend their disbelief. An early-stage open source company like Protocol Labs, for instance, might normally expect to raise an initial round of $10m from traditional start-up investors. But through the sale of Filecoin, it has already raised more than 25-times that. Based on prices buyers paid in the ICO, extra coins the company has retained for sale are notionally worth more than $350m. The history of tech bubbles suggests that throwing such large amounts of cash at unproven new businesses often ends in tears. Of the Filecoin sale, the largest ICO to date, one investor says: “They got a bit carried away because the demand was there.” The ICO bulls take a different view. The huge amounts flowing into coin start-ups, says Mr Carlson-Wee, are an indication that the old barriers to capital formation have collapsed: with anyone free to invest, the coin start-ups can look forward to unconstrained growth. “I actually take this to be an inflection point,” he says. “The genie is out of the bottle and the pace of innovation has changed permanently.” The race to develop a ‘blockchain world’ In one echo of the earlier internet bubble, the ease of launching an initial coin offering has already led to a splurge of “me-too” projects. The idea of creating a decentralised real estate market, for instance, has led to more than 10 rival projects, among them Smartre, REAL, Estate Coin and Recoin. And more than a dozen online betting networks have been proposed or already funded, with names such as BetMaster, FunFair, QuickBetCoin and Wagerr. Much of this reflects an attempt to turn ICOs into a form of “general start-up equity financing”, says Naval Ravikant, head of AngelList, a San Francisco-based network for connecting early-stage investors. The idea would be better if it was restricted to “a small but important category of venture investments — tokens powering distributed protocols with strong community support”, he says. That belief has led to a hunt among investors for the projects with the potential to become the Facebooks, Googles and Amazons of the blockchain world. The best uses in the short term will be ones where interactions can be fully automated, and where a blockchain can capture the totality of a transaction, says Matt Huang of Sequoia Capital. “If you need humans involved, it doesn’t work so well.” Trading storage space might be one such market, he adds. Polychain Capital’s Olaf Carlson-Wee goes further, arguing a new computing infrastructure, based on blockchain-intermediated markets, will be the first big opportunity of the coin boom, and that more complex applications are likely to take longer to develop. “The general idea of a sharing economy for computational resources is a rich vein. It doesn’t have room for human misbehaviour,” says Mr Huang.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\nBack in 2015, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had said that people trading in digital currencies such as Bitcoin were wasting their time. Notwithstanding, the lucky few who wasted their time back then would be sitting on more than 900 percent returns. What a fantastic way to waste time.\n\nFast forward two years and Dimon has intensified his criticism of Bitcoin, calling it “a fraud” and a bubble “worse than tulip bulbs”. Nevertheless, he doesn’t want to short Bitcoin either, because he is not sure how far the bubble will expand.\n\nLet’s study the charts and try to forecast whether we should buy this correction or stay out of it.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nBitcoin has extended its correction and is currently at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a crucial support. A break and close below this level is likely to exacerbate selling, which can sink the digital currency to $3363, which is a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from $1752 to $4975.\n\nHowever, the RSI will enter oversold territory if Bitcoin falls sharply below the 50-day SMA. Three previous oversold readings on the RSI have proven to be an excellent buying opportunity. Hence, it can be risky to short bitcoin at the current levels.\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin bounces from the 50-day SMA, it will face resistance at the downtrend line. We shall turn bullish only after Bitcoin stops falling and breaks out of the downtrend line.\n\nAt current levels, we should remain neutral on the cryptocurrency, as we don’t find any good setups, either to go long or short.\n\nETH/USD\n\nWe were correct in avoiding a trade on Ethereum in our previous analysis. A short trade would have hit our stop loss above $310 and a long trade would also have hit the stop loss.\n\nSo, what next?\n\nEthereum is comparatively weaker than Bitcoin, as it has already broken below the 50-day SMA. It is currently at a critical 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $129.78 to $409.42. A break below this crucial support can sink the digital currency to $236 levels, which is a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the upmove.\n\nHowever, we don’t find an attractive short trade setup, which has a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we remain neutral on Ethereum.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nBitcoin Cash has broken down below the range of $523 to $736. Its next support is at $470 from where it had bounced on Sept. 5. If this level breaks, the cryptocurrency may plummet to $440.\n\nOn the other hand, if the digital currency finds support at $470, it is again likely to enter into the range.\n\nWe don’t find any attractive long or short trading setups, therefore, we remain neutral on Bitcoin Cash.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nRipple could not breakout of the downtrend line and rally above $0.23500, therefore, our long trade was not triggered.\n\nThe digital currency is perilously close to breaking down below $0.19300 levels that will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern, which has a lower pattern target of $0.085. However, we expect $0.13500 to act as a strong support because this level has not been broken down on a closing basis since early-May of this year.\n\nWe recommend a short trade on ripple on a close below $0.19000 with a stop loss of $0.22500. Please cover 50 percent of the shorts closer to $0.15000 levels, and trail the remaining position with a close stop loss.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nLitecoin has broken down the descending triangle pattern. It can fall to $52 and thereafter to $41 levels. Again, a stop loss and the target objective don’t justify a short trade. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it.\n\n*Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin charts are provided by HitBTC exchange.', 'Jamie Dimon landed a second hit in his fight against bitcoin.\n\nOne day after the JP Morgan Chase chief called the digital currency a “fraud,” the bank released a scathing report on the red-hot investment, calling its legitimacy into question and comparing it to “pyramid schemes.”\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the largest digital currency, fell 6.5 percent on Wednesday, to $3,916.66 — the sixth straight day of losses.

Ether tokens, the second-most popular digital currency, were down 17% on the day at $230 in recent action. That equates to a loss of more than $16 billion in total value for the currency running on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nStill, bitcoin’s rise has been dazzling, rallying some 250% so far in 2017. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.31% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.41% are each up by nearly 12% this year, sparking a litany of pronouncements that U.S. equities are too rich.\n\nAt least part of the drop in bitcoin is due to excoriating comments made by Dimon on Tuesday, who referred to it as “a fraud”, among other indictments, at a banking conference. He reiterated those remarks at a separate conference later that day.\n\nOn Wednesday, prominent investor and market pundit Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz Global Investors, added further fuel to bitcoin’s bearish fire, making the case that bitcoin might lose a third or half its value.\n\n“The current pricing assume massive adoption, and I don’t think governments will allow the amount of adoption that’s currently priced in,” he said on CNBC Wednesday morning in New York.\n\nBitcoin bulls have been up in arms about the onslaught of negative comments. But talk of a bubble and the increased attention on digital currencies, and the underlying blockchain technology, are drawing may signify that the cyberunits are at an important crossroads. That could determine whether bitcoin, or some other cryptocurrency becomes a mainstream instrument, challenging fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.22% or just a case study in irrational exuberance.\n\n“Dimon says that bitcoin is a fraud because all of the value is being driven by speculation and not utility. There is a grain of truth to that.

Although some in the industry have challenged the veracity of those reports, China is a major hub for bitcoin activity, representing about 20% of bitcoin mining and trade, said Charles Hayter, co-founder of CryptoCompare in an interview. On Thursday, one exchange, BTCC, said it would stop all trading as of Sept. 30.\n\nChina is cracking down on illicit uses of digital currencies and has also is monitoring so-called initial currency offerings, or fundraising tied to digital-currency ventures that has recently supplanted traditional, early-stage venture investing in 2017.\n\nRead: What is an ICO?\n\n“There has been a free fall of late and it is making everybody quite scared,” Hayter said. He said he welcomes increased regulation from places like the U.S. and China, which may help to legitimize a currency that is in its infancy. But questions abound as to the role China, if any, will play in bitcoin’s outlook.\n\n“China is always an enigma wrapped in an enigma so you don’t always see what’s happening,” he said.\n\nAbout Dimon’s comments Hayter said, “Bitcoin likes to view that as a ‘poor me excuse.’” Meaning, banks may view digital currencies as a rival to their business models of moving money for a fee.\n\nHere’s what Elizabeth Stark, CEO and co-founder of Lightning Labs, a blockchain-related company, had to say about Dimon:\n\nThis is how you know you're on to something. ??https://t.co/fnFCErBzWV — elizabeth stark (@starkness) September 12, 2017\n\n“I think it’s quite shortsighted to be so disparaging about this emerging industry, especially without a core understanding,” Hayter also said.\n\nBharath Rao, founder and chief executive of digital currency trading platform Leverj, said what many critics fail to understand about cryptocurrencies is their potential to be revolutionary, which some have equated to the internet in its early stages, around the early 1980s or 1990s, or even the industrial revolution.\n\n“Bitcoin is a technology breakthrough like the steam engine was a couple of hundred years ago. Those that call it a fraud will simply be run over by it,” Rao said.\n\n“There are a number of people who hold most of their assets in cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin because they are convinced it is the future. This number is growing by the day as people who taste financial freedom are unlikely to want to go back to servitude,” he said.\n\nIt is also important to point out that bitcoin has been facing its own growing pains that led to some summer hiccups. So-called Bitcoin Cash, which erupted out of the original bitcoin early last month is the result of a faction of bitcoin developers’ demands for a version of that allows virtual miners, which support the currency, to more rapidly process transactions in larger units known as blocks. The original bitcoin also went through an upgrade that increased its processing power without resulting in another currency split.\n\nWhether bitcoin or its successor is the future remains to be seen. However, advocates for bitcoin point to a number of factors that make it a promising enterprise.\n\nThe fact that it is decentralized from central banks or governments is one such factor. That means individuals can conduct transactions without an intermediary.\n\nAnother bulls point to is the blockchain, or the software that underpins every digital currency.\n\nCheck out: Bitcoin is now the most crowded trade around: Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nPut simply, blockchain is a digital ledger, or record, that has seen its utility grow within Wall Street and at institutions like Jamie Dimon’s J.P. Morgan. The bank has been testing blockchain uses to combat the rise of cryptos.\n\nThat recognition from the more staid financial community has heartened many bitcoin investors.\n\n“Jamie has far more experience in the financial industry than someone such as myself, but if you have a look at look at the developers in bitcoin…this smells exactly like the early internet,” said Iqbal Gandham, U.K. managing director at eToro, a trading platform.\n\n“This is not a Facebook, this is not a Snapchat. This is something bigger,” Gandham said, referring to social-media giant Facebook Inc. FB, +0.05% which boasts a market value of more than $500 billion, and Snapchat, whose parent company, Snap Inc. SNAP, +0.50% recently became a publicly traded company.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to tell true innovation from fake. In 1903, the president of Michigan Savings Bank is said to have told Horace Rackham, an early stockholder in Ford, that the “horse is here to stay but the automobile is only a novelty.”\n\nAll that said, what happens to bitcoin is anyone’s guess. And it will be marked by bouts of intense volatility, and maybe pain given the tendency of digital currencies to swing wildly.\n\nThe question may be: Can investors stomach the roller-coaster ride?\n\n“I think with any market where the liquidity is low, there is always going to be volatility,” Gandham said.\n\nRead: Why bitcoin isn’t a reliable hedge against stock-market moves"", 'Computer programmer John McAfee told Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan to value Bitcoin and the work that goes into making the virtual currency.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC Fast Money on Wednesday, he rebutted Dimon’s earlier claims that Bitcoin was a fraud that would eventually blow up.\n\n“It’s just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed,” Dimon said at the Delivering Alpha conference on Tuesday.\n\nMcAfee, whose company MGT Capital Investments mines Bitcoin, said that the miners invest heavily in supercomputing power and electricity to create Bitcoins, giving it value.\n\n“You called bitcoin a fraud,” McAfee told CNBC. “I’m a bitcoin miner. We create bitcoins. It costs over $1,000 per coin to create a bitcoin. What does it cost to create a U.S. dollar? Which one is the fraud? Because it costs whatever the paper costs, but it costs me and other miners over $1,000 per coin. It’s called proof of work.\n\n“Sure it will rise and fall as all new technologies are. But at the same time, it is certainly not a fraud,” he said.\n\nEarlier in the year, McAfee made a coarse bet about what he would do if Bitcoin was not worth $500,000 in three years.', 'India’s Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is considering the possibility of issuing its own digital fiat currency as an alternative to Bitcoin, according to Economic Times. The bank expressed its displeasure with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, calling them “private currencies.”\n\nAccording to the central bank’s executive director Sudarshan Sen:\n\n""As regards non-fiat cryptocurrencies, I think we are not comfortable. Bitcoins for example. That\'s a private cryptocurrency. Right now, we have a group of people who are looking at fiat cryptocurrencies. Something that is an alternative to the Indian rupee, so to speak. We are looking at that closely.”\n\nPosition of RBI on cryptocurrencies and other developments\n\nThe Indian central bank has been continuously issuing warnings to the public about the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin. According to the bank, such currencies present potential financial, consumer protection, legal, and security-related risks.\n\nHowever, several media reports claimed that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular to investors. This popularity has reached greater heights since the assumption of Donald Trump as president of the US due to the huge jump in the prices of virtual currencies.\n\nIn its comment on the cryptocurrencies in March, then RBI deputy governor R Gandhi said that the potential of virtual currencies is overstated, citing the absence of a monetary authority or central bank supervising their use.', ""Please Sign In and use this article's on page print button to print this article."", 'The price of Bitcoin price has declined below the $4,000-level, extending its losses in overnight trading to reach a three-week low of $3,275. This represents a 35% drop from its high of $5,000.\n\nPut differently Bitcoin is now trading virtually flat month-on-month for the first time since mid-2017.\n\nPossible reasons for the decline\n\nThere are several possible reasons behind the recent drop in the price of the number one virtual currency. One of these is the alleged plan by the government of China to ban the activities of various cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. The government has not formally announced any plan as such, but much rumor and innuendo abound.\n\nCharlie Lee has been tweeting about this lately. He is the brother of BTCC CEO Bobby Lee, so many believe he has insights into the government’s plans toward Chinese exchanges. When critics pointed out that BTCC competitors OKCoin and Huobi had announced they were still open for business, Lee chortled:\n\nOKCoin and Huobi are meeting with regulators tomorrow. They might soon change their tune. ? https://t.co/sS05td86X4 — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) September 14, 2017\n\nAnother possible reason for the price drop is the sharp criticisms made by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on Bitcoin.\n\nCounterpoints\n\nHowever, there is the possibility that even if China heavily regulates exchanges in the country, it will have small effect on Bitcoin in the long term as the over-the-counter (OTC) market for the digital currency will continue to post solid performance. China also makes up a much smaller percentage of global trading volume than in the past.\n\nThe negative comments by Dimon on Bitcoin are not also surprising since if Bitcoin goes mainstream, Dimon is likely out of a job.\n\nSome on the /r/bitcoinmarkets subreddit, such as joyrider5, believe this is simply a technical pullback. The price touched an important psychological level ($5,000), possibly leading to a sizeable amount of profit-taking. It’s important to remember that nothing can go straight up forever, and that corrections are healthy in the long run.\n\nSome believe that the price of Bitcoin will reach a low of $3,000 which will be followed by a rally back into the low-$4,000s and possibly beyond. Until then, Bitcoin will only regain its bullish position if it surpasses the $4,400 level.', 'Big Banks want to destroy Bitcoin before it destroys them.\n\nBitcoin, the “people’s currency,” has the potential to become a new currency, free of the control of big governments and big banks.\n\nThat’s why they both want to limit this potential.

BCH price was under heavy selling pressure and failed to hold the $500 and $450 support levels against the US Dollar. It corrected once towards the $540 level from $500, but sellers appeared. Later, the price broke $500, $450 and even traded below the $400 level.\n\nThere was even a break below this week’s highlighted descending channel pattern with support at $430 on the hourly chart of BCH/USD. It is clear bearish signal with the recent low at $387 as a minor support. There can be a short-term correction towards the $420 level, but upsides seem to be limited.

09/15/2017,"['Marc Hochstein is the managing editor for CoinDesk and a former editor-in-chief of American Banker.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Hochstein takes a quick look at the current state of the bitcoin markets, finding that just because there\'s smoke, there\'s not necessarily fire.\n\nTl;dr: this ain\'t Mt. Gox – and bitcoin survived that, too.\n\nWith all the panic selling following the Chinese government\'s renewed crackdown on bitcoin exchanges, it\'s important to remember that the country is no longer the trading hub it once was.\n\nAll else equal, that means the market may take less time to recover from the latest sell-off than from the one that took place in 2013 (you know, when the People\'s Bank of China suddenly declared that bitcoin was not a currency and ordered payment processors to stop accepting it).\n\nJust a reminder of how bad the fallout from that that really was, during the three years it took bitcoin to recover from those bombshells, it lost nearly half its value, dropping from an all-time high of $1,150 to under $500.\n\nBut that was at a time when Chinese bitcoin trading accounted for as much as 90% of global volume (as shown in the chart below from CoinDesk\'s second-quarter State of Blockchain report.)\n\nThis state of affairs persisted until as recently as January of this year:\n\nSince then, however, China\'s share of bitcoin trading volume has fallen dramatically.\n\nThis is likely for two reasons: China\'s January ban on no-fee trading on the country’s exchanges dramatically reduced volume there; and the rise of trading volumes in Japan and South Korea as shown in the chart below:\n\n""Global trading volume now appears more distributed than ever before,"" our State of Blockchain report noted in June.\n\nRemember also, this time around there hasn\'t been any formal guidance from government – and it appears local exchanges Huobi and OKCoin will continue letting users trade between cryptocurrencies. In short, this is far from a blanket ban.\n\nOf course, there are many variables that influence the price of bitcoin, so there is no guarantee of a speedier recovery.\n\nBut thanks to this more diversified market, and in context, still limited action, it stands to reason that the regulatory interventions of a single country (even the world\'s most populous country) should have less impact on the bitcoin price over the long term.\n\nChinese finger trap via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'It is a “fraud”, the JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, said this week. “It’s worse than tulip bulbs … it will be the emperor with no clothes”. He was talking about the internet cash system bitcoin.\n\nIt will eventually “blow up”, he said, it’s not a “real thing”. “It will be closed.” Any JP Morgan trader caught buying or selling bitcoins will be “fired in a second” – for “being stupid”, he added.\n\nBitcoin will always divide opinion – as a non-government system of money, inevitably so. Its most ardent supporters think it will eventually become the reserve currency of the globe. Its sternest critics think it will die a death. It is not hard to work out the side of the fence on which Dimon sits.\n\nBitcoin was devised in reaction to what happened in 2008 during the financial crisis: printing money, bailing out banks, suppressing rates. The idea was to create a system of money beyond the manipulative hands of government. Although JP Morgan was by no means the most leveraged of the banks, it still took bailout money, and, as its CEO, Dimon and bitcoin will inevitably be philosophically opposed. His utter faith in the US dollar sounds rather like the boss of a major record label talking up CDs a year before the iPod was brought to market.\n\nThat said, despite the fact he does not understand bitcoin – which, as the CEO of a major bank, he should – Dimon’s comments do bear some consideration.\n\nBitcoin is a fraud that will blow up, says JP Morgan boss Read more\n\nFirst, he says it’s a fraud. Actually, bitcoin is perhaps the most transparent system of money ever invented. Every transaction that has ever taken place, no matter how big or small, is recorded on a database, known as the blockchain, which is shared on hundreds of computers around the world and visible to all. Every entry is permanent. The whole system is built, not on fraud, but on mathematical proof. Hence bitcoin aficionados will say, rather than “In God we trust” as you find on a dollar, but “In proof we trust”.\n\nHowever, there are many fraudulent operators at work in the bitcoin space. Bitcoin is used for trading illegal goods; indeed, it has actually facilitated dark markets. One bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox, was hacked and had some 900,000 coins stolen, making it one of the greatest heists in history. Today fortunes are being raised in minutes via ICOs (initial coin offerings – the crypto equivalent of an IPO) for ventures that will not go anywhere beyond yachts and cocaine. So there is something to what he says, even if the system itself is inherently anti-fraudulent.\n\nDimon declares that we will use the technology – blockchain technology – but that bitcoin will be shut down. That’s like saying we will use football pitches, but football players will be banned. One comes with the other. In any case, you can’t just shut bitcoin down. It’s a decentralised, distributed network. That’s the whole point of its design. There is no central point of failure.\n\nEven so, he raises a good point when he says: “There will be no currency that gets around government controls.” If bitcoin becomes a threat to government tax revenue, the law will move in on the companies and individuals operating in the space. But given the multibillion-dollar investment that has gone in, the US government would have the most almighty legal fight on its hands if it tries to make bitcoin illegal. Here’s the paradox: the bigger it gets, the bigger the threat it becomes, and the harder to shut down.\n\nDimon says he’ll sack traders who trade it. Last time he denounced bitcoin (he has previous) was late 2015 – Bitcoin’s value is now about 1,000% higher. Who’s the stupid one? Would Dimon really sack traders who netted him a 1,000% increase in less than two years? I’m not sure JP Morgan’s shareholders would approve.\n\nFinally, Dimon declares bitcoin is a bubble. You need to define what a bubble is. Tulips were a bubble built on very little. The dotcom frenzy was a bubble in 2000, but the story was right: the internet did change the way we do things. Railways were a bubble in the 19th century: but rail changed the way we travel. In both cases, the bubbles meant the infrastructure was built. Something similar is happening now. For sure the price has got crazy – but bitcoin has a long track record in seemingly crazy prices. When does it end? Perhaps at $100,000 as Dimon suggests; perhaps the bubble ended last week at $5,000. Nobody knows.\n\nThe true fascination of bitcoin is not its mystery inventor | Dominic Frisby Read more\n\nThe interest is vested. Those who own bitcoin say its value is going higher because they want it to go higher. Those who don’t, say it’s a bubble, perhaps because they’re jealous that other people are getting rich when they’re not. As I always say: a bubble is a bull market in which you don’t have a position.\n\nIf bitcoin was going to disappear, it would have disappeared by now. It’s here to stay, though I’d say it is unlikely to replace the primacy of the US dollar. Rather, we are headed into an age in which multiple currencies coexist, some private some public. There are already more than a thousand cryptocurrencies, each designed for a different purpose. In a few years, just as we have different apps on our phones, so will we have different “wallets” with different currencies: one we might use for tipping (dogecoin), another for transactions we want kept private (monero, zcash) another for fast transactions and so on.

(Photo: Steven Senne, AP)\n\nBitcoin, hailed in some quarters as the future of currency, is having a rough week, with a flurry of rumors that China will shut down exchanges and the head of a major U.S bank calling bitcoin a ""fraud.""\n\nPlummeting prices have again raised questions about the wisdom of owning it, if not its legitimacy.\n\nThe digital, or cryptocurrency, tumbled 15% Thursday to about $3,300 against the dollar. Bitcoin, which has had bouts of volatility in the past, has shed about a third of its value since Sept. 1. But it\'s still up about $600 compared with last year at this time.\n\nStill getting up to speed on bitcoin? Here\'s a quick rundown.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency created and exchanged without the involvement of banks or governments. Transactions allow anonymity, which has made it popular with people who want to keep their financial activity, and their identities, private. The digital coins are created by so-called ""miners"", who operate computer farms that verify other users\' transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles. These miners receive bitcoin in exchange. Bitcoin can be converted to cash when deposited into accounts at prices set in online trading.\n\nMore: Bitcoin loses third of its value this month after 400% run-up in 2017\n\nMore: Chinese bitcoin exchange announces it is ending trading\n\nMore: China orders bitcoin exchanges to shut down, report says\n\nIs this bitcoin\'s swansong?\n\nNot necessarily. Let\'s take a look at recent data: In mid-July the value of bitcoin was around $1,900 per dollar, dropping from nearly $2,500 at the end of June. Users forced a change in the computer code, which was designed to improve capacity on the increasingly clogged network. The maneuver worked, helping to avoid a split in bitcoin and driving the value up to roughly $2,800 by the end of July.\n\nBitcoin\'s value has fluctuated since then. At the beginning of August bitcoin\'s value stood at about $2,710 and shot up to more than $4,700 by month\'s end. But there\'s been a steady decline this month, with the value slipping to approximately $3,300 on Thursday, according to Blockchain.info.\n\nWhat happened this week?\n\nOne of China\'s biggest bitcoin exchanges announced that it will cease trades following reports that Beijing will order all Chinese exchanges to close. And on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud, saying that if any of his traders were dealing in the currency, he\'d fire them.\n\nBitcoin tumbled 6% between Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nHow are sovereign nations dealing with bitcoin?\n\nIn the U.S., the IRS has issued guidelines on the currency, calling it an ""intangible asset"" subject to taxation. But in the end, cash talks. According to IRS guidance:\n\n""Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as \'convertible\' virtual currency. Bitcoin is one example of a convertible virtual currency. Bitcoin can be digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into, U.S. dollars, Euros, and other real or virtual currencies.""\n\nAnd it\'s a hotly pursued asset by U.S. intelligence agencies, which see bitcoin as a funding vehicle in some instances for groups or individuals that intend to do harm.\n\nChina\'s central bank has yet to respond to questions about bitcoin\'s future, but it has warned in the past that the currency is being traded without regulatory oversight and might be linked to fraud. The bank banned initial offerings of new digital currencies last week.\n\nFollowing the failure of a bitcoin exchange in Japan called Mt. Gox, that country has enacted new laws to regulate bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Mt. Gox shut down in February 2014, saying it lost about 850,000 bitcoins, possibly to hackers.\n\nThe Japanese government has also spelled out regulations to help prevent misuse of bitcoins and other virtual currencies for terrorism or other illegal activities, including requiring banks and other businesses to verify identities, keep records and report suspicious transactions. The regulations implemented in April require virtual currency traders to keep customers\' assets separate from their own, partly because of the losses suffered in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy.\n\nCLOSE Toys R Us is reportedly exploring the possibility of filing for bankruptcy as it considers plans to restructure its debt.

Taxes and regulations of money is a powerful tool for governments.\n\nThere has even been talk about how Bitcoin is the most crowded trade, indicating that traditional trading is clearly taking a hit.\n\nThe concerns for the traditional\n\nWith a successful digital currency, big governments will lose seigniorage income—the benefits derived from printing money, and they will lose the ability to control the economy.\n\nFor the banking sector, losing the ability to handle the money that flows between central banks and the economy is at the core of the banking business and the very existence of the monetary economy.\n\nBaseless fears?\n\nThese fears may well be a little too strong although Bitcoin flies in the face of a traditional monetary economy, and it is a decentralized system, there is an understanding that it can be supplementary rather than an undermining technology.\n\nApostolos Pittas, adjunct professor of economics at LIU Post, has said:', 'If the financial crisis taught me one thing - it is that coincidences are rare. When a lot of well known and ""plugged in"" people start talking about the same thing at the same time, you could assume one of three things\n\nIt was pure coincidence as the timing really was from their individual observations It was a trial balloon that someone wanted to float to see how markets would respond It was de facto policy and this was part of the messaging\n\nMy experience tells me that number 3 was often the case, especially if there was a catalyst.\n\nThe barrage of negativity on Bitcoin earlier this week seemed extremely high. The fact that some who spoke out against it, hadn\'t spoke out against it before, or wouldn\'t speak about it all in the ordinary course of business seemed telling. That coupled with the allegations of heavy North Korean use right as tensions with North Korea were mounting really raised my eyebrows.\n\nThis fit my Three Rules of Bitcoin well (link). Both side of the cryptocurrency debate have been expecting some sort of government crackdown in an effort to slow its growth. The detractors have been expecting a crackdown because they think it shouldn\'t exist. The most ardent believers expected a crackdown precisely because the digital currencies were disruptive and worrisome to the powers that be.\n\nWe have seen other crackdowns in the past, particularly out of China, but this one seems more coordinated and with some real support due to the North Korea allegations.\n\nIt will be a test Bitcoin and other digital currencies will have to whether. In the almost bipolar world of crypto, some clearly hope this is the end of a product they never understood and some expect crypto to emerge stronger than ever - as this will be the exact type of event that it is designed to circumvent.\n\nFor those who owned a small amount in their highly speculative allocation bucket (link) this is recent drop from $5,000 to $3,000 in Bitcoin is bad, but not out of line with its potential volatility. As I disclosed the other day, I do not currently own any cryptocurrency and would continue to be a seller because if all my experience during the financial crisis is useful - then this story hasn\'t fully played out.\n\nThere may be a time when I choose to go back in as a longer term view, but that is not today. Yes, I am fully aware that view might miss some short term bounces or maybe my overall premise is incorrect, but that is a risk I am willing to live with given my current view (Bitcoin jumped from $3,000 to $3,175 in the time it took to type this note - which is scary in its own right).', ""It’s no secret that in recent years, North Korea has stepped up efforts to expand its nuclear weapons stockpile.\n\nPlayer utilities Popout\n\nShare download Listen to the Story. PRI.org\n\nMore quietly, though, it’s been stashing another commodity: bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to a report by the security firm FireEye Inc., North Korean hackers have been targeting South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n“These are essentially places where people can buy or sell cryptocurrencies ... like bitcoin or ethereum. It's similar to how you might trade on the stock market, but specifically for cryptocurrencies,” says Luke McNamara, the FireEye analyst who wrote the report.\n\nFireEye has confirmed that South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges have come under attack at least three times in recent months. Researchers believe the North Korean hacking group behind these attacks is working alongside the Kim Jong-un regime.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin's having a crazy 2017\n\n“Because this is based out of North Korea and a lot of other targeting we’ve seen them conduct has been of strategic interest to the North Korean regime, we assessed a high likelihood that this group is working in concert with the [Kim] regime,” says McNamara.\n\nSo why go after cryptocurrencies? And why target South Korea’s exchanges?\n\n“If you also look at the amount of daily trading volume in South Korea, it's pretty significant and makes up a big portion of the global trading encrypted currencies,” McNamara explains. “It makes logical sense that if you're interested in stealing bitcoin, these exchanges are a big centralized target to focus on.”\n\nAt the same time, despite some hiccups, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen massive increases in value in recent years (for example, despite a drop this week, bitcoin is up 200 percent this year).\n\nA logo of Bitcoin is seen on an advertisement of an electronic shop in Tokyo, Japan September 5, 2017. Credit: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters\n\nSuccessfully infiltrating a digital wallet (which North Korea has done at least once, according to the report) could translate to a big pay-day.\n\n“They could transfer that out ... to a more anonymous exchange to erase the trail and then ... cash it out for hard fiat currency,” says McNamara.\n\nBecause transactions are generally anonymized on both ends, McNamara says North Korea can use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “to get around ... any money laundering controls in traditional markets.”\n\nNorth Korea’s stepped up efforts to crack digital wallets come as the United Nations approved new sanctions against Pyongyang on Monday.\n\n“Sanctions play a huge role in this,” says McNamara said. “Cryptocurrencies definitely allow them one way to evade sanctions” and could be used to evade trade restrictions.\n\nAs Pyongyang has stepped up efforts to infiltrate digital coffers and expand its virtual currency stash, the Chinese government has been cracking down on the exchanges where trading takes place. On Thursday, bitcoin's value took a major plunge after one Chinese exchange announced it would be shutting down.\n\nMcNamara warns against interpreting China’s crackdown as a strategic move. But others, including Peter Tchir, an executive at Brean Capital LLC, are leaving the question open, Bloomberg reports.\n\n“What I cannot tell is whether the Chinese crackdown and alleged North Korean involvement in bitcoin was an excuse to unleash their inner bitcoin bears,” Tchir wrote in a note to clients, published by Bloomberg, after Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer, and Jeffrey Gundlach, founder and CEO of DoubleLine Capital, slammed bitcoin.\n\n“It also would not surprise me,” Tchir’s note continued, “if they are getting a sense out of D.C. that the alleged North Korean involvement is a good excuse for governments, globally, to take a whack at the increasingly popular market for cryptocurrencies in all its forms.”"", 'BTC-e appears to have successfully launched a new bitcoin exchange platform.\n\nAnnounced today via Twitter, WEX is allegedly the result of a months-long effort by the bitcoin exchange to return service to customers after it was raided and fined by US authorities in July. But despite its new URL, the WEX website notably mirrors the old BTC-e website in design, functionality and trading pair options.\n\nFurther, in a welcome message on its new website, WEX sought to differentiate itself from the BTC-e website, claiming that it is unrelated to that company. Despite having migrated over all the exchange\'s former users, the platform claims the technical teams behind the exchanges are different.\n\nAdding to the claims is that the new website stated that it did not receive any funds from BTC-e, while at the same time alleging that it would abide by anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws.\n\nIn the welcome message:\n\n""We thank all ex-users of BTC-E for their patience at such a difficult moment for all of you guys.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Cryptocurrency trading volume reached a new milestone on Friday, crossing $11 billion for the first time amid regulatory uncertainty in China.\n\nCrypto Markets Post Record Volume\n\nAccording to data obtained from CoinMarketCap, the combined 24-hour trading volume of all cryptocurrencies rose to $11.5 billion shortly after 16:00 UTC. The only other time daily trading volume has surpassed $10 billion was on August 19, when it briefly spiked to $10.5 billion.\n\nBitcoin topped the charts with $4.2 billion in volume, while ethereum and litecoin posted $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. In all, 10 different currencies posted volume greater than $100 million.\n\nBithumb and Bitfinex each handled about $1.5 billion in trades while Chinese bitcoin exchange OKCoin accounted for $750 million. Altogether, at least seven exchanges, including GDAX, Bittrex, Poloniex, and Huobi surpassed the $500 million mark (Volume had tapered off a bit by the time of writing, so it is possible Kraken and Coinone crossed $500 million earlier in the day).\n\nFriday’s trading volume surge was caused by market volatility stemming from China’s crackdown on bitcoin exchanges. Yesterday, the markets crashed following reports that a bitcoin exchange ban was “certain” and BTCC’s subsequent announcement that it would shut down all trading services at the end of September. The markets continued to plunge Friday morning as Huobi and OKCoin were rumored to be meeting with regulators and two smaller exchanges–Yunbi and ViaBTC–also announced September closures.\n\nHowever, later in the day OKCoin and Huobi issued concurrent statements that suggested they might continue providing cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency trading services. Both exchanges announced that they would close CNY trading pairs on October 31, but–unlike BTCC, Yunbi, and ViaBTC–they did not announce the suspension of “all trading.” Moreover, they indicated that they “expect to continue to provide Chinese users with [compliant] digital asset services.”\n\nThese announcements led to an immediate rally, and trading volume soared to a record level as the markets climbed back to $120 billion after dipping below $100 billion earlier in the day.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'What Makes Bitcoin So Tough to Value, and Why a Selloff Could Be in Store\n\nIt\'s hard to think of an investment that\'s been as deeply polarizing as Bitcoin -- still up more than 500% over the past 12 months -- has become as of late. Not just in terms of how many passionate bulls and bears it has produced, but in terms of how many very smart people can be found in both camps. Among the bulls, one can find big-name fund managers such as Bill Gross, Mike Novogratz and Kyle Bass, as well as quite a few venture capitalists. Bears include Jamie Dimon, Howard Marks and Mohamed El-Erian, among many others.\n\nWhat makes the debate so unique and head-scratching is that Bitcoin\'s value, unlike that of stocks, bonds, commodities or traditional currencies, isn\'t linked to measurable financial or economic phenomena. Stocks are valued on a company\'s existing assets and expected future cash flows; commodity prices are driven by supply and demand for the underlying commodity; currency values are driven by by money supply and demand changes, which in turn are impacted by things like GDP growth, interest rates and trade balances.\n\nBut Bitcoin? Outside of some limited use as a means to buy goods and services, Bitcoin\'s $61 billion market cap is linked to the perception of value. That is, Bitcoin is bid up out of a belief that others think it\'s worth something too, or will do so in the future, even if (unlike traditional currencies) there isn\'t much demand for using it to buy things.\n\nAs others have pointed out, Bitcoin -- and for that matter other cryptocurrencies -- in this respect has much in common with precious metals such as gold and silver. But aside from the fact that precious metals also have industrial and jewelry use cases, the big difference is that gold and silver have been established for thousands of years as stores of value across numerous civilizations. Bitcoin is fighting for that same status, and depending on how confident one is in its ability to achieve it, it can look like a giant bubble or (even now) very underpriced. In that sense, Bitcoin isn\'t as much like precious metals as it is a bet that something will be looked upon like a precious metal in the coming years.\n\nAnd certainly, the bet could still have a big long-term payoff. If millions of people were to wake up tomorrow and decide that Bitcoin is just as worthwhile a place to park their money as gold (estimated $7.5 trillion in circulation), its price would skyrocket. Analyst Thomas Lee, who this summer predicted Bitcoin (currently priced around $3,800) could be worth $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022 as cryptocurrencies ""[cannibalize] demand for gold,"" seems to be expecting such a phenomenon to play out over a lengthier period of time. As do a lot of other bulls, with many of the arguing Bitcoin\'s security, global accessibility and fixed supply growth make it a better store of value than gold.\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to obtain many new converts and a lot of existing supporters lose faith, prices would nosedive. A lot of skeptics see just this scenario playing out. Marks, who deems Bitcoin ""an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it,"" is one good example. Likewise, NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran suggests that unless Bitcoin becomes widely used to conduct transactions, it\'s just ""a lucrative, but dangerous, pricing game with no good ending.""\n\nDimon, who sees little need to use Bitcoin to buy/sell items in countries with stable, well-supported currencies and thus thinks the current frenzy is like the Dutch tulip bubble, is thinking along the same lines. He also cites the potential for fresh government crackdowns as cryptocurrencies are used more for illicit activities. Bitcoin was recently hammered after the Chinese government moved to ban initial coin offerings (ICOs), and Chinese regulators are reportedly planning to shut down local cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nSince Bitcoin\'s future prices depend so much on future perceptions rather than anything more concrete -- like, say, iPhone X sales or Chinese oil demand -- I\'m hesitant to declare with strong certain exactly where Bitcoin is headed. But I do think that much of what\'s going on in the cryptocurrency realm right now has a lot in common with past speculative frenzies, and should give pause to anyone thinking about getting in.\n\nPerhaps the biggest red flag: It\'s not just one or two cryptocurrencies that have soared, but a legion of them. There are now 9 different cryptocurrencies with $1 billion-plus market caps, and several more with $500 million-plus market caps. And altogether, there are 50 cryptocurrencies, including ones with names such as Byteball, Stellar Lumens and MaidSafeCoin, with $100 million-plus market caps.\n\nThis brings to mind how nearly any company with a Dot.com at the end of its name blasted off during the 1999-2000 tech bubble. Even if one believes Bitcoin and No. 2 cryptocurrency Ethereum have bright futures, it\'s hard to see a dozen being looked upon as stores of value.\n\nAlso worrying: The billions that have been raised in ICOs, in which companies raise money by selling ""tokens"" (paid for using Bitcoin or Ethereum) in brand-new cryptocurrencies. The tokens don\'t give ""investors"" any shares, merely access to goods and services (often of the digital variety) that the new cryptocurrency supports. Though some have focused on the rise of ICO scams, many of the legal deals, which provide tokens that can be used for things like in-game purchases and online betting, are worrisome in their own right.\n\nThen there\'s the anecdotal evidence suggesting much of the recent mania is driven by speculation from latecomers who aren\'t exactly versed in the nuances of blockchains and distributed ledgers. One only has to look at the degree to which activity on Reddit threads and Facebook groups related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has swelled to get some idea.\n\nNone of that means Bitcoin won\'t live up to the hopes of bulls in time. If Bitcoin is eventually viewed on a large scale as ""digital gold,"" then buying today might very be like buying Amazon in the midst of the Dot.com bubble, when shares (though having soared) were still generally trading at less than one-tenth of current levels.\n\nNonetheless, those who bought Amazon back then and saw shares drop over 90% during the bubble\'s bursting probably wish that they waited a little longer.\n\nMore of What\'s Trending on TheStreet:']"

There were lots of rumours and as soon as BTCC informed about a trade shutdown, the market moved down. OKCoin and Huobi shutdown rumours also stirred the pot.\n\nDevelopment of the situation: everything happened fast, rumours about shutdown have not been confirmed, OKCoin and Huobi continue to work, but close trading and deposits (CNY).\n\nHuge volatility. Big sells on rumours, big buys on refutation - all cryptocurrencies have been prone to speculative movements in the lastest days.

The support zone has managed to stay, since good news arrived.\n\nHuge volatility, even on a day chart.\n\nThanks to good news, dynamics have changed. If it remains positive, we might see $4000 tests. Settling above $4000 may mean possible formation of a new local uptrend.\n\nFor now, news for BTC doesn’t seem to be promising. The first major events are anticipated closer to November.\n\nETH/USD 16.09.2017\n\nMany cryptocurrencies have been subject to volatility lately, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nTechnical situation:\n\nUptrend line has been hit.\n\n$200 support zone remains.\n\nJudging by dynamics, we will see $280 resistance tests in the nearest days. Technically, this level will be very important for speculators.\n\nIn September, ETH will have big news coming. It will be a good growth driver.\n\nFundamentally, the project is going well.

Drop your thoughts in the comments.', 'SAN FRANCISCO (CBS/AP) — Bitcoin, hailed in some quarters as the future of currency, had a rough week, with a flurry of rumors that China will shut down exchanges and the head of a major U.S. bank calling bitcoin a “fraud.”\n\nPlummeting prices have again raised questions about the wisdom of owning it, if not its legitimacy.\n\nThe digital, or cryptocurrency, tumbled 15 percent Thursday to about $3,300 against the dollar. Bitcoin, which has had bouts of volatility in the past, has shed about a third of its value since Sept. 1. But it’s still up about $600 compared with last year at this time.\n\nStill getting up to speed on bitcoin? Here’s a quick rundown.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency created and exchanged without the involvement of banks or governments. Transactions allow anonymity, which has made it popular with people who want to keep their financial activity, and their identities, private. The digital coins are created by so-called “miners”, who operate computer farms that verify other users’ transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles. These miners receive bitcoin in exchange. Bitcoin can be converted to cash when deposited into accounts at prices set in online trading.\n\nIs this bitcoin’s swansong?\n\nNot necessarily. Let’s take a look at recent data: In mid-July the value of bitcoin was around $1,900 per dollar, dropping from nearly $2,500 at the end of June. Users forced a change in the computer code, which was designed to improve capacity on the increasingly clogged network. The maneuver worked, helping to avoid a split in bitcoin and driving the value up to roughly $2,800 by the end of July.\n\nBitcoin’s value has fluctuated since then. At the beginning of August bitcoin’s value stood at about $2,710 and shot up to more than $4,700 by month’s end. But there’s been a steady decline this month, with the value slipping to approximately $3,300 on Thursday, according to Blockchain.info.\n\nWhat happened this week?\n\nOne of China’s biggest bitcoin exchanges announced that it will cease trades following reports that Beijing will order all Chinese exchanges to close. And on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud, saying that if any of his traders were dealing in the currency, he’d fire them.\n\nBitcoin tumbled 6 percent between Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nHow are sovereign nations dealing with bitcoin?\n\nIn the U.S., the IRS has issued guidelines on the currency, calling it an “intangible asset” subject to taxation. But in the end, cash talks.\n\nAccording to IRS guidance:\n\n“Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as ‘convertible’ virtual currency. Bitcoin is one example of a convertible virtual currency. Bitcoin can be digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into, U.S. dollars, Euros, and other real or virtual currencies.”\n\nAnd it’s a hotly pursued asset by U.S. intelligence agencies, which see bitcoin as a funding vehicle in some instances for groups or individuals that intend to do harm.\n\nChina’s central bank has yet to respond to questions about bitcoin’s future, but it has warned in the past that the digital currency is being traded without regulatory oversight and might be linked to fraud. The bank banned initial offerings of new digital currencies last week.\n\nFollowing the failure of a bitcoin exchange in Japan called Mt. Gox, that country has enacted new laws to regulate bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Mt. Gox shut down in February 2014, saying it lost about 850,000 bitcoins, possibly to hackers.\n\nThe Japanese government has also spelled out regulations to help prevent misuse of bitcoins and other virtual currencies for terrorism or other illegal activities, including requiring banks and other businesses to verify identities, keep records and report suspicious transactions. The regulations implemented in April require virtual currency traders to keep customers’ assets separate from their own, partly because of the losses suffered in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy.\n\n© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The exchange plans on introducing trading pairs of BCH/BTC, BTC/USD, and BCH/EUR. Bitstamp has stated, “now that the stability of the newly created fork has been confirmed, we have also decided to add support for BCH trading”.\n\nAt the time of bitcoin’s soft fork, Bitstamp stated that customers “who wanted their BCH funds immediately” should “withdraw their BTC before the hard fork occurred.” After the user-activated hard fork occurred, Bitstamp clarified that it intended to distribute BCH tokens to customers holding bitcoin at the time of the fork, stating that “BCH balances will be made available to our customers as soon as it is safe to do so [-] if and when the Bitcoin Cash system has been thoroughly tested and is sufficiently stable, we will then consider listing BCH”. The exchange has now confirmed that “all customers who had bitcoin balances at the time of the fork now have an equal quantity of BCH safely stored at Bitstamp.”\n\nBitcoin Cash Will Be the Fourth Cryptocurrency Other Than Bitcoin to Be Listed on Bitstamp\n\nThis year Bitstamp, previously a bitcoin-only cryptocurrency exchange, has sought to capitalize on the growth of major altcoins by introducing new trading pairs. Last month, the exchange announced that it had introduced trading pairs for Ethereum, launching zero fee trading services for ETH markets until the 1st of October. In June, Bitstamp implemented the roll-out of several Litecoin trading pairs, following Litecoin’s activation of segregated witness. In January, Bitstamp also introduced Ripple trading pairs.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash markets appear to have regained correlation with the price action of bitcoin, with yesterday’s 25-30% bitcoin bounce serving as the catalyst for a near 50% spike in the value of BCH – driving the price of BCH tokens from a low of approximately $300 USD to the current area of $450 approximately.\n\nDo you think that Bitstamp will continue to introduce new markets to its platform?

The twitter user ‘I am Nomad’ posted the tweet including a screenshot of the BTC chart where JP Morgan was circled. The growing mainstream financial acceptance of the cryptocurrency would indicate that the predictions of Jamie Dimon and other bears may not be sound.\n\nThere are still some legitimate questions and doubts that would have been raised by Jamie Dimon and others in the market. We know that there are more cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin in usage. CoinMarketCap lists more than 1000 different types. Many of those are worth fractions of a penny and lack enough interest to be sustained. Bitcoin, which was invented in 2008 is the largest by far with One of the common elements in historical bubbles is that they include something that’s new or novel. Bitcoin has a little bit of that novelty flavour which could hint towards a potential bubble.\n\nIt seems that Jamie Dimon and others with his views might have scared the speculators who don’t really understand the technology behind Bitcoin. As a deeper understanding of what Bitcoin is and how it works spreads, the market will recover.

If the bill is signed into law, U.S. bitcoin users would no longer have to report transactions worth less than $600.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act of 2017, introduced by Congressional Blockchain Caucus co-chairs Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) and Rep. David Schweikert (R-AZ) is a bipartisan attempt to reduce the regulatory burden on people who use cryptocurrency to make small, everyday transactions and not solely as an investment vehicle.\n\nUnfortunately, current laws classify bitcoin as “property” in all cases, meaning that U.S. residents have to pay capital gains taxes every time they make a cryptocurrency transaction, no matter how small. This bill would bring nuance to bitcoin tax regulations, ensuring that bitcoin is treated like a currency when used as one.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies can be used for anything from buying a cup of coffee to paying for a car, to crowdfunding a new startup and more and more consumers are choosing to use this type of payment. To keep up with modern technology, we need to remove outdated restrictions on cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and other methods of digital payment,” said Polis in a statement posted on his official website. “By cutting red tape and eliminating onerous reporting requirements, it will allow cryptocurrencies to further benefit consumers and help create good jobs.”\n\nAccording to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), most cryptocurrency users are already out of compliance with these laws. The tax agency says that only 802 people declared cryptocurrency transactions on their income tax returns in 2015. Consequently, the agency has contracted with blockchain-tracing firm Chainalysis to locate bitcoin tax cheats and has attempted to force bitcoin exchange Coinbase to reveal their customers’ personal information.\n\nOf course, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act would not remove all reporting requirements for bitcoin transactions. Users will still have to pay the bitcoin tax on transactions larger than $600, which are more likely to be investment-related and thus subject to capital gains regulations.\n\nThat said, the legislative process is an arduous one, and many bills die before they even reach a vote. U.S. residents should demonstrate their support by contacting their representatives in Congress and asking to lend their support.\n\n“Individuals all over the world are starting to use cryptocurrencies for small every day transactions, yet here in the States we have fallen behind and make cryptocurrency use more of a challenge than it needs to be,” added Schweikert. “With this simple legislative change, anyone can make digital payments to buy a newspaper or a bike without worrying about tax code challenges.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
09/17/2017,"['Japan has once again become the largest Bitcoin exchange market with 50.75 percent market share of the global Bitcoin exchange market. Analysts including BitFury Vice Chairman George Kikvadze attributed the surge in the trading volume of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market to the exit of Bitcoin traders in China.\n\nEarlier this week, the Chinese government, local authorities and financial regulators officially requested Chinese Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms to halt their services by the end of September. OKCoin and Huobi, the two largest exchanges in China, were granted leeway to operate until Oct. 30, considering the fact that they have not been involved in any initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the past.\n\nBut, it seems as if traders are not willing to take any chances with the Chinese government and their unpredictable nature. The Chinese Bitcoin exchange market’s daily trading volume has halved within a period of three days, from 15 percent to less than seven percent.\n\nAccording to various trusted Bitcoin market data providers such as CryptoCompare, China only accounts for 6.4 percent of global Bitcoin trades at the time of reporting.\n\nCryptoCompare shows that Japan accounts for over 50% of all #bitcoin trades. Chinese traders have already moved to Japan. China less than 7% pic.twitter.com/t7YRaL5jv3 — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) September 17, 2017\n\nUS market benefits\n\nPrior to the nationwide Bitcoin exchange ban by China, the US exchange market had consistently secured its position as the largest market in the world.\n\nHowever, almost immediately after the announcement of the country’s three largest Bitcoin exchanges, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, were released, traders moved over to the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market. The abrupt migration of traders led to the short-term surge in the trading volume of Japan, allowing the market to overtake the US by over 20 percent in global Bitcoin exchange market share.\n\nContrary to many negative reports, prominent developers, analysts, researchers and experts within the cryptocurrency and Blockchain sectors including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and billionaire investor Tim Draper expressed their optimism toward the shutdown of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market. Lee emphasized that the Chinese government will no longer be able to manipulate the market, as it had done since 2013.\n\nLee says:\n\n“This is a good thing. China can no longer play with the markets by banning Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency cannot be killed by any country. One solution to centralized exchanges is decentralized ones. I hear the Decred Project team has something cooking that helps with that.”\n\nBitcoin stabilization\n\nAs Lee emphasized, the exit of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market should really only have affected around 10 to 15 percent of traders in the global Bitcoin exchange market. Yet, speculators and impatient traders initiated a major sell-off as the Chinese government banned exchanges, leading to a major correction on Bitcoin price.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the global Bitcoin exchange market will stabilize, as traders move from the Chinese market to South Korea and Japan, two markets that have developed significantly more efficient regulations, industry standards and policies for both cryptocurrency exchanges and users.\n\nIt is likely that as Lee and Draper noted, the closure of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market could lead to the stabilization of the global Bitcoin exchange market, which may be beneficial for Bitcoin in the long run.', ""The value of Bitcoin may now be compared with that of gold as it’s likely to be heading $25,000 in five years according to Tom Lee, Head Research of Fundstrat Global Advisors and Former Managing Director of JP Morgan Chase.\n\nHe said it in his recent interview with CNBC’s Fast Money program.\n\nBitcoin suffers\n\nAlthough Bitcoin has suffered from recent negative news from countries like China such as banning of ICOs and planning to shut down the Bitcoin exchanges by the end of the month, Lee thinks there are still advantages to the situation.\n\nAccording to Lee, there are two factors in the issue - liquidity effect and perspective of the people. According to him, Chinese exchanges operate with 30 percent of Bitcoin value. If they decide to shut down the digital currency, obviously there is gonna be force selling.\n\nIt's safe to point out that there have been seven times already that the crypto world has seen a setback of this magnitude.\n\nThe second factor is the perspective of the people on Bitcoin. Our society tends to see Bitcoin as a bubble and a fragile currency so everyone should be on the other side of that.\n\n“Well for instance, you know number one Bitcoin is not what people think... We have some data, there's only 300,000 holders of at least $5,000 so think about that that's like saying the iPhone was a bubble in 2007 four days into the sale because there were 500,000 of iPhones. So it's not that many holders of Bitcoin you know when you think about how many wallets there are today that holds $5,000, it’s huge so I think it's still very early stages.”\n\nBitcoin is different from other technologies, so the actual network itself is generating the value so that the visa of Bitcoin is going to be as valuable as the Blockchain network itself.\n\nAccording to Lee, fraud transaction cannot happen on this digital currency as it will cost $30 bln dollars to create on fake Bitcoin, so it's a very secure trusted network because of the nature of Blockchain.\n\n“I think it can be very threatening to financial institutions to see that hey, trust is created on the network and on the distribution network by the way from generation perspective I think people under the age of 30 think that makes perfect sense.”\n\nBitcoin is still the best tech framework of today.\n\nJust like gold, it is worth investing on. One cannot measure its value in the future with just one look but needs a total analysis on the market. Nevertheless, it still promises a positive, valuable outcome."", ""The world’s central banks can’t ignore the growth in cryptocurrencies and may at some point have to consider whether it makes sense for them to issue their own digital currencies, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\n\n“Whether or not a central bank should provide a digital alternative to cash is most pressing in countries, such as Sweden, where cash usage is rapidly declining,” the BIS said in its quarterly review. “But all central banks may eventually have to decide whether issuing retail or wholesale CBCCs makes sense in their own context.”\n\nIn making these decisions, institutions will need to take into account of not only privacy issues and efficiency gains in payment systems, but also potential economic, financial and monetary policy repercussions, according to the BIS.\n\n“In less than a decade, bitcoin has gone from being an obscure curiosity to a household name,” it said. “While it seems unlikely that bitcoin or its sisters will displace sovereign currencies, they have demonstrated the viability of the underlying blockchain or distributed ledger technology.”\n\nRead more about central banks’ digital currency efforts\n\nThe analysis came at the end of a rough week for digital currencies, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive Jamie Dimon calling bitcoin a “fraud” and China moving to crack down on domestic trading of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut with bitcoin and others gaining in popularity as payment systems go mobile and investors pour in money, central banks are beginning to delve into them and their underlying blockchain technology, which promises to speed up clearing and settlements. At the Bank of England, Mark Carney has cited cryptocurrencies as part of a potential “revolution” in finance.\n\nTo better understand the system, the Dutch central bank has created its own cryptocurrency, albeit for internal use only. U.S. officials are exploring the matter too, though in March Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said there were “significant policy issues” that needed further study, including vulnerability to cyber-attack, privacy and counterfeiting.\n\nWatch This Next\n\nA Look Inside One of the World's Biggest Bitcoin Mines\n\nAccording to the BIS, one option for central banks might be a currency available to the public, with only the central bank able to issue units that would be directly convertible with cash and reserves. There might be a greater risk of bank runs, however, and commercial lenders might face a shortage of deposits. Another question to be resolved would be the question of privacy.\n\nWatch Next: A Look Inside One of the World's Biggest Bitcoin Mines"", 'Bitcoin fell like a rock last week as many speculators in the cryptocurrency decided to book profits and head to the sidelines after JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about the dangers of Bitcoin, saying ""It\'s worse than tulip bulbs. It won\'t end well. Someone is going to get killed."" He even said the cryptocurrency ""is a fraud.""\n\nThe virtual currency was also pressured by the decision by Chinese authorities to crackdown on the digital currency. Last week\'s plunge came after Beijing ordered cryptocurrency exchanges to stop trading and block new registrations, due to fears that increasing number of customers piling into the market could lead to a string of wider financial problems.\n\n""All trading exchanges must by midnight of 15 September publish a notice to make clear when they will stop all cryptocurrency trading and announce a stop to new user registrations,"" the government notice said, according to Chinese state newspaper Securities Times.\n\nBTChina , one of the biggest Chinese exchanges, was the first to announce it was shutting its doors to all trading by September 30. OkCoin and Huobi followed this news with an announcement saying they would close on Friday.\n\nThe news from China is likely to have a big impact on Bitcoin prices because the nation accounts for almost a quarter of bitcoin trades and is also home to many of the world\'s biggest bitcoin miners.\n\nGet Into Bitcoin Trading Today\n\nIt\'s One Man\'s Opinion, Why All the Anger?\n\nIt\'s important to note that Jamie Dimon\'s comments were his opinion so you have the choice to believe what he said or not believe. For every negative comment from a banking heavy-weight like Dimon, we can find a similar number of positive comments about Bitcoin.\n\nMaking investment or trading decisions based on the opinions of others is nothing new to the financial community. That\'s what makes a market. For example, some soybean traders may believe one weather service when they say the crop will get ample rain. Others will believe the other weatherman who says there will be a drought.\n\nPerhaps the most successful investor of all-time, Warren Buffett has often said he doesn\'t invest in anything he doesn\'t understand. Once again, that\'s his opinion and if he says he doesn\'t like Bitcoin, he may be telling us, he doesn\'t understand the cryptocurrency market. As a professional, he isn\'t afraid to say he\'s missed opportunities in the past. One of his biggest regrets may be passing on Apple or Amazon when shares were cheap. However, he doesn\'t dwell on it.\n\nBitcoin Has Become a Trading Market\n\nI think what\'s making Bitcoin investors uncomfortable with the events last week is that Bitcoin is no longer flying under the radar and that it has become a trading market. And trading is 90% mental and 10% mechanical.\n\nI suspect that many Bitcoin ""investors"" were happiest when they could buy the digital currency, put it in their electronic wallet and forget about it because they believed it was going to go to $10,000, $50,000 or even $100,000. If that\'s their strategy then no one should argue with them.\n\nHowever, if you decide to become a Bitcoin ""trader"" then you are going to have to put up with the volatile swings that are part of all markets. You\'ll have to deal with choosing the right digital currency to trade. Just like stocks, some will win, some will lose.\n\nYou see investing and trading are two different animals. When no one was watching Bitcoin, profits may have come easy, but now you\'re going to have to work for it. I embrace cryptotechnology and all the good that will come about because of it. I also embrace volatility but I know my limits. If you\'re going to trade Bitcoin and all the opinions, issues and excessive price swings that go along with it then you\'re going to have to learn to embrace volatility because it\'s not going to go away anytime soon. I say embrace volatility or perish.\n\nThe other thing, make sure you know if you are a Bitcoin investor or a Bitcoin trader. There\'s an old adage amongst traders and it goes something like this: All it takes is a small loss to turn a short-term trader into a long-term investor. In other words, if you decide to trade Bitcoin during these turbulent times, make sure you are willing to take small losses if you are wrong. Otherwise, you may end up holding on to something that may in the long-run be nothing but an illusion.\n\nThe Best and Safest Way to Buy and Sell Bitcoins\n\nFor those who are looking to take advantage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies price fluctuations, Some brokers provide traders with instant access to trade Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.

Photo: Getty Images\n\nFile-sharing websites are not exactly known for their sterling reputation, though a few such as famed torrent site the Pirate Bay have been around for long enough while generally avoiding shady behavior they’ve acquired a certain cachet with the internet community.\n\nBut gotta gett that cash, baby, and banner ads might not be cutting it any more in the age of ubiquitous ad blocking. The Pirate Bay has added a Javascript-based bitcoin miner to its homepage, Torrent Freak wrote, causing some users to notice “that their CPU usage increased dramatically when they browsed certain Pirate Bay pages.”\n\n\n\nThe plugin, which is provided by Coinhive, puts users’ computers to work mining Monero, a cryptocurrency released in 2014. According to Torrent Freak, the miner was throttled to rates from between 0.6 and 0.8, but does consume considerable resources; running a version of the plugin on Coinhive’s website does result in an immediate and hard to miss increase in CPU utilization.\n\nTorrent Freak said they were told the miner was being tested for 24 hours as a possible replacement for traditional banner ads. In the meantime, users on the Pirate Bay’s subreddit were not happy, with several users complaining that the site never informed users the miner was running, let alone asked permission.\n\nUsing a file-sharing website was never going to be a risk-free endeavor, though users could disable the miner with a plugin like NoScript or ScriptBlock or by adding Coinhive to an ad blocker’s blacklist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmbedding bitcoin-mining scripts into a website is not exactly new, though the secret addition of Coinhive to one of the world’s most popular file-sharing websites is throwing up red flags. As noted by BetaNews, Coinhive’s own documentation advises:\n\nThe miner itself does not come with a UI – it’s your responsibility to tell your users what’s going on and to provide stats on mined hashes. While it’s possible to run the miner without informing your users, we strongly advise against it. You know this. Long term goodwill of your users is much more important than any short term profits.\n\nMalware which siphons unsuspecting users’ CPUs for spare cycles to mine cryptocurrency is a common problem, though peaked years ago in 2014, according to Quartz. The amount of processing power it takes to mine Bitcoin has risen 770-fold between 2014 and summer 2017, shifting the focus of bitcoin mining schemes to “giant, purpose-built warehouses” stuffed with thousands of servers. However, with the ongoing explosion in initial coin offerings and new crypto variants, there might still be opportunities to cash in with methods that have stopped working with older cryptocurrencies.\n\n[Torrent Freak]', 'A large portion of ICOs are funded by people who got rich buying Bitcoin.\n\nThey need to diversify their exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nBut they don\'t want to pay tax.\n\nOn that basis, ICOs look like a good deal.\n\nLONDON — Where is all this ICO money coming from?\n\nThat was the question I wanted to ask when Business Insider was invited to lunch last week with Lightspeed Venture Partners investor Jeremy Liew and Blockchain founder/CEO Peter Smith at The Hoxton, a trendy hotel much favoured by tech startups in Shoreditch, London.\n\nMore than $1.8 billion has been raised in ""initial coin offerings"" this year, much of it by companies you have never heard of. There\'s an ICO to build the largest aquarium in the world, for instance. And one for prostitution.\n\nIt\'s not clear where this $1.8 billion originated, however. The traditional funders of venture capital are so-called ""limited partners,"" like banks and pension funds. They aren\'t the ones throwing money at imaginary currencies with imaginary values.\n\nA $2 billion firehose of risk-loving money.\n\nICOs are largely unregulated offerings of digital coins, a bit like Bitcoin, that dozens of small tech companies are selling to raise funding. They operate like IPOs, but instead of offering equity they offer cryptocurrency tokens of their own design. The coins can then be exchanged at a later date, either traded to other buyers or for assets produced by the company itself.\n\nICOs are as exciting, and risky, and crazy, as they sound.\n\nSo who is providing this firehose of risk-loving money?\n\nIn Liew and Smith\'s opinion, a lot of it is coming from Bitcoin millionaires who want to diversify their exposure.\n\nMany people who bought Bitcoin years ago are now staggeringly wealthy. In 2012, Bitcoin traded for $10 a coin. If you bought $3,000 of Bitcoin that year and held it, you\'d now be a millionaire.\n\nIt\'s hard to say how many secret Bitcoin millionaires there are in the world, but it\'s a lot. There are 17 million Bitcoin wallets on Blockchain\'s system alone. Not all of them are millionaires, obviously. But enough of them are.\n\nWhen you\'re a Bitcoin millionaire and the Chinese government can wipe away 25% of your assets in an afternoon, you need to act.\n\nTheir problem is that Bitcoin remains enormously volatile. A year ago it traded below $1,000. It peaked at $4,950 this month but has since fallen back again to $3,222 at the time of writing, largely due to the news that China would ban ICOs and severely tighten regulations around Bitcoin.\n\nWhen you\'re a Bitcoin millionaire and a single press release from the Chinese government can wipe away 25% of your assets in an afternoon, you need to take action. (Of course, the prices of most digital coins rise and fall in rough tandem with Bitcoin so there is a question about how ""diversified"" you\'d be with the bulk of your wealth in the crypto markets. But still.)\n\nICOs are where that action is going. I started by asking Liew — Snapchat\'s first investor — what he thought of the ICO arena, which to outsiders just looks crazy.\n\nIt looks crazy to us too. — Jeremy Liew\n\n""It looks crazy to us too,"" Liew joked over guacamole and chips.\n\nBut there are diamonds inside that craziness, he believes, and the key is to ignore the noise in favour of the really solid ideas that offer buyers assets that have a real underlying value.\n\nOne example is Filecoin, he says, which lets users buy computer storage space on a decentralised server network. On one level, Filecoin is simply a credit that lets you buy a place to store your stuff.\n\nBut Filecoin can be traded like Bitcoin, so unspent Filecoin might — or might not — appreciate in value like an investment. And it can be cashed out for Bitcoin or regular fiat ""real world"" currency if you don\'t want it anymore. It\'s a digital credit that entitles you to a purchasable asset, but its value fluctuates like a currency. In other words, it could, therefore, pay off as an investment.\n\n""It\'s kind of like anybody in the world being able to get a seed investment in a Google or a Facebook or an Amazon or something like that,"" according to Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures (he\'s an investor).\n\nA good way to diversify out of Bitcoin without alerting the government is to trade into an ICO.\n\nThere\'s an added wrinkle: Tax.\n\nSo far, governments have not been very good at taxing Bitcoin. They disagree on whether it\'s property or currency, for instance. And because you can hold Bitcoin almost anonymously, it\'s hard for governments to find it and tax it. Bitcoin generally becomes taxable at the moment you convert it into cash. But it\'s no fun being a Bitcoin millionaire if, as soon as you buy a Ferrari, the government says, ""Hey, nice Ferrari! Where did you get the money for it?""\n\nMost ICO currencies are tradeable with Bitcoin. So a good way to diversify out of Bitcoin without alerting the IRS and HMRC is to trade into an ICO. if you\'ve got $1 million in Bitcoin lying around, then throwing $100,000 into an ICO isn\'t too painful, especially if you believe that ICO is going through the roof.\n\nThere will be a shakeout. — Peter Smith\n\nThat\'s the promise. Prices fall, too, of course.\n\n""There will be a shakeout"" Blockchain\'s Smith says. The dumb, non-transparent, risky companies will get washed away just like they did in the dot-com bubble of 2000. Eventually, the ICO market will settle in as a funding device for prosaic but valuable small-cap businesses that large banks usually ignore.\n\nBut until then, it\'s the Wild West out there.', 'When the boss of Wall Street’s biggest bank calls a bubble, the world inevitably sits up and listens, albeit with a sense of historically weighted irony: of course an investment bank boss would spot disaster after his industry presided over the last one. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, said last week that the ascendancy of the virtual currency bitcoin – which has risen in price from just over $2 in 2011 to more than $4,000 at points this year – reminded him of tulip fever in 17th-century Holland. “It is worse than tulip bulbs,” he said. “It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up. I am just shocked that anyone can’t see it for what it is.”\n\nDimon’s comments are an open invitation for derision from those who, rightly, point out that although JP Morgan may be top of the Wall Street heap, that heap is far from being the moral high ground. Under Dimon’s leadership, it has agreed a $13bn settlement with US regulators over selling dodgy mortgage securities – the instruments behind the credit crunch – and its run-ins with watchdogs include a $264m fine last year for hiring the children of Chinese officials in order to win lucrative business in return.\n\nBut it doesn’t make him wrong. Even the most basic description of bitcoin – an intellectual test on a par with describing a collateralised debt obligation – elicits mental images of a digital back-alley shell game. A bitcoin is a cryptographic solution to a complex equation. It is not as recognisable to you or me as a unit of value as, say, a dollar bill or a prize conker. There is no central authority validating the creation of bitcoins – instead, they are recorded on a public electronic ledger called a blockchain. If you regard the Bank of England as an all-powerful insurer for the pound, there is no such institution behind bitcoin.\n\nThis lack of a central authority is one of the reasons why Dimon cavilled in such strong terms last week. In the interstices of unregulated finance lurk ne’er-do-wells.\n\n“If you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than US dollars,” he said. “So there may be a market for that, but it would be a limited market.”\n\nHyperbole aside – murderers don’t necessarily need a digital wallet to fulfil their ambitions – Dimon is referencing a well-trailed link between bitcoin and narcotics. The currency is also vulnerable to hackers. Without a backstop central bank, heist victims stand to lose everything, as with the collapse of the MtGox bitcoin exchange in 2014. Taking out a mortgage denominated in bitcoins is not advisable and, luckily for those stupid enough to try it, you won’t find a high street bank willing to underwrite it.\n\nBut some of the perceived flaws behind bitcoin that alarm Dimon – no central authority, a public ledger of transactions – point to the foundations of a new financial establishment. In his jargon-busting lexicon of finance How to Speak Money, the author John Lanchester described how the high priests of ancient Egypt controlled agriculture – and by extension the economy – through a closely guarded flood measurement system known as a nilometer that was hidden behind a load of mumbo jumbo. Dimon, a modern high priest, faces a rival value system in bitcoin. It has no temple, no central authority and uses a rubric over which he has no control. In other words, it is an alternative financial establishment, whose popularity is inextricably linked with the ebbing of trust in the global system that was triggered by the credit crunch.\n\nIf bitcoin fails, or is discredited, another system will rise to take its place, without the imprimatur of Dimon or his peers around the altar.\n\nFirst-time buyers beware: this rate rise could just be the start\n\nHouse owners, and would-be house owners, beware. Change is coming. The majority on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee against raising interest rates seems huge, confirmed at 7-2 last week. But the language is tightening around the nation’s finances.\n\nSpare capacity in the economy – unfilled jobs and unspent money – is being whittled away more quickly than previously thought and inflation is still likely to overshoot its 2% target over the next three years. Yes, wage growth is running below an inflation rate that has now hit 2.9%, but all signs now point to that 7-2 split flipping the other way come November.\n\nAs the Bank said, “some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months”. This was firmed up the following day by Gertjan Vlieghe, previously the most anti-rise MPC member, when he said the bank was “approaching the moment” for an increase.\n\nMarket punters now think there is a 42% chance of a rise in November, and more than 50% in December. The current split on the MPC masks the weighing of trade-offs – between economic growth and inflation, post-referendum stability and curbing consumer debt – which is ever delicate and close to a tipping point.\n\nA rate rise from 0.25% at present to 0.5% will be no disaster and would merely represent a return to the previous record low, which had lasted from 2009 to the EU vote. But what should sharpen borrowers’ minds is the thought of further increases – as hinted by Vlieghe. Inflation remains stubbornly high; something will have to be done to temper a consumer lending surge growing at 10% a year.\n\nHouseholds might cope with a move to 0.5%, but if a rate increase augurs a sustained move against cheap borrowing and persistent inflation, then a wider rethink of ambitions, from getting further up the housing ladder to buying a new car, will be needed. And for those not on the housing ladder, hopes of a step up could be extinguished altogether.\n\nDisney hopes its Star Wars choice will use the force wisely\n\nDisney’s choice of creative talent in recent years has been impeccable, having handed the Avengers franchise to Joss Whedon and employed Lin-Manuel Miranda to co-write the music for Moana. But its decisions over the Star Wars universe have unravelled of late.\n\nThe director of Rogue One, Gareth Edwards, was sidelined during reshoots, while the directing duo behind the new Han Solo film, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, were fired altogether shortly before shooting finished. Most recently, Jurassic World helmer Colin Trevorrow was yanked off the final Star Wars instalment before filming began.\n\nLast week, Disney announced it was handing the final film in the latest Star Wars trilogy to JJ Abrams, the creator of Lost and director of The Force Awakens, the film that launched this Jedi triptych. Abrams is a conservative choice, by Disney’s recent standards. But what the studio needs right now is a safe pair of hands on the lightsaber.', 'The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has joined the rising chorus of voices warning about bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nHKMA chief executive Norman Chan Tak-lam warned banks and financial institutions trading or handling bitcoin or other digital currencies to be careful about breaching anti-money-laundering requirements.\n\n“Bitcoin or other digital currencies do not require holders to trade under their real name which allows them to be used for money laundering activities,” Chan said on the sidelines of a conference on Monday. “Bitcoin and other digital currencies are considered as commodities, so investors could trade them as commodities. However, investors need to understand these commodities have no monetary backing,” he added.\n\nHong Kong’s position as one of the world’s largest financial centres means the city is vulnerable to money laundering. In May, the HKMA re-emphasised its determination “t o fight serious financial crime and laundering. ”\n\n“Cryptocurrencies, ICOs and other investment arrangements involving digital tokens are highly speculative and may pose significant risks. Investors are reminded to exercise due diligence to understand the features and associated risks,” said David Kneebone, general manager of the Investor Education Centre.\n\nICO is an acronym for Initial Coin Offering, a major means by which the creators of token based digital platforms raise capital from investors.\n\nChan is not the only senior figure in the financial services industry to warn of the dangers of cryptocurrencies. Earlier this month, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock told the South China Morning Post that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were mostly being used for illicit transactions, and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan said last week that “bitcoin was a fraud”.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has also launched a crackdown on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which has hit market participants and roiled markets.\n\nLast week, coin exchange Bitkan said it would suspend its over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin and bitcoin cash trading services in response to PBOC’s recent ban on ICOs.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, which was close to US$5,000 at the start of September, plunged to US$3,018 on Saturday, before recovering slightly.\n\n“The price action has certainly been led by this Chinese salvo – but healthy profits are moving traders to take gains off the table too until the panic calms,” said Charles Hayter chief executive of Cryptocompare.\n\nWhy has China declared war on bitcoin and digital currencies?\n\nThe HKMA’s warning follows an earlier statement from Hong Kong’s securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nTwo weeks ago the SFC put companies planning ICOs on notice that any such digital fundraising activity may fall under Hong Kong’s securities code, requiring them to be registered with the regulator.\n\nSeparately, Chan also said on Monday that the status of the Hong Kong dollar would not diminish even if more share offerings were made in yuan. His comment was in response to a blog posting from his predecessor Joseph Yam Chi-kwong urging more Hong Kong stock offerings and trading to be made in yuan to reduce currency risks and boost the internationalisation of the Chinese currency.\n\n“Hong Kong had facilities to allow yuan share trading and settlement six or seven years ago but this trading was not active,” Chan said.\n\nChan said more companies ought to opt for yuan share offering and trading given the many infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, and the internationalisation of yuan.\n\nNonetheless, he said: “I do not think more usage of yuan will affect the status of the Hong Kong dollar. We use Hong Kong dollars to pay our salary, to trade shares, to buy properties and to pay for our meals and shopping.”\n\n“Hong Kong dollar remains the currency of Hong Kong. The HKMA supports the currency and the public has confidence on it. There is no change to the status of the importance of the Hong Kong dollar.”', 'There are always intriguing Bitcoin discussions to be found on Reddit. Although most debates turn into a flaming war sooner or later, some topics are discussed in a professional manner. There are some people who feel Bitcoin Cash is vastly superior to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. An interesting train of thought, as it almost appears to be like comparing apples and oranges. Then again, there are some interesting correlations.\n\nThe main purpose of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is to address scalability. More specifically, providing a much higher transaction throughput at reduced fees through payment channels. An intriguing concept, especially when considering Bitcoin’s current throughput and fees situation. With the transaction costs mounting several times this year alone, a cheap solution will have a lot of merit. However, Bitcoin Cash provides a similar functionality and some added features.\n\nNo Point in Comparing BCH to the Lightning Network\n\nFor example, using the LN would – in theory – require multiple interactive “hops” to complete transactions. With Bitcoin Cash, there is a 0-confirmation structure similar to Bitcoin it. Then again, Both systems work completely different, to say the least. Secondly, people claim the Lightning Network will only work for small transactions. That is the main objective, granted, but people can still use Bitcoin for larger amounts. Bitcoin Cash has no real advantage here either, despite its “unlimited” transaction size.\n\nThere are some other interesting points in this Reddit thread, but they may not necessarily add up. The 0-confirmation aspect is anything but secure. The Lightning Network still doesn’t require actual network confirmations like Bitcoin Cash does right now. Moreover, BCH has no unlimited transaction size either. Right now, it appears to be capped at 24 TX per second, which isn’t exactly stellar either. Again, it is literally comparing apples and oranges.\n\nIn the end, people are free to use whichever solution they like best. From a technical point of view, the Lightning Network and Bitcoin Cash are nothing alike whatsoever. There will always be squabbles between BCH and BTC supporters, that much is evident. The Lightning Network is an exciting development, although its actual sue cases have yet to be determined. An interesting future awaits, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Emerging Markets\n\nJust recently the Japanese exchange Coincheck announced the company’s license registration in the country had been approved by the Japan’s Finance Bureau Director.\n\nAlso read: After the Boss Calls Bitcoin a ‘Fraud’ — JP Morgan Buys the Dip\n\nJapan’s Financial Services Agency Approves Coincheck’s Cryptocurrency Trading Platform Registration\n\nOn September 13 the Japanese bitcoin trading platform and payment processor, Coincheck, announced the firm’s registration had been approved to become a licensed “virtual currency exchange.” The exchange registration approval follows the provisions of Article 63-3 of the country’s fund settlement law. After bitcoin was legalized as a form of payment on April 1, 2017, all domestic exchanges in Japan must receive authorization from the treasury department and Financial Services Agency (FSA) to operate a virtual currency exchange business.\n\nAt the time Coincheck was extremely pleased to see the Japanese statutes pass and said the “newly made law and regulations on bitcoin are going be enormous.” Further, the exchange revealed at the time that all exchange providers must be approved by the FSA.\n\n“In order to make the exchanges more secure, cryptocurrency has been handed over to the authority of the FSA,” explains the Coincheck blog this past June.\n\nAll the exchange providers and other companies that deal with virtual currency will need to be registered by the FSA before they can start operation. It will help to make cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan tighter, more secure, have scrupulous control.\n\nCoincheck Expands as Japanese Bitcoin Enthusiasm Continues to Grow\n\nJapan has often captured the number one spot in global bitcoin trade volume. Coincheck handles a lot of bitcoin trade volume as the trading platform swapped 97,502 BTC over the past 24-hours. Further back in May the firm announced the creation of interest-bearing bitcoin savings accounts, if the FSA would allow the concept. This past August Coincheck launched a new investment sandbox that tends to crypto-startups and organizations running initial coin offerings (ICO).\n\nThe Japanese trading platform’s registration follows the demise of the country’s infamous bitcoin exchange Mt Gox and reveals that officials are more comfortable with exchange operations. Moreover, the positive news comes at a time when Chinese bitcoin trading platforms have been forced to close most of its operations.\n\nWhat do you think about Coincheck getting the company’s license registration approved in Japan?

09/18/2017,"[""It's safe to say Friday wasn't the most stable day for the (BTC/USD) exchange rate.\n\nAfter news of exchange shake-ups in China triggered a wave of panic selling, prices fell below $3,000 for the first time in months. Overall, this was the lowest total observed on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index since August 5, when a V-shape recovery saw prices rise all the way to $3,875.\n\nYet, just a few days later, the price is already back at that level, having gained 33% in three days.\n\nThe sharp recovery could be attributed to oversold technical conditions and to the relief offered by news that China’s exchange ban would not impact all forms of cryptocurrency trading.\n\nBut while the exact causes are uncertain, it seems safe to say the bad news has already been priced in by the market.\n\nThe recovery from the low of $2,980 followed by a bout of consolidation (ongoing) in the range of $3,500 to $3,800 over the weekend and move above the resistance of $3,900 (September 5 low) today further indicates there's confidence in the current market state.\n\nSo, is bitcoin out of the woods?\n\nPrice action analysis says bitcoin could be setting up for a solid rally to record highs, the likes of which it saw from mid-July. However, the bulls still need to clear some key technical resistance levels, before claiming victory over the bears.\n\nDaily chart - 100-day moving average support & an oversold RSI\n\nThe price action witnessed over the last 48 hours is similar to conditions seen in mid-July, i.e. the dip below the 100-day moving average was short lived as the RSI (relative strengh index) was oversold.\n\nAt that time, the market saw a huge breakout, followed by a rally to record high of $5,000.\n\nStill, the daily chart shows back-to-back Doji candles (on Saturday & Sunday), a candlestick pattern which shows indecision in the marketplace. A bullish reversal is confirmed if the Doji is followed by a positive candle. If bitcoin ends on a positive note today, preferably above $3,958 (50-day moving average), a bullish reversal would be confirmed.\n\nIf bitcoin ends on a positive note today, preferably above $3,958 (50-day moving average), a bullish reversal would be confirmed.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe trend line drawn from September 2 high and September 8 high will offer resistance around $4,250 levels. A break higher would open doors for fresh record highs in bitcoin.\n\nView\n\nA bullish reversal confirmation followed by a break above $4,250 would add credence to the rebound from the 100-DMA and shall boost the odds of the digital currency rallying to fresh record highs above $5,000.\n\nOnly a daily close below $3,600 would revive the bearish view.\n\nMountain climber via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", ""Yet as one of the world’s foremost bankers, Mr. Dimon is plainly aware that countries also create fiat currencies out of thin air. (In Latin, fiat means “let it be done.”) It has been more than four decades since Richard Nixon removed the American dollar from the gold standard.\n\nAnd in any event, most of gold’s value doesn’t arise from its physical attributes, since it doesn’t have any magical ability to create usefulness or generate financial dividends despite its attractive shiny yellow hue. It’s instead because investors have believed in its value for thousands of years.\n\nOf course, fiat currencies like the dollar have the backing of a sovereign nation. Digital currencies are obviously far more speculative, have been around for only a few years, and don’t have a government’s underlying support. But almost all currencies today are conjured up from nothing — the euro didn’t even exist 20 years ago — and their value is largely dependent on trust.\n\nNaturally, most people have more trust in the “full faith and credit of the United States” than in an anonymous distributed group of miners and traders. But trust in digital currency is clearly building over time and is a self-reinforcing network. And one of the advantages of Bitcoin is that its total supply is fixed. A fiat currency, on the other hand, can be devalued by centralized monetary policy.\n\nIn his comments, Mr. Dimon cited the famed investor Howard Marks, who in a July memo to his clients referred to Bitcoin as an unfounded fad. But he seems to have missed Mr. Marks's subsequent backflip in which, while remaining a skeptic, the hedge fund mogul wrote, “There’s absolutely no reason why Bitcoin — or anything else — can’t serve as a currency if enough people accept it as such.”\n\nMr. Dimon is also too modest about JPMorgan’s own achievements in this arena. His firm conjured up its own currency: Chase Ultimate Reward points, its credit card loyalty program. Millions of customers have accumulated billions of points, trusting in Chase’s promise that this currency can be converted into cash or used for travel and other delights. And they hope that Chase won’t unilaterally choose to devalue them, while living with the risk that, unlike their bank accounts, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides no insurance for this valuable currency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Presumably, Mr. Dimon doesn’t think Ethereum, whose value is up more than 2,000 percent over the last year, is also a modern version of tulip mania.\n\nIn Mr. Dimon’s telling, Bitcoin has value only for people who want to bypass the traditional banking system for illicit purposes, including “murderers and drug dealers,” or people living in countries with repressive governments like North Korea and Venezuela. He doubts that this is a large market opportunity, though perhaps he may concede that there are inherent difficulties in accurately sizing up markets where participants like to keep a low profile.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPart of the promise of the blockchain, and associated digital currencies, is the absence of a central authority. It’s fair to say that the cult of decentralization may have run too far, with some enthusiasts imagining it as a panacea for every business problem. Centralized networks work well for many functions, like trading stocks or managing flight reservations.\n\nBut new use cases for digital currencies are just starting to take shape. They are now being used to create value in the way that Silicon Valley has traditionally done so: regulatory arbitrage. Ride-hailing got its start avoiding onerous taxi medallion costs; Airbnb avoided hotel taxes and regulations; and YouTube played fast and loose with copyright rules.\n\nSimilarly, some entrepreneurs are using the blockchain as a way to avoid certain regulatory requirements for raising capital. As a rule, Silicon Valley prefers to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\n\nCompanies are also creating tokens to align incentives around decentralized efforts like open source software or distributed storage networks.\n\nUndoubtedly, there will be plenty of hits and misses, as one would expect in the early days of a new technology. And there will be some outright scams as well.\n\nBut the toothpaste is now out of the tube, and there is sufficient momentum for legitimate use cases to develop. Presumably, that’s why JPMorgan itself is investing resources in developing these technologies and applications.\n\nEconomists use the term “cheap talk” for words that don’t have any payoff. Despite his withering Bitcoin critique, Mr. Dimon also said, “Don’t ask me to short it. It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up.”\n\nMr. Dimon added that he would fire any employee who traded Bitcoin. But he didn’t say how he would deal with an employee who publicly identifies a $70 billion fraud — then doesn’t find a way to make a dime out of it."", 'The world’s central banks can’t sit back and ignore the growth in cryptocurrencies as it could pose a risk to the stability of the financial system, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\n\nIt said central banks will need to figure out whether to issue a digital currency and what its attributes should be, though the decision is most pressing in countries like Sweden where cash use is dwindling.\n\nInstitutions need to take into account of not only privacy issues and efficiency gains in payment systems, but also economic, financial and monetary policy repercussions, the BIS said in its quarterly review.\n\nThe analysis comes at the end of a rough week for digital currencies, with JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon calling bitcoin a “fraud” and China moving to crack down on domestic trading of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut with bitcoin and others gaining in popularity as payment systems go mobile and investors pour in money, central banks are beginning to delve into them and their underlying blockchain technology, which promises to speed up clearing and settlements.\n\nAt the Bank of England, Mark Carney has cited cryptocurrencies as part of a potential “revolution” in finance.\n\nTo better understand the system, the Dutch central bank has created its own cryptocurrency, albeit for internal use only.\n\nBusiness picture of the day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 show all Business picture of the day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/7 Bitcoin saw a volatile week in which it reached highs of $11,000 before dropping down by more than a fifth on Wednesday.\n\n2/7 Jeremy Corbyn told investment bank Morgan Stanley that it is right to regard him as a threat.\n\n3/7 RBS announced plans to close 259 branches, costing 680 jobs, in response to customers migrating towards online and mobile-banking services.

Advertising and ad placement on the site is largely unavailable due to the nature of the content and as such, it seems as if the administrators of the site went looking elsewhere.\n\nMining cryptocurrency seemed to be their prefered choice, but this isn’t sitting well with users of the site, who were caught unaware by the sudden spike in their CPU’s usage while visiting.\n\n“That really is serious, so hopefully we can get some action on it quickly. And perhaps get some attention for the uploading and commenting bugs while they’re at it,” a Pirate Bay user named “Sid” wrote in a comment, according to Torrentfreak.\n\nSimply a test\n\nAccording to The Pirate Bay, who responded to Torrentfreak, this was a test, and it was only to be performed for 24 hours.\n\nDespite what The Pirate Bay says, they still have a few questions to answer, and furthermore, they raised a few philosophical questions about the regulation of mining.\n\nCryptocurrencies, as well as newly formed ones in the form of ICOs, have recently come under huge scrutiny, as places like China have upped their regulation, even inflicting bans.\n\nThis exploitation of users and their CPU power seems to be ethically wrong - even if it is done by a pirate website. Thus, should there be certain policies to restrict who can mine crypto, or should they subject erring users to penalties?\n\nIf the use of cryptocurrencies are being regulated, should the mining of said coins not also have some sort of laws and rules around them?\n\nA balance must be struck, otherwise people are left unprotected and exposed to potentially exploitative methods — like those who “borrow” your CPU to earn a few virtual coins.', 'The crypto markets continued to recover on Monday, climbing as much as $15 billion to cross the $130 billion threshold. The bitcoin price headlined the advance with an 8% leap across the $3,800 barrier, while the ethereum price surged more than 15%. Ultimately an astonishing 97 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies experienced positive movement for the day.\n\nThis renewed confidence among traders likely stems from the emergence of Japan as a major player in the global crypto markets. As CCN has reported, many major Chinese traders have already moved to Japanese exchanges, even though OKCoin and Huobi will continue to operate until the end of October. It is becoming clear that if China’s bitcoin exchange ban is permanent, it will be China who suffers–not bitcoin.\n\nAfter beginning the day just under $120 billion, the crypto market cap steadily climbed leading into Monday morning. It briefly crossed $135 billion, although it has since experienced a slight taper. At present, the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies is about $133 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Soars Past $3,800\n\nSome industry observers expected that the bitcoin price would level out at our below the $3,000 threshold, at least in the short term. However, bitcoin is defying those predictions, as Monday’s 8% bump demonstrates. After beginning the day close to $3,500, the bitcoin price has surged about $300, raising it to a present value of $3,812. BTC/USD is trading above $3,900 on Bitfinex, GDAX, and Bitstamp, and the global average bitcoin price is now less than $200 away from the psychologically-significant $4,000 mark. Altogether, this translates into a market cap of $63.2 billion.\n\nAnother positive development is the continued rise of over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading. Last week, LocalBitcoins–a platform that connects individuals looking to buy and sell bitcoin for fiat currency–set a 7-day record of about $72 million. Much of this increase came from Chinese residents who are no longer able to make CNY deposits on local order-book exchanges.\n\nEthereum Price Climbs to $275\n\nThe ethereum price climbed 16% on Monday, giving it the best 24-hour performance among coins in the top 5. This rally–which comes as ethereum prepares to begin deploying its Metropolis protocol upgrade–raised the ethereum price to $278. Ethereum now has a market cap of $26.3 billion.\n\nAltcoins Join the Advance\n\nThe early-week rally reverberated throughout the altcoin markets, enabling 97 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies to post single-day advances.\n\nAfter beginning the day near $400, the bitcoin cash price surged 13% to $453, raising its market cap above $7.5 billion.\n\nThe Ripple posted a 6% gain, while the litecoin price edged past $50 following its 8% bump. Dash and NEM both posted double-digit advances, climbing 12% and 13%, respectively. This raised NEM’s market cap back across the $2 billion mark. The IOTA price surged by 22%, giving it the best return of any top 10 cryptocurrency; IOTA is now trading at $0.576. The Monero price climbed 6%, but this was not enough to push XMR over the $100 barrier. OmiseGO rounded out the top 10 with a 14% climb, which was sufficient to hold off challenges from NEO and ethereum classic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Hackers have proven just how urgently a gaping flaw in the global telecoms network, affecting what\'s known as Signalling System No. 7 (SS7), needs to be fixed. In a video demonstration, shown to Forbes ahead of publication today, benevolent hackers from Positive Technologies were able to take control of a Coinbase bitcoin wallet and start pilfering funds via the SS7 flaws.\n\nSS7 weaknesses, despite fixes being available for years, remain open. They allow anyone with access to that part of the telecoms backbone to send and receive messages to and from cellphones, with various attacks allowing silent interception of SMS texts, calls and location data. (Typically, the SS7 network is used by telecoms companies to talk with one another, normally for shifting customers between operators when roaming).\n\nIn their attack, the Positive researchers first went to Gmail, using Google\'s service to find an email account with just a phone number. Once the email account was identified, the hackers initiated a password reset process, asking one-time authorization codes to be sent to the victim\'s phone. By exploiting SS7 weaknesses they were able to intercept text messages containing those codes, allowing them to choose a new password and take control of the Gmail account. They could then simply head to the Coinbase website and do another password reset using the email they\'d compromised.\n\nScary SS7 attacks\n\nThis isn\'t just a threat that affects bitcoin, of course. It affects anything linked within the Gmail account, not to mention the complete loss of all those emails and the entire Google account. ""This hack would work for any resource - real currency or virtual currency - that uses SMS for password recovery,"" said Positive researcher Dmitry Kurbatov. ""This is a vulnerability in mobile networks, which ultimately means it is an issue for everyone, especially services relying on the mobile network to send security codes.""\n\nThe biggest barrier, perhaps, to such attacks is acquiring access to the SS7 network in the first place. Positive\'s researchers had access to it ""for research purposes to identify vulnerabilities and help mobile operators make their networks more secure."" Typically, criminals would either have to buy or hack their way onto the network.\n\nAs for how others might do that, Kurbatov added: ""The risk lies in the fact that cybercriminals can potentially buy access to SS7 illegitimately [on the] dark web."" He pointed to dark web sites, like Interconnector, that have been seen selling SS7 services. (Some claimed Interconnector was a scam).\n\nIndeed, criminals have, on at least one occasion, used SS7 vulnerabilities to carry out an attack. That occurred in Germany this year, when crooks were able to use the same methods as the Positive researchers, but to pilfer funds from bank accounts of O2-Telefonica customers.\n\nSurveillance companies, such as Israeli firm Ability Inc., are also actively selling services to spy on targets over the SS7 network. Ability\'s Unlimited Inteception app has sold for as much as $5 million, though the cost can go up to $20 million, the firm\'s CEO told Forbes last year.\n\nWhile the world waits for telecoms companies to act, users could also stop using SMS for two-factor authentication. SS7 attacks such as those carried out by Positive, which previously showed how to hack WhatsApp and Facebook accounts with similar exploits, currently won\'t work where data-based communications are used for sending one-time codes, such as Google\'s Authenticator app.\n\nDaniel Romero, Coinbase vice president of operations, said the company has been reaching out to customers about migrating from SMS-based two-factor authentication to apps like Google Authenticator. ""Additionally, we\'ve enhanced our own monitoring systems to prevent phone-related security threats. We are continuing to monitor this vigilantly,"" he said. The company has witnessed an uptick in hacks using another popular method for bitcoin theft: stealing a user\'s telephone number by social engineering the telecoms firms. From there, the hackers can, in a similar way to the SS7 attacks, reset passwords.\n\nGoogle has various tools available to concerned users on to of Authenticator, such as the Google Security Checkup. For non-SMS two-factor authentication, which will prevent SS7 attacks, it\'s possible to use a Google prompt or security key instead.\n\nBut the problem won\'t go away until telecoms operators take action. Even with pressure to patch coming from Capitol Hill, chiefly from representative Ted Lieu and senator Ron Wyden, little progress appears to have been made.\n\nMust Read: An Intrepid Investor\'s Guide To Buying Bitcoin And Other Crypto Assets', 'The mind behind Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is matter-of-fact about the crypto. In short, he believes what interviewer Naval Ravikant called “brain virus” is the true future of security and economics and, with the right incentives, Ethereum can replace things like credit card networks and even gaming servers.\n\nButerin separates the world into two kinds of people.\n\n“There’s the average person who’s already heard of bitcoin and the average person who hasn’t,” he said. His project itself builds upon that notion by adding more utility to the blockchain, thereby creating something everyone will want to hear about.\n\n“Where Ethereum comes from is basically you take the idea of crypto economics and the kinds of economic incentives that keeps things like bitcoin going to create decentralized networks with memory for a whole bunch of applications,” he said. “A good blockchain application is something that needs decentralization and some kind of shared memory.”\n\nThat’s what he’s building and hopes others will build on the Ethereum network.\n\nRight now the network is a bit too slow for most mainstream applications.\n\n“Bitcoin is processing a bit less than 3 transactions per second,” he said. “Ethereum is doing five a second. Uber gives 12 rides a second. It will take a couple of years for the blockchain to replace Visa.”\n\nButerin doesn’t think everything should run on the blockchain but many things can. As the technology expands it can grow to replace many services that require parallelization — that is programs that should run at the same time.\n\n“You could run StarCraft on the blockchain. Those kinds of things are possible. High level of security and scalability allows all these various other things to be built on top. Ethereum is a secure base layer that doesn’t have too many features.”\n\n“Crypto is all about incentives on various levels,” he said. “You cannot reason about the security of blockchain consensus protocols without incentives.”\n\nUPDATE – Buterin clarified his point:', 'Australia\'s government has introduced a bill that delivers on a long-standing promise to solve a ""double taxation"" problem for cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs it stands today, Australians are potentially liable for goods-and-services tax (GST) when they either purchase or spend a cryptocurrency. This state of affairs has been the target of criticism from the country\'s local bitcoin community, and in March 2016, the government announced a plan to resolve the issue by removing the tax at the time of purchase.\n\nNow, months after unveiling a budget that included the tax cut, Australia\'s government has introduced legislation that would, if passed, codify the elimination. In a September 14 statement, the Australian Treasury said that the plan would ""cement Australia’s reputation as a global fintech centre.""\n\nThe government explained:\n\n""The Bill will ensure that Australians are no longer charged GST on purchases of digital currency, allowing it to be treated the same way as physical money for GST purposes. The law change will retrospectively apply from 1 July 2017, in line with the 2017 Budget announcement.""\n\nThe measure was framed as part of a wider effort to promote financial technologies in Australia, including its homegrown cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n""The Bill will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia, as the government takes action to boost jobs and wages.""\n\nIt\'s not immediately clear when the bill will be brought up for debate and potential revision. Australia has a bicameral legislature, meaning that both chambers would need to approve the legislation before it could advance and become national law.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

See demonstration video from Electrum below.\n\nIt quoted the retailer’s information systems executive Jason Peisl as saying that although bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are “still relatively new payment concepts”, Pick n Pay has been able to “effectively demonstrate how we are able to accept such alternative payments”.\n\nPick n Pay did not say when or even if it planned to expand the pilot to other stores.\n\nElectrum provided the cloud-based enterprise payments platform used for the transactions, while the bitcoin infrastructure for the project was provided by Luno, a bitcoin company active in Southeast Asia and Africa, and with an office in Cape Town.\n\nAccording to Electrum’s website, major major retailers and financial institutions use the company’s technology to accept payments, process loyalty transactions and provide value-added services. Its customers include two out of Africa’s top three retailers.\n\nInvestec economist Chris Becker tweeted about the development earlier on Saturday.\n\nWell done Pick n Pay! Now accepting #Bitcoin.

After reaching a record high of $4,921 on Sept. 1, the digital currency fell as low as $2,975 on Sept. 15.\n\nPrices are rebounding because traders in China are likely to switch to alternative exchanges or seek loopholes in the regulation, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a Washington-based nonprofit research firm focusing on cryptocurrencies.\n\n“The efficacy of any bitcoin ban is pretty dubious,” said Van Valkenburgh. “It’s bullish because if a powerful government like China feels the need to ban major trading, then it’s a good indicator that the technology works and that it does what it’s supposed to. If it overcomes those controls, then it’s further proof that it’s independent from government controls, which is pretty radical.”\n\nRead more: Bitcoin explained -- a QuickTake\n\nChina banned fundraising by selling digital coins, known as initial coin offerings, and plans to ban trading of bitcoin and other virtual currencies on domestic exchanges. In addition, authorities also increased oversight on messaging app WeChat, which traders use to communicate.\n\nWhile the tighter regulation makes access to cryptocurrency more difficult, investors can trade the digital assets over-the-counter or go to exchanges based in other jurisdictions. Instead of WeChat, cryptocurrency aficionados are already migrating to encrypted messaging service Telegram. On the ICO side, they can set up companies in countries where regulation on the sector is more lax, like Switzerland and Singapore.\n\nIn addition, China’s weight on the broader cryptocurrency market isn’t as high as it once was, so changes in regulation have lower potential impact. Bitcoin trading against the Chinese currency has dwindled to 19 percent of total volume in the past 6 months, from about 90 percent last year, according to digital currency data website Bitcoinity, after Chinese regulators clamped down on the market earlier this year. The U.S. dollar is now the most traded currency against bitcoin, accounting for 54 percent of total volume in the past six months.\n\nRead more: What’s an ICO? -- a QuickTake\n\nBitcoin slumped almost 20 percent in the two days after Chinese authorities did on-site inspections of bitcoin exchanges early January and slumped again after China’s central bank took steps to prevent withdrawals of the cryptocurrency in February. That the digital asset recovered is an understatement, as its price has almost quadrupled since.\n\nSo where to next? John Spallanzani at GFI Group Inc. says $4,000 is the level to watch.\n\n“If we hold at $4,000 we have a nice shot to make a new high on the year,” Spallanzani said. “If not, then it’ll roll over and retest the lows of $2,875.”\n\n— With assistance by Lulu Yilun Chen']"
09/19/2017,"['Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese regulators have issued strict instructions on how Bitcoin exchanges should dismantle their operations\n\nChina is moving forward with plans to shut down Bitcoin exchanges in the country, starting with trading platforms in key cities.\n\nAll Bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai have been ordered to submit plans for winding down their operations by 20 September.\n\nThe move follows the Chinese central bank\'s decision to ban initial coin offerings in early September.\n\nTop exchange BTCC said it would stop trading at the end of the month.\n\nChinese authorities decided to ban digital currencies as part of a plan for reducing the country\'s financial risks.\n\nA website set up by the Chinese central bank warned that cryptocurrencies are ""increasingly used as a tool in criminal activities such as money laundering, drug trafficking, smuggling, and illegal fundraising"".\n\nStrict instructions\n\nAccording to a document leaked online by users on the social network Weibo that was seen by Coindesk, Chinese regulators ordered all cryptocurrency exchanges in Beijing to stop registering new user registration by midnight local time on 15 September, and to notify users publicly when they formally close.\n\nAll exchanges are required to send regulators a detailed ""risk-free"" plan of how they intend to exit the market before 18:30 local time on Wednesday 20 September.\n\nThe regulator also ordered the exchanges to submit DVDs containing all user trading and holding data to the local authorities.\n\nShareholders, controllers, executives, and core financial and technical staff of exchanges are also required to remain in Beijing during the shutdown and to co-operate fully with authorities.\n\nBeing cautious\n\n""China is shutting the exchanges down for good reasons - I think it\'s right they\'re being cautious at this time,"" Paul Armstrong, an emerging technology adviser and author of the book Disruptive Technologies, told the BBC.\n\n""Bitcoin is by proxy unregulated and peer-to-peer, it\'s a very volatile currency.""\n\nHowever, Mr Armstrong does not think that this will be the end of Bitcoin in China for good.\n\n""They\'re shutting it down for now, but it doesn\'t mean that in six months or so they won\'t create new Bitcoin regulations like Japan and Australia did,"" he said.\n\n""All the other countries have digital currencies and are making important decisions about it, so it doesn\'t make sense for China to dismiss it out of hand.""\n\nHe added that China\'s decision could prompt Chinese investors to seek alternative options to digital currencies, such as moving out of the country and operating exchanges or Bitcoin mining pools in other regions.', ""JOHANNESBURG - The world's central banks cannot ignore the growth in cryptocurrencies and may at some point have to consider whether it makes sense for them to issue their own digital currencies, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\n\n“Whether or not a central bank should provide a digital alternative to cash is most pressing in countries, such as Sweden, where cash usage is rapidly declining,” the BIS said in its quarterly review. “But all central banks may eventually have to decide whether issuing retail or wholesale CBCCs (central banks cryptocurrencies) makes sense in their own context.”\n\nIn making these decisions, institutions will need to take into account not only privacy issues and efficiency gains in payment systems, but also potential economic, financial and monetary policy repercussions. “In less than a decade, Bitcoin has gone from being an obscure curiosity to a household name,” BIS said.\n\n“While it seems unlikely that Bitcoin or its sisters will displace sovereign currencies, they have demonstrated the viability of the underlying blockchain or distributed ledger technology.”\n\nThe analysis came at the end of a rough week for digital currencies, with JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon calling bitcoin a “fraud” and China moving to crack down on domestic trading of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut with Bitcoin and others gaining in popularity as payment systems go mobile and investors pour in money, central banks are beginning to delve into them and their underlying blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to the BIS, one option for central banks might be a currency available to the public, with only the central bank able to issue directly convertible units.\n\n- BLOOMBERG"", 'As Bitcoin recovers $1,000 in less than four days, another institutional giant is voicing his doubts about the volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a Tuesday interview with CNBC, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Ray Dalio, dubbed the cryptocurrency “a bubble.”\n\n“Bitcoin today, you can’t make much transactions of in it. You can’t spend it very easily,” Dalio said on CNBC as bitcoin traded up by about 33% from four days earlier, at $4,000. “It’s a shame. It could be a currency. It could work conceptually, but the amount of speculation that is going on and the lack of transactions [hurts it].”\n\nThough bearish on Bitcoin, Dalio’s comments were less aggressive than those of J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s from a week earlier. At a Barclays conference earlier this month, the banking executive dubbed Bitcoin a “fraud” that will “blow up.” Coinciding with a crackdown on cryptocurrency in China, Dimon’s remarks help push Bitcoin from its all-time high of around $5,000 to just under $3,000.\n\nDalio’s comments however reflect concerns that Bitcoin’s price has created something of a feedback loop reinforcing speculation — and preventing the cryptocurrency from becoming a mainstream form of payment. In July, Morgan Stanley analysts noted that fewer online merchants appeared to be accepting bitcoin, likely because the bitcoin holders weren’t spending their bitcoins. Instead, holders were storing the cryptocurrency in hopes of catching, or perhaps in fear of missing out on, Bitcoin’s next boom.\n\nThe hedge fund titan again in the CNBC interview reiterated that gold, currently trading at about $1,309 an ounce, was a better area of investment in times of volatility. In a LinkedIn post, Dalio suggested investors allocate 5% to 10% of their assets to gold amid political risk.\n\nThis is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance.

That opinion was echoed by some of the biggest mining pool operators and also programmers -- known as “Core” developers -- who were instrumental to developing the infrastructure of the original bitcoin network.\n\nIn recent weeks, a group of miners -- people who crunch complex math problems to generate and transact the digital currency -- split off from the legacy bitcoin to use a new version known as Bitcoin Cash. Ver is moving some of his funds into the new offshoot as he anticipates what would be the second split of the currency of 2017. Ver admits he could potentially benefit from such a schism as more coins are created.\n\n“There’s probably going to be another split between bitcoin legacy and SegWit2X version of bitcoin but that just gives me more coins that I can sell for the Bitcoin Cash version,” Ver said in an interview on Bloomberg Television at a conference organized by Bitkan in Hong Kong.\n\nBitcoin’s popularity has led to congestion in trade, with transaction times and processing fees at one point soaring to records. Debate over how to deal with the problem has divided the trading community, with some proposing boosting the number of transactions in each block that has to be verified by miners, and others advocating for moving some information off the main network.\n\nOne faction of the community is pushing for a network upgrade in November, which could lead to a split if no consensus is made.\n\nRead more about the fracas over the fate of the currency\n\nWhen the split occurred around the beginning of August -- with Bitcoin Cash diverging from legacy bitcoin -- the digital currency initially slumped 6.8 percent in a two-day slide as investors appeared to discount the value of the new coin. But prices subsequently rallied, surging to a record $4,880.85 by Sept. 1 before China announced a crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings that sent prices plunging 20 percent.\n\nWhile an early adopter of bitcoin, Ver has also attracted controversy for his embrace of Bitcoin Cash, which some developers criticize for giving too much power to miners.\n\nIf another tear occurs in November, it would create a third version of the cryptocurrency and potentially further scatter capital and resources as three offshoots of bitcoin emerge.\n\nSegWit2x refers to a compromise proposal developed to deal with the surge in transactions. In August, miners agreed to implement the first phase of the proposal, or SegWit. They were expected to increase the blocksize to two megabytes around November in a second phase.\n\nAvoiding such a splinter requires miners to reach at least 92-percent consensus on supporting the second phase of SegWit2x, but that’s becoming increasingly unlikely, according to Wang Chun, co-owner and chief administrator of F2Pool, one of the world’s largest mining pools.\n\nEven though SegWit2x garnered more than 93 percent support in July, miners and developers seem to be backing away from the proposal, a compromise that harbors characteristics disliked by extremists on both sides. Wang said he thinks the split will “happen, 100 percent.”\n\nMany Core developers agree. Several have said they’d prefer to focus on writing code in the future for only the SegWit chain: currently the largest version of bitcoin at about $64 billion in market value.\n\n“Many developers, users, miners, and businesses have already stated they do not agree with the pointless 2x fork, so we’ll likely end up with three chains,” said Samson Mow, chief strategy officer at Blockstream, which has close associations with Core developers. “Long-term, only the main bitcoin chain which has the support of users and developers can survive.”\n\nThen there’s Bitcoin Cash, which was split off so miners could boost the block size of transactions. It’s more useful as it can be moved more quickly and cheaply than other cryptocurrencies, Ver argued. Some bitcoin exchanges and wallets have said they will support the new coin, while others are uncertain whether Bitcoin Cash will have lasting market value.\n\nRoger Ver Photographer: Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg\n\nAlready, key players are warning investors to brace for more turmoil. Core developers including Peter Todd say the fork this time could be much more tumultuous, and could incur more user confusion of what version can be dubbed the actual “bitcoin.”\n\n“In a sense, a split is 100-percent guaranteed,” said Todd, a key coding contributor to bitcoin. “The split is likely to be more disruptive.”\n\n— With assistance by Kana Nishizawa, Stephen Engle, and Yuji Nakamura', 'Luno, a bitcoin wallet and exchange based out of Singapore, is riding the crypto wave into Europe after it closed a $9 million Series B round for market expansion.\n\nThe funding was led by new investor Balderton Capital, with participation from existing backer Digital Currency Group. South Africa’s AlphaCode — also a new arrival on the cap table — joined the deal which takes Luno, which was formerly called BitX, to $13.8 million raised to date.\n\nMajor league investor Naspers, another that hails from South Africa, led a $4 million investment in June 2015.\n\nThe products these backers are throwing their weight behind include a bitcoin wallet for storing crypto currencies, an exchange for buying them and merchant services that enable banks and retailers to work with bitcoin. In South Africa, in particular, Luno has worked with the likes of Pick N Pay while it was among the first batch let into the FCA’s Regulatory Sandbox in London last year.\n\nLuno said the money will go towards bringing those services to 35 new countries in Europe. The company — which has offices in Singapore, Cape Town and London — plans to double its current headcount of 70 staff to support this new sprint, which takes its services to a total of 40 countries worldwide.\n\n“[The expansion] might sound quite trivial but as you probably know there are not a lot of companies that offer these kind of services in Europe — certainly not in a very mass-market, user-friendly way, and particularly with a really good mobile product coupled with good customer service,” Luno CEO Marcus Swanepoel told TechCrunch.\n\n“As we expand the team and grow in these countries we will be rolling out more deposit methods and country localization that we are already working on,” he added.\n\nBitcoin has been a tear this year, with the cryptocurrency’s value against the U.S. dollar reaching new highs in 2017. It reached $2,000 for the first time in May before surging to $3,000 and then $4,000 in August. Bitcoin touched $5,000 on some exchanges earlier this month before a ban on trading in China, and other market uncertainties saw the price decline to around $4,000 as of today.\n\nDespite that volatility, companies and investors see the potential for the digital currency particularly around cross border transfers and — with the bitcoin blockchain — infrastructure and operational opportunities for the banking industry. Ethereum, the world’s second most popular crypto coin, is also emerging as a platform for developers, beyond helping companies raise money via ICOs.', 'The drive to discover alternate ways for a new company to raise money has birthed many experiments, but none more prominent than the 2017 rise of so-called Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs.\n\nThe decades-old, tried-and-true way for a technology company to raise cash: A company founder sells some of his or her ownership stake in exchange for money from a venture capitalist, who essentially believes that their new ownership will be worth more in the future than is the cash they spent now.\n\nBut over the last year — and especially over the last four months — a new craze has overtaken some influential subsets of the technology industry’s powerbrokers: What if companies had a more democratic, transparent and faster way to fundraise by using digital currency?\n\nSo as the first ICOs surpass the $1 billion marker that typically jettisons a company to some Silicon Valley stardom, let’s explore what is going on.\n\nWhat exactly is an ICO?\n\nAn ICO typically involves selling a new digital currency at a discount — or a “token” — as part of a way for a company to raise money. If that cryptocurrency succeeds and appreciates in value — often based on speculation, just as stocks do in the public market — the investor has made a profit.\n\nUnlike in the stock market, though, the token does “not confer any ownership rights in the tech company, or entitle the owner to any sort of cash flows like dividends,” explained Arthur Hayes of BitMEX, one bitcoin exchange. Buyers can range from established venture capitalists and family offices to less wealthy cryptocurrency zealots.\n\nInvesting in a digital currency is extremely high-risk — more so than traditional startup investing — but is motivated largely by the explosive growth in the value of bitcoins, each of which is now worth around $4,000 at the time of publication. That spike helped introduce both fanatics and professional investors to ICOs.\n\nHow big a deal are ICOs?\n\nWe’ve seen over $2 billion in token sales in about 140 ICOs this year, according to Coinschedule, quieting arguments made by some that ICOs are merely a flash in the pan likely to fade any minute now when a new fad emerges.\n\nIt can feel like ICOs are everywhere — at least a few typically begin every day. Buyers during a presale period might email a seller and personally conduct a transaction. Later on, a purchaser tends to use a website portal, hopefully one that requires an identity check, explained Emma Channing, general counsel at The Argon Group.\n\n“The froth and the attention around ICOs is masking the fact that it’s actually a very hard way to raise money.”\n\n“I don’t think that there’s been an obsession of Silicon Valley that has overtaken seed and angel investing in a single year,” said Channing, who helps companies execute ICOs. She argues: “I don’t think Silicon Valley has ever seen anything quite like ICOs.”\n\nChanning said it is possible that more than $4 billion will be raised through ICOs this year. But she advises that ICOs are typically only successful for the very small number of companies that have “blockchain technology at their heart.” ICOs commonly fail when that’s missing or when the marketing and message are poor, she warned.\n\n“The froth and the attention around ICOs is masking the fact that it’s actually a very hard way to raise money,” Channing said.\n\nWho are its biggest proponents?\n\nA number of more forward-thinking venture capitalists, such as Fred Wilson at Union Square Ventures and Tim Draper at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, have been some of the most vocal believers in ICOs.\n\nDraper earlier this year participated for the first time in an ICO, buying the digital currency Tezos, a rival blockchain platform, in what was a $232 million fundraising round.\n\nWilson has not proclaimed it to be a panacea.\n\n“Contrary to the hype machine working on ICOs right now, they are not simply a funding mechanism. They are about an entirely different business model,” Wilson wrote on his blog this summer. “So, while ICOs represent a new and exciting way to build (and finance) a tech company, and are a legitimate disruptive threat to the venture capital business, they are not something I am nervous about.”\n\nOther leading ICO investors include Chris Dixon at Andreessen Horowitz and entrepreneur and self-described “crypto capitalist” David Sacks.\n\n“Any startup that can ICO will ICO (barring a regulatory intervention),” Sacks tweeted last month.\n\nWhat are its risks?\n\nThere are certainly some losers if and when ICOs win.\n\nOne group, as Wilson knows: Venture capitalists. Much of investors’ power derives from their supposedly superior judgment — they fund projects that are deemed worthwhile, and if the VC industry decides your startup isn’t promising, you’re left with little choice beyond bootstrapping or crowdfunding. ICOs offer another option to founders who are skittish about handing control of their baby over to outsiders driven above all else by financial return.\n\n“Every VC firm is going to have to take a long hard look at the value they bring to the table and how they remain competitive,” said Brian Lio, the head of Smith & Crown, a cryptocurrency research firm. “What do they have other than prestige? What are they offering to these companies that are more advantageous than going to the community?”\n\nBut Lio noted that buyers are also possibly in peril and should be cautious: Risk is higher than buying stock, given the complexity of the system. And it can be difficult to vet an investment or the technology behind it. Other experts have long worried about fraud in this largely unregulated space.\n\nIs the government okay with this?\n\nThat’s TBD.\n\nIn the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission requires private companies to file a disclosure whenever they raise private cash. After largely letting the ICO market develop with no guidance, the SEC this summer warned startups that they could be violating securities laws with the token sales.\n\nHow governments choose to regulate this new type of transaction is one of the big outstanding questions in the field. The IRS has said that virtual currency, in general, is taxable — as long as the currency can be converted to a dollar amount.\n\nSome expect the SEC to begin strictly clamping down on ICOs before the cash is raised. That’s already happened in other countries, most notably China — which this month banned the practice altogether. ICOs, while hosted in a certain country, are not confined to a certain jurisdiction and can be traded anywhere you can connect online.\n\n“Ninety-nine percent of ICOs are a scam, so [China’s pause on ICOs] is needed to filter the crooks out,” tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted this month. “Next phase of ICOs will be real.”', 'When it rains, it pours. Last week, news began to hit the crypto community that China was taking harsh measures to reign in their various cryptocurrency exchanges. Several exchanges closed down and others were given a deadline to properly cease trading operations. This news came hard on the heels of recent directives that banned ICOs in China, leading to dramatic drops in cryptocurreny prices across the board.\n\n\n\nAfter this latest news settled, bitcoin managed to slightly rally before topping out around $4100. However, early this week, rumors began to circulate that executives associated with Chinese exchanges are being prohibited from leaving China. At the time of this article, BTC-USD is sitting just at $3900 and is showing signs of further pullback:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, GDAX, Macro Fibonacci Retracement Values\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows the whole, macro bull run from the $1700s. One important feature of the trend shown above is the 61% retracement down to the $2900s. The retracement down to such a low value shows that sell pressure is very strong in the current market and hints toward bullish exhaustion within the macro trend. Another key feature to note is the following:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, GDAX, Failed 100% Retracement\n\n\n\nAn important test of this rally was the 100% retracement of the bear run, post-China news. Sitting just below the 23% Fibonacci Retracement lies the bear run. The test of the 100% retracement is important because that resistance line marks a strong shift in market sentiment. A failure to break through those values shows that, even though there was a strong rally, the market is still bearish in nature and is likely to continue.\n\nFigure 2 also shows several tests and rejections of the 2-Hour 200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average). The 200 EMA is a common tool used among traders to objectively view the state of the market compared to the prior trends. A trend existing below the 200 EMA is bearish in nature, and trends that show support on top of the 200 EMA are bullish in nature.\n\nAt the time of this article, the BTC-USD is displaying two failed tests of key resistance levels and its showing little sign of upward pressure. Currently, the trend is sandwiched between the 200 EMA and the 50 EMA. Both moving averages can used in conjunction to gauge just how strong the market is. Like the 200 EMA, the 50 EMA shows short-term bullish and bearish trends relative to the EMA line: Trends above are showing bullish traits, and trends below are showing bearish traits.\n\nRight now, we are in the middle of a crucial test of both support and resistance lines as the market decides where it will go next. A break below the 50 EMA will ultimate show the long-term bearish intent of the market and will lead to tests of the low support values:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Hour Candles, GDAX, Support Levels for Current Rally\n\n\n\nAt the moment, BTC-USD is making its third test of the current rally’s 23% retracement values. A break below this line will have bitcoin testing the macro 38% retracement values in the $3700s. If bitcoin manages to break the 38% retracement values somehow, there will be strong support around the $3400s as the 50% macro Fibonacci Retracement values (shown in Figure 1) have historic significance and support.\n\nIf bitcoin is going to see any significant price growth within this rally, it will have to pick up some major buy volume and break through very strong, historic resistance values. It’s extremely unlikely that, given its repeated failures to break resistance and the inherent bearish news looming over the Bitcoin community, BTC-USD will shove to new highs without strongly testing lower macro support.\n\nSummary:', 'Regulatory authorities must establish a framework for managing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, says Pick n Pay.\n\nretailer\n\ncryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin\n\nGroceryPick n Pay is taking a cautious approach to accepting\n\nThis comes after has the retailer moved to accept payment using the cryptocurrency at one of its Cape Town stores. Local payments technology company Electrum said in what is potentially a world first for a major grocery retailer, Electrum has enabled Pick n Pay to accept Bitcoin payments in-store.\n\nResponding to ITWeb questions via e-mail following the development, Richard van Rensburg, deputy CEO of Pick n Pay, said the retailer recently successfully piloted accepting Bitcoin as a tender in one of its stores.\n\n""Our IT team worked closely with tech innovation teams from Electrum and Luno. We designed a process from user registration (FICA), tender acceptance at point of sale to funds authorisation, currency exchange in real-time during the transaction, and instant payment settlement.""\n\nHe pointed out the pilot was limited to the canteen store in Pick n Pay\'s head office for a specific period of time and is no longer active.\n\nThe checkout process is as simple as scanning a QR code using a Bitcoin wallet app on the customer\'s smartphone.\n\n""We don\'t expect that in the near term, accepting Bitcoin will unlock any significant new business and we are unlikely to roll-out the solution until the payments industry and regulatory authorities have established a framework for managing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. We have proved to ourselves, though, that it is technically possible to roll-out a solution very quickly.\n\n""That said, we are very excited about what we have learnt and about what the long-term promise of cryptocurrencies holds for our industry and our customers.""\n\nAccording to Van Rensburg, Pick n Pay undertook this pilot for two reasons. He explained that accepting cryptocurrency holds the promise of being both frictionless and safe, and therefore, has the potential to be a big game-changer for the retail industry.\n\nRichard van Rensburg, deputy CEO of Pick n Pay.\n\n""Our pilot resulted in a transaction that was safe – there is no cash risk and no card fraud risk. The process we designed enabled us to know the identity of the customer because we required the customer to undergo a once-off FICA process to be registered to transact.\n\n""For us, the transaction was frictionless and free. For our customer, the transaction was also frictionless and, while there are no transaction costs for the customer, the process of exchanging Bitcoin was expensive. The cryptocurrency industry has some way to go to create a low-cost currency exchange process.""\n\nHe said cryptocurrencies are still in relative infancy, and it would take some time before they become widely accepted as a form of tender.\n\n""Progress is unlikely to be hampered by technology, but rather by regulatory issues and concerns. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide a cheap and frictionless cashless payment platform in the future, and we believe it is this that will drive their eventual adoption by the industry.""\n\nVan Rensburg added the second reason the retailer conducted the pilot had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, but to prove the opportunity of Pick n Pay\'s value-added services platform.\n\n""We have been working with our partners to build an open interface to our point-of-sale environment for value-added services that will enable third-party providers to bring new services and capabilities to our customers in our stores.\n\n""Accepting Bitcoins at our stores was made possible through the design of this value-added service platform interface. Further examples would include accepting third-party electronic vouchers, issuing event and travel tickets and purchasing virtual products such as airtime and electricity.""\n\nPick n Pay believes building a collaborative, inclusive outlook to working with tech partners will help it bring better innovation to customers.\n\n""We look forward to playing our part in the ongoing discussions and developments with the regulatory authorities, the payments industry and technology partners in the cryptocurrency industry to further develop a potentially valuable platform for the economy going forward,"" Van Rensburg concluded.\n\n\n\nSign up for our FREE newsletters in one easy step Subscribe NOW!

This attack on Bitcoin, as well as fear and speculation around other markets, could spell a good time for investment in gold.\n\nSeen as an insurance policy, gold has been a steady and safe investment for hundreds of years. As markets, beyond even the crypto market, get spooked, investors could see a safety net in the precious metal.\n\nGood time for gold\n\nWhile all the attention over the last few months or so has been solely aimed at digital currencies and their astronomical gains, gold has not been suffering, although many thought it would.\n\nGold recently hit a new high of $1,350, and part of that was a $100 rise seen over three months for the steady commodity. It seems paltry for those who have been spoiled by swings as big as 25 percent in a day by digital currencies, but in its own right, it is a big jump.\n\nEssentially, that jump, and new high, was reason enough for gold to be no longer considered a bear market - and all this while Bitcoin was making its own massive gains.\n\nWhy will gold profit from Bitcoin under fire?\n\nAs Bitcoin was rising, so was gold, but when Bitcoin came under fire from China, and JP Morgan recently, gold profited even more.\n\nGold was always seen as a safe and steady investment; not too much growth, but never really any decline. When sexy cryptocurrencies came along, with their 800 percent gains in less than a year, many put their funds into it.\n\nHowever, in the bad times, and for those investors who are a little more cautious, gold acts as a good insurance policy, as well as a reliable option to diversify with.\n\nAdditionally, it only takes a relatively small number of investors around the world to decide to allocate five to 10 percent of their wealth to gold, to radically improve its valuation.\n\nReal world factors aiding gold’s appeal\n\nIt’s not only Bitcoin that has talk of bubbles and uncertainty around it. The stock market has shown many times it has its propensity to pop, and there is a similar bubble feeling at the moment.\n\nThe US stock market is already too high, and that has to do with a concentration of speculation into a very limited number of stocks in the NASDAQ. Lesser company stocks have already fallen.\n\nThe dollar is also weakening, as it has done since its inception. But, it has its own factors to worry about. None more so than its country’s leader, Donald Trump. Trump, as well as his war of words - so far - for North Korea, is putting a lot of doubt into financial markets, making gold again appear to be the safest and steadiest option.', 'The Australian government has delivered on its longstanding promise to remove the double taxation of transactions involving cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nFor years, digital currency adopters in Australia were taxed twice for transactions, once for the goods and services tax (GST) on the product and again for the GST levied on the digital currency used for the payment.\n\n“If you pay $4 in bitcoin for a coffee, you will pay 40c GST for the coffee, and 40c again for the bitcoin you used to pay for the coffee,” explained Daniel Alexiuc, CEO of Australian bitcoin startup Living Room of Satoshi, speaking to CCN in 2016.\n\nAt the time, the Australian government confirmed it was “committed” to removing the double taxation of digital currencies, in March 2016. A year later, bitcoin was still seen as “intangible” property by the Australian Tax Office with no changes in legislation to put an end to the double taxation. The delay was criticized by Australia’s FinTech community as an “outdated” approach to the taxation of digital currencies by the government. “It’s one of the original priorities we put in the reform paper and one they said yes to,” revealed Danielle Szetho, CEO of industry lobby group and collective FinTech Australia in April this year. “But here we are, 14 months on and still nothing.”\n\nThe following month, digital currencies finally gained that tax cut in this year’s federal budget, as a part of Australia’s wider FinTech-friendly agenda.\n\nNow, the Australian government has – at last – introduced a bill to push the necessary legislation to remove the double taxation of digital currencies. A move described by Australia’s treasurer Scott Morrison as an “action that will further cement Australia’s reputation as a global FinTech centre”.\n\nIn a statement, Morrison wrote:\n\nThe Bill will ensure that Australians are no longer charged GST on purchases of digital currency, allowing it to be treated the same way as physical money for GST purposes. The law change will retrospectively apply from 1 July 2017, in line with the 2017 Budget announcement.\n\nAs such, the bill would need to go through parliament for approval before being mandated as national law. The government’s announcement reveals no details as to when the bill will be brought up to go through the due process. Nonetheless, the local bitcoin industry and the wider digital currency ecosystem is certain to get a boost as digital currency transactions become cheaper and gain parity with fiat money transactions.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
09/20/2017,"['Last week was tumultuous for bitcoin, as Chinese authorities announced plans to ban the cryptocurrency’s trading in the country.\n\nI am not surprised that Chinese authorities are acting to put a lid on bitcoin BTCUSD, +7.87% trading. What is surprising is why more governments, including the U.S., are not doing the same.\n\nThe CEO of the largest bank in the U.S., Jamie Dimon, labeled bitcoin as a fraud last week. Ray Dalio, the head of the world’s largest hedge fund, says the same. These financial titans have the ears of President Donald Trump and Fed Chair Janet Yellen, so if fraud on massive scale is going on, U.S. authorities should act.\n\nBitcoin’s price declined from about $5,000 to a low of around $3,000 last week — as of Monday the cryptocurrency traded around $4,000. In China, bitcoin sold off more sharply on yuan exchanges than it did in U.S. dollar DXY, -0.23% terms is not surprising, as traders may not be able to get their bitcoins out of China before the ban goes into full effect, so there has to be a discount in yuan-denominated bitcoins (See this chart).\n\nI looked at bitcoin several years ago, concluding it was a scam. I even posed the question in one of my weekly commentaries: ""Is bitcoin a bubble or a scam?"" One colleague astutely noted that ""It\'s a scam within a bubble."" That was in early 2014. While bitcoin then crashed from about $1,000 to about $300 in 2014, bitcoin recovered. This year it has run up from about $1,000 six months ago to about $5,000 before its latest tumble.\n\nThe bitcoin sales pitch is to get more people into a finite amount of bitcoins, with a cap expected to be around 21 million bitcoins. There are about 17 million bitcoins now; the algorithm is designed to increase that cap slowly before it is exhausted. (The number of bitcoins increase by ""mining""; for details, see this 2014 primer: ""CNBC Explains: How to mine bitcoins on your own"").\n\nThe sheer absurdity that humans will bid for a line of code on an exchange in ever larger numbers and see its price skyrocket is hardly unprecedented. From tulips in the Netherlands in 1635-37, to South Sea Company stock in Britain in 1720-22, to the Wall Street Crash in 1929 driven by unlimited leverage on the exchange in combination with a financial system credit bubble; the list goes on and on (see these charts).\n\nRead: The biggest investing surprises halfway through September? Not record stock prices\n\nChina’s slam of bitcoin should be viewed through how its own currency, the yuan USDCNY, +0.0015% , correlates to bitcoin. In June the Chinese yuan hit a low of 6.86 to the dollar, while in September amid the bitcoin crackdown the yuan appreciation accelerated, changing hands at one point at 6.44. The bulk of the appreciation in the yuan (fewer yuan per dollar means a stronger yuan) has come in the past three months, just in time for the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China next month (see chart).\n\nThe point is that the Chinese leadership would do anything to keep the Chinese economy going in order to keep power at this important juncture in Chinese history. Messing with the yuan exchange rate, or with bitcoin for that matter, is one of the tools to meet their goals before the October summit.\n\nThe bitcoin ban is a way for China to enforce capital controls\n\nThe bitcoin ban is a way for China to enforce capital controls, given the $1 trillion that has left the country since the summer of 2014. Foreign exchange reserves have stabilized in 2017, and risen by less than $100 billion. The clampdown on outflows, the rebound in the yuan, and the bitcoin ban all comprise multiple steps taken by Chinese authorities to assure smooth sailing at the National Congress.\n\nThe yuan-engineered short squeeze took its first big victim on Sept. 6, when Corriente Advisors threw in the towel after a bearish bet on the yuan resulted in a $240 million loss. Using yuan options, forwards, and most other derivatives unfortunately makes any bear easily detectable by the Chinese authorities, who in some cases directly oversee the financial intermediaries that facilitate those bets in Hong Kong. So, if the Chinese authorities know where the shorts are and what the terms of the derivative contract are, it won\'t be hard to squeeze them with $3 trillion in forex reserves. This is precisely what they may be doing.\n\nTwo years in a row, we experienced huge overnight spikes in the Hongkong Inter-Bank Offer Rate (HIBOR) market, where in one case overnight yuan borrowing costs rose to 66%, while the following year they topped 100%. I have no doubt that the People’s Bank of China engineered those moves in order to squeeze the yuan shorts on multiple fronts. The latest sharp appreciation of the yuan before the October summit is also designed to do damage to yuan bears and to show that the PBOC is in control of the Chinese financial system.\n\nThe PBOC-engineered short squeezes do absolutely nothing to change the dynamic in which the Chinese economy\'s growth rate has slowed dramatically, while borrowing has surged and keep surging. China\'s ""total social financing"" does not include shadow banking leverage, which adds another 100% to the total debt to GDP leverage ratio, making the total close to 400% and still rising (see chart).\n\nWhen I examined this dynamic of rising leverage ratios and a slowing economy, coupled with a stock market crash in 2015, I thought that by 2017 the strain in the financial system would begin to show and the Chinese economy would experience a hard landing. The fact that it has not happened does not mean it won\'t happen. There is no such thing as ""controlling a credit bubble"" after it begins to pop. The Chinese authorities may have slowed this process down, but I doubt they will be able to prevent the hard landing. Watch out in 2018.\n\nIvan Martchev is an investment strategist with institutional money manager Navellier & Associates . The opinions expressed are his own.', 'After a double blow from China, with its ban on ICOs, then news of total exchange bans, not to mention Jamie Dimon’s vitriol against Bitcoin, the digital currency briefly crashed to $3,000 before rapidly soaring back to, and holding, the $4,000 mark.\n\nDigital currency users are finding ways around the Chinese bans, other countries, like Japan and Hong Kong are profiting, and people are exposing Dimon’s ploy, all indicating that Bitcoin is now stronger than a few bumps in the market’s road.\n\nStill as bullish as ever\n\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a Washington-based nonprofit research firm focusing on cryptocurrencies, sees positives in China’s knee jerk reaction. Valkenburgh said:\n\n“The efficacy of any bitcoin ban is pretty dubious. It’s bullish because if a powerful government like China feels the need to ban major trading, then it’s a good indicator that the technology works and that it does what it’s supposed to. If it overcomes those controls, then it’s further proof that it’s independent from government controls, which is pretty radical.”\n\nThese bans and crackdowns may have made things more difficult for Bitcoin users, but hasn’t made them impossible. Those affected by the ban have been utilizing LocalBitcoins and even moving away from the state-controlled messaging app, WeChat.\n\nOn the ICO side, projects can set up companies in countries where regulation on the sector is more lax, like Switzerland and Singapore.\n\nChina is no longer the powerhouse\n\nChina’s share of the broader cryptocurrency market isn’t as high as it once was, so changes in regulation have had less impact than they might have a few years ago. Bitcoin trading against the Chinese currency has dwindled to 19 percent of total volume in the past six months, from about 90 percent last year, according to digital currency data website Bitcoinity.\n\nThe bounce back from these negative hits, in such quick and powerful fashion, indicates that there is not much in terms of real world market pressure that can derail Bitcoin.\n\nThe slump of about 20 percent is actually rather minor if looking at the volatility of the past. Bitcoin has become too big and too entrenched to be sunk by one or two small mishaps along the way.', 'Never miss a great news story!\n\nGet instant notifications from Economic Times\n\nAllowNot now\n\nYou can switch off notifications anytime using browser settings.', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

This news will affect the US dollar and can also influence the cryptocurrencies. These are uncertain times; therefore, we suggest traders cut their position size in half to limit their risk.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nBitcoin has been facing resistance at the $4,100 levels, according to our expectation.\n\nBetween $4,000 and $4,100, there is a confluence of resistance from both the moving averages and the downtrend line. The 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $4,975 to $2,974 is also just below the $4,000 levels. Therefore, we had avoided recommending any trade in our previous analysis.\n\nHowever, after consolidating for three days, if Bitcoin breaks out of this resistance zone, we expect it to gain momentum on the upside. Though there is a minor resistance at $4,210 - the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level - we expect this resistance to be crossed. The next major resistance is at $4,680, after which a retest of the highs is likely.\n\nTherefore, we recommend buying Bitcoin on a breakout above $4,120. However, before initiating long positions, the traders should watch for an hour or two to confirm that the breakout is sustaining.\n\nThe stop loss can be maintained at $3,660 initially. Once the cryptocurrency breaks out of $4,210, the stops can be raised to $3,800. Traders should similarly trail their stops higher to reduce their risk. Partial profits can be booked at $4,600 levels. Remaining positions can be sold closer to $5,000 levels.\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to breakout of the overhead resistance, it will retrace the recent bounce from the lows and is likely to fall to $3,500 levels.\n\nETH/USD\n\nEthereum also performed according to our expectations. It is facing stiff resistance from both the moving averages and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $409.42 to $200.15.\n\nA breakout of the resistance zone of $275 to $310 will indicate strength. Therefore, traders can buy above $312 and keep a stop loss of $250. There is a minor resistance zone between $329 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level) and $344. If the digital currency struggles to breakout of these levels, traders should raise their stops to breakeven. However, if these levels are crossed, a move to $409 is likely.\n\nOn the other hand, if the digital currency is unable to breakout of the overhead resistance, it can fall to $240 levels, which is a significant support.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nBitcoin Cash has been hovering around the $500 mark for the past two days.\n\nIt has been facing resistance from the downtrend line. However, a breakout and close above the downtrend line can propel the digital currency towards the $700 levels.\n\nTherefore, the traders can initiate long positions at $550 and keep a stop loss at $400.\n\nIf, however, the cryptocurrency returns from the downtrend line, it can fall to $400 levels.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nRipple has not been able to breakout of the critical overhead resistance of $0.19300.\n\nThe digital currency remains bearish until it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle. It has support at $0.15000 and $0.13500 levels.\n\nNotwithstanding, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the downtrend line, it will indicate a change in trend. Failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign. However, we don’t find any buy setups. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on Ripple.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nLitecoin is facing resistance at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $93.649 to $32.681.\n\nThe cryptocurrency will change its trend only on a breakout above the downtrend line and the overhead resistance at $60. Until the digital currency trades below these levels, it remains weak.\n\nWe don’t find any reliable buy setups on Litecoin thus we remain neutral on it.', 'As the founder and head of Bridgewater, the world’s largest hedge fund with 350 institutional clients, Ray Dalio knows a thing or two about the traditional investment business.\n\nImage: MarketWatch\n\nHe has certainly spotted and steered his firm around traditional asset bubbles in the past. But does he know how to spot crypto asset bubbles? That is yet to be seen.\n\nRecently, Dalio joined his friend and fellow billionaire finance mogul Jamie Dimon in calling Bitcoin a bubble. He states that Bitcoin is “not an effective storehold of wealth because it has volatility to it, unlike gold.”\n\n“Bitcoin is a highly speculative market. Bitcoin is a bubble.""\n\nThere are several reasons why Mr. Dalio doesn’t believe in the potential of Bitcoin and other cryptos at large. According to Bridgewater criteria, there are two important facets to being considered as a valid currency. The first is that it must serve as a medium of exchange and the second is that it must be a store of wealth.\n\nDalio goes on to say:\n\n“It\'s a shame, it could be a currency. It could work conceptually, but the amount of speculation that is going on and the lack of transactions [hurts it].”\n\nAccording to him, the action and resulting exuberance in cryptocurrencies has “very much” been driven by people simply thinking that they can sell it at a higher price, without any understanding of fundamentals, “so it’s a bubble.”\n\nDalio isn’t the only big shot finance CEO with a negative stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Last week, JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon took a shot at Bitcoin saying “it is a fraud.”\n\nOnly time will tell if the two financiers are right in their predictions about cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. Dalio’s comments seem not to have spooked markets as much as Dimon’s. Market’s dropped rapidly last week in the wake of negative news from China and Dimon’s commentary.', 'Let\'s say the bitcoin bubble has just burst.\n\nFrom its peak of $4,921 earlier this month, the digital currency is already down 16 percent at $4,076. Over the next two months, imagine it continues to slump to barely more than half its peak valuation. After a brief recovery, the price slides again, until by the start of 2020 it\'s dropped by another third, to below $2,000. For 20 years it then languishes around that point, never to recover its September 2017 levels in inflation-adjusted terms.\n\nA Vision of the Future If bitcoin follows the path of gold after its January 1980 peak, the future would look like this Source: Bloomberg\n\nDoes that vision of the future show that digital currencies have no place in an investment portfolio, or that they do? The answer is worth pondering, because that\'s the trajectory gold followed after its peak in January 1980.\n\nFull disclosure: I don\'t, and wouldn\'t, invest in either gold or bitcoin. Still, as someone once said, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent -- and trying to shake other investors out of their unreason is as pointless as fighting the tide. Rather than asking whether digital currencies make sense philosophically, we should be asking whether they stack up as investments.\n\nAs Gadfly argued last week, with a conventional market in digital-currency-settled derivatives emerging, the best argument for owning those currencies is the same as the best one for owning gold: Their potential to have negative beta, to rise when stocks fall and vice versa. If a negative correlation to equities can offset periods of underperformance in shares, they can go a long way to improving returns.\n\nSuppose you bought a basket of digital currencies, and held them alongside gold as the negative-beta slice of an investment portfolio, valued at no more than (say) 3 percent of the total. Would that make sense?\n\nIf all digital currencies are going to be worth zero in five years, clearly not.\n\nThat\'s the argument made by those who say cryptocurrencies don\'t have any ""fundamental value."" Gold is genuinely useful in niche medical and electronic applications, and it\'s been coveted aesthetically since the dawn of civilization. Central bank bullion holdings are another 31,500 metric tons of proof that the yellow metal is more than just a fad.\n\nWhat\'s supporting a floor price for digital currencies, though?\n\nOne answer to that question was given by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon in his anti-bitcoin spray last week:\n\nIf you were in Venezuela or Ecuador or North Korea or a bunch of parts like that, or if you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than U.S. dollars ... So there may be a market for that, but it’d be a limited market.\n\nNot that limited, though. As demonstrated by the popularity of bitcoin in China, people living in countries with closed capital accounts show a great deal of interest in moving funds outside of official exchange controls. About 40 percent of the world\'s population and 20 percent of its gross domestic product are in such jurisdictions.\n\nHidden Value The rarely glimpsed 500-euro note still accounts for about a fifth of the value of euros in circulation Source: European Central Bank\n\nOther gray segments of the global economy suggest further sources of demand for anonymous transactions, as Bloomberg View\'s Aaron Brown argued this week.\n\nMore than $12 trillion is stashed in tax havens, according to the Tax Justice Network, an advocacy group. The trade in illicit drugs may be worth $320 billion, or close to 1 percent of global GDP. The 500-euro banknote, which most Europeans have never seen but is popular with criminals, still accounts for more than one-fifth of the value of euro notes in circulation, more than a year after the European Central Bank stopped printing it. Yes, digital currencies can be used to launder the proceeds of crime -- but so can JPMorgan.\n\nPossible value of illicit drugs trade $320 billion\n\nWhile this may seem unsavory, it cuts against the argument that demand for digital currencies can just go back to where it was in 2007, absent coordinated government crackdowns of the sort we\'ve never seen.\n\nCoefficiency Dividend Gold and treasuries both add negative beta to a stock-based portfolio; bitcoin, not so much Source: Bloomberg, Gadfly calculations\n\nThe stronger argument against digital currencies is not that they\'re going to zero -- it\'s that they don\'t make a good hedge at all. Since 2010, gold and Treasury bonds have a negative correlation with the S&P 500; bitcoin, on the other hand, has a positive relationship, multiple regression analysis done by Gadfly shows. In addition, bitcoin moves so radically that you can\'t even construct a meaningful long-short strategy with your equity portfolio.\n\nIf you believe the bluster of bitcoin bugs, they\'re putting their money in code because they think the fiat-money economy is on the verge of collapse. Their revealed preference, though, is to punt on bitcoin whenever rising stock markets lift their risk appetite, and vice versa.\n\nIn principle, the biggest advantage of digital currencies is they have no connection to anything that\'s happening in the real economy. In reality, the two are intimately connected through that most powerful of conductors, investor sentiment. Only if that changes will virtual money really be able to bite off part of gold\'s domain.\n\n-- With assistance from Shuli Ren\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.', 'Every time there is a crash in cryptocurrencies, the alarm bells ring out and panic often ensues. People predict the end, see the bubble popping and sell off for a loss.\n\nHowever, there is another way to look at it, and that is to see a significant drop as a buying opportunity and a chance to profit.\n\nHow to profit\n\nThere are a few ways to try and cash in on a sharp fall in price of cryptocurrencies. Some are more effective than others, and some more suitable for different types of crashes or currencies. It is up to the investor to decide.\n\nThere are five methods described below that can help turn a sickening crash into a chance to make more money than before.\n\nA lot of these methods are well known, and almost cliched, but the real difficulty is not simply knowing them, it is being brave enough to enact them in the face of a collapsing market.\n\nBuy the dip\n\nWith Bitcoin’s path on a constant upward trajectory, buying the dip is one of the easiest ways to make compelling gains. However, it is not always easy to pull off as it requires timing the market.\n\nYazan Barghouti, project lead at Blockchain company Jibrel Networks, emphasized:\n\n“Buying a dip in a crash can be difficult, because when do you know it has bottomed out?""\n\nPetar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged digital currency platform Whaleclub, also spoke to the caveats surrounding this particular strategy:\n\n""Buying the dip only works in a general bull market. If the global trend reverses, buying the dip is useless.""\n\nPinpoint strong opportunities\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency markets seem to be intrinsically linked, and will broadly be in a bull or bear mode, there are still opportunities to be made on certain strong coins through the market.\n\nVinny Lingham, CEO of Civic, suggested that investors ""find quality coins with teams you can trust to execute and weather the storm"" and then hold.\n\nIn trying to identify these opportunities, one must identify coins with a solid foundation and a compelling business model.\n\nHodl\n\nA byword when it comes to cryptocurrencies, holding on through the bad times is the most basic and respected strategy. If you do not sell your coins when they are below what they were bought for, you have not made a loss.\n\nThis equates to buying digital coins and simply holding onto them through thick and thin. It is one of the most basic strategy for dealing with a crash - do nothing.\n\nAdditional advice offered by Zivkovski is to make sure you are holding the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap as they probably have the best foundation and ability to beat the crash.\n\nSelling to fiat\n\nA somewhat controversial strategy, and one that flies in the face of holding is exiting to fiat currencies.\n\nCrypto asset managers are notorious for doing this when there is a crash. However, it is difficult as it again requires timing the market both on exit, and then again on reentrance. Marshall Swatt, founder and CTO of Coinsetter, said:\n\n""Exiting to fiat requires that you be able to time the market, both when you exit and again when you return. The smartest strategy is to allocate money you can afford to put at risk, and then stick with your plan regardless of the variations in the market.""\n\nShorting Bitcoin\n\nThis is a tool used mostly by traders, and it is one that if executed correctly offers huge returns.\n\nA few popular exchanges do offer this as an option, but it takes a lot of skill and experience to get this right. Shorting an asset involves borrowing it from somebody else, selling it, and then buying it back later to return to the person you borrowed from. If the price drops, you’ll make a fortune. If the price rises, you could lose everything.\n\nKnow your abilities\n\nThe strategy you use should be based on your skill level and your comfort with risk. If you don’t want to take any chance of losing your digital currency, then holding is probably best. If you don’t mind being in fiat for awhile (possibly forever), then you can sell at highs and try to rebuy lower. If you’re a high flying and experienced trading, short selling might work for you. Use whatever strategies you are most comfortable with, and always know your investing goals.', 'Peregrine Treasury Solutions, a treasury management company, says that cryptocurrencies should not be seen as a store of value, but rather only as a means of exchange.\n\nThe financial services company noted that money generally serves three purposes: it acts as a store of value, it can be used to measure economic value and it can be used as a medium of exchange.\n\n“This means that it can be stored or kept for use at a later stage; that it gives an indication of the value of something (i.e. its price); and that it can be used to acquire goods and services,” said Bianca Botes, corporate treasury management at Peregrine.\n\n“Fiat money is a currency that has no intrinsic value (unlike gold) and which has been established by law as money. Fiat money is created by governments for use in each country or group of countries.”\n\nSo how do cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, fit into this concept of money?\n\n“Anyone can buy these currencies and many people are doing so, often for speculative purposes in the hope that they will be able to sell the currency at a profit. But in our view, cryptocurrencies should not be seen as a store of value, but rather only as a means of exchange,” Botes said.\n\nPeregrine pointed to recent high profile negative press regarding such currencies, giving rise to considerable volatility, emphasising exactly that: the currencies do not necessarily retain their value.\n\nChina has banned the trade of cryptocurrencies, while JP Morgan Chase has denounced the trade of them with comments that all traders caught trading them will be fired – which sets a vulnerable landscape for all cryptocurrencies, Botes said.\n\n“The next few months should be interesting as these actions of big financial institutions and country regulation will set a precedent for the trend of the cryptocurrency,” she said.\n\nIf you have bought cryptocurrency, what should you do now and should you hedge your exposure?\n\n“If you are in a position to actively trade the currency in the short term there certainly will be profits to be made. However, it should not be seen as a wealth accumulating asset such as equities that are typically kept for longer periods and which may generate a return in the form of dividends,” Botes said.\n\nTo hedge exposure to anything, you need to establish a correlation between that asset and other assets.\n\n“In the case of cryptocurrencies, this is unrealistic as they do not seem to behave in accordance with financial instruments and they do not respond to conventional market sentiment, environment or theories,” the analyst said.\n\nPeregrine said that the least complicated and ‘safest’ way to mitigate the risk of selling your cryptocurrency for less than you paid for it is to hedge for fiat money, such as securing a firm US dollar price per Bitcoin in the forward or derivative market.\n\n“Options, for instance, will give you the opportunity to hedge your risk, but not be forced to sell the cryptocurrency should the cryptocurrency market move in your favour,” Botes said.\n\n“For those who are, firstly, open to a bit more complexity and, secondly, understand cryptocurrency, there are various crypto derivative platforms where you can trade derivatives engineered for the crypto market such as Bitserve, Hedgy or Coinapult.\n\n“I would, however, suggest you research crypto and the hedging of it extensively before participating in this,” Botes said.\n\nThe analyst said that hedging market for crypto still has a long way to go, but the viability and sustainability of these “new age exchanges” and hedging solutions will be largely dependent on the legislation making its way to market.\n\nRead: ‘I would fire any employee trading Bitcoin for being stupid’: JPMorgan Chase CEO', 'Not that anyone would have experienced this phenomenon, on account of the Pirate Bay website being for committing illegal acts, but all the same, it appears that The Pirate Bay has been hijacking the CPUs of site visitors to dig for Bitcoin, according to Coin Telegraph.\n\nThe illicit website has accepted Bitcoins as donations since April of 2013, but like many sites that conduct business based on people not paying a dime, The Pirate Bay has been struggling to find a steady stream of income to keep their ship afloat.\n\nUsers visiting the site (probably to download Darkwood) experienced sharp spikes in CPU usage, causing a bit of alarm. Users soon found out that some software hosted on the site was using the hardware of their computers to mine for cryptocurrency. For a more detailed rundown of how Bitcoin mining, check out Forbes. Though mining crypto currency may solve some of The Pirate Bay’s cash flow problems in the short term, the world’s most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has already been banned in two major Chinese markets. This move has not only made Bitcoin less valuable; it is also more unstable than ever.\n\nIn an official statement, The Pirate Bay has stated that this was a 24-hour test and not indicative of regular practices for the foreseeable future.\n\nUltimately the question at hand here is how much of a right you have to your computer hardware. If you bought the machine, should you dictate how the hardware is used, or are visitors beholden to the will of the site that they are visiting so long as no harm is done and no identifying information is collected? What kind of privacy risk might this sort of software pose?\n\nIf other websites start implementing similar Javascript cryptocurrency mining software that takes over privately owned hardware, how might this invite online regulations from governmental bodies?

Debates are raging everywhere, and on a global scale – on television, print media and even WhatsApp chat groups. But the one fundamental question that always comes up is ""Should we buy ah?""\n\nSo what is Bitcoin? Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies (crypto) such as Ethereum, Ripple, NEM, Litecoin, Dash, Zcash and hundreds more, are basically a form of digital currency where encryption techniques are used to regulate the production and verification of transfers of such units.\n\nCryptos presently have a market capitalisation of US$100bil (RM419.36bil) and have grown at a mind-boggling rate of over 1,000% in the past 12 months. To put things in perspective, cryptos are now cumulatively worth slightly more than Bank Negara Malaysia\'s foreign reserves of US$98bil (RM411bil). Crypto advocates are quick to point out that the staggering growth in price and trading volume vindicates their long-held belief that this is indeed a currency for the digital age.

The goal was to build a decentralised currency, or electronic cash, that could be sent anywhere around the globe in minutes.\n\nThe digital coin is by nature scarce as it has to be ""mined"". The ""mining"" process, in a nutshell, involves solving complex mathematical algorithms that secure and verify transactions taking place over the network globally. These are in turn continuously updated to a ledger – called the blockchain – which logs all Bitcoin transactions worldwide, and is available to the computer of anyone running the mining software.\n\nThe beauty of cryptos is that they are not owned by any government or central bank, and as such is supposedly ""safer"" as it is free from government influence.\n\nIf a currency is defined as a ""stored value"", then by definition Bitcoin fits the bill! But I would argue that for it to truly be a currency, it must also be easily convertible to everyday goods that people can consume, otherwise there would be no point to owning it! At present, only three online merchants accept Bitcoin payments, and a few countries have allowed Bitcoin ATMs.\n\nI am more inclined to compare Bitcoin to gold, an investment asset that people have grown to appreciate over thousands of years to store value, and was the everyday currency in use prior to paper notes. The similarities are remarkable – gold is also scarce and requires a complicated mining process, can be transferred from one party to another and has an almost religious following.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has one overwhelming advantage over physical gold – the ease in which ownership can be transferred, and this ownership (though anonymous) is tracked by blockchain technology. One could argue that Bitcoin is the gold of the digital age and the world is experiencing the modern-day equivalent of a gold rush!\n\nWarren Buffet was once quoted as saying that aliens looking down on earth would probably scratch their heads in disbelief when they see humanity\'s obsession with gold. He described it as essentially a yellow sparkly metal that ""has no utility"". We spend millions digging it up, turning it into bricks, then we bury it in some vault somewhere! We can\'t eat gold, it doesn\'t yield income – but at least we can wear it! Which leads me to conclude that perhaps Bitcoin, and its crypto cousins like Ethereum and so forth, are the digital jewellery of the 21st century!\n\nI, for one, do not accept Bitcoin as legal currency. When a central bank like the United States\' Federal Reserve System prints money, I know that the issuer or counter-party is the richest and most powerful country in the world, backed by trillions in GDP per annum, and the value of the currency is based on economic fundamentals of the country. In Bitcoin\'s case, it is issued by anonymous miners and its value is determined by who is willing to buy it next – hopefully at a higher price!\n\nIt is obvious that buyers of these digital currencies are typically involved in illicit activities and do not want their identity or source of funds revealed. The second group of buyers driving the crypto market are investors who have contracted a very common epidemic that spreads throughout the financial world from time to time, called FOLO (fear of losing out), or literally in Malaysia its ""FOLO je lah""!\n\nFor me to consider Bitcoin as a valid currency, it would need to be issued and regulated by a politically agnostic financial institution such as the Bank of International Settlements (close enough!), and accepted as legal tender in all countries. Until that day, I prefer to continue living as an alien among humans!\n\nMany have asked me where the price of Bitcoin will go. The honest answer is that I have no idea! It is impossible to predict as you never know how long this ""epidemic"" will last, or how long the ""invisible hand"" will continue supporting this market.\n\nThe recent dramatic movement of Bitcoin\'s price from US$2,800 (RM11,740, pre-split/fork) to US$4,800 (RM20,125) then a drop to US$3,000 (RM12,580) in a matter of days, only to rebound to US$3,700 (RM15,510) in the same day underlines the madness of this market. My gut feeling is that this is similar to a ""dead cat bounce"" situation like how a cat would bounce up after it has just been run over by a car. If the crypto bulls can continue pushing it through its previous highs, then the rally will continue in the short-term. However, it is more likely that other countries will follow China\'s lead in banning initial coin offerings (ICO) and Bitcoin trading on exchanges, or at the very least introduce some regulation which will restrict the air going into this already-inflated balloon. If the United States follows suit in introducing legislation or requiring the identities of token holders be known, a 50% fall in the price of Bitcoin and/or its crypto cousins is not hard to imagine.\n\nMeanwhile, I recommend that my friends bitten by the currency bug to buy the US Dollar. Its recent weakness against major currencies presents a terrific buying opportunity for this the most recognised and globally accepted form of legal tender today.\n\nWan Hazreek Hussain Yusuf is the founder and managing director of the Dara Group of companies as well as an investor.']"
09/21/2017,"[""The rebound in the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate appears to be stalling out.\n\nAfter rising from a recent low of $2,980 earlier this week, bitcoin is again trading below $4,000, a development that raises doubts as to whether the rally will continue. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency was trading at $3,850 at press time – down 1.68 percent in the last 24 hours.\n\nWeek-on-week, BTC is up 19 percent. On a monthly basis, BTC is down 3.7 percent.\n\nHowever, assumptions that China's crypto trading crackdown will not have a long-term impact seem to have waned. This is evident from the price action analysis, which points to bullish exhaustion around $4,000 and a lack of substance in the rally from $2,980.\n\nThis runs counter to the response to a knee-jerk sell-off in bitcoin earlier this week, when, following China's crackdown on cryptocurrency trading, the market quickly saw steep gains.\n\nBuilding on that momentum, on September 15, bitcoin staged a solid rebound from the 100-day moving average levels in the wake of an oversold relative strength index.\n\nBut while a similar price action in July had yielded a record rally to $5,000 levels, September may be unlikely to offer a case of history repeated.\n\nATR signals lack of buying pressure\n\nDaily Chart\n\nThe chart reveals a descending broadening wedge formation – a megaphone-shaped pattern with lower peaks and lower valleys. The breakout direction is upward more than 70 percent of the time.\n\nHowever, in the bitcoin's case, the odds of an upside breakout look weak, if the lack of buying pressure/lack of substance as shown by the average true range (ATR) indicator is taken into account.\n\nATR is a volatility indicator that reveals the degree of interest or disinterest in a move. A bullish reversal with an increase in ATR shows strong buying pressure/high interest and adds credence to the reversal.\n\nBitcoin's reversal from $2,908 has been accompanied by a drop in the ATR, however, which indicates lack of enthusiasm in the move.\n\nView\n\nATR shows bitcoin's recovery from the low of $2,908 was the result of the unwinding of the shorts.\n\nLack of strong buying pressure and a failure to hold above the 50-day moving average indicates the cryptocurrency is likely to leave a lower high around $4,000 and drop to the 100-day moving average level of $3,252.\n\nOnly an upside break of the descending broadening wedge pattern would boost the odds of bitcoin rallying to record high above $5,000.\n\nBurned match image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Well, it turns out that the JPMorgan chief executive could have been flouting European market abuse laws by shooting his mouth off. At least, that’s what one complaint to the Swedish financial regulator alleges.\n\nThe complaint was lodged by Florian Schweitzer, the managing partner of a London firm called Blockswater, a bitcoin market-maker that trades about $25 million a month. At issue is an alleged link between Dimon’s comments and, a few days later, JPMorgan emerging as one of the most active buyers of a bitcoin tracker fund called Bitcoin XBT. Bitcoin XBT is an exchange-traded note that’s listed on Nasdaq Nordic in Stockholm. It effectively lets clients hold bitcoin without worrying about how to store it securely.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell as much as 24% between the day Dimon verbally thrashed it and the day of the XBT trades. Widely followed finance blog Zero Hedge seized on this and accused JP Morgan of either buying bitcoin on the cheap for itself, or helping its clients do so.\n\nBut before we get carried away with notions of Dimon playing the media to pick up bitcoin on the cheap, there’s a less nefarious reason for the XBT trade: JPMorgan told Reuters that it was just acting as a broker for clients who wanted to buy into the fund. “They are not JPMorgan orders,” a JPMorgan spokesperson told Reuters. “These are clients purchasing third-party products directly.”\n\nIn any case, Schweitzer has presented the facts to the Swedish regulator and asked them to investigate. He notes in his complaint that market abuse in Sweden is punishable by up to two years in jail. The Swedish regulator said it does not comment “if we are looking into matters like this or not.” We’ve contacted JPMorgan but have not heard back.', 'Bitcoin has become so successful that the way it operates needs upgrading, and fast. Trouble is, there are opposing views on how to do that and no all-powerful administrative body to determine which method to adopt. After all, part of bitcoin’s allure is its lack of central oversight. The arguments between the different camps transcend the purely technical to encompass philosophy and politics, raising the prospect of the cryptocurrency splitting into different offshoots. After splitting once already in August, another test awaits in November.\n\n1. What’s the problem with bitcoin?\n\n\n\nIt was built with security more in mind than the kind of volume its success has brought. To prevent counterfeiting, bitcoin transactions are verified by so-called bitcoin miners in batches called blocks. The blocks are then strung together to form the decentralized open ledger known as the blockchain that’s one of the currency’s biggest selling points. Worries about cyberattacks led the system’s designers to cap the size of blocks at 1 megabyte. But as bitcoin grew in popularity over the past nine years, transaction times and processing fees soared to record levels.\n\n2. How big is the issue?\n\nThe average time to confirm a bitcoin deal ballooned from under 20 minutes to six hours at one point this year, according to blockchain.info. The backlog of transactions rose to a record, pushing up fees as bitcoin holders offered miners increasing amounts to deal with their transactions sooner. In recent weeks, the congestion (and fees) have lightened significantly as some users have steered clear of the traffic jam.\n\n3. Who are the opposing sides?\n\nAs bitcoin is open-source software, anyone can put forward proposals for tweaks. Two main camps have emerged. One is made up of bitcoin miners, the thousands of individuals who form a vital part of the blockchain process by deploying their powerful (and expensive) computers to verify transactions. They support increasing the number of bitcoin transactions in each block. The other represents the so-called Core developers who have been instrumental in constructing bitcoin’s bug-proof system. Their proposal: Allow some data to be moved outside the main network, in effect creating multiple ledgers called sidechains. Without a compromise, two versions of bitcoin’s blockchain would probably come into existence -- effectively splitting the cryptocurrency.\n\n4. What happened with the first split?\n\nIn late July, a small group of miners began backing an offshoot with block sizes of 8 megabytes. It’s called Bitcoin Cash. On Aug. 1, they successfully deployed their version of bitcoin’s software, triggering the split. The price of bitcoin hardly moved, perhaps because Bitcoin Cash initially had little support from miners. Even so, its market value soared to $7.3 billion the next day, one-sixth of bitcoin’s.\n\n5. Why is bitcoin not out of the woods?\n\nIn July, the broader community compromised with a proposal called SegWit2x -- a combination of the Core developers’ suggestion (called SegWit, for Segregated Witness) and the majority of miners’ proposal. The first step of SegWit2x has been locked in and bitcoin’s network adopted SegWit technology. In November, bitcoin will face its next big challenge when some of the world’s biggest miners move to adopt phase two, the doubling of the size of the block. That could lead to bitter disagreements.\n\n6. What’s that argument about?\n\nSome developers argue that increasing block sizes will leave too much power in too few hands, since the technology required will get more expensive. Some miners have embraced Bitcoin Cash instead and see the SegWit2x proposal as an unnecessary and unloved alternative. Because of the way SegWit2x is designed, the software will activate even if just 1 percent of the community supports it, which would lead to a split again. To avoid such a schism, more than 92 percent of computing power on bitcoin needs to rally behind the proposal, which is looking less likely, according to key players.\n\n7. Would such a split be more dramatic?\n\nIndeed. Greater volatility would probably ensue as more members of the community side with one approach other other. Users could be confused about what would be considered the legitimate bitcoin legacy. Capital and resources could become even more scattered before a winner emerges.\n\n8. Why are some people upset about the splits?\n\nMiners and Core developers need each other to function -- and prosper. Research analyst Ronnie Moas sees bitcoin’s scarcity and acceptance by investors doubling its value to $5,000 by next year, then surging to as much as $50,000 in the next decade, albeit he didn’t specify which offshoot he was referring to. The splits could cause newcomers to become confused about what offshoot can be deemed as ""bitcoin,"" effectively diminishing some of its first comer’s advantage. As the oldest cryptocurrency, bitcoin is facing competition from other alternatives and protocols that vow to displace it.\n\n9. What does ideology have to do with it?\n\nCreated in 2009 by a person or a group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin initially attracted an array of figures including libertarians who wished to counter the control of sovereign regulators and central banks. One attraction is that, in contrast to limitless printed currencies, there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins. And as bitcoin’s market value has surged, peaking at more than $75 billion, the debate has intensified over whether it should embrace more mainstream capitalism or fortify its position as a libertarian beacon. More practically, the debate has revolved around whether bitcoin should become like gold and other assets that store value, or whether the community should focus on developing it as a payment system and platform for economic activity.\n\nThe Reference Shelf\n\nBloomberg View’s Aaron R.

Bitcoin graphs show that the market withstood this test with forbearance. Even in the absence of positive news, there was a rapid price reversal from key support levels. Everything has gone smoothly this week, and buyers and sellers are now analyzing the situation. Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) gives a bit of positivity to the market as it is considering the possibility of surveying ICOs in Japan. The FSA has played a pivotal role in drawing up rules regarding cryptocurrencies in Japan, despite the fact that the country has officially classified Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nBitcoin hit a very strong support level at $3,000, and any attempts by sellers to move in this direction now can be regarded as an opportunity to make a good purchase.\n\nResistance at the $4,000 level has been tested, and we are very likely to see a breakthrough attempt to reach $4,400.\n\nGetting out of the $3,000 to $5,000 range is important for the bulls. A new surge in sales may result from remaining at the same levels for a long time. This can lead to the price quickly getting back to $3,500.\n\nETH/USD 21.09.2017\n\nEthereum has not stayed long at the local minimums it had reached either.\n\nThe support zone at about $280 has confirmed its significance again, as the price has quickly regained those levels. If it drops below $280 again and remains there long enough, it will mean that a return to the maximum levels is not to be expected anytime soon.\n\nThe following resistance level is around $340, and it matters for the whole market that the altcoins leader shows confidence in the future. In case there’s no negative news, this scenario is most likely to take place.\n\nWe see a growing number of successful ICOs on the Ethereum platform. For example, ICON, a Korean-based project, raised 150,000 ETH in less than six hours.\n\nLTC/USD 21.09.2017\n\nLitecoin reacted quite dramatic to all the news from China last week. This is due because the cryptocurrency is really popular among Chinese investors.', 'Bitcoin is a relatively new currency, but that doesn\'t mean investors are safe from old school fraud.\n\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Thursday that it\'s suing a New York man and his company over an alleged bitcoin Ponzi scheme. It\'s the agency\'s first fraud suit involving bitcoin.\n\nThe CFTC, an independent agency that monitors U.S. derivatives markets, claims that Nicholas Gelfman of Brooklyn, New York and his fund Gelfman Blueprint, Inc., which primarily invests in bitcoin, ""fraudulently solicited more than $600,000 from approximately 80 persons.""\n\nGelfman, the CEO and head trader at Gelfman Blueprint, is said to have told investors that he ran a fund that ""employed a high-frequency, algorithmic trading strategy."" But the whole strategy was ""fake,"" according to the CFTC.\n\nRelated: China\'s bitcoin crackdown wreaks havoc on the virtual currency\n\n""The purported performance reports were false, and -- as in all Ponzi schemes -- payouts of supposed profits ... actuality consisted of other customers\' misappropriated funds,"" the CFTC said in a statement.\n\nThe agency further claims that Gelfman staged a computer hack in order to conceal the whole plot.\n\nIn the complaint, federal prosecutors say that investors ended up losing ""most if not all of their invested funds.\n\n""The Defendants here preyed on customers interested in virtual currency, promising them the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin when in reality they only bought into the Defendants\' Ponzi scheme,"" James McDonald, the CFTC\'s director of enforcement, said in a statement.\n\nGelfman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe enforcement action comes as China begins a crackdown on bitcoin that shut down two of the country\'s most prominent bitcoin exchanges.\n\nAccording to some reports, officials are preparing even more drastic steps due to concerns the currency is being used for money laundering.', 'Bitcoin\'s value has experienced a rollercoaster ride this month.\n\nEarlier in September, Bitcoin peaked at $5,000. Then the cryptocurrency tumbled after news came from China that it would shut down cryptocurrency exchanges. And when JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon\'s declared Bitcoin a ""fraud,"" the cryptocurrency\'s valuation dropped down further.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin price has recovered to around $3,800. The question is will Bitcoin rise to $5,000 by the end of this year? Josh McIver, founder and CEO ULedger, believes Bitcoin will reach higher levels.\n\n""Bitcoin is a relatively resilient system."" said McIver.\n\nHowever, we can expect further highs and lows.\n\n""Any technical trader can see strong support for Bitcoin at the $3,000 and $4,000 levels,"" said Alex Mashinksy, the CEO of Celsius. ""While the price may go up and down in the short term, we predict that in a years time baring any catastrophic news the price should test the $5,000 resistance levels again.""\n\nAre you investing in cryptocurrency? Don\'t miss TheStreet\'s coverage:\n\nGlobal crypto movement increasing\n\nMashinksy explains that since so many new people around the world are ""converted"" as believers in the cryptocurrency movement and it\'s very hard and expensive to short Bitcoin and Ether, there is more money trying to get in than out.\n\n""This means long term the price is going up and not down,"" he said. ""One of the clear and most direct barometers for this demand is the premium to asset values that GBTC [Bitcoin Investment Trust] is trading at. When BTC got over $5,000, it was trading at over 100% premium ,which means people preferred buying an OTC share which only trades a few hours five days a week vs, the coin itself mwhich trades 24/7 and paying 100% premium for it.""\n\nYonatan Sela, senior vice president of business development at YouNow, also believes Bitcoin will rise to $5,000 again.\n\n""If you buy into the thesis that Bitcoin would become the prominent digital reserve currency, you got to believe it will [reach $5,000],"" he said. ""The main reserve currency in the world is gold, with a market cap of $7 trillion. Bitcoin is currently at $66 billion, which is less than 1% of that. Even if it stays at just 2% of gold, it will surpass the $5,000 price point.""\n\nThere is still some hesitation in the industry as to whether Bitcoin will become mainstream. One commentator warns making price action is misguided.\n\n""I think making near term predictions about price action is a fool\'s errand,"" said Zachary Karabell the head of global strategies at Envestnet. ""Either Bitcoin will establish itself as a long-term viable alternate means of exchange or it won\'t. If it does, it will be worth considerably more over time; if not, it could be worth zero.""\n\nWill we see Bitcoin lose marketshare to other cryptocurrencies?\n\nOf course, Bitcoin isn\'t the only player in the cryptocurrency game, but it still looks to be able to weather any intermittent sell-offs.\n\n""Bitcoin will likely continue to lose market share to other cryptocurrencies--it\'s now 50% of total crypto market cap value, down from 85% earlier this year,"" said Sol Lederer, blockchain lead at LOOMIA. ""But the cryptomarket overall is showing resilience to negative news -- for example, to China -- so will likely continue to grow.""\n\nLederer adds we can then expect Bitcoin to pass $5,000 again next year now.\n\nAnd, of course, Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee thinks Bitcoin will rise even higher. Considering what he has on the line, he better hope it does.', 'Three-Day, High-End Event to Showcase 40 Startups/ICO Competition, ICO Bootcamp, Plus 50 World-Class Experts, Digital Currency Funds, and Cryptocurrency Founders/Executives/Traders\n\n\n\nLeading Industry Speakers Include Liam Robertson, William Quigley, David Johnston, Halsey Minor, Mike Jones, Chance Barnett, Gil Penchina, Spencer Bogart, Richard Titus, Alexander Shelkovnikov, George Samman, Ken Hausman, and Jack Tatar\n\nLAS VEGAS, Sept. 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinAgenda (www.coinagenda.com), the premier conference for connecting blockchain and cryptocurrency investors with startup and ICO opportunities since 2014, has announced its fourth annual CoinAgenda Global presented by Transform Group, LLC, taking place at SLS Las Vegas, a luxury resort co-located with the W Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip, October 24-26.

These are two common questions that usually come up after any discussion on Bitcoin. We\'ve already explained what Bitcoin is, and how to buy Bitcoin in India, but here\'s a quick summary - Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is ""mined"" by computers, through a process of solving complex mathematical equations encoded in an algorithm. This is done using a technology called blockchain, that not only defines the rules of the algorithm, but serves as a public ledger - all transactions (such as mining or trading coins) must be verified against the ledger, which ensures that the transaction is legitimate, and transparent. It\'s an interesting idea, that started to skyrocket in value as Bitcoin became popular, particularly because there\'s a hard limit on the number of coins that are possible in the system. As a result, it\'s gotten harder to ""mine"" each coin, and the value of each coin has also gone.\n\nThe process of mining through complex algorithms makes Bitcoin a type of cryptocurrency - and in fact it\'s just one of many popular cryptocurrencies, with some well known alternatives being Litecoin, Etherium, and Dash. These all have different rules and different pros and cons - for example, Litecoin is designed to be faster to mine and trade, while Etherium\'s growing popularity means that there\'s a growing ecosystem around the currency. But these aren\'t the only uses for blockchain technology.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nBrock Pierce, co-founder Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in blockchain technology companies, explains the blockchain as a public-private ledger of transactions, which does not have any central control or single authority, or repository of information. Think of blockchain like a public record - anyone can make changes to it, provided they have the right credentials (authenticated using algorithms described in the blockchain), but all these changes are also public, including who changed what. This means that any sort of record can be widely shared, yet kept private and restricted, and can be kept up to date without losing track of who made the changes.\n\nThat sounds straightforward enough, but the key to the technology is that it doesn\'t rely on a centralised server to keep track of all this. Instead, the blockchain is distributed among all users, and its validity is measured using the blockchain algorithm. There\'s no ""master"" copy that any one person can access or edit; in a way, the infrastructure of blockchain is a little bit like a torrent file being shared.\n\nThis makes it a great basis for a cryptocurrency, but there are actually more ways in which it can come into play as well, with potential application across different sectors, although the financial companies are probably the ones who are most vocal about blockchain right now.\n\nHow can Blockchain technology be used?\n\nThere are a lot of different potential applications for Blockchain technology. Mumbai-based Auxesis Group, which got its start as a research group roughly two years ago at IIT-Bombay is one of the companies that\'s working towards building applications on top of blockchain infrastructure, and Akash Gaurav, its CEO, spoke to Gadgets 360 about how blockchain technology can be used.\n\n""Our focus is on building a products suite for different industries, so that any organisation can quickly deploy blockchain,"" says Gaurav. ""We\'re building applications for core banking, governments, and PSUs to use the power of blockchain.""\n\nOne of the projects that Auxesis is working on is for the Government of Andhra Pradesh - the government is launching prepaid Visa cards, and wants to use blockchain technology to track the transactions. ""The government wants the transactions on the blockchain infrastructure so that it\'s transparent to all stakeholders,"" explains Gaurav, adding, ""otherwise Visa is the only person keeping the records.""\n\nOther projects are currently under NDAs, but Gaurav talks about a healthcare project where blockchain could enable better sharing of data between hospitals.\n\n""A lot of data [from patients] is still collected in the paper format,"" he explains, and as a result, massive digitisation drives are underway around the country. The challenge becomes sharing data between hospitals, without raising privacy issues for patients. ""One hospital cannot easily share the information of one patient with another hospital while guaranteeing the privacy of your data,"" says Gaurav. ""But with blockchain, the treating doctor could update the patient\'s data, and if they go to another hospital, that data is available, but it can only be accessed with the patient\'s digital consent.""\n\nLots of potential for businesses too\n\nBeyond currencies, and government uses for maintaining records, blockchain technology has other potential uses too. For example, Yes Bank is using blockchain to manage vendor financing for its clients. With this, vendors can submit invoices using the ledger, and clients can handle payments seamlessly. This used to be done manually, explained Anup Purohit, Senior President and CIO, Yes Bank, and the implementation of blockchain makes it faster, and more secure.\n\nFinacle, whose technology powers many major banks in India, has also been looking at the future of blockchain. Some areas where it could find right now use are international remittances, and identity management, according to Rajashekara V Maiya is Associate Vice President and Head – Finacle Product Strategy. One of the challenges that he foresees is slow adoption, because there\'s no advantage to early adopters, he said. ""Unlike other digital technologies – mobility, analytics, cloud and so on – which offer competitive advantage to early adopters or monopolists, the distributed ledger needs a minimum of two parties to even function,"" said Maiya, adding, ""On the blockchain, it only pays when you collaborate. That will not be easy for banks, who are slugging it out in a fiercely competitive market.""\n\n""Indian companies have only been looking at this technology for only about a year right now but already a lot of development has been done and we aren\'t very far behind because that was the early stages where things were moving more slowly,"" adds Auxesis\' Gaurav. ""So now when we make use cases, they learn from these scenarios. Bajaj, Pidilite, and others are looking at things like supply chain using blockchain infrastructure, and there are more big corporations that are also working to evolve the processes.""\n\nAt the same time, the advantage of the government taking an interest in blockchain is that a large user base comes up quickly, which can be beneficial in developing the technology, Gaurav adds. ""Right now, the Aux Ledger has more than 50 million users, which provides us an edge over any other blockchain organisation in the world,"" he says. ""When people are talking about doing pilots, we\'ve already got some live projects.""\n\nCryptocurrency isn\'t necessarily the future, though blockchain is likely to be\n\nIf state governments are showing interest in blockchain, does this mean that you should start buying Bitcoin? Well, the RBI recently said it was ""not comfortable with Bitcoin"". That\'s not the end of the discussion, definitely, but Gaurav also sounded a note of caution.\n\n""For any central or regulatory body this is of course going to be a very difficult concept - of completely peer to peer currency,"" he says. ""There are some downsides of it as well, if it is not well regulated it can be used for money laundering and other uses which does not suit the institutions. So it\'s logical that the RBI or any government has a hard time to fully embrace it.""\n\n""But the RBI is looking at the parts of the blockchain,"" Gaurav continues. ""It\'s only been eight to ten years since the birth of the cryptocurrency, and more evolution has to be done, which will only happen once the central bank looks into it. The RBI is also thinking of using the Rupee over the Blockchain infrastructure. Blockchain would solve the issue of counterfeit money, and bring transparency to money.""\n\nIt\'s a view that Johan Gerber, Executive Vice President of Security and Decision Products, MasterCard, echoed on a recent visit to Bengaluru. Gerber was in the city for Mastercard\'s first Innovation Forum event in India, and showed us different methods for securing transactions, and the question of cryptocurrency came up. ""Blockchain, yes,"" he said emphatically, continuing, ""cryptocurrency though, they\'re still facing issues and figuring it out. Fiat currency [government backed money] is still a larger and more open ecosystem. And it\'s not necessarily more secure, and it\'s a lot less regulated. I believe blockchain technology has a big role to play, but not necessarily restricted to cryptocurrency.""', 'Alexander Drozdenko, governor of the Leningrad region in Russia, issued a general invitation to miners to use land in the region for mining farms, per 47news.ru. He has offered to utilize the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant (LNPP) as a space for new cryptocurrency mining.\n\nThe announcement came as part of the third annual small and medium-sized business (SMEs) forum, called Energy of Opportunities. More than 600 business owners and national representatives were present. The governor said:\n\n“For the production of Bitcoins, first of all, large areas for processing and cheap electric power are required. As you know, the construction of LNPP-2 is being completed in Sosnovy Bor, and large areas of the first nuclear power plant are being liberated. The liberated facility of Leningrad NPP can be used as a technopark designed for cheap energy.”\n\nThe statements reflect a growing sentiment among the Russian government of adopting cryptocurrency as a means of national growth. Recent announcements of partnership with Ethereum, as well as opening of potential locations for ICOs show the rising embrace of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.', 'For quite some time now the market is very depended to the news that are announced towards Bitcoin’s Regulation especially from China as the officials have been the first to take action against ICO (Initial Coin Offerings). That was followed with Bitcoin-to-fiat exchanged being terminated and now words are flying around that BTC mining and mining pools will be shut down.\n\nWhile digital currency token prices are very linked to speculation, the first moment news comes form GOV decision they are either hoisted up or tanked to the bottom. Bitcoin’s price dropped slowly from $5,000 to $4,000 and then finally below $3,000.\n\nBeing considered like commodities, following cryptocurrencies did get an impact in price also by Bitcoin as almost all had sell-offs and crashes in price. But as time goes by, the second in the row is taking the stage with ‘big headlines’ when it comes technology advancements and the blockchain tech future – Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Shakes the Market\n\nFounded by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum is a blockchain technology that runs more like a protocol than a currency, despite its token ETHER or known as ETH which can be paired and exchanged with currencies in a global scale.\n\nIt has rise to a market cap of $27 million and once it did hit the $400 mark/token, while now it is trading just below $300 with the recent development. Since January when it price was $8 the increase in price does count up to 3650% almost 10 months only. Ethereum does follow Bitcoin in many aspects and traders or investors are considering the fact that if they do not see Bitcoin having success then there is no belief in Ethereum.\n\nHowever an optimistic change towards that kind of understanding for Ethereum could be coming as soon as the end of this year. The technology itself on the protocol, the uses it finds and regulations are not hindering it as Bitcoin is having a rough time about them.\n\nBitcoin is planned and meant to be a currency of the age to come – decentralized, privacy appreciated and so on, in which idea it is quite lacking and failing to do so in many ways (by many well known figures it is considered a storing value while Litecoin could take the place of daily use more than BTC). Ethereum on the other hand is trying to find practical and utilization of the Blockchain and its ledger Tech which opens doors for many future movements – very important to mention the Smart Contracts.\n\nSmart Contracts are self-execution-able agreements in code language. For example, an auto-paying mortgage agreement on any rate that could be fixed or adjustable. Just this is being considered all around the world by officials and lawyers, for instance the State of Arizona are open to elaborate finding use of the technology.\n\nEthereum Thinks Bigger – is Bigger than just a Currency\n\nWith that the understanding of Ethereum more like a technology advancement than just a currency made real by a certain technology. “Wiser to contribute or invest in the internet itself than just one website”. Keeping in mind that a dot-com crash could struck Ethereum in the move like the entire internet’s inherent value could have crashed. So the demand and investment potential of Ethereum grows in value as ETH is needed more to run the above mentioned protocol. ETH is returned to miner or “stakers” (those that fold on ETH for value confirming) that call positive on transaction completion.\n\nEther even does make possible other coins and tokens that are known as ERC20 tokens that enter the market with Ethereum’s protocol technology. Initial Coin Offering-s are based on the same way, even that some Countries are putting regulations up against ICO-s, there are ERC20 tokens that have been hit by the mainstream factor – OMG – short for OmiseGo is the token that made the first billion dollar on its category and very famous especially in Thailand as it is used as a payment method in Mcdonalds.\n\nThere is the big difference – Bitcoin has to make its place and be accepted in any way by the world and its economy as a currency while acting as a could-be-decentralized value in a very centralized space. However for Ethereum it all needs the desire of the world to develop, grow and utilize the technology that is so much anticipated. If the Internet 3.0 or new-age internet would be based on Ethereum, than stopping a currency is much easier by states than a protocol.\n\nFor long term investors this means that Ether will continue to grow in technology foundation while BTC waits for news and countries to accept or regulate towards it in any way.\n\nLook-Out for News – Change is our Way\n\nFor every update that hits the Ethereum network, its market domination on the second place grows so wait out for news, updates and changes as many are coming.\n\nOn a very recent meeting Vitalik Buterin did comment on the scale issuing as it could be taking place of many protocols known world wide for future to come. For example Bitcoin processes 3 transaction in one second, Etherum 5 or Visa thousands. Even that the last one seems to much, the team behind Ethereum will stay behind Ether to reach that number.\n\nOne method to do so is the “Metropolis Update” that is tested and to come in the near term. It is made with the cause of a better scaling infrastructure. On top of that news of security strengthen are incoming.\n\n“The upgraded Ethereum blockchain is to also ensure a higher level of security through masking such that users will be able to determine the address for which they have a private key. Additionally, it will be able to withstand hacking even from quantum computers.”\n\nA very important update is the so called Proof-of-Stake, with which ETH holders will be compensated and returned like miners are for holding the ETH. It is being expected to have a positive reflection on the price:\n\n“The demand for ETH is expected to witness a significant rise as the date for update approaches despite the fact that we are yet to see any significant increased demands with announcements in this regard thus far.”\n\nAs the cryptocurrency fame in general is growing – more attention and demand is to come. The only time that the value could crash is if it does not deliver on promises, which is not to be expected for Ethereum. True value will be provided by the Protocol with its technology succeeding which will have an exponential rise.\n\nAppreciated surge in price by holders will take place as demand grows against the limited number of supply for ETH. There is still time to be a long term investors and see the future now as many are stopping themselves towards cryptocurrencies because of some news related to Bitcoin.\n\nRead Also:']"
09/22/2017,"['In an age of encryption, one of the major innovations of Bitcoin is their block-chain technology, which allows for transaction to be encrypted and tracked. - YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBitcoin has had a very tumultuous summer. As the valuation of the cryptocurrency climbed, experts opined about the potential “bitcoin bubble.” Bitcoin’s value, however, stumbled a bit over the past few weeks as Chinese regulators took steps to regulate the currency and its exchanges.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what exactly happened in China and why certain countries have decided to ban the cryptocurrencies to begin with it:\n\nDid China actually ban bitcoin?\n\nChina’s latest crackdown was specifically designed to target initial coin offerings (ICOs), according to Fran Strajnar, founder and CEO of Brave New Coin, a blockchain and digital currency market data company. ICOs have been used by startups to raise funds via selling tokens (or virtual currency such as bitcoin) to their early investors, similarly to the way that a company would sell shares during an initial public offering.\n\nHowever, in the past, there have been fraudulent ICOs that targeted investors. Unlike IPOs, ICOs are unregulated, making recovery of lost funds difficult.\n\nEarlier this month, the People’s Bank of China stated that ICOs are illegal and as a result crypto exchanges must stop any trading of ICO tokens. The bank also said that any startups that raised funds via ICOs were required to issue refunds.\n\n“Thus we have seen major projects \'delisted\' from exchanges and via private communications I can tell you there was quite a panic as multi-million dollar projects scrambled to essentially refund their crowd-sourced financing under the threat of penalties,” said Strajnar. According to her, figuring out how to issue refunds “was a logistical nightmare.”\n\nWeeks after the bank made its announcement, The Wall Street Journal reported that the three “largest domestic exchanges — BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin — all said they would halt trading services in the coming weeks.”\n\nSo while the People’s Bank of China did not actually ban bitcoin, it made trading it extremely difficult.\n\nWhy would countries ban ICOs or bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin transactions are encrypted and while they can be tracked by involved parties, bitcoin provides a way to keep money and transactions away from the prying eye of the regulators.\n\n“There is a risk that it could be used to fund crime or illicit terrorist activity — another reason is that it can be a route to circumvent capital controls,” explained Charlie Hayter, founder and CEO of the cryptocurrency data analysis firm CryptoCompare. “Rich Chinese don\'t want their money stashed in China as if they fall foul of some party apparatchik they can have it all confiscated.”\n\nThe People’s Bank of China has claimed that ICOs were a threat to the financial markets’ stability. Thanks to its decision to make ICOs illegal, the bank now has power to “shut down any exchange it wishes for violating their ruling,” according to Strajnar.\n\n“The People’s Bank of China now has a nice environment where it is impossible to comply, allowing it to penalize any issuance or exchange it wants to. Since then they have gone after some less than savoury operators, which is why we have seen news of number of Chinese ICO platforms and exchanges closing down. The top tier exchanges have the resources and procedures to keep their heads above the PBoC water, so to speak,” she said.\n\nHave there been other countries that have taken similar actions?\n\nAmong countries to have banned bitcoin in the past are Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Kyrgyzstan. The bans seem to have had little effect on the global bitcoin network.\n\n“These countries are of little consequence to the global cryptocurrency liquidity or global blockchain industry direction,” explained Strajnar.\n\nIn 2014, Bangladesh banned use of bitcoin as part of its anti-money laundering efforts.\n\n""Bitcoin is not a legal tender of any country. Any transaction through bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is a punishable offense,"" the bank said at the time.\n\nThe announcement came just months after Vietnam also banned bitcoin, claiming that virtual currencies are often linked to money laundering and other illegal activities.\n\nNot all countries think banning cryptocurrencies is a way to go. Consider Russia. Earlier this month, the country’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that regulation is the way to go.\n\n""The state understands indeed that cryptocurrencies are real. There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them,"" he said. He did however add that investing in cryptocurrencies is risky and insecure.\n\nReuters, which reported on Siluanov’s comments, also pointed out that the Russian central bank previously “said such currencies were used in illegal operations, such as money laundering, and promised to crack down on the instrument.”\n\nWhat about the U.S.?\n\nThere has been a push to regulate bitcoin in some small ways. For example, in 2014, the IRS ruled that bitcoin should be considered as assets. The decision meant that Americans who owned bitcoin would have to pay taxes on it.\n\nIn 2015, Coinbase launched the first U.S.-based licensed exchange for people to trade the cryptocurrency. Now, two and a half years later it’s already run afoul of the IRS by refusing to disclose information about its users who have traded more than $20,000 worth of bitcoin. The two are supposed to face off in court later this year.\n\nThe lack of legal support behind bitcoin is also a cause for concern for JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. While speak at a conference last week, Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud and said it would eventually “blow up.”\n\n""Here is a reason: Governments, first thing they do is form a currency. They like to control the currency. They control it through the central bank. They also like to know who has it, where it is, where it’s going ” he told CNBC, pointing out that this is exactly why the People’s Bank of China decided to make ICOs illegal and was winding down some of the exchanges.', 'Even as Bitcoin fans attack the J.P. Morgan CEO for his views on the cryptocurrency, Jamie Dimon is doubling down once again on his call that Bitcoin is a “fraud.”\n\nIn a CNBC interview Friday, Dimon labeled Bitcoin a “novelty” with no real value.\n\n“Right now these crypto things are kind of a novelty. People think they’re kind of neat. But the bigger they get, the more governments are going to close them down,” the CEO told CNBC. “It’s creating something out of nothing that to me is worth nothing.”\n\nBitcoin’s price is now hovering around $3,600, down from an all-time high of $5,000 earlier this month. The cryptocurrency took a plunge after Chinese officials cracked down on bitcoin, banned ICOs and closed down cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAround the same time, Dimon also reasserted his view from 2015 that Bitcoin is a fraud that will “blow up.” He reasoned the cryptocurrency was best suited for illicit uses, likely triggering crackdowns from world governments.\n\nSeparately, London-based Blockswater, which trades Bitcoin, lodged a complaint with Swedish authorities Thursday in which it accused Dimon of manipulating the price of Bitcoin. The allegations were made after Reuters reported that J.P. Morgan (jpm) had been routing customer orders for an exchange-traded note tracking Bitcoin. Notably however, the trades were not directly made on behalf of J.P. Morgan—making the case a little shakier for the London firm.\n\n“They are not JPMorgan orders,” a spokesperson said Friday. “These are clients purchasing third-party products directly.”', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\n* BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\n\nBitcoin has entered a bear market and most of the news around it has turned bearish. Experts are speculating about the future of cryptocurrencies and what can be done to reduce the volatility.\n\nHowever, we believe that a 30 percent fall after such a stupendous rally this year should not come as a surprise. There have been many such corrections in Bitcoin’s journey to $5,000 and investors who had the stomach to sit through it have been rewarded handsomely.\n\nNevertheless, it’s difficult for many to digest this volatility and they prefer to trade the short-term swings. For such traders, we provide critical levels that can be kept in mind while initiating a trade. Let’s see the latest recommendations.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nAfter the sharp fall, Bitcoin’s recovery hit a roadblock around the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $4,975 to $2,974. Additionally, the downtrend line has offered resistance twice. Therefore, it also becomes a strong resistance point.\n\nThe 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) are also on the verge of a bearish crossover. All these indicate that Bitcoin is in a downtrend.\n\nSo, how far can the cryptocurrency fall?\n\nBitcoin has a strong support at $3,500 levels, from where it has risen on Sept. 16 and 17. If this level breaks, then the final support is at $3,409, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the pullback from $2,974 to $4,113.15. Below this level, the digital currency is likely to retest the lows at $2,974.\n\nBitcoin is volatile. It turns around in a jiffy. What are the levels to watch out for if it turns around?\n\nThe first bullish sign is a breakout and closes above the downtrend line. This is where the aggressive traders should initiate long positions. However, this is a risky trade, therefore, please keep the allocation size small. Long positions can be added once Bitcoin breaks out and closes above $4,113.15.\n\nTraders should refrain from buying on dips because a breakdown below $2,974 will be very bearish.\n\nETH/USD\n\nWe had predicted Ethereum to fall to $240 in our previous analysis, which has materialized. What next?\n\nIf the digital currency breaks below $240, it is likely to fall to $223 levels, which is the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $200.15 to $310.7. If this level also breaks, then the digital currency will retest the lows at $200.\n\nFirst signs of a recovery will be when the digital currency breaks out and closes above the downtrend line. Nevertheless, the rally is likely to face resistance from the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA.\n\nEthereum is likely to gain strength only above $312 levels. Therefore, traders should wait for a breakout above $312 to initiate any long positions.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nWe were correct in predicting a fall to $400 levels on Bitcoin Cash if it failed to breakout of the downtrend line. Now, if it breaks below the $400 support, it can fall to $357 and thereafter to $300 levels.\n\nBitcoin Cash is in a strong downtrend since topping out at $972 on Aug. 19. Therefore, even if it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line, we advise against initiating long positions until the digital currency breaks out of $550.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nRipple is likely to retest the lows at $0.15000 once again. Any recovery is likely to face resistance at the $0.19300 and the $0.20000 levels.\n\nWe don’t see any buy setups even if the digital currency breaks out of $0.20000 levels. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on ripple until we see a clear trend.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nLitecoin is in a strong downtrend. If it doesn’t find support at $45, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the pullback from $32.681 to $57.729, it is likely to fall to $42 and after that to $38 levels.\n\nLitecoin will not be out of the woods until it breaks out and sustains above $60 levels. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it.', 'The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a lawsuit against a New York-based man and his company for allegedly running a bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme.\n\nNicholas Gelfman and his firm, Gelfman Blueprint Inc (GBI), are accused of procuring over $600,000 from 80 people between January 2014 and approximately January 2016.\n\nAccording to the CFTC, the funds were solicited from customers under the pretence of sponsoring a high-frequency bitcoin trading algorithm called ""Jigsaw."" Legal documents state that GBI falsely claimed that, through their investment, customers could enjoy a 7–9 percent monthly increase in bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the CFTC summarises that:\n\n""In fact, the strategy was fake, the purported performance reports were false, and – as in all Ponzi schemes – payouts of supposed profits to GBI customers in actuality consisted of other customers\' misappropriated funds.""\n\nWhile GBI reportedly advertised itself as the ""world’s largest and most advanced cryptocurrencies exchange,"" the company\'s bitcoin address allegedly shows ""no bitcoin trading activity at all after early July 2015, and a bitcoin balance of zero beginning in early August 2015.""\n\nGelfman allegedly tried to conceal the Ponzi scheme by claiming the company had been hacked, and that all customer funds had been stolen as a result.\n\nSpeaking in a release on the agency\'s website, James McDonald, the CFTC\'s Director of Enforcement, stated that, as part of its commitment to fintech innovation, the watchdog must pay careful attention to scammers misusing bitcoin.\n\nMcDonald said of the GBI case: ""As alleged, the defendants here preyed on customers interested in virtual currency, promising them the opportunity to invest in bitcoin when in reality they only bought into the defendants\' Ponzi scheme.""\n\nHe added that the CFTC will continue to ""work hard to identify and remove bad actors from these markets.""\n\nLady Justice image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon earlier this month said he would fire any employee trading bitcoin for being “stupid” and that the cryptocurrency “won’t end well.”\n\nBitcoin has soared in recent months, spurred by greater acceptance of the blockchain technology that underpins the exchange method and optimism that faster transaction times will encourage broader use of the cryptocurrency.\n\n“We do not believe that one can predict with confidence at this point that any given cryptocurrency will continue to thrive and gain status,” Nordvig said. “But we look forward to using the information from an increasingly active cryptocurrency market in our tracking of global capital flows.”', 'Investing in new Bitcoin ETF is like rolling the dice, says portfolio manager\n\nCanada is about to get its first Bitcoin ETF.\n\nEvolve Funds has filed a preliminary prospectus with regulators for the launch of Canada’s first cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund, which will trade on the TSX under the ticker BITS.\n\n“Accessing Bitcoin is not easy for many – it is a very complicated and expensive process as investors are currently unable to trade them in a regular brokerage account,"" said Raj Lala, president and CEO of Evolve ETFs, in a press release. ""An ETF tied to the price of Bitcoin could be a simpler way for investors to participate in its growth.""\n\nEvolve says the fund will aim to replicate the performance of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange by investing in exchanged-traded futures contracts and other instruments.\n\nBitcoin began Friday trade at US$3,648.61. The cryptocurrency hit a one-year high of US$4,921.45 on Sept. 1.', 'Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, and with the serious money it is attracting provoking this year’s record highs, more folks are looking to own the virtual currency. There are multiple methods by which you can acquire Bitcoins, including setting up a PC to mine it yourself, paying for a professional mining contract, or trading another cryptocurrency for it. Or you can simply buy Bitcoins for cold, hard cash.\n\nIn the latter case, the issue then becomes how best to change legal tender into Bitcoins. As Bitcoin is an all-digital virtual currency, the novice buyer might well be a little confused concerning where to start. As Bitcoin is not a physical currency, but a virtual one, it needs to be held in a digital wallet.\n\nA popular digital wallet is Blockchain, and an account can be created there in which you can keep your digital money; it offers a web interface as well as smartphone apps. While some Bitcoin exchanges also provide a digital wallet feature, we do not recommend this route due to security concerns – exchanges focus more on currency trading, and less on keeping the user’s Bitcoins safe. Online digital wallets come at no cost to the user.\n\nIf you just want to mine bitcoin instead, check out our guide here as well as a list of the best bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitcoining it in\n\nIn order to purchase a Bitcoin (or more), the user needs to go to a Bitcoin exchange that deals in their own fiat tender (real currency). A popular one is Coinbase which has an excellent track record as it has exchanged over $20 billion (£15 billion) worth of cash into Bitcoins, with support in 32 countries.\n\nIn order to perform a purchase on the Coinbase exchange, first you must set up an account. This requires some basic information to be supplied: a name, email, password and location (to make sure your particular location is supported). You also need to be 18 years of age or older.\n\nOnce the account is created, the next step is to link it with a bank account. When selling Bitcoin on Coinbase, the proceeds can either go to this bank account, or to a PayPal account. Purchases can be made from the linked bank account, or with Mastercard or Visa credit cards.\n\nUsers then decide how much Bitcoin they would like to purchase. Initially, Coinbase imposes a limit of purchasing $1,000 (£750) worth of Bitcoin per day; when you’re fully verified this limit increases to $50,000 (£37,000) daily.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin is shown in US dollars. Once a purchase has been agreed, the user will transfer the Bitcoin to their digital wallet to keep the funds secure in what is called a ‘cold storage’ wallet. This is an important step as if it’s not taken, and the exchange goes out of business or has financial difficulty, the user will lose their funds.\n\nWhile Coinbase is a popular place to purchase Bitcoin, it’s hardly the only game in town. Other sites that offer this service include Bitpanda, Bitquick, Localbitcoins, and Spectrocoin.\n\nWhile purchasing Bitcoin via a credit card is the most convenient method for the newbie, it also has a higher risk of transaction fraud, as well as higher processing fees. Using a credit card also limits the amount that can be purchased, for example, Spectrocoin limits users to $50 (£37) of Bitcoin for the initial four days, which then gets increased to $200 (£150) daily, and then $500 (£370) after seven days.\n\nUsers should be wary, though, and only deal with a regulated Bitcoin exchange (which fully displays its credentials on the site). Otherwise, there is little stopping a rogue Bitcoin exchange from taking your money and making off with it.', 'Bitcoin price is struggling to recover from the $3,800 region. Earlier today, on September 22, bitcoin price fell by 7.35 percent from $3,750 demonstrating early signs of recovery on Wednesday.\n\nThe entire cryptocurrency market endured a major price correction as leading cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Monero all recorded over 7 percent decline in value over the past 24 hours.\n\nPotential Factors of Bitcoin Price Correction\n\nAlthough the global bitcoin exchange market has recovered from the imposition of a nationwide ban on bitcoin exchanges by the Chinese government to an extent, the bitcoin market still remains concerned over the uncertainty of the Chinese bitcoin industry. Particularly, rumors on the potential ban on bitcoin mining centers and mining industry surfaced, and key players within the Chinese bitcoin mining industry such as ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang explained that the Chinese government’s crackdown on bitcoin mining industry could lead to the demise of Chinese miners.\n\n“Technically, China can’t ban bitcoin traffic, we have our own sync network. But if China gov say mining is illegal, we are fucked,” said Yang.\n\nThroughout the past week, several leading figures in both the Chinese and global bitcoin industries including Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, security expert John McAfee and Litecoin creator Charlie Lee have stated that there is no truth to the Chinese government’s potential ban on bitcoin mining. Lee wrote:\n\n“I have a trusted source that says that there’s no truth to China banning mining or network. For your information, I haven’t made any trades on this info. The FUD is propagated by large manipulators trying to make money shorting. They know that China ban FUD works and cannot be proven wrong. Take it for whatever it’s worth, but I have not traded this and have no plans to buy or sell in the near future.”\n\nIf large manipulators are in fact attempting to bring the price of bitcoin down for the purpose of shorting by circulating false news on the Chinese government’s supposed intent to ban bitcoin mining, it is definitely working. Uncertainty in China remains a large factor to the recent price correction of bitcoin. Even though the Chinese bitcoin exchange market was not a major market to begin with as it only accounted for 10 to 13 percent of global bitcoin trades prior to the ban, the bitcoin mining industry of China is accountable for a large portion of the global bitcoin hash rate.\n\nBut, the structure of the global bitcoin mining industry is starting to change rapidly. Multi-billion dollar technology conglomerates in Japan have started to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in manufacturing bitcoin mining equipment and establishing large-scale mining centers. Hence, in the long run, the deviation of hash power from China to Japan and other regions such as South Korea and the US will not be a major factor and indicator of bitcoin price trend.\n\nMore to that, several analysts and news publications including Zerohedge have reported that the recent price correction of bitcoin can be attributed to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s baseless criticism of bitcoin and its lack of intrinsic value. The vast majority of sensible investors and traders understand that the concept of intrinsic value is fundamentally flawed; the value of all assets, currencies and companies are completely subjective and thus, Dimon nor any other bankers are not in a position to depict the value of bitcoin in any way.\n\nJPMorgan CEO says #bitcoin has no value but clients want more.

Dimon has remained skeptical toward bitcoin since 2013 and his perception of it has not changed. The market has become resilient to falsified information and unjust analysis from financial analysts and bankers with the lack of knowledge in the structure of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs the market continues to recover from China and the Chinese government offers more clarification regards to the short-term future of bitcoin miners, bitcoin price will likely recover.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.', 'Claire Jones in Frankfurt and Patrick Jenkins in London SEPTEMBER 22, 2017 18 One of the eurozone’s most senior central bankers has waded into the debate over bitcoin, dismissing the cryptocurrency as “an instrument of speculation” and saying its sharp rise in value was akin to the 17th century tulip craze. The views of Vítor Constâncio, the vice-president of the European Central Bank, echo those of JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, who has described bitcoin as a “fraud”. “Bitcoin is a sort of tulip,” Mr Constâncio said. Tulipmania, which erupted in the Netherlands in the 1600s, is often cited as one of the oldest examples of a financial bubble. “It’s an instrument of speculation,” the ECB vice-president told the audience at a conference in Frankfurt on Friday. “But [it is] certainly not a currency and we don’t see it as a threat to central bank policy.” Bitcoin’s value slumped last week after Mr Dimon said the cryptocurrency was “worse than tulip bulbs”. The phenomenon was a “fraud”, he added, saying it was only useful to drug dealers, murderers or the inhabitants of North Korea. Bitcoin was trading at an all-time high of $4,911 at the beginning of this month, before falling to $3,899 after Mr Dimon’s comments. On Friday afternoon a bitcoin was worth $3,299. Mr Dimon is known for expressing strong views but the outburst against bitcoin surprised some peers in the industry. Many banks are embracing both bitcoin and the blockchain technology that underpins it. As issuers and guardians of official currencies, central bankers have faced questions about whether these private-sector rivals threaten their ability to control the supply of money. Earlier on Friday ECB president Mario Draghi said in Dublin that the central bank did not think cryptocurrencies posed a threat to the euro or the bank’s monetary policy but said cyber risk posed one of the most important dangers for the stability of the financial system. Mr Draghi this month hit back at a paper by an Estonian government official that mooted the idea of the Baltic state — which sees itself as something of a digital pioneer — creating its own cryptocurrency. “No member state can introduce its own currency; the currency of the eurozone is the euro,” the ECB president said. Speaking on the same panel as Mr Constâncio, Huw van Steenis, global head of strategy at Schroders, an asset manager, said: “As cryptocurrencies grow, we should expect more central bankers to look to outlaw or crimp their use. “This will be most acute in markets which are worried about capital flight and organised crime. This won’t stop speculators and enthusiasts, but will limit their potential to create the powerful network effects which would make them a useful parallel currency,” Mr van Steenis said.

Since not everyone supports this hard fork, this could well “split” the Bitcoin network into two incompatible blockchains and currencies, not unlike Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) did two months ago.\n\n\n\nBut this NYA hard fork is controversial and not only because it lacks consensus. It’s also controversial because of design choices made by the development team behind BTC1, the software client associated with the New York Agreement. Perhaps most importantly, this development team, led by Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, has so far refused to implement replay protection, a measure that Bcash did take. Partly for this reason, at least one NYA signatory — Wayniloans — has backed out of the agreement.\n\nSo what is replay protection, why should BTC1 implement it … and why doesn’t it?\n\nWhat Is Replay Protection? (And What Are Replay Attacks?)\n\nBitcoin could see another “split” by November. (It’s arguably more accurate to consider the “splitting” nodes and miners as an entirely new cryptocurrency with a new blockchain and token — not an actual split of Bitcoin itself.) For the purpose of this article, we’ll refer to the blockchain and currency that follows the current Bitcoin protocol as “Legacy Bitcoin” and “BTC.” The blockchain and currency that follows the New York Agreement hard fork is referred to as “SegWit2X” and “B2X.”\n\nIf this split happens, the two blockchains will be identical. All past transactions and (therefore) “balances” are copied from the Legacy Bitcoin blockchain onto the SegWit2X blockchain. Everyone who owns BTC will own a corresponding amount of B2X.\n\nWithout replay protection, new transactions will be equally valid on both chains as well. This means that these transactions can be copied or “replayed,” from one chain to the other — in other words, for them to happen on both. This is called a “replay attack.”\n\nSo, let’s say Alice holds BTC at the time of split, which means she also owns B2X after the split. Then, after the split, she wants to send BTC to Bob. So, she creates a transaction that spends BTC from one of her Legacy Bitcoin addresses to one of Bob’s Legacy Bitcoin addresses. She then transmits this transaction over the Legacy Bitcoin network for a Legacy Bitcoin miner to pick it up and include in a Legacy Bitcoin block. The payment is confirmed; all is good.\n\nBut this very same transaction is perfectly valid on the SegWit2X blockchain. Anyone — including Bob — can take Alice's Legacy Bitcoin transaction and also transmit it over the SegWit2X network for a miner to include in a SegWit2X block. (This can even happen by accident quite easily.) If this payment is also confirmed, Alice has inadvertently sent Bob not only BTC but also an equal amount of B2X.\n\nAnd, of course, all of this is true in reverse as well. If Alice sends B2X to Bob, she might accidentally send him BTC as well. A lack of replay protection, therefore, is a problem for users of both chains. No one wants to accidentally send any money — not even if it was “free money.”\n\nTechnically, there are ways to “split” coins on both chains to ensure they can only be spent on one chain. This would, for example, require newly mined coins to be mixed into a transaction. Tiime-locks can also offer solutions. But this takes effort and is not easy, especially for average users — not to mention that many average users may not even know what’s going on in the first place.\n\nTo avoid this kind of hassle, at least one side of the split could add a protocol rule to ensure that new transactions are valid on one chain but not the other. This is called replay protection.\n\nWhy Should BTC1 Implement Replay Protection? (And Why Not Bitcoin Core?)\n\nIn case of a split, at least one side must implement replay protection. But many — Bitcoin Core developers and others — believe there’s only one viable option. It’s the splitting party — in this case BTC1 — that should do it.\n\nThere are several arguments for this.\n\nFirst of all, it makes the most sense for BTC1 to implement replay protection because that requires the least effort. BTC1 is a new client that’s already implementing new protocol rules anyway, and it’s not very widely deployed yet. It would be relatively easy for BTC1 to include replay protection.\n\nMeanwhile, it would not be sufficient for Bitcoin Core to implement replay protection on its own. While it is dominant, and even considered by some to be the protocol-defining reference implementation, Bitcoin Core is not the only Bitcoin implementation on the network. Bitcoin Knots, Bcoin, Libbitcoin and other alternative clients would all have to implement replay protection, too. (And that’s not even taking non-full node clients into account.)\n\nBut even more importantly, the reality of the current situation is that all deployed Bitcoin nodes do not have replay protection implemented. And logically, they can’t: Some of these nodes even predate the New York Agreement. So even if Bitcoin Core and other implementations were to implement replay protection in new releases of their software, it wouldn’t suffice. All users must then also update to this new version within about two months: a very short period of time for a network-wide upgrade.\n\nIf only some of the nodes on the network upgrade to these new releases, Bitcoin could actually split in three: Legacy Bitcoin, SegWit2X and “Replay Protected Bitcoin.” Needless to say, this three-way split would probably make the problem worse — not better.\n\nLastly, there is a bit of a philosophical argument. Anyone who wants to adopt new protocol rules, so the argument goes, has the responsibility to split off as safely as possible. This responsibility should not fall on those who want to keep using the existing protocol: They should be free to keep using the protocol as-is.\n\nMany developers — including RSK founder Sergio Lerner who drafted the SegWit2Mb proposal on which SegWit2X is based — have argued that BTC1 should implement replay protection. In fact, many developers think that any hard fork, even a hard fork that appears entirely uncontroversial, should implement replay protection.\n\nBut so far, the BTC1 development team will only consider optional replay protection.\n\nWhat’s Wrong With Optional Replay Protection?\n\nImplementing optional replay protection, as proposed by former Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, for example, is currently on the table for BTC1.\n\nIn short, this type of optional replay protection would make certain specially crafted (“OP_RETURN”) Legacy Bitcoin transactions invalid on the SegWit2X chain. Anyone who’d want to split their coins could spend their BTC with such a transaction. These transactions should then confirm on the Legacy Bitcoin blockchain but not on the SegWit2X chain. This effectively splits the coins into different addresses (“outputs”) on both chains.\n\nSuch optional replay protection is probably better than nothing at all, but it’s still not a definitive solution.\n\nOne problem is that the Legacy Bitcoin blockchain would have to include all these OP_RETURN transactions. This would probably result in more transactions on the network and would require extra data for each transaction. All this data must be transmitted, verified and (at least temporarily) stored by all Legacy Bitcoin nodes. It presents a burden to the Legacy Bitcoin network.\n\nBut more importantly, it would probably still not be very easy to utilize this option. It might suffice for professional users — exchanges, wallet providers and other service providers — as well as tech-savvy individual users. But these are generally also the types of users that would be able to split their coins even without replay protection. Average users, if they are even aware of what’s going on, would probably find it much more difficult to utilize optional replay protection.\n\nOptional replay protection, therefore, offers help to those who need it least and does little for those who need it most.\n\nDoes the NYA Preclude Replay Protection?\n\nWhile it’s unclear what was (or is) discussed behind closed doors, the New York Agreement seems to be a very minimal agreement. Published on May 23, 2017, it really only consists of two concrete points:\n\nActivate Segregated Witness at an 80 percent threshold, signaling at bit 4, and\n\nActivate a 2 MB hard fork within six months.\n\nWith the first point completed through BIP91, the only remaining point is a hard fork to 2 megabytes before November 23. (This assumes that this hard fork wasn’t completed with the creation of Bitcoin Cash which is supported by a number of NYA signatories.)\n\nNotably, a lot of details are not filled in. For example, the agreement does not even state that signatories must specifically run the BTC1 software: Any software implementation that implements a hard fork to 2 megabytes might do. This could even include a software implementation that implements replay protection. And, of course, nothing in the NYA stops BTC1 from implementing replay protection; some signatories may have even expected it.\n\nWhy Won’t BTC1 Implement Replay Protection?\n\nThere are really several reasons why BTC1 — both stated and speculated — might not want to add replay protection.\n\nThe first reason is that replay protection would require simplified payment verification (SPV) wallets and some other thin clients to upgrade in order to send and receive transactions on SegWit2X. Replay protection would, therefore, in the words of BTC1 developer Jeff Garzik, “break” SPV wallets; they wouldn’t be compatible with SegWit2X until upgraded.\n\nThis framing and choice of words is disputed. If SegWit2X were to implement replay protection (and if SPV wallets don’t upgrade), these wallets could still send and receive transactions on Legacy Bitcoin perfectly fine. On top of that, they wouldn’t accidentally spend B2X when they don’t mean to.\n\nMeanwhile, if the SegWit2X chain does not implement replay protection (and if SPV-wallets don’t upgrade), users may not be sure if their wallet is receiving or sending BTC transactions or B2X transactions or both. They also may not be sure if the balance in their wallet is a BTC balance or a B2X balance or both. And if hash power moves from one chain to another over time, these wallets could even switch from displaying BTC balances to B2X balances or the other way round without users knowing. (This problem could be solved, to some extent, through another workaround, but this is not yet implemented in either.)\n\nIndeed, not implementing replay protection on SegWit2X could arguably “break” SPV wallets much worse.\n\nThe only (plausible) scenario where implementing replay protection would perhaps not break SPV wallets much worse is if there is no Legacy Bitcoin to speak of. Indeed, the New York Agreement very specifically intends to “upgrade” Bitcoin, rather than split off into a new coin as Bcash did. And based on miner signaling and statements of intent by several big Bitcoin companies, some NYA signatories claim that Legacy Bitcoin will not be able to survive at all.\n\nImplementing replay protection is, therefore, sometimes considered an admission that SegWit2X will split off from (Legacy) Bitcoin into something new and will not be considered the upgraded version of Bitcoin.\n\nBut the assumption that Legacy Bitcoin won’t be able survive is a big one. In reality, miner signaling is effectively meaningless, while Bitcoin Core — the dominant Bitcoin implementation — will not adopt the hard fork. There is also a significant list of companies that have not stated that they support the hard fork, including two top-10 mining pools. Similarly, it’s not clear if many (individual) users will support SegWit2X either. The implementation of wipe-out protection (another safety measure) also suggests that even BTC1 developers aren’t so sure that there will only be one chain.\n\nAnd perhaps even more importantly, it’s not clear that replay protection would affect any of this. If miners, developers, companies and users are to consider SegWit2X an upgrade of Bitcoin, they will probably do so with or without replay protection.\n\nThis is why it has also been suggested that BTC1 is rejecting replay protection for the specific purpose of being as disruptive as possible. If the Legacy Bitcoin chain is effectively made unusable, SegWit2X might stand the best chance of being recognized as “Bitcoin.”\n\nFor more information and debate on replay protection, also see the the relevant threads on the SegWit2X mailing list.""]"
09/23/2017,"['Sept. 22, The Paper news agency reported that the Chinese regulators not only banned the exchange between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the Chinese Yuan, but they also called for all trading of cryptocurrency to any fiat currency to end.\n\nThis carries the implication that all exchanges have effectively been banned.\n\nShanghai goes further\n\nFurthermore, the regulators in Shanghai have asked for the top management of the exchanges, including the executives, directors, finance team and technical team members, to stay in Shanghai to cooperate for the clean-up activity.\n\nPreviously, the Beijing regulators still did not call for trading in all fiat currency to be stopped. However, it was noticed that on Sept. 15 both OKCoin and HuoBi first announced that all cryptocurrency trading in Chinese Yuan will end. The next day, both exchanges modified their announcements respectively to include a plan to end all cryptocurrency trading activities.\n\nThe main reason for closing down the exchanges, as authorities tell the public, is because Bitcoin price fluctuates greatly, it is risky and it can be a way for criminal activities to take place. Besides, Bitcoin trading platforms do not have a qualified regulatory system and won’t give sufficient protection to investors, regulators believe.\n\nHow the u-turn was happening\n\nIn May this year, when Bitcoin price went above RMB 8,000, PBOC arranged talks with the three largest crypto exchanges.\n\nThey allowed for the Bitcoin exchanges to handle issues regarding development on their own, so the clean-up activities were carried out correspondingly. Later on, the Bitcoin exchanges were instructed to charge trading fees, to prevent speculating activities, to stop financing services, to implement strict Know-Your-Customers (KYC) policies, to take measures to prevent money laundering and to report back to the regulation department in a timely manner.\n\nIn September this year, the regulators called to end all forms of digital currency trading and to return the customer’s funds into accounts that can be audited.\n\nAn audit mechanism was then to be established to audit every account to prevent diversion or embezzlement of cryptocurrency funds. All Bitcoin exchanges were instructed to halt new accounts registration, to lower the number of investors and to plan to their own exits from cryptocurrency trading.\n\nStrict supervision\n\nWhen asked about the situation regarding ICO, a source with the regulators explained:\n\n“If a certain ICO’s sole purpose was to raise funds, it will be okay if the funds were returned to the investors, and the case is closed.But if the ICO was used as a way for money laundering, then it should be handled as how it is supposed to be doing just that.”\n\nWhen asked about how the ICO funds return is being handled, the insider explained that most importantly, the platforms, project owners and investors can come to an agreement and the government’s responsibility is to urge and supervise the return of capital and to protect the rights of the investors.\n\nForeign platforms\n\n‘For some projects, there are disagreements between the trading platforms and the investors. For example, some tokens were already trading on the exchanges, and the prices had increased from 1.5 cents to five cents, yet how much should be returned to the investors is not decided by the government. If the parties could not come to an agreement, they should take the legal approach to settle the case.’\n\nWhen asked about government’s initiative to block access to all foreign platforms, the person informed that as cryptocurrency is a decentralized system, the regulators are having difficulties in the technical aspects. Thus they can only control from the movement of funds.', 'In another statement that will certainly have cryptophiles fuming, Jamie Dimon, the erstwhile CEO of JP Morgan Chase Bank, was quoted in an interview in New Delhi India saying that cryptocurrencies ‘to me are worth nothing.’\n\nDimon was serious in his warning that as cryptocurrencies grow, governments will begin to control them, and will eventually ban them, throwing those who buy and sell them into prison. The commentary does not reflect the wider governmental acceptance of Bitcoin in the news but seems to be more in line with the Chinese government rhetoric.\n\nCrypto or fiat ‘from thin air’\n\nDuring the interview, when Dimon commented that cryptocurrencies are created ‘out of thin air’ with no value, the reporter tried to point out that the same can be said of fiat currencies. This is especially true in an inflationary economy like Venezuela, where cash is printed in massive volumes.\n\nDimon, however, was not to be gainsaid, and rapidly fired back that ‘legal tender’ means that ‘you have to take it.’ Dimon made it clear that dollars, for example, have value because they are backed by a government, as opposed to Bitcoin, which is backed by consensus among users, saying:\n\n""Creating money out of thin air without government backing is very different from money with government backing.”\n\nApparently, however, Dimon does recognize that both dollars and Bitcoins are made out of thin air.\n\nJP Morgan buys while CEO condemns\n\nThe comments follow his previous condemnation of Bitcoin as a ‘fraud’ which was met with some vitriol from the cryptocurrency community. One company has even filed a suit against Dimon for adverse business practice.\n\nIronically, however, after his initial comments, news spread that JP Morgan had purchased Bitcoin at the lowest point immediately after Dimon’s comments. Clearly, if governments are to ban the cryptocurrency, JP Morgan Chase itself would take a major hit.', ""One reason used by Bitcoin opponents, including Jamie Dimon, to attack it is its high volatility. Is high volatility such a bad thing for Bitcoin after all?\n\nHighly volatile asset class\n\nOne reason why traditional investors have shunned Bitcoin is that its price has swung from one extreme to another. Its price increased from around $1,000 at the beginning of the year to a peak of over $5,000 in September 2017 (gain of +400 percent), before crashing to a low of $3,000 (-40 percent from its peak). Even this represents an improvement from the initial days when Bitcoin price crashed from $32 to $2 in 2011 (a drop of 94 percent). There have been periods of low volatility, but these have been few and far between. Bitcoin may be called digital gold, but in terms of volatility, it looks more like stock markets on steroids.\n\nVolatility is an opportunity for traders\n\nFor day traders and short-term investors, volatility presents an opportunity for making profits. By correctly predicting the short-term trends in Bitcoin, traders can make substantial profits; much more than investors who have a buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nHighly volatile markets also create demand for secondary derivative products like options.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market develops, we could see increased trading of derivative products rather than actual trading of Bitcoin.\n\nAs per the London Bullion Markets Association, it is estimated that 95 percent of gold trading in London is in unallocated metal (which is not settled). Bitcoin is still in its infancy, but as the market develops we could see the same trading characteristics in Bitcoin as well.\n\nBane for merchants\n\nMerchants, no matter how tech-savvy they are, hesitate to accept Bitcoins for their goods and services. Their core competence lies in providing goods and services, not in managing Bitcoin's volatility.\n\nThey work on thin margins and hate even the one to two percent transaction fees imposed by credit card companies.\n\nThe Bitcoin price can move substantially between the time they accept Bitcoins from customers, and they sell these Bitcoins in exchange for their local currency. This price movement can wipe out their entire profitability.\n\nThis is the reason why most merchants accept Bitcoin only through payment processors like Coinbase, which removes the risk associated with holding Bitcoins. In the end, merchants have to pay their bills using fiat currencies, not Bitcoin.\n\nVolatility inevitable during growth\n\nBitcoin is a relatively new asset class. Although the level of awareness about Bitcoin among the general population has increased, only a small proportion of them hold significant amount of Bitcoins.\n\nMoreover, institutional investors have largely avoided Bitcoin, given its unregulated nature and the risks associated with it.\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption increases and demand increases, its price can move up rapidly.\n\nSimilarly, when there is negative news about Bitcoin, like the Chinese shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges, some of the holders of Bitcoin will sell and its price can crash rapidly.\n\nUntil the holding of Bitcoin becomes widely distributed and its liquidity improves substantially, we will see substantial volatility in Bitcoin price."", 'News\n\nAn exchange-traded-fund (ETF) management firm, Evolve Funds, has announced the company is seeking regulatory approval for a Canadian bitcoin-based ETF.\n\nAlso read: Markets Update: Bitcoin Price Consolidates After Last Week’s Volatility\n\nEvolve Funds Aims to Introduce Canada’s First Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe Toronto-based firm, Evolve Funds, has revealed the fund management business is currently in the process of filing a preliminary prospectus for a bitcoin ETF in Canada. The company is attempting to provide a variety of other ETFs that cover investments like cybersecurity and classic cars. Evolve Cyber Security Index ETF (CYBR) currently trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) while the classic cars fund is pending approval alongside the bitcoin ETF prospectus.\n\nThe Evolve bitcoin ETF will be called “BITS,” and aims to give mainstream investors exposure to bitcoin if Canadian regulators decide to approve the fund. Evolve explains that BITS will derive its value from the performance of bitcoin through investments based off of the CFE Bitcoin Futures Index. According to Evolve, there will be a management fee for 0.80 percent of the ETF’s net asset value (NAV).\n\n“Accessing bitcoin is not easy for many – it is a very complicated and expensive process as investors are currently unable to trade them in a regular brokerage account,” explains the President & CEO of Evolve Funds, Raj Lala.\n\nAn ETF tied to the price of bitcoin could be a simpler way for investors to participate in its growth.\n\nBitcoin Effectively Marries Currency With Technology\n\nThe company started last summer and many of the ETFs it creates cover niche markets that traditional ETF management firms don’t usually handle. At the moment, the firm is waiting for the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) to list four new funds on TSX including the bitcoin ETF. However, Canada’s provincial and securities regulators are currently busy researching initial coin offerings and drafting legal framework for token sales. Evolve’s founder Mr. Lala is still optimistic about the CSA approving the fund and believes bitcoin is the future of money.\n\n“Bitcoin effectively marries currency with technology,” Mr. Lala details. “Bitcoin is an online currency that can be sent and received by anyone in the world, relying on computers to control the transfer and creation of money without human intervention.”\n\nIt’s the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. As more and more of the world goes digital, usage of cryptocurrencies could increase significantly in the coming years.\n\nCanada May Get a Bitcoin-Based ETF Before the U.S.\n\nEvolve also details that BITS investors can purchase both hedged and unhedged shares. The startup says if the ETF is approved, Evolve Funds, will be the primary “promoter, manager, trustee and portfolio manager of BITS.”\n\nAt the moment in the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission has denied bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but investors can still purchase Grayscale’s GBTC and soon Ledger X’s bitcoin options. Presently there are a few cryptocurrency ETFs in Europe, and now Canada might see a bitcoin-based ETF before U.S. management companies gain approval. Additionally, last week the first registration of a Canadian management firm operating a bitcoin investment fund was approved by the British Columbia Securities Commission.\n\nWhat do you think about Canada introducing a bitcoin-based ETF in the country?

The recently installed ATM was featured in a New Yorker piece by Ian Parker, who described it as a ""machine with the body of a regular ATM but the soul of a lottery terminal.""

Russia has been added to the list of countries that are trying to limit the spread of Bitcoin, as London is added to the list of local and national governments that banned Uber\'s operations.\n\nThere’s a good reason big governments have been going after Bitcoin and Uber. They are innovations that challenge the status quo, the power of elites to write the rules that advance their own interests at the expense of the people at large.\n\nBitcoin has emerged as a ""people\'s currency,"" an alternative to national currencies, freed of the control of central banks and banks. And that means a loss of seigniorage income for governments—the benefits derived from printing money and from controlling the economy, as discussed in a previous piece here.That\'s why big governments from China to Russia -- and smaller governments like Venezuela -- have been trying to crush it. How? By banning Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), by closing Bitcoin exchanges, and by going after Bitcoin developers.\n\nAnd it seems they are succeeding it, with the digital currency having lost close to 30% of its value in a matter of days.\n\nCoin/Investment Trust Change 24H* Bitcoin (BTC) -1.05% Ethereum (ETH) 0.62 Litecoin (LTC) .72\n\n*As of Friday September 22, 2017 at 9 pm\n\nSource: Coinranking.com\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin also means that banks are losing control of the money that flows between central banks and the economy, and the interest income and fees associated with them.

That\'s why some big local, regional, and national governments refuse to license Uber or bring its standards to those of taxi unions.\n\nA Sample Of Countries/Cities That Have Banned Uber\n\nChina Taiwan Italy Denmark Bulgaria Hungary Denmark London (as of September 30) Vancouver/Canada\n\nBut if history can be a guide, big governments and their allies can slow down innovations but cannot kill them. Especially in democratic societies where people will eventually send home politicians who stand against them and the technologies that better their lives.\n\nMust Read: An Intrepid Investor\'s Guide To Buying Bitcoin And Other Crypto Assets', 'Dr Paul Ennis is a research assistant at the Centre for Innovation, Technology & Organisation at University College Dublin, specializing in bitcoin and blockchain studies.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Ennis takes a dive into the kinds of sub-cultures bitcoin and cryptocurrencies enable, tracing their origins in libertarianism – and beyond.\n\nNot everything is tameable – that\'s a truism that might apply to bitcoin above all.\n\nRecently, researchers from City University and Stockholm University introduced the concept of the ""bandit organization,"" calling it ""a form of association or \'band\' (frequently led by a charismatic individual) that occupies a space outside national and/or international credibility but inside the everyday practical and moral organization of specific audiences.""\n\nBitcoin, as we all intuitively seem to sense, is not quite a community in any usual sense.\n\nFor this reason, I\'ve started to describe it as a land of bandits, ""Bitcoin Country,"" a term that denotes a semi-autonomous lawless region full of bandits, some noble, some not, and most certainly not cohesive.\n\nToo formless to be a country, too amorphous to be a company, you can think of Bitcoin Country as a kind of digitally decentralized frontier.\n\nThe outlaws\n\nHistorian Eric Hobsbawm provided an early model of outlaws as social bandits that, although often violent, were celebrated by the local community as heroic or defiant.\n\nIn this way, the origin story of bitcoin is deliciously outlaw, essentially one of the individual who, through an amazing feat, harangues the evil king. It\'s all the better if the king has devolved into vice and avarice to the point of financial ruin.\n\nThe other, slightly more contentious hero, operated on the edge of the edge, is the black market within the black market, the bayous of Bitcoin Country.\n\n""The fascists always use the narrative of \'We are the white knights in shining armor protecting against the threats. We come here and we move out the dark with pure whiteness.\' That\'s a false narrative because there is corruption in those castles. The real base of power lies with us. We are the darkness.""\n\nIn the above quote, anarchist bitcoin developer Amir Taaki sets out, in the context of a documentary about the original darknet marketplace, Silk Road, a common theme within digital libertarian culture: the establishment, broadly construed, is corrupt.\n\nNot just corrupt, its corruptness is clouded in ""whiteness,"" traditional forms of organizational legitimacy, and it uses narratives of fear to ensure we place our trust in them.\n\nWe need police to stop crime, we need armies to stop invaders and intelligence services to stop terrorists. Taaki\'s rhetoric is hyperbolic, but it contains, implicitly, two important insights. The first is that the organizational legitimacy of central authorities is connected to our placing our trust in them in exchange for protection from threats (Taaki calls this ""babysitting"" a little later in the speech).\n\nThe second, a cypherpunk view, is that a powerful response to this situation, in the context of the digital world, is the creation of technological systems that subvert this power relation, ""the real base of power lies with us.""\n\nRadical dimension\n\nThese systems Taaki discusses would strive to be trustless, having no central authority and, strikingly, they would not require legitimacy. It is crucial to remember that digital libertarians do not propose a counter-legitimacy belonging to them.\n\nThey do not claim to be the truly legitimate position. Rather they revel in being ""the darkness.""\n\nTheir ideal systems necessitate no ""babysitters,"" no trusted third party, no ""legitimacy"" in any traditional sense. Given such an anarchic spirit, it is no surprise that digital libertarians are drawn toward those areas deemed off-limits by authority, such as the shadow economy.\n\nSilk Road was never just an exercise in deviant entrepreneurship, but was ""presented as a means to dismantle the state."" University professor David Golumbia notes that in the wider bitcoin discourse ""the idea that government itself is inherently evil"" appears with ""particular force.""\n\nIt was a form of activism involving a political ""prefiguration"" that sustained the community.\n\nPrefiguration is a concept found in the left anarchist and autonomist Marxist traditions and developed in relation to cryptomarkets. Like most forms of political radicalism, libertarianism relies on envisioning a world that does not yet exist. Aware that this is the case, radical activists often must discover methods that justify their faith in the project.\n\nFor the anarchist and autonomist traditions, this tension has emerged quite visibly in movements such as Occupy Wall Street.\n\nAs Mathijs van de Sande explains, prefigurative politics need to be seen in terms of the ever-evolving act of bringing into being the world its adherents wish to see, but without any mainstream engagement. Crucial to prefiguration is a subtle inversion within leftist thinking.\n\nIn traditional Marxism, the relation to the state is directly antagonistic; one is against the state.\n\nIn the anarchist and autonomist view, this becomes inverted. There, to borrow from the Spanish Indignados, ""We are not against the system. The system is against us.""\n\nThis redefines the nature of defiance as a focus on how best one can build new worlds despite state ""interference."" It manifests as a process of instantiation of abstract ideals to come through practices occurring in the here and now.\n\nThe overriding aim is to act ""as if one is already free.""\n\nExit over voice\n\nThe state is to be escaped rather than replaced. In other words, ""exit over voice.""\n\nAccording to economist Albert Hirschman, the two options open to all dissatisfied members of an organization are exit or voice. One can either exit the organization or voice dissatisfaction.\n\nLibertarians are infamous for their preference for exit or, at least, the option of exit and, as journalist Brian Doherty charts, there have been many attempts to escape what they perceive as the ultimate closure of options, the state.\n\nThe concept of exit has even led to attempts to establish entirely new countries, known as micro-nations, their failures documented in an obscure libertarian classic ""How to Start Your Country."" Arguably the most successful forms of exit have occurred by simply moving out to sea, as encapsulated in our romantic vision of anarchistic pirates, but also in the most successful micro-nation of all time, the Principality of Sealand, an offshore oil platform located not far from the coast of Suffolk, England.\n\nThe Dread Pirate Roberts name evokes this pirate outlaw status quite explicitly (Ross Ulbrich, who ran Silk Road under that name, even notes this in discussion with Variety Jones). He had not just prefigured the world his community wanted to see, but had generated a space, a micro-nation located off the coast of the clearnet, where the law (seemingly) no longer applied.\n\nIn effect, what Ulbricht achieved was a quite unique marriage of high-minded digital libertarian ideals with the routine process of buying and selling narcotics.\n\nFor most participants, their engagement with Silk Road operationalized a sense of freedom to consume their drug of choice in the context of doing no harm to others, aligning participants with the cyber-libertarian philosophy of DPR.\n\nKonkin\'s influence\n\nIn more formal terms, organizational legitimacy on the Silk Road was ensured by reimagining the ""mundane"" act of buying and selling narcotics as an act of liberty.\n\nFor Ulbricht, the success of Silk Road was precisely in line with the teachings of his most important intellectual influence, Samuel Edward Konkin III. A relatively obscure figure, Konkin developed a strand of libertarianism known as agorism in the early 1970s. In his exceptionally detailed and thorough-going history of American libertarianism, Doherty references Konkin a mere five times and not once in any especially important manner.\n\nIndeed, Konkin seems to have ""fallen"" out of the tradition, but this is consistent with his rejection of the Libertarian Party as inherently paradoxical, preferring instead to promote black market activism where one might ""commit civil disobedience profitably."" It is not clear how Ulbricht first came across Konkin, but perhaps there was something of the kindred spirit to them, both had studied chemistry to an advanced degree.\n\nKonkin proposed a dual course to bringing agorism into being: (1) a theoretical position known as ""counter-establishment economics,"" or ""counter-economics"" for short, and (2) the practical dimension of ""counter-economic activity."" For Konkin only a small handful understand agorism, in the theoretical sense, but this does not mean that counter-economic activity does not occur.\n\nKonkin was keen to celebrate the unconscious agorists that populate our world: tax-dodgers, black market operators, prostitutes and so on. This is where Konkin can be considered explicitly radical.\n\nThe creation of black markets was for Konkin an agorist act where small ""pockets"" of outlaw culture create markets more efficient than the state can provide. The more efficient these pockets the more people in the white economy will turn to agorism.\n\nKonkin died in 2004, but he had foreseen, as early as the middle of the 1980s, that the internet opened up agorist possibilities. His remarks are worth quoting in full, given his influence upon Ulbricht:\n\n""The internet explosion has led the American State – for now, at any rate – to throw up its tentacles at regulation of the information industry. Every legislative session, however, brings up new attempts to tax and control the World Wide Web. But consider this well: should the counter-economy lick the information problem, it would virtually eliminate the risk it incurs under the State\'s threat. That is, if you can advertise your products, reach your consumers and accept payment (a form of information), all outside the detection capabilities of the State, what enforcement of control would be left?\'""\n\nThis is, to be direct, quite simply what Silk Road was.\n\nEven more prescient is that Konkin recognized the importance of encryption around the same time.\n\nNoting that encryption meant the state ""cannot reach the invoices, inventory lists, accounts and so on of the Counter-Economist,"" Konkin\'s proto-conception of the cryptomarket means he arrived at the idea before even the cypherpunks.\n\nRusted train image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Previously, Casey held a mixed view of cryptocurrencies, doubting if they had the basic principles that make a currency.\n\nHowever, after further research and consideration, Casey has affirmed his view that Bitcoin is, indeed, money. This evaluation is based on five principles that make up a currency - durability, consistency, divisibility, convenience and usability.\n\nAmong these five criteria, Casey says, he has always believed that Bitcoin meets all of them nicely, with the exception of usability. His concern previously was that Bitcoin had little real-world use cases. Casey, however, has changed his mind, saying:\n\n“The problem I had with Bitcoin to start with was the fifth point: does it have use value in itself, so you can’t get stuck holding the bag? And I said that was the problem with Bitcoin. But I was wrong about that… The bottom line, Bitcoin passes the medium of exchange test for the moment and store of value test for the moment. So you can definitely say it’s money—for the moment.”\n\nBitcoin destined to fail?\n\nCasey’s comments reflect the opinions of other analysts, including the Economist, which echoed Casey’s comments, saying that Bitcoin is indeed money. The article used tests for value based on the famed economist Charles Kindleberger, who wrote the quintessential analysis of bubbles in 1978.\n\nCasey, however, goes on to say that the reality is that Bitcoin can and will change. He concludes by saying, “I have little confidence Bitcoin will be here say five years from now.”', 'An insidious attack trend has been catching my eye lately. It’s called the software supply chain attack.\n\nThe scheme goes like this: Hackers compromise a trusted software vendor, subvert its products with their own malicious versions, and then use the tainted formulation to infect customers — thereby bypassing internal security controls and easily spreading malware far and wide. Customers, careful to keep their software up to date, don’t think twice about downloading the latest iterations. That’s good digital hygiene, after all.\n\nAt least that’s what we’ve been trained to think. Cisco researchers exposed one of these sneaky incursions earlier this week. The hacking operation sabotaged CCleaner, a popular piece of computer cleaning software distributed by Avast, a Czech antivirus firm. (Morphisec, an Israeli cybersecurity startup, had discovered the compromise too.)\n\nHere’s what happened: In August, some unknown hacking group inserted a backdoor into the CCleaner software, which was then dutifully installed on more than 700,000 machines. With that foothold, the attackers then attempted to drill down deeper into the networks of at least 18 big tech company targets, including Google, Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, HTC, and Cisco. Presumably, the intruders sought trade secrets.\n\nThis is only the most recent example of such an attack. Earlier this year hackers compromised MeDoc, a piece of accounting software developed by a Ukrainian tech firm, in order to spread a destructive strain of ransomware, dubbed NotPetya, through its update mechanism. The attack crippled operations at big companies, ranging from Danish shipping giant Maersk to U.S. pharma company Merck. Similarly, Kaspersky Labs, the lately besieged Russian cybersecurity firm, found a backdoor in server management software from the U.S. and South Korean tech firm NetSarang that infected hundreds of banks and other companies over the summer.\n\nThese supply-chain attacks fly in the face of commonly accepted principles of computer security — i.e., patch your systems early and often — and they undermine everyone’s trust in the software ecosystem. As the Cisco researchers note in their analysis, a product from an established vendor “rarely receives the same level of scrutiny” as one from an untrusted source. And as they warn in a follow-up post, these types of attacks now “seem to be increasing in velocity and complexity.”\n\nThe proliferation is cause for alarm. It’s hard to see how the situation will improve until everyone — even small-fry software vendors — takes responsibility and ups their digital defenses.\n\nRobert Hackett\n\n@rhhackett\n\nrobert.hackett@fortune.com\n\nWelcome to the Cyber Saturday edition of Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily tech newsletter.

09/24/2017,"['Bitcoin prices have been trading sideways for the last few weeks, moving within a reasonably tight range as many investors wait to see what China\'s regulatory environment will look like going forward.\n\nThe digital currency\'s price has primarily traded below $4,000 since September 14, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nThe currency has suffered this malaise after surging to more than $5,000 on September 2 and then promptly falling back from that level.\n\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nFollowing this decline, Bitcoin prices, along with the price of many other digital currencies, pushed higher, but encountered some difficulty as the regulatory environment for these digital assets became increasingly uncertain.\n\nMust Read: An Intrepid Investor\'s Guide To Buying Bitcoin And Crypto Assets\n\nRegulatory Crackdown\n\nChinese authorities banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) on September 4, according to CoinDesk. This came after the nation\'s government officials investigated the exchanges, as well as them permitting no-fee trading, earlier this year.\n\nLater that month, China\'s already complex regulatory situation took a new turn when the nation\'s three largest exchanges announced that within the next few months, they would stop offering local trading, TechCrunch reported.\n\nWait And See\n\nNow, many Bitcoin investors are adopting a ""wait and see"" approach to see what China does next, according to several analysts.\n\n""People are looking for clarity from China,"" said Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX. Traders are ""evaluating"" the effects that new restrictions will have on the markets, he added.\n\nLucas Geiger, founder and CEO of Wireline, offered similar input, stating that ""the regulation issues are casting a shadow"" that likely worries those who are on ""on the fence"" about getting involved with cryptocurrencies.\n\nRyan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy, shed some light on how this ""wait and see"" situation was impacting markets, stating that traditional volume has fallen across the board.\n\nRegulatory Clarity\n\nThese market observers may get the clarity they are looking for very soon, said Pawel Kuskowski, CEO & co-founder of Coinfirm, a blockchain and regulatory technology firm.\n\n""There are obviously some valid concerns from the regulators,"" he said, asserting that the industry is quickly learning the impact of these requirements.\n\n""So I think soon we see more and more \'traditional\' players coming to this market and they will be strictly compliant,"" said Kuskowski. ""This will push the price up.""\n\nTailwinds For Bitcoin\n\nKuskowski is certainly not the only market observer who has asserted that regulation could have a positive effect on digital currency prices.\n\nGeiger, for example, spoke to the upward price movement that Bitcoin enjoyed earlier this year as Japan recognized the cryptocurrency as a legal payment method.\n\n""In my opinion the bull run coincided with positive regulatory information in the spring coming from Japan,"" a development that ""brought new participants to the market.""\n\nGeiger insisted that in recent months, digital currency prices have risen as investors have entered the market.\n\nA Healthy Pause\n\nWhile Bitcoin prices have been moving range-bound for the last few weeks, this period of relative calm has taken place after the digital asset enjoyed a meteoric rise, causing its price to surge more than 400% this year.\n\nAfter such a sharp climb, moving within a modest range could simply represent a healthy pause, said analysts.\n\n""Cryptos were probably a little ahead of themselves when BTC was trading toward $5,000,"" said Sean Walsh, partner at Redwood City Ventures.\n\nTim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, offered similar sentiment, stating that ""it’s healthy to take a pause"" after experiencing such sharp price increases.\n\nWhat The Future Holds\n\nGoing forward, some analysts are very optimistic. Geiger has described the growth of the digital currency market as ""structural,"" emphasizing that many players have been getting involved, causing the market to grow rapidly.\n\nMarshall Swatt, an entrepreneur who founded cryptocurrency exchange Coinsetter, which was acquired by Kraken, provided a bullish stance on these digital assets.\n\nEven though China was at one point considered the center of Bitcoin, Swatt asserted that cryptocurrencies will continue to grow regardless of what the Asian nation opts to do.\n\nOne analyst, Kevin Zhou, had a more neutral stance on the matter.\n\n""I think it\'s a bit hard to say right now whether the bull market will resume or whether we are at an inflection point,"" said Zhou, co-founder of cryptocurrency trading fund Galois Capital.\n\n""We\'ve been in a bull market all year and if we really hit an inflection point here, we could see a more sustained pullback in both severity and time.""\n\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.', 'A Bitcoin exchange is a digital marketplace for users to buy and sell Bitcoins using different currencies. The Bitcoin can be exchanged for either fiat money (legal tender) or other alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. The exchange serves as the middleman for traders of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBeing able to purchase Bitcoin is the initial step to trading in it. Just like trading a stock, Bitcoin exchanges charge transaction fees, which range from 0 to 1%. In order to trade Bitcoin on an exchange, the user needs to have an account, and go through a series of steps to be verified. Remember that Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies are a completely digital currency, and there are no physical Bitcoins.\n\nHowever, before plunging in with both feet, users should be aware of what to look for in choosing a Bitcoin exchange for their cryptocurrency transactions. This is analogous to the issues and potential pitfalls in making a choice of where to do your banking, or open an online brokerage account. Furthermore, bear in mind that unlike banks and stock trading, Bitcoin trading is largely unregulated by most countries, although this is changing as its popularity increases.\n\nA good place to start is to look at the virtual coins which are supported by an exchange. With over 4,000 cryptocurrencies, and additional ones being added all the time, it is key to figure out which currencies you want to trade in, and then match the exchange that deals in those. For example, Ethereum mining has recently become more popular, but not all Bitcoin exchanges support this alternative cryptocurrency.\n\nLanguage barriers\n\nNext look at the country that is hosting the Bitcoin exchange. Some are in less regulated countries, and there may be additional problems if something goes awry. This can include time differences, international long distance costs, and language barriers. In general, it’s preferable to find an exchange that speaks your language.\n\nAdditionally, pay close attention to the fees levied. While all these exchanges charge transaction fees – after all, they are businesses looking to make a profit – as the user, it is obviously best to find one with the lowest costs in order to maximize your own profits.\n\nAlso look for a secure trading platform, and a Bitcoin exchange which has robust security measures. After all, you wouldn’t use a bank that didn’t have a vault, and stored its money on the counter…\n\nDesirable security features include two-factor authentication, SMS or email alerts, encrypted emails, and wallet monitoring. A smartphone app can also be very useful in terms of accessing and monitoring funds – but equally, poorly implemented software can represent a security risk.\n\nFinally, look for an exchange which is doing a good volume of trading – in other words, one with a high number of trading pairs, and high liquidity.\n\nNow that we know the features to look for in the best Bitcoin exchanges, let’s move on to pick out our particular favorites.\n\n1. Coinbase\n\nThis is a US-based exchange which was founded in 2012, and it supports over 32 countries. Coinbase exchanges Bitcoin and the alternative cryptocurrencies of Ethereum and Litecoin, and it’s the largest of the exchanges, claiming $20 billion (£15 billion) in currency exchanged. In 2014 Coinbase created GDAX, the Global Digital Asset Exchange which was developed for professionals with high volumes of trading.\n\nThe firm offers a mobile wallet, offline storage, and insurance protection for currency stored on its servers. Coinbase supports several fiat currencies: British Pounds, US Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Singapore Dollars.\n\nThe Coinbase exchange has a 1% flat fee for each purchase, while cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are done without any fees. A streamlined user interface which is ideal for novice traders – and fast trades – makes Coinbase a popular exchange with traders.\n\n2. Gemini Exchange\n\nGemini Exchange is another US-based outfit founded by the Winklevoss twins – the pair who sued Mark Zuckerberg over social networking, and were awarded $65 million (£48 million), which they put to use as venture capitalists. This exchange is based in New York, and is available in 45 US states, as well as the UK, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.\n\nGemini’s only supported fiat currency is US dollars, and it only trades Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gemini does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees, and levies a low flat rate of 0.25% for trades, to both the buyer and the seller.\n\nAnother advantage of Gemini is that it’s a New York state limited liability trust company, and is regulated by New York’s Department of Financial Services. Close proximity to the Wall Street financial markets allows the company to easily provide a bridge from more traditional investments to newer cryptocurrency markets, for both individual and institutional investors.\n\nGemini is also notable in that it accepts ACH transfers for fast access to money for trades. A potential downside is that the interface is not particularly novice-friendly.\n\n3. Changelly\n\nChangelly is a cryptocurrency exchange with support for many more virtual currencies than most, including Monero, Dash, Bytecoin, and DigitalNote among others. If you are mining a less popular currency, chances are that Changelly can exchange it for you.\n\nThis exchange comes from the popular mining platform MinerGate which provides a merged mining pool across Windows, Mac, Linux and Android operating systems. While Changelly focuses on exchanges between different cryptocurrencies, users can also purchase cryptocurrency with US Dollars or Euros.\n\nNote that this exchange has a shorter track record, as it only entered the market in 2016. Exchange fees are 0.5% on transactions.\n\n4. Cryptopia\n\nCryptopia was founded in 2014, aiming to be a comprehensive exchange that focuses on the user experience, with integration of additional services including a marketplace and wallet. It is based in Christchurch, New Zealand. Cryptopia is notable in that the first level of verification happens very quickly, and only requires an email address for initial verification.\n\nWhile Cryptopia does not support fiat money trading, it does support a ridiculously large number of cryptocurrencies: over 400 to date, with more being added all the time. The trading fee is also a low 0.20% per transaction, which compares favorably with many competitors. The website is quite large and sprawling, meaning that new users might find their first experiences with the site a little daunting.', 'Already a subscriber?\n\nClick on the button below to set up your account or log in if you already have one.', 'Rumors are circulating that Amazon may begin accepting Bitcoin as a payment method this October. The rumors appear to stem from a recent report on squawker.org, Some surveys have indicated that the company would have a financial reason to do so, but no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe squawker.org article references a mention in investor James Altucher’s newsletter. According to the source, Altucher is an experienced trader who many believe could have pre-announcement information. The article comments:\n\n“James Altucher has (co)founded more than 20 companies, authored 11 books, and has been a contributor to several major publications.He is a former hedge fund manager and venture capitalist turned activist blogger/podcaster and offers a subscription based mailing list – the source of the Amazon information.”\n\nSuch an announcement is a long shot, but isn’t inconceivable. As online retailers begin to embrace Bitcoin, Amazon will likely respond in kind, in order to maintain its dominance. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said:\n\n“They have to follow suit. I’d be stunned if they don’t, because they can’t just cede that part of the market to us, if we’re the only main, large retail site accepting Bitcoin.”\n\nFollowing suit\n\nThe move would also continue a trend that began with Overstock and has included other enterprise-level tech companies. A recent comment within a Google API tutorial has led many to believe that the online behemoth will also begin accepting Bitcoin within the Google Store, as PayPal and others already do.\n\nAs recently as this summer, users were petitioning Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, to begin accepting the cryptocurrency. The move may occur as early as October 26th, during the next earnings conference call.\n\nIt should be reiterated that this is likely only a rumor at this point, and could be swiftly put to rest. Nonetheless, it is interesting to speculate on the possibilities if Amazon does one day integrate Bitcoin. As the adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies grow, retailers will need to join the progression toward acceptance in order to remain relevant.', 'JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is facing market abuse reports from algorithmic liquidity provider Blockswater, according to the UK’s biggest financial news publication CityAM.\n\nEarlier this month, at a banking conference hosted by Barclays, Dimon offered baseless condemnation on Bitcoin, claiming that the decentralized cryptocurrency is a fraud and that the government will soon close down the network of Bitcoin.\n\nAlmost immediately after providing a non-factual and inaccurate assessment of Bitcoin, Dimon was heavily criticized by prominent venture capital investor and the owner of the Golden State Warriors, Chamath Palihapitiya.\n\nAt the conference, in response to Dimon’s comments, Palihapitiya explained that governments are limited in what they can restrict and regulate within the global Bitcoin industry and market. He emphasized that government agencies and financial regulators can control trading activities around Bitcoin but cannot manipulate or censor the peer-to-peer protocol itself.\n\nTo the Dimon’s labeling Bitcoin as fraud, Palihapitiya answered:\n\n“Absolutely not. It cannot be a fraud. What countries can constrain today is how it is effectively traded, but it cannot be controlled. It is a fundamentally distributed system that exists peer to peer. And so to the extent that you can basically eliminate the will and the actions of every single person in the world, you can eliminate it. But in the absence of that, the genie is fundamentally out of the bottle.”\n\nSubsequent to the release of Dimon’s condemnation on Bitcoin, the price of the digital currency plunged from over $4,400 to $3,900. Many analysts have clarified that the price drop of Bitcoin most likely was not impacted by Dimon’s comments but rather by the Chinese government’s imposition of a nationwide ban on Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nStill, Blockswater pursued a market abuse report against Dimon for his statement that was evidently incorrect and because of the involvement of JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in various Bitcoin investments.\n\nOn Sep. 15, trusted sources including Bitcoin developer Andrew DeSantis and respected Bitcoin trader IamNomad published screenshots of four separate purchases of Bitcoin XBT shares by the bank accounts of JPMorgan Securities. Analysts as Tone Vays supposed they are custodian accounts that purchased the shares of XBT Provider, a Nordic Nasdaq-based Bitcoin exchange-traded note (ETN) on behalf of clients.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that JPMorgan Securities as a company made the decision to invest in Bitcoin XBT. Instead, the clients of JPMorgan likely requested bank transfers to XBT Provider in Sweden in order to invest in Bitcoin through regulated channels.\n\nFlorian Schweitzer, managing partner at Blockswater said:\n\n""Jamie Dimon\'s public assertions did not only affect the reputation of Bitcoin, they harmed the interests of some of his own clients and many young businesses that are working hard to create a better financial system.”\n\nThe complaint of Blockswater also noted that Dimon purposely released non-factual information in regards to the structure and legitimacy of Bitcoin with the intent of negatively impacting its price and value.', 'An early bitcoin developer and entrepreneur, Alex Waters served as COO and CIO for bitcoin exchange startup BitInstant. Later going on to start several bitcoin ventures, he was also at the forefront of efforts to boost its regulatory compliance.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Waters reviews ""How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance"" (Oneworld Publications), arguing it captures the zeitgeist of the original cryptocurrency and the sprawling – all too human – movement that helped it reach the masses.\n\nI have long suspected, owing to its sheer brilliance and idiosyncratic beauty, that bitcoin was in fact brought here by aliens from another planet.\n\nBrian Patrick Eha\'s vivid history of bitcoin, ""How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance,"" which captures in thrilling journalistic fashion what I experienced in my years working on this remarkable technology, only confirms my suspicions.\n\nI regret not recording what I saw and felt while working on bitcoin — the fleeting moments of intense joy and dismay that once seemed too meaningful ever to forget. But at the time, it was all I could do to keep up with the pace, and my life became a blur of 80-hour working weeks devoted to the engineering project of a lifetime.\n\nAs the years passed, and the blockchain industry exploded, it seemed that these beautiful moments of intellectual adventure would remain only as fading memories, slowly dimming as I aged.\n\nThe idea that an author could capture the essence of that stirring time seemed impossible even in my most optimistic moments. Yet, just as I had initially done with bitcoin, I came to find in reading Eha\'s book that I had underestimated once again.\n\nFrom the top\n\nEha starts at the beginning, sparing no detail.\n\nThe era he eloquently describes was an alternate reality which brought together the brightest, hardest-working and most ideologically extreme individuals I have ever known. We shared common goals and an outsider camaraderie that only grew stronger as we made progress in the early years of bitcoin\'s ascendance. Looking back, it\'s sobering to realize that some of us were imprisoned or otherwise suffered as a result of the desire to improve and promote this new kind of money.\n\nFor some of my fellow pioneers, the intensity of their ideological commitments became a prison in itself.\n\nEarly bitcoiners collectively witnessed the radical dismantling of tribal and national affiliations, and the formation, in their place, of a new global citizenry. The birth of bitcoin and its blockchain was an important moment in human history – one whose legacy deserves to be documented.\n\n""How Money Got Free"" is precisely what I was yearning to read.\n\nThe fascinating detail and precise vocabulary of Eha\'s writing provide a sense of closure for me personally. It feels cathartic to now possess a tome which records the visceral thrill of bitcoin\'s rise, the earthshaking import of its innovations. As I read, I felt as though I were in the room witnessing the breakthroughs made by the first bitcoin pioneers.\n\nThe truth is, I have crossed paths with many of the characters depicted in the book.\n\nSome of them were in close proximity to me for nearly a decade. Until now, I didn\'t know why these people had joined the bitcoin community or how fate had guided us to share in this wonderful experiment. While I was busy working on cash remittance at BitInstant, I had very little insight into what others were working on in parallel. The challenges faced by Coinbase, Blockchain, BitPay, SecondMarket and others were just brief news headlines to me at the time, like billboards flashing past on the highway.\n\nI had little appreciation for the depth of their intensity or the richness of the stories behind those headlines – all of which is conveyed in full through Eha\'s narrative.\n\nConsequently, ""How Money Got Free"" has changed my perspective on many of those people, some of whom I once thought of as competitors. What I\'ve since learned is that we were all in the same boat, whatever our individual aims. Bitcoin itself is, in some sense, our parent organization, and its furtherance benefits us all.\n\nEha interviewed me for his book, as he did many of my former colleagues and acquaintances. When I asked what had motivated him to write it, he said that he wanted to shine a light on the pioneers and preserve the history of bitcoin\'s formative years. (His book, which is both a work of investigative journalism and a tremendous feat of storytelling, focuses mainly on the period from 2009–2015, though Eha also examines bitcoin\'s precursors, and an epilogue brings his narrative almost to the present day.)\n\nThe martyrs, explorers, creators, and pariahs who champion new technologies and advance society, Eha told me, are often overlooked or soon fall into obscurity. While every frontier has to be settled eventually, the lessons learned during the rough-and-tumble days are important – so that future projects are inoculated against failure by the hardships of the past.\n\nUntold stories\n\n""How Money Got Free"" transports readers to the meeting rooms, startup couches, conference halls, online discussion boards and proverbial watercoolers where the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry took shape. It guides readers through the history of bitcoin\'s implementation and explains its potential for the future.\n\nWhether you are a bitcoin believer or a skeptic, Eha\'s work will arm you with a deeper knowledge not only of the technology but of the human motives behind it. It is inspiring, evocative, and imbued with empathy for the dreamers – the ""crazy ones,"" as Eha puts it in the book\'s dedication, echoing Steve Jobs – who move society forward.\n\nAs the book makes clear, bitcoin would not be where is it today had it not been for all of the people who clicked on a link, who read an article, who discussed, built, argued and invested. Small in themselves, each of these actions shaped our future; they contributed to the momentum of where we are going.\n\nNaturally, our past informs our choice of what to write, what to click, with whom to argue and what to say.\n\nJust so, early bitcoiners tended to have philosophical or political reasons for being drawn to cryptocurrency, and Eha is splendid at delving into primary sources and tracing the wellsprings of these convictions.\n\nAs we express ourselves through the use of these new technologies – the Internet, email, text messaging, social networks, blockchains – we stand to benefit from weighing the long-term implications of even our smallest interactions.\n\nIt is crucial for us to recognize and reflect on the journeys made and efforts undertaken to bring us our current way of life. But while some figures loom larger than others, every person who participates in bitcoin, even conceptually, is taking an implied risk. It carries social, legal, and financial consequences regardless of success. That risk and the willingness to take it, in the interest of furthering humanity, is what binds us together.\n\nEha\'s book reminds me of something Faulkner once wrote: ""The past is never dead. It\'s not even past.""\n\nEven now, it informs our actions, and we need to understand it if we want to understand where we are going. ""How Money Got Free"" conveys the essence of bitcoin\'s past – not preserved in amber but alive with color and controversy.\n\nFor non-geeks, reading this book may be the first step toward acceptance of our inevitable future. It can serve as a permanent record for those who weren\'t around to witness the events first-hand, and as an inspiration for all the dreamers still captivated by a transcendence which rivals the internet itself.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stake in BitPay, Blockchain and Coinbase.\n\nOld books image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Check out our blog today!\n\nThis September is our two year anniversary operating Bitcoin.com — the world’s most interactive web portal dedicated to educating the world about the technological innovation we all love — Bitcoin.\n\nThe website Bitcoin.com is a big project, and we’ve been steadily improving every corner of the site over the last two years. The domain has a long history and has passed through many hands over the course of the past eight years. In fact, Bitcoin.com was registered in January of 2008, a year before the protocol was released by Satoshi Nakamoto back in January of 2009. After the domain was created, one of the earliest bitcoin exchanges, Tradehill, took over the website six years ago but the ownership didn’t last long. The trading platform fell apart, and the domain was then transferred over to Roger Ver in April of 2014.\n\nVer explains that he purchased Bitcoin.com for an undisclosed sum. Originally Blockchain.info was going to use the website as the main landing page Ver says, but the idea never came to fruition. Following this Ver negotiated a deal with the Chinese exchange, Okcoin, to lease the website as he had several other offers from interested parties. Ver says that Okcoin provided the best offer for the lease agreement and the two parties worked out an arrangement. Okcoin didn’t put much work into the website’s design and in May of 2015 Ver revealed to the public that the exchange owed him funds for overdue payments. Ver explains that “Okcoin breached the agreement in every manner possible.”\n\n“I now have a $570K USD, plus damages judgment against them,” explains Ver telling the story about his dispute with Okcoin.\n\nWhen they took the website offline, and stopped paying the money that they owed, I decided to manage the website myself, and the current version of Bitcoin.com that we all know and love was born. – Roger Ver.\n\nIn the summer of 2015 Ver hired Mate Tokay, a successful entrepreneur as the Chief Operating Officer for Bitcoin.com. Tokay got very interested in bitcoin in 2012 and began mining using custom-built miners back in 2013. Following this, Tokay founded the popular cryptocurrency news website the Bitcoinist and sold the domain shortly after joining Bitcoin.com. Since then Tokay has been successfully managing the day to day operations for every aspect of the bitcoin-focused web portal.\n\n“Bitcoin.com is a world-class website that covers every aspect of this growing ecosystem,” Tokay explains. “My ultimate goal is to make cryptocurrencies as popular as possible, and I knew working with Roger that the domain would go a long way.”\n\nThree years later our web portal covers all types of bitcoin-related products, services, and educational venues. We have the hottest headlines in our news section, a bitcoin Wiki, a whole suite of wallets for every OS, charts, a world-class casino, podcasts, and so much more. The truth is Bitcoin.com is just getting started.\n\nIn addition to adding Tokay to the team, Ver hired Emil Oldenburg, as the company’s Chief Technical Officer. Oldenburg began working for ISP businesses early in his career working on networks and data centers. Following this Oldenburg worked as a security specialist at Nasdaq OMX, but got really passionate about bitcoin shortly after. Following his new passion for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Oldenburg created the Swedish bitcoin exchange Safello in 2013. In the summer of 2015, Oldenburg began building Bitcoin.com from the ground up.\n\n“I remember starting building Bitcoin.com in the spring; we started with just a simple static website,” Oldenburg details. “Then we migrated to WordPress, set up the news site, built a simple tools page, then got more and more servers. It feels like ages ago now.”\n\nIn September of 2015 Ver hired the writer, Jamie Redman, a bitcoin journalist and graphic artist to help start a bitcoin-based news section. Redman got into bitcoin in 2011 and had worked as a graphic artist/writer since 2002. In early 2015 Redman began writing for multiple cryptocurrency and bitcoin-based news outlets. Ver reached out to Redman because they shared the same libertarian-based ideologies and hired him as the first writer for Bitcoin.com. Alongside adding Redman, the news section also started with former Bitcoinist editors, Scott Fargo and Evan Faggert, and a few other freelance journalists. Since then, Redman has worked exclusively for Bitcoin.com as the news team’s lead writer and has written over 1200 articles on the website. Some of Redman’s articles have gathered well over three hundred thousand views and have exposed scams like the Ponzi operation Onecoin.\n\n“Working for news.Bitcoin.com has been super fun, and our site has grown very popular over the past few years,” Redman details. “Our news team strives for greatness every day to be the number one source for bitcoin-related news.”\n\nOver the past eight months our new Editor in Chief, Nanok Bie, has pushed Bitcoin.com’s news section to the next level. Further my colleagues Kevin Helms, Sterlin Lujan, and Samuel Haig provide us with top-notch reporting on the everyday events taking place in the growing bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nNow Bitcoin.com has a lot of people on the payroll with a broad variety of sections covering every aspect of the bitcoin space. These days we have a mining pool, a voting section, a place where people can purchase bitcoin, cloud mining, an open and uncensored forum, and so much more. Over the past two years, our website has gathered millions of visitors every month, and we hope to bring that number to the billions someday.\n\nWe’d also like to thank our Chief Financial Officer – Natalia Ra, General Counsel – Daniel Kelman, Head of Design – Jeffrey Vier, Business Development – Jake Smith, Product Manager – Mike Malley, Graphic Designer – Luis Barreto, Web Designer – Makoto Takizawa, Translator / Author – Huang (Lightning) ShiLiang, Podcaster – Brian Wilson, Sales Manager – Mike White, Affiliate Marketing Manager – Tzvi Shishler, Global Support – Stephen Bitkilo, Bitcoin Games affiliate manager – Kaine Bell-Cross, Community Manager – Jason Sheman, Bitcoin Games Affiliate Manager – Mandy Goldberg, and Business Development – Tim Potter.\n\nAnd our excellent development team who brings us all the magic from behind the scenes with Senior Developer – Clark Moody, Developers – Shaun Chong, Arsen Gasparyan, Joakim Johansson, Triet Cao, Joey King, Sam Cheng Hung, David Shares, and Hans Engren.\n\nThe entire Bitcoin.com team is super passionate about decentralized technology and the innovative bitcoin protocol. We look forward to bitcoin’s future and want our visitors and readers to know Bitcoin.com will be there every step of the way. Check out our new company blog today to hear from our passionate team members.\n\nHow big do you think Bitcoin will become as a currency, a network and a protocol?

Founded in 2016 by Nadine and Nicole Damblon, HydroMiner uses ecological energy resources derived from hydropower plants located in the Austrian Alps.\n\nWhile being a clean and eco-friendly energy source, hydropower is also the most sustainable and productive kind of power, allowing HydroMiner to reach one of the lowest electricity prices in the region. Its current electricity bill is 85% lower than the average bill in Europe. Thus, the company gains a significant advantage over other mining firms, which utilize data centers that consume large amount of energy.\n\n“We focused on mining using hydro power to build a cryptoworld that is based on an environmentally friendly way of mining. The best part is, this green way is also very profitable, since we are able to purchase the energy at a really low price, which can compete with Chinese and northern European ones,” said Nadine Damblon.\n\n“While being part of the crypto-revolution, that is changing the world as we know it, we still manage to have almost no carbon footprint. So, the investor doesn’t need to choose between a rewarding and a responsible, eco-friendly mining business, we can offer both with our mining farms in the Alps.”\n\nStarting tomorrow, investors will be able to participate in HydroMiner’s one week pre-sale, acquiring its H2O tokens at a discount of 25%. Contributors will be given an opportunity to earn monthly dividends in ETH currency. The minimum investment is 50 ETH.\n\nOn October 3, 2017, HydroMiner will launch an ICO that will last for four weeks with different bonus tokens, ranging from 20% to 5%. The proceeds will be spent for the company’s further expansion as it plans to buy additional hydropower stations. Announced a few days ago, the crowdsale will enable investors to share in HydroMiner’s mining profits via the blockchain.\n\nHydroMiner provides a fair and transparent way to take part in the revenues of bitcoin mining. H2O tokens will use smart contracts to distribute the profits generated by the coins mined at hydropower stations. Each token represents one watt of power and gives the rights to the net proceeds of one watt of mining profits. By offering rewards per watt instead of per hashrate, HydroMiner will distribute mining profits evenly among all investors.\n\n“We believe this represents a much better approach than the usual method of paying per hash-rate, as the power of networks increases continuously and proceeds based on hashes can erode very quickly,” the company said.', 'This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material.

The BitIndia wallet will transform the current structure and concept of crypto wallets. While BitIndia wallets aims to make blockchain mainstream in India, the BitIndia exchange will let any layman to buy, sell and understand cryptocurrencies in the easiest and fastest scam free platform ever designed.\n\nThe BitIndia wallet aspire to become an essential part of daily routine activities such as buying groceries, paying bills or dining at a restaurant; while using cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. BitIndia exchange will let its users to trade on essential cryptocurrencies with the Indian currency. This will not only promote various cryptocurrencies in India but also promote blockchain technology globally.\n\nJohn McAfee, a renowned computer programmer and business, who founded the software company McAfee Associates in 1987, has also put his faith in BitIndia and has collaborated for partnership and as an advisor to BitIndia.\n\nWhat BitIndia wishes to achieve\n\nThe Indian total population is over 1.2 Billion, but only 0.5% are aware about Bitcoins. The percentage of knowing other cryptocurrencies is even lower.\n\nTherefore, the mission of BitIndia is to increase this percentage and bring around 20% of the population into Blockchain within the next 3 years by making them aware about blockchain and digital currencies. And thus, BitIndia envisions to reach out to each individual in India by providing an assured, reliable platform for Bitcoins and other cryptocurrency to trade in India.\n\nTeam:\n\nPartner and Advisor: John Mcafee\n\nFounder and CEO: Sahil Kohli\n\nCo Founder: Saumil Kohli\n\nTechnology Advisor: Kunal Nandwani\n\nDevelopment team:\n\nJai Kumar\n\nBhanu Pratap Singh\n\nPranshu Sharma\n\nShefali Sharma\n\nHimanshu Sharma\n\nPublic relations and experience:\n\nRajesh Rana\n\nSarabjeet Singh\n\nHeena Vinayak\n\nNikhil Batra\n\nRanjeet Kaur\n\nAdvisors:\n\nReuben Godfrey\n\nFabian Kippenberg\n\nVictor Wong\n\nSimon Cocking\n\nIssac Lee\n\nFrancisco Jo\n\nPress Contact Email Address\n\nico@bitindia.co\n\nSupporting Link\n\nhttps://bitindia.co/', 'Developers often use words like ""monolithic,"" ""blob"" and ""tangled"" to describe the code underpinning bitcoin.\n\nThese words paint a picture of how difficult the code can be to comprehend and, in turn, work with, and it\'s not exactly a comforting thought for a network supporting $61 billion in investor dollars. That\'s not to say bitcoin doesn\'t work – it does – but the state of the codebase does leave something to be desired, both for users who might desire more flexibility and the developers who want to improve it.\n\nSo, although changes like the code optimization Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the philosophy of so-called ""hard fork"" upgrades have attracted the most attention of late, several bitcoin developers are working under the radar to untangle bitcoin\'s messy architecture.\n\nChaincode\'s Russell Yanofsky, for one, is attempting to tackle one part of the problem with something called ""process separation"" in the Bitcoin Core code, the most used of the software options.\n\nYanofsky told CoinDesk:\n\n""Bitcoin is an older codebase. It\'s changed a lot over time. There are lots of parts of it where, if we were writing everything from scratch, we\'d probably do things differently. But since we have this legacy of code, we have to find ways to maintain it.""\n\nDitch the monolith\n\nTo begin to understand Yanofksy\'s process separation technique, you must first understand that the Bitcoin Core software is made up of many different pieces and two so-called ""processes"" that are lumped together in, some would argue, a random way.\n\nThe first process is called ""bitcoind"" and, according to Yanofsky, is made up of a few things: the peer-to-peer code, which connects the nodes in the network; the validation code, which checks whether transactions and blocks that a node receives are valid; and the wallet code, which stores a user\'s private keys.\n\nThe second process, ""bitcoin-qt,"" runs all of those things with the addition of a user interface so users with little tech experience can run a full node without using the command line.\n\nYanofsky thinks it would be better to separate some of these aspects of the code. To that end, he\'s creating a new process, ""bitcoin-walletd,"" which splits off the wallet code from bitcoind. And he\'s removing all of the code from bitcon-qt except the user interface.\n\nHis slides from a BitDevs presentation in New York City this week show the difference in structure:\n\nAt a high level, it may seem as if the various bitcoin processes are already completely separated, but in coding terms they aren\'t. So now, Yanofsky is essentially building barriers between the different components.\n\nIn this way, once the code is finished, the wallet portion will not be able to touch other parts of the code.\n\nMix and match\n\nSo, what would this mean for users? More flexibility, mostly.\n\nUsers can move things around like a puzzle, mixing and matching the pieces Yanofsky is splitting up. For example, with the wallet not tied to the node, users could take the wallet and use it with any bitcoin node.\n\n""Maybe if you\'re using an older wallet that doesn\'t support new features and you don\'t want to get rid of it – or you don\'t want to transfer your money out,"" the option to bring the wallet over to a different node might be useful, he said.\n\nIn much the same way, users might want to use the user inteface of bitcoin-qt with different bitcoind nodes.\n\n""You could basically have a bitcoin node running on a server someplace. Maybe you just want to run the GUI to just check what its bandwidth usage is or its peer-to-peer connections are,"" Yanofsky said.\n\nCreating more options for users, something bitcoin enthusiasts are particularly attentive to, is why Yanofsky is working on the project at all.\n\nWhile he admits his changes could slow things down a little, or make debugging code more difficult for developers, the project has gotten a GitHub blessing from several Bitcoin Core contributors, including lead maintainer Wladimir J. van der Laan and contributor Daniel Cousen.\n\nAnd that\'s partly because the advantages aren\'t only user-facing, Yanofksy said, adding:\n\n""There are user-visible features that come out of it, but there\'s also a big architectural and code cleanup component to it.""\n\nReview bottleneck\n\nWhile Yanofsky said he\'s almost done writing the code for the major upgrade, there\'s still a number of things need to happen before it can be officially added to Bitcoin Core.\n\n""The biggest problem with review is getting people\'s attention,"" he said.\n\nSince a number of open-source bitcoin developers have to review each code change before it can be added, and there is a limited number of developers with the expertise to review code changes, the process could be a long one.\n\nYanofsky also expects some other changes, such as Cory Fields\' peer-to-peer code additions and wallet code changes from his Chaincode colleague Matt Corallo, will also take precedence over his process separation change.\n\n""Right now the focus is definitely not in this area,"" Yanofsky said. ""Our biggest priority right now is getting better SegWit support. This feature will have to wait its turn.""\n\nBut while it\'s not on the priority list just yet, the work still promises to be an important change, as highlighted by Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell\'s comment on the Yanofsky\'s Github:\n\n""I think we should have done something like this a long time ago.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nLego image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

09/25/2017,"['Bitcoin enjoyed a great start to the week.\n\nThe digital coin, which has been sliding the past couple days amid uncertainty about the future of cryptocurrencies in China, was trading up over 7% at $3,928 per coin Monday morning.\n\nReports on September 14 that Chinese regulators would require exchanges to voluntary shut bitcoin trading triggered a sell-off of nearly $1,000, bringing the price of the cryptocurrency below $3,000 for the first time in over a month. Within hours, however, bitcoin recouped most of those losses.\n\nSince Friday, bitcoin has stayed within the range of $3,600 to $3,800 per coin.\n\nBut traders appear bullish, despite the uncertainty underpinning the market.\n\nJosh Olszwicz, a bitcoin trader, for instance, told Business Insider the news out of China won\'t have a long-term impact on bitcoin because it doesn\'t affect the cryptocurrency\'s blockchain, the underpinning technology of the coin.\n\n""If it doesn\'t affect the protocol, then it\'s not a real problem,"" he told Business Insider.""The bitcoin cash shakeup was much more worrisome from my perspective, but even then the core bitcoin protocol remained unaffected.""\n\nOn August 1, bitcoin forked into two different cryptocurrencies: bitcoin and bitcoin cash.\n\nTechnical analysis reported by CoinDesk, the cryptocurrency news site, suggested a break of $3,800 would open the door to $4,200 or higher.\n\n""Such a move would add credence to last week\'s bullish doji reversal and higher lows pattern, and may open the doors for $4,300,"" CoinDesk\'s Omkar Godbole wrote.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is up about 550% over the last year.', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\n* BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\n\nChina has banned ICOs and has ended cryptocurrency trading opportunities on the Chinese exchanges. However, it is moving ahead with steps to study the Blockchain technology in detail to issue its own digital currency.\n\nBeijing should “accelerate the process of launching a sovereign digital currency after it curbed risks of cryptocurrencies,” said an opinion piece published in the Financial News, the mouthpiece of the People’s Bank of China(PBOC).\n\nHowever, with credit rating agencies recently downgrading China’s sovereign rating, it is unlikely that a digital currency issued by the PBOC will displace Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nBitcoin has been trading in a small range for the past two days. It is facing resistance at the 3,800 levels. Today, even if the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line, it is unlikely to race away towards the highs. It will face resistance from the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $3,886.\n\nThereafter, the next resistance zone is between $4,050 and $4,120 levels. Unless Bitcoin breaks out of this, it is likely to remain range-bound and volatile. Nevertheless, a breakout of the downtrend line will change the trend from down to range bound.\n\nOn the downside, the digital currency has a strong support at $3,500 levels. A breakdown of this level can push the cryptocurrency back towards the lows of $2,974.\n\nCurrently, we don’t find a buy setup with a good risk to reward ratio. Nevertheless, aggressive traders can look for buying opportunities once Bitcoin breaks out and closes above the downtrend line. The initial stop loss can be kept at 3,500, which can be raised later. The position size shouldn’t be more than 25 percent of the normal.\n\nIf Bitcoin gains momentum, additional positions can be added above $4,120 levels. The first target objective on the upside is $4,680, above which a retest of the lifetime highs is likely.\n\nETH/USD\n\nEthereum is attempting to move higher. It has broken out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. It has also formed an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $311. The pattern target on a breakout of the triangle is $420.\n\nHowever, the digital currency will have to sustain above the uptrend line to keep the formation intact. If Ethereum breaks below the uptrend line, it will invalidate the pattern, sinking the digital currency to $235 levels.\n\nWe don’t find any trade as long as the cryptocurrency trades inside the triangle.\n\nWe recommend a long position on a breakout and close above $312, SL $260 and target $420. Traders should enter long positions only on a confirmed close above the overhead resistance. $344 might act as a resistance; however, we expect this level to be crossed.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nBitcoin Cash firmly remains below the downtrend line. It hasn’t done much in the past four days. $400 has acted as a strong support, however, lack of buying at higher levels has resulted in small range days.\n\nAs Bitcoin Cash is not showing any trend, we don’t have a recommendation on it. We shall consider it only after it sustains above the downtrend line for three days or breaks out of $550.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nRipple is not showing any trend. It is stuck in a tight range between $0.15000 and $0.19300. We don’t find any trade within this range.\n\nIf ripple breaks out of $0.20000, aggressive traders can initiate long positions with a target objective of $0.25000. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $0.15000. Nevertheless, please don’t allocate more than 25 percent of the usual position size on this trade, because it is a low conviction setup.\n\nOn the lower side, $0.15000 and $0.13500 are the two critical supports to watch out for.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nLitecoin has held the critical support of $45. However, it is struggling to move higher.\n\nIt is likely to break out of the downtrend line. However, it will not become positive until it breaks out of the $60 levels.\n\nIt is likely to remain range-bound between $45 and $57 for the next few days. Therefore, we are not recommending a trade on it. Critical levels to watch out are $60 on the upside and $45 on the downside.', ""Macau gaming company Dragon Corp is hoping to raise half a billion dollars through the ICO to integrate blockchain technology into the gambling market, according to CNBC.\n\nChinese authorities have launched a wide scale crackdown on bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading in recent weeks.\n\nBut Dragon's ICO won't be affected because the tokens will be issued in Hong Kong.\n\nThe digital transactions also mean authorities will be able to track illegal outflows through the casinos.\n\nProjects built on blockchain technology use ICOs to raise funds and issue tokens to investors."", 'North Korea may be turning to the shadowy internet currency bitcoin to get around increasingly intrusive U.S.-led sanctions barring its access to the world banking system and fund its missile and nuclear programs, financial experts warn.\n\nA recent private intelligence study detailed how the North Korean hackers have dramatically ramped up a bitcoin “mining” operation, and analysts say Pyongyang may be bent on using the elusive digital currency as a way to undermine U.S.-led efforts to financially isolate the regime of Kim Jong-un.\n\n“North Korea using these technologies is not exactly a loophole to the sanctions — that could be overstating the power of bitcoin itself,” Yaya Fanusie, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst, told The Washington Times. “But you have a cat-and-mouse game evolving, and this is just the type of emerging technology that the [U.S. intelligence community] needs to develop expertise to understand.”\n\nMr. Fanusie noted that, despite its reputation, bitcoin transactions can still be tracked by international authorities.\n\nBut a second former U.S. intelligence official told The Times on Monday that the digital currency did present major new challenges for American officials seeking to cut off North Korea’s money taps.\n\n“We’re good at tracking traditional banking, but bitcoin is not a Swiss bank,” said the former official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The U.S., he said, should not underestimate the North’s increasing hacking and online sophistication.\n\nThe bitcoin speculation comes amid rising tensions in the region, with the North Korean foreign minister telling reporters in New York that President Trump’s increasingly tough rhetoric and military moves amounted to a “declaration of war.”\n\nRecorded Future, a private cybersecurity firm, issued a report last week that identified what it said was a major effort by the cash-strapped regime to subvert financial sanctions.\n\nUnder persistent U.S. prodding, the U.N. Security Council last month unanimously banned North Korea from exporting coal, iron, lead and seafood worth about a third of its total income from trade. Permanent Council members Russia and China — North Korea’s neighbor and main trading partner — backed the resolution.\n\nEvading sanctions\n\nSome U.S. officials subsequently griped that Beijing, which is widely considered to be Pyongyang’s main source of cash, may avoid actually imposing the new sanctions. But the Trump administration last week announced a new agreement with China to effectively halt all financial transactions between North Korean entities and Chinese banks.\n\nEnter bitcoin.\n\nFinance analysts now fear that Pyongyang has begun using hard-to-trace digital currencies to generate cash and buy goods. It’s still unclear how the sanctions on traditional banking channels would affect bitcoin. According to the Recorded Future report, North Korea witnessed “a dramatic spike in activity from May 17 to July 3” related to a bitcoin “mining” operation.\n\nRecorded Future’s director of strategic threat development, Priscilla Moriuchi, told Voice of America in an interview, “Before then, I haven’t seen any activity indicating that [the North Koreans] were interested in bitcoin.”\n\nA former NSA threat analyst, Ms. Moriuchi added that the North’s suspected bitcoin activity is thus far tiny — roughly $100,000 — but the potential exists for the cryptocurrency to generate major income.\n\nThe effort is likely being run by North Korea’s military or intelligence, or at least conducted with their knowledge, she added. The massive amount of internet bandwidth needed for the detected bitcoin activity would have been noticed by Pyongyang.\n\nA creation of the digital age that reflects the libertarian impulses of much of the online community, bitcoins were launched in 2009 by a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto, who has never publicly come forward. Many analysts have suggested that he never existed.\n\nThe currency’s unique power comes from its independence from any individual government or central bank overseer. Unlike regular money, digital or cryptocurrencies are not connected to banks or governments and allow anonymous purchases or money exchanges completely outside the realm of banks, credit card firms or other third parties. Instead, the coins exist because users “mine” them by lending their computing power to verify other users’ transactions.\n\nMr. Fanusie, who currently oversees the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance analysis team, is also credited with analyzing the first verifiable instance of a terrorist organization attempting to use bitcoin to raise funds.\n\nHe said North Korea’s long track record for seeking cash and new assets through illicit activity, including the drug trade, counterfeiting or other smuggling, means bitcoin was a logical next step.\n\n“We are really talking about experimentation,” Mr. Fanusie said. “The [bitcoin technology] is still so nascent, state and nonstate actors are looking for ways to exploit it.”', 'Japan\'s Financial Services Agency (FSA) will begin more closely monitoring cryptocurrency exchanges from next month.\n\nAccording to the Japan Times, the increased scrutiny is aimed to ensure that the companies comply to the revised payment services law, passed in April this year, which set out operational standards for exchanges, as well as recognizing bitcoin as a form of legal tender.\n\nAn FSA executive reportedly indicated the surveillance is intended both to regulate the exchanges and to ensure the healthy growth of the cryptocurrency market, saying:\n\n""We pursue both market fostering and regulation enforcement. ... We aim for sound market development.""\n\nThe payment services law passed earlier this year established anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules for the exchanges. The law is also intended to enforce security standards aimed to protect the exchanges from the risk of cyberattack.\n\nThe law specifies that all exchanges must report to the authorities by the end of September to confirm they are compliant with the new rules. The FSA also has the remit to conduct on-site inspections if deemed necessary.\n\nTo monitor the over 20 cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Japan, the FSA last month established a specialised surveillance team, reportedly comprised of 30 staff members.\n\nJapan is no stranger to cryptocurrency based fraud, with 33 cases, representing more than a half of million dollars-worth of loses, reported in the first seven months of 2017.\n\nFurther, in 2014, the now-notorious Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox collapsed, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in customers\' funds. Japanese lawmakers have previously cited the exchange\'s failure as a key driver in the move to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nJapan surveillance image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', ""You’ve probably read it on a multitude of news outlets, but the decentralized virtual currency Bitcoin is on a seemingly unstoppable tear, rising over 54% in value the first two weeks of August alone. As of late August, its value was at $4,625 per coin. Taking an even wider step back, Bitcoin has outperformed virtually all major asset classes, rising over 520% in a one-year period.\n\nBut is this staggering trend sustainable, or are we merely in a bubble? There are a number of drivers behind a doubling of the value of the currency – and I think there's a case for a $10,000 coin in our near future.\n\nScarcity\n\nIt’s important to note just how scarce Bitcoin is. There are currently a little over 16.5 million Bitcoins in circulation, representing about $71 billion. That may seem like a lot, but compare that to how much currency is in circulation in the world – about $5 trillion worth – and Bitcoin is just a blip in the currency radar.\n\nOn top of this, it is estimated that some 25% of all Bitcoins mined are lost forever, either because of improperly generated wallets, lost keys, discarded hard drives or carelessness.\n\nSo what does this scarcity mean, really? For starters, it limits the total possible supply of Bitcoin that can be owned. This means that if the demand continues to increase, the price must go up.\n\nWhat Demand?\n\nWith the supply of Bitcoin limited, the reality is that enough people have to want it and use it in order for its price to go up. This presents a bit of a problem for some people, like billionaire investor Howard Marks, who said on CNBC, “There is no intrinsic value in Bitcoin.”\n\nThere are definitely two sides to the debate about the value of Bitcoin, however: It’s no accident that Bitcoin’s total market value is higher than the likes of Netflix, General Motors and American Express, seemingly eating entire large cap companies' worth of market share growth in just a few weeks.\n\nSo what exactly is powering this massive surge in growth? Below are a few reasons I think Bitcoin has started to gain larger adoption, and why this trend has good potential to increase over the foreseeable future.\n\n• Utility Value. Perhaps the largest use case for Bitcoin is as a fungible instrument: It can be used like fiat currency, to buy and sell goods of value as a form of currency exchange. It is also very fast and inexpensive to move in comparison to traditional banking.\n\n• Increased Accessibility. Bitcoin is becoming increasingly easier to purchase and trade. CoinMarketCap lists over 75 exchanges that actively traded at least $1 million in Bitcoin within the last 24 hours, and according to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 1,400 Bitcoin ATMs currently operating, which represents a 100% increase in circulation compared to just a year ago.\n\n• Highly Liquid. Due to very high daily trade volumes and a strong open order book, Bitcoin can be purchased and sold almost instantly in relatively large amounts. It can be converted to other currencies or to a local currency at a moment's notice.\n\n• Store Of Value. Although it wasn’t designed as a store of value, Bitcoin has proven to be a fairly good instrument to store or increase value over its lifetime. Just $1,000 invested in 2010 would be worth of $70 million today.\n\n• Non-Banked. Cade Metz made a case in a Wired article about how Bitcoin might thrive in the developing or emerging markets where local currency may be unstable due to political issues or where the majority of the population is non-banked. In these areas, Bitcoin may be the best alternative to fiat, since all that is needed is an internet-connected device such as a smartphone."", 'News\n\nThe operator of Kakao Stock, a popular Korean securities trading app based on the country’s number one smartphone messenger app Kakao Talk, is launching a cryptocurrency exchange called Upbit. Over 110 cryptocurrencies will be supported initially including bitcoin, ether, and litecoin. The company says that it will be the largest digital currency exchange in South Korea.\n\nAlso read: Popular Korean Talk-Based Stock Trading App Adding Cryptocurrency Exchange\n\nKorea’s Largest Crypto Exchange Launching\n\nSouth Korean fintech company Dunamu Inc. announced on Monday that it will beta launch a cryptocurrency exchange called “Upbit” next month. News.Bitcoin.com first reported on the company planning to launch this exchange back in August. The company claims that Upbit will be the largest digital currency exchange in South Korea.\n\nLaunched in April 2012, Dunamu is affiliated with Kakao Corp, the company behind Kakao Talk, Korea’s number one smartphone messenger app with over 200 million users worldwide. Kakao Talk is installed on over 95% of smartphones in South Korea. Dunamu also operates a popular securities trading app called Kakao Stock, a social trading service based on Kakao Talk.\n\nUpbit will be accessible through the Android and iOS platforms, as well as on desktop computers through its website. The service will also offer coin investment guides with analyses of various altcoins. In addition, the new exchange will also offer internal Bitgo wallets to their users as well as Kakao Pay authentication for added security, its website states.\n\nPre-registration for Upbit begins on Monday, September 25. According to Edaily, pre-registered users will be entered into a drawing to receive one coin from the list of cryptocurrencies which will trade on Upbit, including bitcoin.\n\nExclusive Agreement with Bittrex\n\nIn order to launch Upbit, Dunamu signed an exclusive partnership agreement with the U.S. Digital currency exchange Bittrex, which supports over 190 cryptocurrencies, according to its website.\n\nInitially, Upbit will offer the trading of over 110 cryptocurrencies, KBS World Radio, detailed:\n\nUpbit will trade over 110 different digital currencies including bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and litecoin. In comparison, existing exchanges in South Korea trade around six to eight virtual currencies.\n\nCurrently, users in South Korea wanting to trade most cryptocurrencies have to “transfer money to overseas exchanges such as Bittrex, Poloniex, etc,” the Korea Financial Times explained. They would encounter problems such as “time delays, complicated account management, and language barriers,” the news outlet noted, adding that Upbit will eliminate these problems and will therefore “raise the domestic virtual currency trading environment to a world-class level.”\n\nWhat do you think of Upbit?

Many participate to get funding for business or personal projects.\n\nWhat sets Valu apart from crowdfunding platforms, however, is that it also allows the trading of tokens called “VA” between those who list them. VAs are exchangeable with bitcoin.\n\nIn essence, the system is akin to that of an initial public offering. To attract buyers, users may offer gifts or services, as in the case of a musician granting access to exclusive demo tracks or a physician giving free check-ups.\n\nThe beauty of Valu is that anyone can join — but celebrities, apparently, hold the upper hand.\n\nHikaru, who happens to have 2.2 million subscribers on YouTube, joined the platform some time last month. On Aug. 14, he announced that he wanted to do something interesting and will “move his Valu shares in one moment,” Bloomberg noted.\n\nThat pitch made his shares soar on the market. But just a week after going public, Hikaru, together with two friends who go by the monikers Ikkun and Raphael, cashed out, Reuters reported.\n\nHikaru’s action led to an astronomical drop in his shares, and understandably, outrage in the Japanese internet. Reuters quoted one Valu user as saying:\n\n“I was a fan of Hikaru so I bought his ‘Valu’ partly to support him and this is what happened. I want my money back.”\n\nHikaru, who admitted that he only listed to get attention, announced earlier this month that he would quit YouTube. According to Bloomberg, he and his friends netted 54,650,000 yen ($490,000) in bitcoin.\n\nHikaru’s management promised to compensate users. However, Hikaru stressed that he did not do anything unlawful, as far as Valu’s terms and conditions apply. In addition, Japan’s Financial Services Agency does not consider VAs a financial product.\n\nIf anything, the Hikaru scandal is a wake-up call for Valu, which has since tweaked its rules for trading. Stock sales are now limited to a tenth of total shares issued per person per day. Users have also been limited to 30 transactions per day. Daily price swings, meanwhile, are capped to 50% fall and 200% rise.\n\nIt is unclear as to what extent Hikaru’s investors had been/will be compensated.\n\nFeature Image via Youtube / ????Hikaru?']"
09/26/2017,"['Copper and bitcoin don’t obviously have much in common.\n\nOne is an industrial metal, mined by giant trucks and used in everything from computer chips to plumbing tubes, the other a cryptocurrency that’s ’mined’ only in a virtual sense.\n\nYet the two have been moving in near unison for the past two months. Bitcoin and copper both rallied strongly from mid-July to early September. Then when bitcoin tumbled as Chinese regulators moved to clamp down on the trading of cryptocurrencies, the copper rally also went into reverse.\n\nOn a four-week basis, the correlation between the metal and the cryptocurrency is currently more than 0.95, showing prices have moved almost completely in lockstep. The reading matches that of gold and silver and exceeds Apple and the S&P 500.\n\nTo explain the near perfect relationship between the two investments, analysts are looking at China. The country accounts for about half of global demand in industrial metals and traders and investors there have become increasingly dominant in the market. The same trend’s now visible in cryptocurrencies.\n\n""A lot of metal speculation comes from China, and most of the recent interest in trading cryptocurrencies has been coming from China,"" said Matthew Turner, metals analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London. ""The factors that drive Chinese speculation could have an impact on both metals and cryptocurrencies.""\n\nThe similar price action in the two markets highlights how important Chinese sentiment has become for both.\n\nCharlie Morris, chief investment officer at Newscape Capital Advisors Ltd. said there had been ""huge amounts of interest from China"" in bitcoin.\n\n“There’s been a huge amount of punting on bitcoin,” he said. “China is obviously quite strong in this space.”\n\nTo read a story on Hong Kong and cryptocurrencies, click here.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese traders are increasingly ""setting the price"" for industrial metals, Macquarie argued in a note earlier this month. The Australian bank said a surge in bullish bets on copper at New York’s Comex exchange, which hit a record high in early September, had likely been driven by Chinese investors.\n\n""Anecdotally, we hear that Comex became increasingly popular with Chinese funds,"" Macquarie said.\n\nIndeed, some in the copper industry believe that the price has rallied too far -- even after a 6.6 percent retrenchment from three-year high of $6,970 a metric ton on Sept. 5. Ivan Arriagada, chief executive of copper miner Antofagasta Plc, on Monday suggested he expected further falls in the short term.\n\n“Our perspective over the medium to long term is favorable, but over the short term we will have volatility due to market conditions that have to do with the Chinese economy,” Arriagada said in Santiago.\n\nIt’s not just copper that has been rising and falling in tune with bitcoin. Barry Ehrlich, analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow, pointed out in a note that nickel, palladium and the share price of MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC all displayed a strong correlation with the cryptocurrency over the past few months.\n\n""We conclude that key metals/Norilsk are being driven by similar China liquidity and policy developments that are affecting Bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nBut while the correlation between metals and bitcoin has emerged in recent months, it is unclear whether it will be long-lived.\n\n""Bitcoin is primarily about getting money out of China, whereas there are a whole host of reasons that you might invest in copper,"" said Guy Wolf, head of market analytics at Marex Spectron Group.\n\n""You’ve got a completely different type of investor driving it, and in the case of copper, sometimes things like a shift in the currency or liquidity in China really matter, and sometimes they don’t,"" Wolf said.\n\n— With assistance by Laura Millan Lombrana', 'Last month, North Korea was banned from exporting coal to China, its biggest buyer. The rogue regime may have found a new use for these idle coal supplies: powering bitcoin mines.\n\nThat’s according to research by Recorded Future, an information security firm that counts the Central Intelligence Agency’s venture capital arm among its investors, and security non-profit Team Cymru. The research identified activity that the firms believe is bitcoin mining in North Korea starting on May 17. The analysts don’t know if the mining is ongoing, but the activity was present in the last data point Recorded Future collected, from July 6, the firm told Quartz.\n\nBitcoin mining consumes large amounts of electricity to feed the vast computational power necessary for miners to release new supplies of bitcoin. The bitcoin network releases 12.5 bitcoins (about $50,000 worth, at the current bitcoin price) every 10 minutes to a miner as an incentive for checking bitcoin transactions and adding them to the cryptocurrency’s immutable, distributed ledger, known as the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin mines are generally large server farms containing thousands of machines specifically designed to mine the cryptocurrency. One of the world’s largest bitcoin mines, in Inner Mongolia, runs an electricity bill of $39,000 a day. North Korea is among the top 10 net exporters of coal globally, according to the International Energy Agency (pdf, p.17). Since the country can no longer earn revenue from coal exports, it makes sense that it might put some coal to use generating electricity for a bitcoin mine.\n\nRecorded Future also found that North Korean elites, who have unrestricted access to the internet, were using virtual private networks (VPNs) to make online purchases with bitcoin. These North Korean VPN users were also checking their Gmail accounts, logging into Twitter, buying expensive sneakers, and watching porn. The firm was able to track the activity because the VPNs and other traffic-masking techniques were used incorrectly, it said.\n\nThe researchers couldn’t tell how much processing power North Korea’s suspected bitcoin mines possess. But they believe it’s just one part of a larger strategy to generate revenue for the increasingly isolated regime. Previously FireEye, another security firm, found evidence that North Korean hackers were targeting South Korean bitcoin exchanges to steal their crypto funds. North Korea is also believed to be behind the global ransomware attack WannaCry, which froze computer systems and demanded a bitcoin payment to unlock them.', 'Banks in Singapore are reportedly moving to close accounts tied to a number of cryptocurrency firms.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg today, as many as 10 companies have reported issues in recent weeks. Anson Zeall, head of Singapore\'s cryptocurrency and blockchain industry association, ACCESS, supported the claim, stating the closures remain unexplained by the banks. Further, he urged the country\'s authorities to take a stance on the matter.\n\n""We would urge Singapore to take a leadership role and demonstrate how to come to an effective resolution among all parties,"" Zeall said.\n\nHowever, any support may not be forthcoming.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country\'s central bank, told Bloomberg that it doesn\'t interfere with commercial decisions taken by individual banks. The central bank added it was the responsibility of the banks in question to establish operational protocols to ensure they comply with fraud protection and customer due-diligence laws.\n\nCoinHako, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency provider announced the closure of its DBS Bank account in a blog post.\n\nWhile it did not state a reason for the bank\'s decision, it said: ""Regulations and the exact role of the blockchain in society continues to present as a grey area to everyone.""\n\nThe exchange told customers it will not be able to process Singapore dollar deposits and withdrawals until a new bank account can be opened – a process it expects to take several weeks.\n\nThe account closures come soon after the MAS issued a release stating that digital tokens, distinguished from cryptocurrencies, may be classified as securities. The release was followed by another statement which warned customers about the risks of investing in initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nThe central bank has, however, shown enthusiasm for digital currency technology in other areas, completing a distributed ledger trial focused on inter-bank payments back in March.\n\nSingapore image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The run up in prices in 2017 has been faster and quicker than in other known bubbles, such as the tech stock bubble of 1999. The price run is even being compared with the tulip mania seen in Europe in the 1600’s. This period saw a parabolic movement in the futures price of a single tulip bulb to ten times the annual income of a skilled worker. Inevitably, the speculative bubble popped and the price crashed. Fortunes were lost in a matter of days, and many believe this is likely to happen to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat causes bitcoin to devalue?\n\nThere have been a number of events in bitcoin’s past that have caused significant downside pressure. Here are some of the causes:\n\nBitcoin exchanges closing or failing, for example BTCC or Mt. Gox Changes in regulation on a governmental level, such as China banning bitcoin Contentious changes in technology or the risks that come with hard forks Delays in technological upgrades to the blockchain Scalability issues, slow network validation, and expensive transaction costs\n\nWhilst these risks are inherently part of a decentralised cryptocurrency, it’s interesting to see that while many people are calling the top for bitcoin prices, not many have followed up with a trade. There are many potential reasons for this, but a prominent answer you hear is that it’s hard to short bitcoin.\n\nHow does shorting work in traditional markets?\n\nIn more traditional markets, shorting is possible by borrowing a share or contract from someone else, selling it at the current market price, and then buying back the original asset when the price has (hopefully) moved lower. You can then give back what you originally borrowed, and pocket the difference in the price.\n\nThis can be hard for bitcoin because there are significant risks in lending out your cryptocurrency to someone else without an intermediary. If you were to lend bitcoin directly to someone else, there would be nothing to stop them from pocketing the digital currency and disappearing forever. There are, however, other options if you are looking to short bitcoin.\n\nOne option would be to spread bet or place a CFD trade on the price action of the cryptocurrency. This can be accomplished without holding or borrowing the underlying coin.\n\nHow to short bitcoin with spread betting or CFD trading\n\nWhen you trade cryptocurrencies with a spread betting or CFD provider, you are placing a speculative bet on the point movement in the underlying market. This not only means that you don’t need to borrow or hold the underlying cryptocurrency, but it also means that you don’t need a crypto wallet or have to deal with the movement of bitcoin between exchanges, wallets and other people.\n\nWhen you spread bet on bitcoin you place a size-per-point you are looking to trade against each dollar movement in the underlying asset. For example, if you were to place a spread bet of £5 per point, you would make or lose £5 for each dollar movement. If you were shorting bitcoin and the price went from $4000 to $3990 you would make ten points, and therefore £50. By the same principle, if the market moved against you and went from $4000 to $4015 you would lose 15 points and therefore be down £75. CFD trading is the same, however each value per point is based on a contract size rather than bet size.\n\nShorting bitcoin and risk management\n\nShorting any asset can be risky, but due to the volatility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it’s very important to pay particular attention to risk management. Whenever you are planning your trade it’s worth having a look back at historic price action to see what sort of movement you would expect to see in a normal day, and to use stops to manage your risk.\n\nIs now the time to short bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen significant price movements over the last few years. As with all assets, no one knows for sure where the price will be tomorrow, let alone in a year’s time, and this provides both trading opportunity and risk in equal measure.\n\nProminent critics of bitcoin, such as JP Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, have said that the cryptocurrency could go to $10,000 or more before the bubble bursts. Others point to the fact that people have been calling the end of bitcoin since 2010 when a single coin was priced at $0.23.\n\nWith this in mind, a good trade plan and an understanding of risk management principles is essential.', 'The number of merchants accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment has steadily increased over the past year. The latest to accept Bitcoin is Sharps Pixley, a London gold dealer.\n\nSharps who?\n\nSharps Pixley, whose origins date to 1778, is a London-based dealer of precious metals. It is a full member of the London Bullion Market Association. It acts as a full service shop for investors to buy, store and trade precious metals. Although it has been in operation for ~250 years, Sharps Pixley has shown that it is in sync with the times by deciding to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.\n\nRoss Norman, the CEO of Sharps Pixley, said:\n\n“It is our view that many investors in Bitcoin would like the option of holding intrinsic value in a traditional safe haven asset like gold; and be able to switch across in a simple and cost effective way. That avenue is now open to them.”\n\nDigital gold\n\nBitcoin may be called digital gold, but it still has a long way to go before it can rival gold as a safe haven asset. The volume of gold traded annually is estimated to be $22 tln and there is a flourishing derivatives market for it. Bitcoin investors represent a niche class of investors, although awareness about cryptocurrencies is increasing.\n\nGiles Mable, a Business Development Director at Sharps Pixley, said:\n\n“We are bridging the gap between the world’s oldest currency and its newest, offering new and existing customers the means to exchange and diversify digital currency for a real, tangible asset which they can store and trade at Sharps Pixley.”\n\nBitcoin accepted through Bitpay\n\nSharps Pixley will accept Bitcoins for the sale of gold through the payment processor Bitpay. This will help them avoid any risk of Bitcoin’s fluctuating price. Given that Sharps Pixley’s core competency lies in trading precious metals, the decision not to accept Bitcoins directly is wise.\n\nUnless merchants have some costs which are denominated in Bitcoin (and not fiat), they will be exposing themselves to Bitcoin’s price volatility if they accept Bitcoins directly. We still have a long way to go before Bitcoin can be used at each stage of a product’s value chain – right from the raw material to the sale to the end customer.', 'The crypto markets continued to climb on Tuesday, with the vast majority of top 100 cryptocurrencies posting moderate gains. The bitcoin price rose to within striking distance of $4,000, while the ethereum price edged past $290 to continue its march toward $300. Altogether, the markets added more than $5 billion.\n\nThe total crypto market cap began the day at $131.5 billion, having risen past the $130 billion mark the day before. Monday afternoon, it quickly shot up to $135 billion and eventually rose to a present value of $137.2 billion–its highest point since September 20.\n\nBitcoin Price Eyes $4,000\n\nThe bitcoin price led the advance with a 4% increase. After falling close to $3,500 a few days ago, bitcoin is once again challenging the $4,000 mark. Within the past day, the bitcoin price has risen from $3,762 to $3,934, placing it just $66 below this psychologically-important threshold. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $65.3 billion.\n\nSome analysts have attributed this movement to increasing tensions between North Korea and the United States, noting parallels to similar events last month. Another factor that is likely influencing bitcoin’s climb is the continued emergence of Asian markets such as South Korea and Japan in the wake of China’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. Notably, South Korean messaging platform Kakao announced the creation of a new cryptocurrency exchange, named Upbit. Developers say it will support 110 cryptocurrencies and predict it will be the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea.\n\nEthereum Price Crosses $290\n\nThe ethereum price did not climb as quickly as bitcoin on Tuesday, but it did manage to post a 1% gain to continue its gradual climb. Though minor, this positive movement enabled the ethereum price to tick up past $290. The ethereum price currently rests at $291–less than $9 below the $300 mark. This gives ethereum a market cap of $27.6 billion.\n\nLitecoin Recovers Past $50\n\nThe altcoin markets were characterized continued upward movement, with every cryptocurrency in the top 15 posting at least a minor gain.\n\nBitcoin cash rose more than 4%, bringing its price to $451 and market cap to $7.5 billion. Ripple increased 3% following news that the FinTech startup was opening a new office in Singapore, further increasing its Asian presence.\n\nThe litecoin price advanced 7% following a disappointing week. Today’s trading helped the litecoin price recover past the $50 mark to a present value of $52. Dash, on the other hand, rose just 1%, causing it fall behind litecoin on the market cap charts.\n\nSeventh-place NEM rose 5%, while IOTA increased by 1%. The Monero price rose 3%, lifting its market cap to $1.4 billion. NEO–which recently supplanted ethereum classic as the 10th-largest cryptocurrency–continued its dramatic rise with a 21% climb to $26.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'A young man died suddenly in Colorado this year, leaving his family the burden of sorting out his estate. Little did they know their loved one had been investing in Bitcoin, the digital currency that cost as little as $13 in 2013 and recently climbed as high as $5,000.\n\nThe grieving family stood to inherit a small fortune—that is, if they could only find and access the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoins are a virtual form of money protected by unbreakable cryptography. This attribute makes it a secure way to store wealth but also creates the risk that when Bitcoin owners die, their digital fortune will be out of reach forever. That’s a major problem for the relatives of tech-savvy individuals who have invested in a market currently worth about $70 billion.\n\nIllustration by Se?bastien Thibault\n\nBitcoins are stored in a virtual wallet. Each wallet uses a string of random characters called a “public key,” visible to anyone, as an address for sending and receiving the cryptocurrency. A separate “private key” allows the owner access to the wallet’s contents.\n\nIf a Bitcoin owner dies without passing on the private key, his heirs may discover his wallet only to realize that they will never gain access to the wealth inside. To prevent this, the owner simply has to ensure that someone gets a copy of the private key by writing it down, storing it on a flash memory drive, or entrusting it with a commercial service that manages them.\n\nBut some of these methods come with their own perils. Suzanne Walsh, a wills and estate attorney with Murtha Cullina, says executors and heirs may fail to recognize a private Bitcoin key for what it is and end up discarding it—hence the attraction of a commercial service.\n\nIndeed, that’s the reason why the family of the Colorado man will likely be able to recover his Bitcoins, Walsh says. The family discovered the man invested in Bitcoin upon reviewing his bank account, which revealed debits to Coinbase, a popular wallet and exchange service. With documents in hand, the family approached the San Francisco company, which confirmed the existence of a wallet and is in the process of transferring its contents. (Other exchanges also have policies to transfer virtual currency to next of kin but are reluctant to discuss the issue for fear that fraudsters will use fake death claims to steal customers’ Bitcoins.)\n\nBut what if you don’t know about the existence of a deceased person’s Bitcoins?\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nHenry Leibowitz, an attorney at Proskauer, says executors typically use tax filings as a way to locate assets. He likens the Bitcoin situation to a time when people died with stock certificates in shoe boxes—sometimes they would go unnoticed for decades until the corporation that issued them concluded that nobody would redeem them and turned them over to a state government’s unclaimed property division.\n\nFinally, if the Bitcoins are not listed in a will, they are susceptible to what estate lawyers call “probate by truck”—where heirs walk off with property by claiming that “he would have wanted me to have it.” The difference is, instead of a favorite lamp or piece of jewelry, a relative might walk off with the private key to a Bitcoin wallet worth thousands or millions of dollars.\n\nA version of this article appears in the Oct. 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline “Breaking the Bitcoin Bank.”']"

Prices have climbed more than four-fold this year -- a run that has drawn debate over whether that’s a bubble.\n\n“I haven’t invested in it,” Gorman said. “I’ve talked to a lot of people who have. It’s obviously highly speculative but it’s not something that’s inherently bad. It’s a natural consequence of the whole blockchain technology.”\n\nGorman did wonder “at what point do regulators -- like the Chinese have been saying -- just decide we want to control monetary flows for money laundering and privacy and capital outflows and all the other reasons.”\n\nDimon differentiated between the bitcoin currency and the underlying blockchain technology, which he said can be useful. He also noted that his daughter had bought some bitcoin.\n\nWatch This Next', ""Earlier this year, the SEC rejected two similar Rule 19b?4 applications for the exchange listing of digital currency products, based upon the SEC's analysis of the current state of regulation of the underlying digital currency markets and related derivatives markets.

I know people who lost all their money like that.”\n\nIt came only weeks after Chase Bank CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud, and made his distaste for Bitcoin crystal clear when he suggested he would fire any employee trading Bitcoin on the company’s accounts. However, JP Morgan bought a large block of Bitcoins days after the CEO statement.\n\nBut Jamie Dimon is not the only one with this view on Bitcoin. Ray Dalio, the founder and head of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater, recently stated that Bitcoin is “a highly speculative market”, and in fact is a “bubble”.\n\nBelfort also finds it “bizarre” that Bitcoin is only backed by a program that creates artificial scarcity and said that because of this, the digital currency is not sustainable.\n\nAlthough Belfort believes in the concept of cryptocurrencies, he stated the current model holds too many problems. According to him, there is a future for digital currencies, but he thinks it’s essential for digital coins to get “some sort of backing” by central governments.\n\nIn his opinion, a central bank will sooner or later introduce their own cryptocurrency, which will be more sustainable.\n\n“There will be a time when everybody is freaking out about Bitcoin and dumps it and who knows what’s going to happen?”\n\nIn a situation like that there’s no buffer, for example the Federal Reserve, to cushion the blow.\n\nHe issued a final warning to investors and said, “Be very careful not to invest a lot of money into something that could vanish very quickly.”', 'A subsidiary of retail giant Overstock.com (OSTK) announced a fully regulated digital coin trading exchange on Wednesday, a step toward creating an entire Wall Street exchange using cryptocurrencies.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe venture, spearheaded by tZero, RenGen and the Argon Group, aims to “transform the trading of security tokens issued in Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) in compliance with SEC and FINRA regulations,” according to the press release.

Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne believes the new joint venture will only increase liquidity in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nByrne told FOX Business during an interview last week that blockchain will be a disruptor in the market and that’s why his company has been trying to pioneer the technology on Wall Street.\n\n“Blockchain is going to be as disruptive to all kinds of institutions like banks as the internet was itself to publishing … a commodity turns into money when it becomes useful and this underlying technology of bitcoin, this thing called blockchain, is extraordinarily useful and that’s here to stay,” Byrne told Maria Bartiromo of Mornings with Maria.\n\nHe also said it will decrease costs associated with trading traditional securities by about 90%.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, bitcoin was valued at more than $4,080.', 'Bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold?\n\nThere could be multiple cryptocurrencies bearing the bitcoin name if a small group of miners and developers carry out a planned fork of the blockchain this month.\n\nStyled as a rebellion of sorts, bitcoin gold aims to follow a similar launch plan as bitcoin cash – the blockchain that split from bitcoin this summer by way of a ""hard fork."" The idea of the project is to release an improved protocol, one that will challenge bitcoin cash in particular, and details are now starting to come into focus.\n\nLed by Jack Liao, CEO of Hong Kong mining firm LightningASIC, bitcoin gold is slated to launch on October 25, with its cryptocurrency being opened to exchanges on November 1.\n\nStill, while whispers of the event are just beginning to spread, the importance of the project appears up for debate. Given that bitcoin cash produced an ultimately smaller bitcoin network, not to mention a cryptocurrency that\'s worth about 12 percent as much as bitcoin at press time, most seem to view the plan as another distraction in an already divided community.\n\nFor one, bitcoin gold looks like it could be even smaller than bitcoin cash, at least in that not as many miners seem to support it.\n\nIn remarks, BTC.Top founder Jiang Zhuoer and ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang – two early champions of bitcoin cash – went so far as to downplay bitcoin gold as insignificant.\n\n\'Decentralized again\'\n\nBut while those in the know might be skeptical of bitcoin gold, it does have a goal that many in the community may find attractive: creating a truly decentralized bitcoin.\n\nMost notably, the developers behind the network hope to open up mining to more participants by replacing bitcoin\'s mining algorithm with one that will enable it to be mined with graphics cards. The idea is to make big miners – sometimes controversial figures on the network – less relevant.\n\n""Bitcoin gold will implement a proof-of-work change from bitcoin\'s SHA256 to Equihash, a memory-hard algorithm that is ASIC-resistant and optimized for GPU mining,"" explained pseudonymous bitcoin gold developer ""The Sorrow.""\n\nThat the plan is being hatched in China, long the hotbed of bitcoin mining, only adds another layer to the story. Liao, whose mining hardware largely focuses on the litecoin network, is seen as one of the few voices domestically that can challenge the established order.\n\nYet, Liao was quick to name one mining firm in particular, Bitmain, as the reason that more bitcoin users should support the idea. A mining company that has been at the center of bitcoin drama over the last year, critics have long argued that the firm has too much of an influence over the network.\n\nStill, creating a network that grows so popular as to remove miners is easier said than done, and some are skeptical that this would lead to the end goal that bitcoin gold advocates desire.\n\n""GPU mining can\'t prevent centralization. GPU [markets] are controlled by Nvidia and AMD,"" Zhao Dong, a cryptocurrency trader and investor, argued in response to the plan.\n\nLiao, however, argued the accessibility of the companies\' products means the distribution of hashing power might evolve differently.\n\nBitcoin gold\'s unknowns\n\nAgain, though, even project leaders admit many of the details around the hard fork are fuzzy.\n\nBitcoin gold\'s pseudonymous lead developer ""h4x"" said that the project is ""still evolving"" and details such as exact block height of the hard fork are still up for discussion.\n\nAccording to the original website text, bitcoin gold was even planning an initial coin offering (ICO) by which 1 percent of the bitcoin gold coins would go to the developer team, but these details have since been removed.\n\nOne thing is clear though about the funding: because of the nature of the split, every bitcoin user at the time will have an equal amount of bitcoin gold associated with their private key.\n\n""It is a minimalist fork of the Bitcoin Core codebase in the spirit of litecoin – only a few conservative modifications,"" said h4x.\n\nH4x went on to describe bitcoin gold in more abstract biological terms, arguing that it tests how well hard forks work and if they benefit the ecosystem.\n\nHe said:\n\n""Organisms derive benefits from creating offspring. With bitcoin gold we are conducting an experiment to see if that principle holds true in the world of blockchains.""\n\nAnd this sentiment is largely in line with developers who have predicted that more bitcoin forks similar to bitcoin cash will come forth in the future.\n\nAfter bitcoin cash forked earlier this summer, for example, Lightning Network developer Tadge Dryja argued that more forks would spring up, but for another reason: money.\n\nWith bitcoin gold in the works and another hard fork slated for November, it seems that prediction is slowly becoming reality.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

According to Khalid Al Rumaihi, the chief executive of the Economic Development Board of Bahrain, the Bahrain’s finance ministry is keen on adopting digital currencies and had even suggested that Bahrain could issue “bonds on a digital currency.”\n\nIn response to a query at the MIT Innovation Forum in the country’s capital city Manama on Wednesday, Rumaihi said that Bahrain was “open to Bitcoin,” adding that a regulatory sandbox was the proper way for the island country to allow experimentation in a controlled environment.\n\nThe Bahrain Central Bank recently put in place a regulatory sandbox. Four companies applied so far, and two had already received approval.\n\nRumaihi said that a Bitcoin company from Saudi Arabia was looking to establish a Bitcoin exchange in Bahrain. “We are working with the Central Bank of Bahrain on this,” he said, adding:\n\n“I hate to be a regulator today. Because we are obliged to protect the consumers and customers. There is fear about funding and anti-money laundering. We are going to be looking through the Regulatory Sandbox allowing small-scale experimentation.”\n\nBahrain wants to become a pioneer in the burgeoning fintech space and according to Rumaihi, national adoption of blockchain technology will be a key enabler of this.\n\n“The ability for blockchain to be adopted at country level is a huge opportunity for Bahrain to move into the spotlight as a pioneer in this space,” he said at the GCC Financial Forum in Manama earlier this year. “Blockchain will unlock so many different possibilities for business in the way email and Internet did years ago.”\n\nLast month, Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation, also known as Bank ABC, joined the R3 distributed ledger consortium, becoming the first bank in the Middle East and North Africa region to join the group.\n\nSael Al Waary, deputy group CEO at Bank ABC, said the collaboration will allow the bank to develop innovative financial products for its clientele and “propel us further to achieve our strategic goals.”\n\nBank ABC’s group head of information technology Stuart Rennie, added “access to the wealth of knowledge and resources available through the R3 consortium will strengthen Bank ABC to leverage our investment in technology and support the delivery of our digital strategy.”', 'Never miss a great news story!\n\nGet instant notifications from Economic Times\n\nAllowNot now\n\nYou can switch off notifications anytime using browser settings.']"
09/28/2017,"['Peter Schiff, a renowned investor, author, and financial commentator, who has consistently offered baseless condemnation on Bitcoin, has demonstrated why the demand toward Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market can no longer be ignored.\n\nOn social media platforms, Schiff announced that GoldMoney, the parent company of SchiffGold, his gold businesses acquired in 2014, will be offering Bitcoin brokerage services to its clients. Schiff claimed that it is not an endorsement of cryptocurrencies but a response to the growing demand toward Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is not a bubble...\n\nThroughout the past few years, Schiff has continuously described Bitcoin as a bubble. Schiff explained that Bitcoin was a bubble when the price of Bitcoin hit $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 and most recently, $5,000. In August, Schiff told Coindesk:\n\n""There\'s certainly a lot of bullishness about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and that\'s the case with bubbles in general. The psychology of bubbles fuels it. You just become more convinced that it\'s going to work. And the higher the price goes, the more convinced you become that you\'re right. But it\'s not going up because it\'s going to work. It\'s going up because of speculation.""\n\nThere definitely were bubbles in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets in the past. But, it is completely inaccurate to describe Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as bubbles. Schiff has always introduced the concept of intrinsic value to justify the superiority of gold over Bitcoin, but like any asset or currency, the value of Bitcoin depends on its market. Within the last eight years, the cryptocurrency market has become more liquid than the most liquid stock in the world, Apple.\n\nBitcoin is money...\n\nSchiff fundamentally believes that Bitcoin is not money. By definition, money is a medium of exchange and the value of it should be dependent on the market and users. But, the value of government-issued fiat currencies are manipulated by central banks and were enforced against the will of the people, like the US government replacing gold with the US dollar. Whether Bitcoin is money or not, is not decided by the government or central entities. There are many users, merchants, and businesses utilizing Bitcoin as money, a digital currency, and a store of value. Hence, Bitcoin is money.\n\nAccording to McAfee and Bank of Finland\n\nAs security expert John McAfee stated:\n\n“It costs $1000 to mine one Bitcoin. What does it cost to print US dollar? Which one is the fraud?”\n\nMore to that, the Bank of Finland further emphasized in its research paper that Bitcoin is a decentralized financial network that cannot be regulated and censored by central entities, as it operates its own economy in a peer-to-peer ecosystem. It further encouraged economists to study the “marvelous” structure of Bitcoin.\n\n""Bitcoin is a monopoly run by a protocol, not by a managing organization. Familiar monopolies are run by managing organizations, with discretion to determine and then change prices, offerings and rules. Monopolies are often regulated to prevent or at least mitigate their abuse of power. [Bitcoin\'s] apparent functionality and usefulness should further encourage economists to study this marvelous structure,” read the Bank of Finland research paper.', 'An effort to allow investors to trade digital currencies as easily as stocks stumbled when backers withdrew two proposals to list bitcoin funds.\n\nIntercontinental Exchange’s NYSE Arca exchange on Wednesday withdrew an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Van Eck Associates Corp pulled a registration document for a bitcoin fund after saying the SEC told them they would not review the filing until futures contracts on the digital currency start trading.\n\n“Although digital currency market regulation continues to rapidly evolve, at this time Grayscale does not believe there have been enough regulatory developments to prompt the SEC to approve the … application,” Grayscale said in a statement.

How does one describe rates and the yield curve that are either directly determined by CBs (BoJ or PBoC) or heavily influenced by them (Fed or ECB)? People living in glass houses should not throw stones.""\n\nShvets said cryptocurrencies ""absolutely"" have a role in investment portfolios. Like gold, they\'re insurance policies against the depreciation of fiat currencies, he said.\n\nBut he added that cryptocurrencies account for less than 1% of cash in circulation, leaving the dollar as the primary global reserve currency for a while. He added that bitcoin, unlike paper currency, is not yet widely accepted as a store of value and is very unstable. For example, the cryptocurrency plunged by as much as 14% in the 10 days after Dimon\'s comments; it had rebounded and was roughly flat by Thursday, near $4,209 per bitcoin.\n\nShvets sees consumers and businesses using a mix of different sovereign currencies and cryptocurrencies, and carrying out more transactions through technologies like blockchain.\n\n""The challenge facing central banks is that although cryptocurrencies are today a tiny portion of the overall money pool, the nature of monetary economy is rapidly changing and central banks would have no choice but to adjust,"" he said.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Thursday released guidance on the legal responsibilities of Australian investors when it comes to participating in initial coin offerings (ICOs), just weeks after China\'s government banned the practice.\n\nAn ICO is a form of crowdfunding that internet businesses use to raise capital. In exchange for cash, Bitcoin or Ethereum, the organisations offer digital tokens or coins that allow the investor to participate in a new, developing network.\n\nMore than $US2.2 billion has been raised via ICOs in 2017, according to CoinSchedule.\n\nIn Australia, the legal status of an ICO is dependent on its circumstances, and ASIC has said an ICO could be a managed investment scheme, an offer of shares, an offer of a derivative, or a non-cash payment facility.\n\nBut, as ASIC points out, ICOs can be conducted anonymously and there is almost zero protection for investors swapping money for ICO tokens.\n\n""ICOs are highly speculative investments, are mostly unregulated, and the chance of losing your investment is high,"" ASIC commissioner John Price said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n""Consumers should understand the risks involved, including the potential for these products to be scams, before investing.""\n\nIn some circumstances, the ICO will be subject to general Australian consumer laws.

The People\'s Bank of China said ICO speculation was likely linked to ""illegal financial activities [which] seriously disrupt the economic and financial order"".\n\nWhile some ICOs have raised eye-watering sums in next to no time, there have been some cases of alleged theft. In July, CoinDash said its website was hacked and roughly $US7.4 million in cryptocurrency was stolen from investors trying to take part in its ICO. The same month, Veritaseum said it was hacked and a similar attack reportedly followed against Enigma last month.\n\nAlthough ICOs are explained as a form of crowdfunding, ASIC clarified that ICOs will not be covered by the crowd-sourced funding (CSF) regime that comes into effect on Friday.\n\nASIC defines crowdfunding as a financial service, and from Friday, unlisted companies with less than $25 million in assets and annual revenue can issue shares to retail investors over a crowdfunding platform, using an offer document that contains less disclosure than a prospectus demands.\n\nThe regulator also points out those facilitating ICO transactions may be operating as a financial market and must obtain a licence or be declared exempt by the minister.', 'Want your company’s stock to climb?

They’re enablers, solving the weak links in the cryptocurrency system.”\n\nOverstock and Goldmoney are examples of companies trying to take cryptocurrencies to the mainstream by building an infrastructure around the sector that allows institutional investors to buy the assets with all the safeguards and protections of trading stocks and bonds. That plan depends on cryptocurrencies maturing enough to become their own asset class, even as eminences of the financial world such as JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio rail against it.\n\nAnd it’s not just those two stocks. In June, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which make hardware used in cryptocurrency mining, rallied as ether surged near $400 and bitcoin was near a record.\n\nWhile there’s an argument to be made that the bets these companies are making are risky, they represent the more tame examples within the wider universe of crypto-endeavors.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Illustration: Greg Mably\n\nBitcoin “miners” are electromagnetic alchemists, effectively turning megawatt-hours of electricity into the world’s fastest-growing currency. Their intensive computational activity cryptographically secures the virtual currency, approves transactions, and, in the process, creates new bitcoins for the miners, as payment.\n\nAnd it does another thing, too: It uses an absolutely stunning amount of power. The ever-expanding racks of processors used by miners already consume as much electricity as a small city. It’s a problem that experts say is bad and getting worse.\n\n“The concern that people continue to debate is, where does this end?” says Michael Reed, head of blockchain technology for Intel.\n\nThe Bitcoin leech sucking on the world’s power grids has been held in check, so far, by rapid gains in the energy efficiency of mining hardware. But energy and blockchain analysts are worried about the possibility of a perfect storm: Those efficiency gains are slowing while bitcoin value is rising fast—and its potential transaction growth is immense.\n\nThere’s a silver lining, though: This troubling energy picture is inspiring innovators such as Reed to come up with energy-saving approaches that would unleash the technology behind Bitcoin, allowing it to expand into applications for which it was never intended [see “Blockchains: How They Work and Why They’ll Change the World,” in this issue]. Developers of blockchains for such disparate applications as health care management and solar-power trading see Bitcoin’s energy-intensive design as a nonstarter and are now crafting more sustainable blockchains.\n\nSource: Harald Vranken, in Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 2017, 28: 1–9 Sisyphean Slide: Daily revenues for mining bitcoins [white], in US dollars per unit of computational power, are generally somewhat higher than the daily energy costs [red] of running the computers.\n\nTo understand these new blockchains, first consider the existing ones. A blockchain is a list of transactions—a ledger—maintained by a community of users, rather than a central authority. It’s called a blockchain because new transactions are bundled into “blocks” of data and written onto the end of a “chain” of existing blocks describing all prior transactions.\n\nThat process of chaining blocks together provides the security that has made Bitcoin hack-proof. But the process of writing new blocks, called mining, consumes a lot of energy, for several reasons. One is that each block of transactions must be encoded in an iterative process called cryptographic hashing, which is computationally intensive. It produces a hash, which is a string of characters of fixed length, and it must begin with a specific number of zeros.\n\nHere’s why that takes a lot of computing. Blocks are created by transforming the data associated with a group of transactions. That transformational process, known as hashing, isn’t inherently computationally intensive. But to get a hash that starts with the required number of zeros—it changes (typically increasing) after every 2,016 blocks or roughly every two weeks—a miner has to tweak the data and then hash it, check whether the result has the proper number of zeros, and, if not, start over again. That process of hashing and rehashing usually goes on thousands of times and consumes lots of energy.\n\nThe first miner on the network to find a valid hash uses it to create a block, adds it to the chain, and is then rewarded for this community service with newly minted bitcoins. With many parties competing to win each block, no one party can gain control over the currency and its ledger.\n\nBitcoin’s mining-based ledger-writing process is aptly known as “proof of work.” In June, the world’s bitcoin miners were generating roughly 5 quintillion 256-bit cryptographic hashes every second, according to the all-things-Bitcoin website Blockchain.info. That’s a 5 with 18 zeros after it, every second. No entity tracks how much power it takes to sustain that level of computation. But estimates by independent researchers suggest it’s around 500 megawatts—enough to supply roughly 325,000 homes [PDF] —with the activity concentrated in China and a few other countries with cheap energy and, in some cases, loose regulations on emissions.\n\nBecause of all that calculation, the energy cost of Bitcoin is high in comparison with that of conventional financial transactions. For example, according to one estimate, processing a bitcoin transaction consumes more than 5,000 times as much energy as using a Visa credit card.\n\n“Processing a bitcoin transaction consumes more than 5,000 times as much energy as using a Visa credit card.”\n\nMining power is high and getting higher, thanks to a computational arms race. Recall that the required number of zeros at the beginning of a hash is tweaked biweekly to adjust the difficulty of creating a block—and more zeros means more difficulty. The Bitcoin algorithm adds these zeros in order to keep the rate at which blocks are added constant, at one new block every 10 minutes. The idea is to compensate for the mining hardware becoming more and more powerful. When the hashing is harder, it takes more computations to create a block and thus more effort to earn new bitcoins, which are then added to circulation.\n\n“If you try to work harder, the algorithm makes it more difficult,” says Harald Vranken, a computer scientist at Radboud University, in Nijmegen, Netherlands. “It’s a very circular game.”\n\nVranken says doing today’s calculations would “consume way more power than is generated on the entire planet” if it were done using the CPUs available when Bitcoin launched in 2009. What has prevented such disruption is a series of hardware upgrades: Miners began abandoning the CPU for the more-efficient graphics processing unit around 2011, and by 2013, chipmakers were producing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) just for bitcoin mining.\n\nToday’s state-of-the-art Bitcoin ASICs complete a 256-bit hash 100 million times as fast and with one-millionth the energy of a 2009-vintage CPU, Vranken says. Yet more efficiency gains are possible by optimizing data centers from the ground up to power and cool bitcoin-mining ASICs [PDF] [see “Why the Biggest Bitcoin Mines Are in China,” coming soon in this issue].\n\nThe problem is that chip efficiency gains are slowing [see “Moore’s Law Might Be Slowing Down, But Not Energy Efficiency,” IEEE Spectrum, April 2015] and, according to Vranken, are losing ground against Bitcoin’s exponentially rising exchange rate and rates of hash computation. Another Dutch researcher, Sebastiaan Deetman, says an “enormous increase in hash rate” over the last year or so has likely pushed Bitcoin’s global draw closer to 700 MW.\n\nAnd if the hash computations accelerate further? In that case, Deetman, who is a doctoral candidate in industrial ecology at Leiden University, sees Bitcoin power demand ballooning 20-fold—to 14 gigawatts—by 2020. If that happens, Bitcoin will be using as much electricity as Denmark.\n\nIn certain places, Bitcoin’s power drain may already be straining grids. Mining took off recently in Venezuela, where bitcoins make an attractive alternative to the bolivar, largely worthless now because of hyperinflation. Earlier this year, Venezuelan authorities shut down a mining operation whose 11,000 computers were allegedly running on power that was being siphoned illegally. The drain apparently caused a backlash amid the country’s severe electricity shortages.\n\nIntel’s Reed says that Bitcoin’s sustainability in terms of power usage is tough to predict. He cites such factors as the periodic reduction in the number of bitcoins that miners earn for adding a block. “It’s a very complex set of inputs,” he says.\n\nWhat Reed is sure of, however, is that the world’s power infrastructures could not handle many more blockchains running on Bitcoin’s computationally intensive proof-of-work mining scheme.\n\nHe notes that the leaders of Ethereum—the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency, which started trading in 2015—are planning a switch to a noncompetitive alternative algorithm called proof of stake. Instead of miners battling for block-hashing rights, the network would assign block-adding rights to “forgers” based on their relative holdings of Ethereum currency (known as ethers). This scheme would slash Ethereum’s energy footprint by eliminating the mining process and its computational arms race.\n\nReed’s team at Intel is working on a novel energy-saving blockchain system that relies on security features built into the chipmaker’s CPUs. Intel’s Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain software randomly selects which users will write each block. Its proof-of-elapsed-time scheme idles all users’ code for randomly determined intervals. The first to awaken adds the latest transactions to the blockchain and wins compensation.\n\nWhat prevents participants from tampering with the code to get a larger share of the blocks, says Reed, is that they must run Sawtooth code on Intel CPUs equipped with its Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology. SGX combines protected areas of memory for code execution with a remote system for verifying its sanctity, enabling Intel to determine whether code has been tampered with.\n\nSeveral blockchain application developers have signed on, Reed says, including PokitDok, a provider of platforms for sharing health care data. Ted Tanner, PokitDok’s chief technology officer and cofounder, expects several applications by the end of 2017, including an identity-validation system to link patients with their medical records and automatic adjudication of some health insurance claims.\n\nAt Cornell University, meanwhile, researchers are using Intel’s SGX to one-up the chip giant. Team leader Ittay Eyal says their system fixes an unintended waste-encouraging aspect of Intel’s blockchain scheme, which his team calls the stale-chip problem. Miners in Intel’s proof-of-elapsed-time scheme will have a financial incentive to use the cheapest SGX-enabled CPUs available, predicts Eyal. This will extend the use of outmoded, inefficient CPUs, he says.\n\nEyal’s team presented its alternative code [PDF] in May. In their proof-of-useful-work system, participants win blocks by getting credit for doing their own work-related computations within the SGX. A pharmaceutical firm, for example, could run simulations of molecules interacting and simultaneously establish its block-writing status. The firm would want to use the fastest chips available rather than outdated chips, Eyal argues. This preference, his group estimates, should make proof-of-useful-work blockchains at least 25 times as efficient as Intel’s.\n\nEyal says that lower-energy-consumption blockchains relying on secure hardware will support many applications. But he predicts that such blockchains will not find favor with security-obsessed cryptocurrency users. “The Bitcoin community will not be open to trusting Intel—or anyone else, for that matter,” Eyal declares. In other words, blockchain technology writ large may have a sustainable future, but the power-sucking Bitcoin leech will probably remain ravenous for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article appears in the October 2017 print issue as “Feeding the Blockchain Beast.”', 'The ethereum and bitcoin prices continued to climb on Thursday, even as a slight dip in the altcoin markets pulled many coins into decline. The bitcoin price rose toward the $4,200 mark–even passing it temporarily–while the ethereum price closed in on the $300 threshold. Altogether, the total crypto market cap added about $3 billion for the day, bringing it a few steps closer to the all-time high it set earlier this month.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap entered Wednesday afternoon just above the $140 billion mark. It steadily climbed throughout the remainder of the day and into Thursday morning, eventually peaking at $147.3 billion at 9:00 UTC. This was the highest the market has extended since September 12. However, the market began a sharp decline shortly after reaching this peak, shedding more than $3 billion before settling down to a present value of $143.6 billion.\n\nOne factor that should prove bullish for the market’s long-term prospects is Overstock’s announcement of an initial coin offering (ICO) exchange that will comply with SEC and FINRA regulations concerning securities trading. The exchange is being developed as a joint venture between tZero (an Overstock subsidiary), Argon Group, and RenGen LLC and will make the ICO marketplace more inviting for institutional investors who are concerned about the regulatory climate surrounding crypto finance.\n\nBitcoin Price Scales the Charts\n\nThe bitcoin price has made significant progress this week in the face of volatility in the global markets. On Thursday, the bitcoin price rose as high as $4,279, although it has since tapered to $4,178. Nevertheless, this represents a daily increase of 3% and brings bitcoin’s market cap to $69.3 billion.\n\nMany analysts predict that the bitcoin price will be able to challenge its all-time high of $5,000 in the near future if it is able to hold above the $4,000 mark for the next few days. That said, uncertainty regarding the potential SegWit2x hard fork continues to weigh on the mid-term outlook of the bitcoin price.\n\nEthereum Price Hits $300\n\nThe ethereum price posted another minor increase on Thursday, enabling it to climb to $300 for the first time in more than two weeks. After beginning the day at $294, ethereum stretched as high as $308 before settling at a present mark just a few cents below $300. Ethereum now has a market cap of $28.4 billion, representing a 24-hour increase of 2%.\n\nAltcoin Markets Mixed\n\nAltcoins had returned generally-positive performance this week, but these markets were a mixed bag for investors on Thursday.\n\nThe Ripple price had climbed nearly 20% during the first half of the week following news that the startup was opening an office in Singapore, but XRP waned a bit on Thursday. The Ripple price is now trading at $0.193, a 4% decline from Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin cash and Dash followed Ripple’s lead, declining 3% and 2%, respectively. Litecoin and NEM each managed to make minor progress, while IOTA and Monero held steady at the previous day’s levels.

09/29/2017,"['When China’s central bank banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) at the start of this month, the move helped trigger a crash in the value of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has largely recovered, but enthusiasts will be on the alert again, as South Korea has now followed China’s lead.\n\nThe ICO is a new form of fundraising where, instead of a startup issuing its investors with shares, it gives them digital tokens that are sometimes connected with the new service they’re trying to sell. There are huge risks here, as many of the startups launching ICOs are getting regular people to buy into thin or implausible business plans—or, worse, outright scamming them with pump-and-dump schemes.\n\nThose risks are what led China to pull the plug, and the same thought seems to have occurred to South Korea’s financial regulators. The country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) said Friday that it was banning all ICOs in the country, with a threat of “stern penalties” for those who continue with the fundraising method.\n\n“There is a situation where money has been flooded into an unproductive and speculative direction,” FSC vice chairman Kim Yong-beom said, according to Yonhap.\n\nThe regulator added that virtual-currency trading needed to be closely monitored and controlled. It’s worth noting that China followed up its ICO ban with a heavily rumored—though never officially confirmed—crackdown on Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nThe latest news triggered a 2% fall in Bitcoin’s value, and a slightly larger drop in the value of Ethereum, the virtual currency that’s used in many ICOs. It remains to be seen how much the Korean ban will affect sentiment in the coming days.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is certainly aware of the risks surrounding ICOs. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin earlier this week released a whitepaper he had co-authored regarding ways to dampen the dangerous hype that sometimes accompanies the offerings.', 'SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Weeks after Beijing banned fundraising through token launches and ordered some bitcoin exchanges to shut, casting a chill over the cryptocurrency industry, traders say that the market is far from dead.\n\nWhile several exchanges have announced that they will close by the end of this month, traders have now moved to buy and sell bitcoin directly with each other on peer-to-peer marketplaces and messenger apps. Industry insiders say some overseas-based initial coin offerings (ICOs) are still being marketed.\n\nAlthough the crackdown has dissuaded large swathes of less-experienced investors from participating in the trade, market participants point to the limits Chinese regulators ultimately face in controlling the industry, where many users are anonymous and difficult to track.\n\nIn the short-run, the crackdown has also created an arbitrage opportunity for investors, with the price of bitcoin in China now trading at a discount to overseas exchanges.\n\n“They can’t set rules to stop me from investing in what I want to invest in.

""The best response by central bankers is to continue running effective monetary policy, while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.""\n\nThe most high-profile of these digital currencies is bitcoin, which like others can be converted to cash when deposited into accounts at prices set in online trading.

On Friday a Greek court postponed the ruling for Vinnik, a Russian citizen accused of laundering $4 billion via bitcoin exchanges.\n\nRead more\n\nVinnik, 38, was arrested on a US warrant in the Greek resort area of Halkidiki as he was holidaying with his wife and two children in July this year. He is facing extradition to the US, where he is wanted on charges of money laundering and running “one of the most important websites of electronic crime in the world,” authorities said upon his arrest.\n\nThe Thessaloniki court will decide on Friday whether to extradite the Russian to the US. Asked by the judge if he admits his guilt, Vinnik denied any wrongdoing, Russian media reported.\n\nLater the court said that it postponed the ruling till October 4, citing “large amounts of material,” Russian media reported the court’s spokesman as saying.\n\nOne of Vinnik’s lawyers, Timofey Musatov, confirmed to RT that the ruling had been postponed.\n\n“The court will meet on Wednesday [October 4], and all our arguments will be heard,” Musatov told RT.\n\n“If the court decides to extradite him, we can appeal the decision, and the appeal will be reviewed by the Greek High Court, which is in Athens, and which is responsible for criminal cases,” Alexandros Lykourezos, a renowned Greek lawyer who took Vinnik’s case, told RT.\n\nDescribed as a skilled cryptocurrency consultant, Vinnik is alleged to have funneled at least $4 billion in bitcoin through various trading platforms such as Mt. Gox and BTC-e, which he is believed to be linked to, for the purpose of money laundering.\n\n“This case is very new to Greek jurisprudence, and it is quite interesting for me as a lawyer, and we also hope that Greek judiciary and judges will consider it a high priority and we will get the result we are expecting,” Lykourezos said.\n\nA northern California grand jury indicted Vinnik and BTC-e on 21 counts of money laundering and related crimes. If extradited to the US, the Russian may reportedly face up to 55 years in jail.\n\n“So far there has been no evident political underpinning, but it is clear that the USA is very interested in our client being extradited,” Lykourezos added.\n\n‘We’ll fight to the end’ – Vinnik’s wife to RT\n\nVinnik’s wife, Aleksandra, has arrived in Greece for the court hearings. She hopes that the Greek court “won\'t take on the responsibility of extraditing him” and says she is ready to fight for her husband “until the end,” she told RT in an interview.\n\n“No matter what, I will fight to the bitter end. Just as I fight for him here, I will fight for him in America or any other country, until the end. Because I think justice must be served. And justice will be for my husband to be in Russia,” she said.\n\nAccording to Aleksandra, time after her husband’s arrest turned out to be “an endless source of stress.”\n\n“Every time I come here I can\'t get that my husband is here [in Greek prison], who just two months ago was at home playing with our kids,” she said.\n\nRussian man suspected of laundering $4bn via bitcoin exchanges didn\'t bother to cover his tracks - security expert https://t.co/EhxNC4joes — RT (@RT_com) July 28, 2017\n\nAleksandra’s health has been deteriorating due to constant stress, but she says that this is nothing compared to what her husband is undergoing.\n\n“Yes, it\'s hard, but I have to deal with it, because I have two small kids, and I have a husband who I\'m fighting for,” she added.\n\n‘US want to impose its rules on everyone’ – analyst\n\nAllegations that bitcoin and the BTC-e serve criminal activity are pointless, since US dollars, euros and other currencies are used for criminal activity, Dmitry Vasiliev from the International Blockchain Development Institute in Moscow told RT.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange platform BTC-E on \'maintenance\' after arrest of alleged bitcoin \'crime mastermind\' in Greece https://t.co/90jaPm6Okl — RT (@RT_com) July 27, 2017\n\n“The indictment shows that all computer incursions, fraud and extortion were conducted via the BTC-e. But there are more than a hundred platforms that have the same properties and where you can make a crypto exchange without registering,” he said.\n\n“America wants to impose their rules on everyone, because they invented the internet,” he concluded.', 'One of Wall Street’s most influential bankers does not believe bitcoin should be illegal while adding that the cryptocurrency is “more than just a fad.”\n\nMorgan Stanley CEO James Gorman was speaking at the ‘Wall Street Journal Future of Finance’ event when an audience member sought his opinions on cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt’s a fascinating development, that’s certainly something more than just a fad. The concept of ‘anonymous currency’ is a very interesting concept. Interesting for the privacy protections it gives people…interesting because what does it say to the central banking system…about controlling that.\n\nContrary to some of his Wall Street counterparts, Gorman’s comments on cryptocurrencies struck a measured tone.\n\nThe banking executive gave equal footing to both cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and the banking sector, both of which are ultimately under the purview of governments, according to him.\n\nNone of us operate in isolation from the ecosystem in which we live. If banks behave badly, the government says ‘Raise more capital.’ We say ‘Gee, that makes us less profitable.’ They say “That is now your problem”…If a currency is operating that is enabling people to transfer money anonymously, a government can say “We are not going to allow that anymore.” So there is a government risk factor to it.\n\nWhen asked by the moderator if bitcoin should be ‘illegal’ Gorman replied: “No, I don’t.”\n\nGorman further revealed that while he wasn’t personally invested in bitcoin, he has met a number of people who are investors in the cryptocurrency market\n\nI haven’t invested in this, I’ve talked to a lot of people who have. It’s obviously highly speculative but, it’s not something that’s inherently bad. It’s a natural consequence of blockchain technology, as I understand it.\n\nGorman’s stance on cryptocurrencies is in marked contrast to those offered by JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon who recently stated that bitcoin is a “fraud” that is “worth nothing.”\n\nFeatured of Jamie Dimon and James Gorman from Flickr/Financial Times.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\n* BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\n\nJapan is unperturbed with its neighbor’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies. While Chinese exchanges are stopping trading from this month’s end, Japan has granted 11 cryptocurrency exchange licenses.\n\nIn the US, Keith Noreika, acting comptroller of the currency for the U.S. Treasury Department has said that Bitcoin companies might be granted “fintech charters” in the future. He also said that he was open to the idea of the banks conducting their business in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis shows that while one nation is closing its doors to cryptocurrencies, others are warming up to it. Let’s see if this news can boost cryptocurrencies higher.\n\nBTC/USD\n\nThough Bitcoin triggered our buy at $4120 levels, it could not sustain the rally and plunged to $4018.32. Nevertheless, lower levels attracted buying, again bringing Bitcoin to the verge of breaking out of the ascending triangle pattern, which is a bullish development.\n\nThe minimum target objective of a breakout from the triangle is $5358, however, we shall go one step at a time.\n\nOn a breakout above $4280, the currency is likely to rally to $4680, where we recommend selling half of one’s position. The other half can be held with a close stop, because above $4680 the digital currency can quickly rally to $5000 levels.\n\nTraders who are long on our previous recommendations should keep a stop loss of $3750. They can tighten their stops further to $4000 once the digital currency rallies above $4280. We shall keep trailing the stops higher as the market moves in our favor.\n\nETH/USD\n\nEthereum did not trigger our buy levels, because we had recommended a long position only if the digital currency closed above $312 and the highest closing in the last three days was $309.61.\n\nOnce it was clear that Ethereum wouldn’t breakout, sellers emerged. As a result, Ethereum plunged to $278.88, close to the trendline.\n\nIf the digital currency breaks below the trendline, it is likely to fall to $255 and to $235 levels. Therefore, we want to initiate a long position only on a confirmation of a resumption of the uptrend.\n\nWe now recommend a long position at $317. Traders should keep their stop loss at $270 and the target objective is $420.\n\nHowever, there is significant resistance at $344. Therefore, traders should tighten their stop loss if the digital currency struggles to breakout of this resistance.\n\nBCH/USD\n\nBitcoin Cash is range bound between $385 and $549. Within this range, the cryptocurrency is likely to remain volatile. Therefore, we shall buy it only after it breaks out of the range. Until then, we will stick to the other cryptocurrencies that are trending.\n\nHowever, for traders who want to trade Bitcoin Cash only, they can buy once the digital currency bounces from the lower end of the range at $385. Profits should be booked at the upper end of the range at $549. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $350 because if the digital currency breaks down of this level, it can sink to $300.\n\nXRP/USD\n\nRipple could not continue higher after breaking out of the resistance at $0.19537. It fell to $0.18800 levels where buying emerged.\n\nAs a result, the digital currency has again broken out of $0.19537. We expect the currency to gain momentum once it breaks out of $0.22000 levels.\n\nTraders who are long on our previous recommendation should maintain their stop loss at $0.16500. They should raise the stops to $0.18500 once Ripple breaks out of $0.22000.\n\nThe target objective is $0.25000.\n\nLTC/USD\n\nLitecoin did not reach our buy levels, therefore, no trade was triggered. The cryptocurrency fell close to $50 levels where it found buying support.\n\nIf Litecoin breaks above $58, it is likely to start a new uptrend which could carry it to $72 levels. Therefore, traders can buy at $58 and keep a stop loss at $44. Once the currency breaks out of $64 the stop loss can be increased to $50.\n\n\n\n*This article was written Sept 29, 7 p.m. UTC', 'Dan Wasyluk discovered the hard way that trading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin happens in an online Wild West where sheriffs are largely absent.\n\nWasyluk and his colleagues raised bitcoins for a new tech venture and lodged them in escrow at a company running a cryptocurrency exchange called Moolah. Just months later the exchange collapsed; the man behind it is now awaiting trial in Britain on fraud and money-laundering charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWasyluk’s project lost 750 bitcoins, currently worth about $3 million, and he believes he stands little chance of recovering any money.\n\n“It really was kind of a kneecapping of the project,” said Wasyluk of the collapse three years ago. “If you are starting an exchange and you lose clients’ money, you or your company should be 100 percent accountable for that loss. And right now there is nothing like that in place.”\n\nCryptocurrencies were supposed to offer a secure, digital way to conduct financial transactions, but they have been dogged by doubts. Concerns have largely focused on their astronomical gains in value and the likelihood of painful price crashes. Equally perilous, though, are the exchanges where virtual currencies are bought, sold and stored. These exchanges, which match buyers and sellers and sometimes hold traders’ funds, have become magnets for fraud and mires of technological dysfunction, a Reuters examination shows, posing an underappreciated risk to anyone who trades digital coins.\n\nHuge sums are at stake. As the prices of bitcoin and other virtual currencies have soared this year – bitcoin has quadrupled – legions of investors and speculators have turned to online exchanges. Billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies – which aren’t backed by any governments or central banks – are now traded on exchanges every day.\n\n“These are new assets. No one really knows what to make of them,” said David L. Yermack, chairman of the finance department at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “If you’re a consumer, there’s nothing to protect you.”\n\nRegulators and governments are still debating how to handle cryptocurrencies, and Yermack says the U.S. Congress will ultimately have to take action.\n\nSome of the freewheeling exchanges are plagued with poor security and lack investor protections common in more regulated financial markets, Reuters found. Some Chinese exchanges have falsely inflated their trading volume to lure new customers, according to former employees.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThere have been at least three dozen heists of cryptocurrency exchanges since 2011; many of the hacked exchanges later shut down. More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen, which today would be worth about $4 billion. Few have been recovered. Burned investors have been left at the mercy of exchanges as to whether they will receive any compensation.\n\nNearly 25,000 customers of Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, are still waiting for compensation more than three years after its collapse into bankruptcy in Japan. The exchange said it lost about 650,000 bitcoins. Claims approved by the bankruptcy trustee total more than $400 million.\n\nIn July, a federal judge in Florida ordered Paul Vernon, the operator of a collapsed U.S. exchange called Cryptsy, to pay $8.2 million to customers after he failed to respond to a class-action lawsuit. The judge ruled that 11,325 bitcoins had been stolen but did not identify the thief. “This is no different than bank robbers in the Old West,” said David C. Silver, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys. “Cryptocurrency is just a new front.” Vernon could not be reached for comment.\n\nAnother challenge for traders: government intervention. This month, Chinese authorities ordered some mainland Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges to stop trading. The order, however, did not apply to exchanges based in Hong Kong or outside China, including those affiliated with mainland Chinese exchanges.\n\nSo-called “flash crashes” – when cryptocurrencies suddenly plummet in value – are also a threat. Unlike regulated U.S. stock exchanges, cryptocurrency exchanges aren’t required to have circuit breakers in place to halt trading during wild price swings. Digital coin exchanges are also frequently under assault by hackers, resulting in down times that can sideline traders at critical moments.\n\nOn May 7, traders on a U.S. exchange called Kraken lost more than $5 million when it came under attack and couldn’t be accessed, according to a class-action lawsuit filed in Florida. During the incident, the suit alleges, the exchange’s price of a cryptocurrency called ether fell more than 70% and the traders’ leveraged positions were liquidated. They received no compensation. The exchange declined to comment on the lawsuit. In a court filing, it asked for the case to be dismissed and said the claims should be decided by arbitration.\n\nAnother two flash crashes occurred this year on the U.S. exchange GDAX. The exchange said it compensated traders who lost money.\n\nNot surprisingly, many banks are leery of cryptocurrency exchanges and some have refused to deal with them. At a bank investor conference this month in New York, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, called bitcoin “a fraud” and predicted it will “blow up.”\n\nBoycotts by banks can make it impossible at times for exchanges to process wire transfers that allow customers to buy or sell cryptocurrencies with traditional currencies, such as dollars or euros. In March, Wells Fargo stopped processing wire transfers for an exchange called Bitfinex, leaving customers unable to transfer U.S. dollars out of their accounts, except through special arrangement with the exchange’s lawyer. Wells Fargo declined to comment.\n\nDealing with the banks “is a constant and ongoing challenge,” said Bitfinex Chief Executive Jean Louis van der Velde. “Citizens and businesses being treated like criminals when they are not, including myself.” He declined to say which banks Bitfinex is now using.\n\nIn part, banks say they are concerned about the due diligence cryptocurrency exchanges do on their customers to guard against money laundering, criminal activity and sanctions violations. While regulators require banks to verify who their customers are, some cryptocurrency trading platforms have performed minimal checks, Reuters found.\n\nInternal customer records reviewed by Reuters from the BTCChina exchange, which has an office in Shanghai but is stopping trading at the end of this month, show that in the fall of 2015, 63 customers said they were from Iran and another nine said they were from North Korea – countries under U.S. sanctions.\n\nAmericans are generally prohibited from conducting financial transactions with individuals in Iran and North Korea. Statements on BTCChina’s website from 2013 and 2014 identify Bobby Lee, who holds American citizenship, as its chief executive and co-founder. Lee is currently CEO of BTCC, a separate Cayman Islands-registered cryptocurrency exchange company, according to a spokesman for the exchanges.\n\nThe spokesman did not respond to repeated questions from Reuters as to Lee’s current role at BTCChina, and Lee did not comment on the issue. The spokesman said that BTCChina complies with Chinese law and “is run by a Chinese citizen, and its legal representative is also a Chinese citizen.”\n\nThe spokesman originally said the exchange had “significantly strengthened” its compliance processes over the last two years, including “banning registrations from sanctioned countries such as Iran and North Korea. Our system still has some inactivated accounts from some sanctioned countries for audit and logging purposes.” He said “most” of those accounts had never been used to trade.\n\nHe later said that BTCChina has never had any North Korean customers and “has had only one Iranian customer.” The Iranian used a bank account in China, not Iran, “therefore all of that customer’s transactions on our trading platform did not violate” U.S. sanctions, the spokesman said. He said “BTCC has never had and does not have any North Korean or Iranian customers.”\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control in Washington, which enforces economic and trade sanctions, declined to comment.\n\nIn mid-2016, the Chinese exchange hired a compliance analyst to help monitor any suspicious activity on the trading platform. It selected Constance Yuan, then 23 years old, who told Reuters she had no prior formal training in compliance. On her LinkedIn page, she listed her title as “Senior compliance manager.”\n\n“I was a bit surprised,” Yuan said of her hiring. “I felt I had no experience, and it was a pretty big responsibility.” She said lawyers taught her on the job, which she recently left.\n\nThe spokesman for BTCChina told Reuters it has had a vice president in charge of compliance on its staff since 2013 and that person helped to develop a “robust” system to verify customers’ identities.\n\nMickey Mouse identities\n\nBitcoin, the first digital currency to gain widespread acceptance, sprang up during the financial crisis about nine years ago. Its attraction, early proponents maintained, was that it offered a way to bypass banks and governments, and to conduct financial transactions more cheaply. Every transaction is validated and recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain that is maintained by a network of computers. While anonymous, the individual transactions are available for all to see on the internet. They are secured by cryptography, the computerized encoding and decoding of data.\n\nMike Hearn, an early bitcoin developer, said bitcoin was initially viewed more as a hobby than a serious alternative to traditional money. “People didn’t really think it could take off and get big,” he said. “It was a thought experiment that happened to have some code.”\n\nThough bitcoin turned out to generate huge attention and media coverage, it is still not widely used by ordinary consumers. Few retailers accept it, and processing transactions on the blockchain remains much slower than payment card networks, despite some recent technical changes.\n\nThe computer maker Dell, which announced in 2014 that it would accept bitcoin payments, has stopped “due to low usage,” a spokeswoman said. At the U.S. online retailer Overstock.com, only a fraction of one percent of sales are transacted in bitcoins, according to the company.\n\n“Most of the cryptocurrencies right now are more commodities than currency,” said Dan Schulman, chief executive of payments company PayPal. “You trade them based on what you think will happen to their value. They’re not really accepted by many merchants as a currency.”\n\nInstead, cryptocurrencies have proved attractive to those seeking anonymity.\n\nPoloniex, a U.S. exchange, has allowed some customers to trade cryptocurrencies and withdraw up to $2,000 worth of digital coins a day by providing only a name, an email address and a country, Reuters found. In a statement, Poloniex said it “has spent considerable resources developing a culture of compliance and has systems in place to prevent users from abusing the platform.”\n\nThe exchange isn’t allowed to accept New York residents as customers because it lacks a state license to operate a cryptocurrency exchange. But Reuters interviewed two New York residents who had claimed that they lived elsewhere and were able to trade on Poloniex. A Poloniex spokesman said, “Any NY resident who submits false profile information in order to trade on our platform is in breach of our terms of service.”\n\nInformed by Reuters of the trading on Poloniex by New York residents, the state’s Department of Financial Services said it would “take appropriate action.” In a statement, the department said: “As New York’s regulator of cryptocurrency, DFS will not tolerate any activity by unlicensed operators who attempt to conduct business in the state.”\n\nIn June, a former U.S. federal prosecutor testified before Congress that criminals – including distributors of malicious code called ransomware, “large drug kingpins and serial fraudsters” – were increasingly using unregulated foreign exchanges that don’t verify their customers.\n\n“Criminals can open anonymous accounts, or accounts with phony names to fly under the radar of law enforcement,” Kathryn Haun, a former assistant U.S. attorney, said at a congressional hearing. “Thus, we have received ‘Mickey Mouse’ who resides at ‘123 Main Street’ in subpoena returns.”\n\nHaun left the Justice Department in May and joined the board of Coinbase, which runs the GDAX exchange. She told Reuters she was impressed with Coinbase’s team and vision. A class-action lawsuit was filed last year against Coinbase on behalf of customers of the collapsed Cryptsy exchange. It claims that Coinbase converted bitcoins allegedly stolen from Cryptsy into about $8.2 million that was then withdrawn. Haun and Coinbase declined to comment on the case; in a court filing, Coinbase denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn July, U.S. authorities shut down the website of the BTC-e exchange, one of the world’s largest, and ordered it to pay a $110 million fine. The Treasury Department said it had “facilitated transactions involving ransomware, computer hacking, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking.”\n\nBTC-e required only a username, password and email address to open an account, authorities said.\n\nReuters was unable to contact BTC-e, whose base of operations was unclear, though it continues to have a website using a New Zealand domain name. It now forwards to a new exchange called WEX, which didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nFake Volume\n\nOne of the criteria traders say they use to select an exchange is trading volume. The more trades an exchange handles, the faster buyers and sellers can be matched.\n\nFrom about early 2014 until late January this year, Chinese exchanges accounted for about 90% of global bitcoin trading volume, according to the website bitcoinity.org, which collates trading data reported by exchanges.\n\nSome of that high volume occurred because traders were attracted by the fact that these exchanges at that time charged no transaction fees. But some of the volume was fake, six former employees at two Chinese exchanges told Reuters. Artificially pumped-up volumes in China could have affected the often volatile price of bitcoin, because investors elsewhere monitor and respond to the activity.\n\nOne exchange, OKCoin, inflated volumes through so-called wash trades, repeatedly trading nominal amounts of bitcoin back and forth between accounts, two former executives said. The transactions were logged on the exchanges but not recorded on the blockchain, according to a former employee.\n\nZane Tackett, who held several positions at OKCoin from 2014 to 2015 including international operations manager, said he resigned partly out of concern about its fake volumes. “The motivation is to seem larger than their competition,” he said.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, a former chief technical officer at OKCoin, stated on the website reddit.com in May 2015 that OKCoin used bots that “are designed to pump up volumes.” In a response to the post, OKCoin said: “OKCoin does not need to have any fake volume.”\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, OKCoin said it “never artificially inflated trading volume.”\n\nFour former employees at BTCChina, including one of its co-founders, said the exchange had also engaged in faking its trading volumes. A spokesman for the exchange said it “has never faked its trading volumes.”\n\nThe Chinese exchanges’ sky-high volumes appear to have caught the attention of the People’s Bank of China. After a series of inspections by the central bank, Chinese exchanges in January began charging trading fees – as exchanges elsewhere typically do – and volumes in China plummeted.\n\n“A deceptive market is not a healthy market,” said Xiaoyu Huang, a co-founder of BTCChina, who said that the exchange had faked some of its volume. “And, in fact, it was the fake volumes that made the government mistakenly believe that the Chinese market accounted for so much of the global trading volume, and caused the government to supervise bitcoin in China so forcefully.” Huang said he had left the company in part over a disagreement over its direction.\n\nThe spokesman for BTCChina said “the Chinese government’s scrutiny into bitcoin exchanges earlier this year was because of a dramatic increase in bitcoin’s price.” China’s central bank declined to answer questions.\n\nUnder attack\n\nExchanges are frequently targeted by hackers, causing additional problems for investors.\n\nWalle Wei, a Chinese trader based in Guangxi in southern China, said he was trading futures in bitcoin and a cryptocurrency called litecoin on OKCoin.com on July 10, 2015. Betting that the litecoin price, then about $4, would rise, he bought contracts for long positions using borrowed money. This meant that he only had to put down 10% to trade. Trading with that much leverage meant that a small move in the price could either wipe out his positions or greatly magnify his gains.\n\nInstead of rising as Wei had hoped, litecoin’s price began falling and OKCoin’s website slowed down, Wei said. He was unable to buy or sell. When he regained access to his account, his contracts had been liquidated. He said he lost 3,136 litecoins, then worth about $12,500.\n\nOKCoin announced on its blog that it had been a victim of “large scale” attacks by hackers who flooded its websites with traffic, preventing some users from accessing their accounts.\n\nOn July 13, Wei suffered a second, similar event with bitcoin. He said the exchange’s website became inaccessible, his contracts were liquidated and he lost 57.9 bitcoins, then worth about $16,900.\n\nWei said he complained and OKCoin covered 15% of his bitcoin losses, waived one month’s worth of trading fees and gave him a mobile phone charger. He said he also filed complaints with police and five government agencies, including the central bank and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Most ignored his complaints, he said, and those that replied told him his problem didn’t fall under their jurisdiction.\n\n“They said to find the relevant department. But I don’t know what other relevant government departments there are,” he said.\n\nA person close to the CSRC said cryptocurrency exchanges fall under the purview of the central bank, which declined to answer questions.\n\nIn a written response, OKCoin said it had invested heavily in guarding against attacks and there was no precedent for multinational corporations to compensate users for service interruptions. “All trading’s profit or loss should be solely borne by the users,” OKCoin said. To open an account, customers must agree to terms of service that absolve the company of liability for losses from “hacker attacks” and “computer virus intrusion or attack.”\n\nInaccessible websites aren’t the only way investors can lose money on exchanges. In February, a hedge fund called GABI, based in Jersey, bought a futures contract on OKCoin’s Hong Kong exchange, betting the price of bitcoin would rise. But the contract was liquidated soon afterwards when another investor placed a giant bet the other way that dwarfed it.\n\nIn regulated exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, there are limits to the size of futures contracts to prevent one trader from dominating the market. That’s not the case on some cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nIn its online February newsletter, the hedge fund’s manager called the incident “clear market manipulation.” He said he questioned OKCoin about it: “They confirmed to us that there were no position limits whatsoever and that people were free to do whatever they wanted in their ‘happy trading environment’ (yes, they used those actual words).”\n\nThe February bitcoin contract cost the hedge fund between $400,000 and $500,000, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nOKCoin said the “two customers traded fairly” and “there is no regulation restricting the trading strategy.” Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission declined to comment.\n\n“An absolute disgrace”\n\nIn the past 15 months, Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, was fined by a U.S. regulator, lost $72 million worth of bitcoins to hackers and was cut off by Wells Fargo, one of America’s biggest banks.\n\nBitfinex was set up four years ago. Its hundreds of thousands of clients include banks, investment funds and other cryptocurrency exchanges, according to van der Velde, its CEO and co-founder, and its lawyer.\n\nIt has no head office, is owned by a British Virgin Islands company and is managed by three executives who live in Hong Kong, the United States and Europe. Besides its Dutch chief executive, they include Chief Financial Officer Giancarlo Devasini, who is Italian, and Chief Strategy Officer Philip Potter, an American who once worked at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn June 2016, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission fined Bitfinex $75,000 for offering “illegal” cryptocurrency transactions and failing to register as a futures commission merchant.\n\n“We were happy with the terms of the settlement,” said Stuart Hoegner, Bitfinex’s general counsel.\n\nIn August 2016, hackers stole 119,756 bitcoins from Bitfinex.\n\nAs customers and others went online to vent their anger – “@bitfinex is an absolute DISGRACE to the #bitcoin community and needs to go,” one Twitter user wrote – Bitfinex executives weighed their options. Convinced they couldn’t get a bank loan and lacking insurance, they decided to reduce their customers’ balances by 36%, regardless of whether the investor accounts had been hacked – a technique known as the “socialization” of losses.\n\nThe exchange distributed IOUs in the form of digital tokens, which could be traded on Bitfinex. Some customers converted the tokens into equity in the company that operates the exchange. Although the exchange later redeemed the tokens in full, some customers had already sold them at a loss.\n\nIn an interview, van der Velde expressed regret for the hack. But he defended his firm’s response. “I felt – and I still feel – terrible for those people who lost their money,” he said.\n\nHe declined to discuss how the hack happened, citing an ongoing police investigation. “We took responsibility. How many financial institutions in the past can you find that say within a very short time, ‘We are good for that loss, and we issue an IOU for that’? Please find me one.”\n\nHe also said Bitfinex has acted transparently, has rigorous know-your-customer procedures and cooperates with law enforcement agencies.\n\nDespite its numerous challenges, van der Velde said Bitfinex is now handling about $12 billion in trades a month and is “very profitable.” Last year, the exchange said it expected to make a $20 million profit in 2017. Despite all the Wild West problems besetting cryptocurrencies, van der Velde predicted the final amount will turn out to be even higher.', 'HELSINKI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Exchanges aren’t the only way to trade bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Some websites help to arrange private transactions between buyers and sellers.\n\nLocalBitcoins.com is a popular website through which buyers and sellers advertise bitcoins, setting their own prices and conducting trades privately. It is operated by two brothers in Helsinki who say it has about 350,000 active users from nearly every country.\n\nThe website has recently been facilitating trades worth as much as $72 million a week and may surpass $1 billion worth of bitcoin transactions this year, according to Nikolaus Kangas, its 31-year-old chief executive. His older brother Jeremias, a programmer, set up LocalBitcoins five years ago. It now has about 15 employees and is looking to hire more.\n\nHere’s how it works: Bitcoin buyers and sellers place advertisements on LocalBitcoins. The website holds a seller’s bitcoins in escrow. A seller releases them to a buyer upon being paid. LocalBitcoins collects a one percent fee in bitcoins for each completed transaction. This year those fees may add up to more than $10 million worth of bitcoins.\n\nMany of the customers are unknown to the two Finns. Providing identification is voluntary. Nikolaus Kangas said about 70 percent of active clients provide ID details; the rest give only a username and email address.\n\n“Right now we don’t require it,” he said. “We’ve been considering making ID mandatory.”\n\nWhile some LocalBitcoins sellers require bitcoin buyers to identify themselves, some have openly advertised that they don‘t. “I accept funds without any security check,” stated one seller who went by the user name “wmarbitr” and advertised in Russian and English. The website said he had conducted more than 3,000 confirmed trades on LocalBitcoins with more than 4,200 buyers and sellers. The website subsequently said the account was “banned by staff.”\n\nFormer U.S. federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun said LocalBitcoins’ policy of not requiring its users to provide identification can cause problems for law enforcement. “It becomes really difficult to track the identities of those people, absent physical surveillance,” she said.']"
09/30/2017,"['The cryptocurrency markets ended the week on a high note following Korea’s ICO ban, indicating that, at least for now, traders are not worried about the government’s posture toward cryptocurrency. The markets were buttressed by positive news from the Japanese government, enabling the ethereum price to climb to $300 and the bitcoin price to approach $4,300.\n\nEarlier this week, Korean regulators announced a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs). While some reports indicated the prohibition was a blanket ban — such as the one enacted by China — residents still appear to be able to contribute to foreign ICOs and trade for those tokens on exchanges. Consequently, news of the ban only had a minor effect on the markets, and they quickly recovered from that dip.\n\nHastening the recovery was an announcement by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) that 11 Japanese bitcoin exchanges — including bitFlyer, one of the highest-volume bitcoin exchanges — had received licensure to continue to operate within the country. Japan has positioned itself as a central hub within the Asian cryptocurrency ecosystem, and this announcement reaffirms that the country will play a prominent role moving forward.\n\nThese developments contributed to the total cryptocurrency market cap’s continued recovery. After beginning the week at $131 billion, the total value of all cryptocurrencies steadily climbed throughout the week. Despite a brief dip immediately following the announcement of the Korea ICO ban, the markets continued to rise leading into the weekend. At present, the total crypto market cap is $146.6 billion, which is a 7-day increase of more than $15 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Nears $4,300\n\nThe bitcoin price headlined the week-long rally with a 14% climb. On September 23, the bitcoin price was trading below $3,800, but it gradually scaled the charts throughout the week. At present, the bitcoin price is $4,284 — this is its highest mark since September 12. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $71.1 billion.\n\nEthereum Price Crosses $300\n\nThe ethereum price did not quite keep up with the pace of bitcoin’s rally, but it did manage a weekly gain of 8%. This was quite significant, especially considering that Korea’s ICO ban has a much deeper impact on ethereum than bitcoin and most altcoins. Altogether, the ethereum price gained nearly $20 for the week and is now valued at a global average of $300. This translates into a market cap of $28.5 billion.\n\nAltcoins Trend Up\n\nThe majority of top-tier altcoins followed the path blazed by bitcoin and ethereum, and several returned gains greater than 10%.\n\nThe Ripple price rose 12% over the course of the week, enabling it to maintain the 3rd-place ranking on the market cap charts. Bitcoin cash ended the week with a 3% bump and is now priced at $438.\n\nThe litecoin price rose 12% to $54 and has widened the market cap gap between it and 6th-place Dash to $400 million. Dash, meanwhile, had a disappointing week that culminated in a 7% decline. NEM rose 8%, while IOTA increased by 15%.\n\nThe NEO price was far and away the top 10’s most impressive performer, surging 57% to $31 and the 9th place on the charts. Monero returned a moderate gain of 5% to round out the top 10, but it may soon face a challenge from ethereum classic, which, after falling to 11th, soared 24% for the week and is now priced at $13.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It looks as if we may finally see official cryptocurrency regulation in China. Although this discussion has gone on for some time, the conclusion may arrive in a day from now.Chinese sources claim the new guidelines will go into effect on October 1st of 2017. Although no one knows for sure what the regulation entails, speculation is running wild. China has lost its dominance in the cryptocurrency world, though, and new guidelines won’t change that by any means.\n\nA lot of people are waiting to see what China will do with cryptocurrencies. With all exchanges halting CNY trading, some changes will be introduced, We do not know what these changes will entail exactly. JInse, a Chinese media outlets, seems to think cryptocurrencies will be classified as virtual property. That would be a rather interesting turn of events, as China would set a rather unusual precedent in this regard.\n\nChinese Cryptocurrency Regulation Remains a Mystery\n\nMore specifically, if this is true, all cryptocurrency will be legally protected in the country. Some experts claim the country’s regulators have always been working on making Bitcoin legal. However, there has been plenty of evidence clearly pointing in the other direction. The Asian country seemingly has a love-hate relationship with cryptocurrencies as of right now. Virtual property classification does make a lot of sense, though.\n\nMoreover, it is unclear if the new regulation will be presented tomorrow. Insiders claim the process is expected to be finalized “soon”, yet there is no official date whatsoever. It is possible tomorrow will bring more clarity or more confusion. Only time will tell which of the two will turn out to be true in the end. All surviving exchanges should reopen their doors relatively quickly as well. Again, there is no official timeline or confirmation.\n\nOne thing a lot of people have forgotten is how China will not ban cryptocurrency. That has never been the intention, nor will it be in the future. Exchanges are scrutinized for money laundering concerns first and foremost. However, cryptocurrency trading was never halted. This means there is a bright future ahead for Bitcoin and altcoins in the Asian country. For now, no one knows what we can expect from the new regulation. All of this is a temporary measure, though, that much is certain.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'NEW DELHI: Delhi Police Crime Branch has arrested half a dozen of people including a woman for allegedly duping buyers on the pretext of selling Bitcoin.

shut down bitcoin trading platforms has left investors scrambling to cut their losses and threatens to deprive the crypto-currency of a crucial market.\n\n“The authorities don’t understand anything about bitcoin!” fumed Zhang Yanhua, founder of an investment fund that was dead on arrival after Beijing started tightening the screws at the start of the month.\n\nIn mid-September the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, told virtual currency trading platforms based in Beijing and Shanghai to cease market operations.\n\nThe bank has focused its sights not just on bitcoin but also ethereum and any other electronic units that are exchanged online without being regulated by any country.\n\nThey include two Chinese platforms, Okcoin and BTC China, which accounted for 22 percent of the global volume of bitcoins at the end of August.\n\nThe bank’s warning shot has shaken world prices and put a damper on the active community of local investors.\n\n“The chances of a reversal are minimal,” said Zhang Yanhua, who has been scrambling to offload his bitcoins.\n\nThree months ago the 50-year-old had set up a small investment fund dedicated to crypto-currencies, which met a premature end.\n\nTo acquire virtual currencies, “investment channels (in yuan) are becoming scarcer” and access to platforms using foreign currencies “will become too complicated”, Zhang told AFP.\n\nOthers are seeking an alternative way out: private over-the-counter transactions between individuals are taking off on messaging applications.\n\nBut Zhang said that was “too risky”.\n\nFor his part, Sun Minjie, an investor who says he bought more than $150,000 worth of bitcoins, intends to hold on to them for the long term.\n\n“I expect nothing from the government… but the fate of bitcoin does not depend on the Chinese authorities.”\n\n– ‘Criminal instrument’ –\n\nWhy has this hardening attitude towards bitcoin come about?\n\nIn mid-September, the National Internet Finance Association of China — an offshoot of the central bank — drew up a damning indictment against virtual currencies, accusing them of being “increasingly used as a tool in criminal activities” such as drug trafficking.\n\nBitcoin has also lured many ordinary Chinese attracted by the incredible surge in prices, a popularity that has generated “pyramid schemes and financial fraud”, said Dong Ximiao, an economist at Peking University.\n\nBut the central bank, which at the start of September banned companies from issuing electronic currency units to raise funds, wants to fight “the speculation” around the crypto-currencies, which “seriously disrupted the financial system”.\n\n“They didn’t ban bitcoin, but banned exchanges from trading for speculative purposes,” said David Yermack, finance professor at New York University.\n\nChina “has a long-term concern about capital flight”, which hits the value of the yuan, he said.\n\n“It has a lot to do with problems in the Chinese financial system, that they’re worried about this as a competitive threat in some way,” said Yermack.\n\nThe price of bitcoin plummeted mid-September after the ultimatum to the Chinese platforms, slipping to under $3,300.\n\nIt made a vigorous recovery to around $4,100 Friday, though it had traded around $5,000 a month ago, according to the Bitcoin Price Index.\n\n– Minefield –\n\nAnother cause for concern is the future of bitcoin mining in China, which the authorities have yet to comment on.\n\nThe virtual currency is created through blockchain technology, which publicly records transaction details including the unique alphanumeric strings that identify buyers and sellers\n\nIt is very profitable but long, expensive, energy-intensive process requiring powerful servers.\n\nBetween 60 and 70 percent of new bitcoins are mined in China, where the local leader Bitmain has imposing infrastructure.\n\nIf the government officially attacked the Chinese “miners”, “this would reduce the volumes produced” and move the mining elsewhere, strengthening the hand of Western players such as BitFury, observed Greg Revenu, managing partner of investment bank Bryan, Garnier & Co.\n\nBut “it’s a separate topic from trading platforms,” said Revenu. “And as the spectrum of applications using the blockchain technology widens, China may take another look.”\n\nIn fact, blockchain technology — which is reputedly very secure and in principle impossible to tamper with — is already used in food safety, finance and sea freight.\n\nAnd Beijing does not want to be left behind: Despite the crackdown the Chinese ministry of industry announced last week the launch of a research laboratory dedicated to blockchain to “accelerate” its development in the country. – AFP', 'One of the more hilarious myths about bitcoin is that it is a money supply that is fixed. Like most myths, there is an element of truth here. There are only 21 million solutions to the bitcoin encryption puzzle. Each solution represents a coin or token that impacts the bitcoin price. When all the solutions are found there will be no more new bitcoins.\n\nBut this is not strictly true, thanks to the open source miracle known as a fork.\n\nHaving covered open source for five years in the past decade, I know about forks. A fork happens when developers can’t agree on how to improve an open source program. A divorce is arranged, and the two codebases go their own ways, letting developers sort the wheat from the chaff.\n\nWhat the Fork Means for Bitcoin’s Price\n\nBitcoin has already gone through such a fork, resulting in Bitcoin Cash. On Sept. 28 a bitcoin was worth $4,171, and a Bitcoin Cash token was worth $441.72.\n\nI covered the issue for InvestorPlace at the time of the fork and, while some bitcoin trading houses were reluctant at first to hand over Bitcoin Cash to their customers, things are slowly sorting themselves out.\n\nThey’re doing so just in time for two more forks.\n\nOne, called Bitcoin Gold, claims technical motivation — a new algorithm, the claim of a truly “decentralized” market. But this is basically Chinese miners and a programmer operating under a pseudonym building a new sandbox.\n\nThe other fork, based on Segwit2X, aims to increase the transaction capability of bitcoin. It could happen in November.\n\nThe result would be four tokens, all claiming the title bitcoin, in the market.\n\nEthereum Is Bubblelicious\n\nWant more cryptocurrency? You’re in luck, because Vitaly Buterin, the Russian programmer behind Ethereum, is planning a fork there, too.\n\nA new network dubbed Metropolis is being rolled out, aimed like the bitcoin forks on scaling issues, allowing more trading and a new Proof of Stake algorithm to identify new coins.\n\nThere is a lot of hype around all of this. Buterin says his network will be able to handle as much transaction volume as Visa, the credit and debit card network, in just a few years.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) CEO James Gorman now calls bitcoin “more than just a fad,” a stark contrast with JP Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, who calls it a fraud and a bubble.\n\nArgentine bitcoin evangelist Wences Casares, who runs bitcoin wallet company Xapo, which seems to feature his handsome face on its homepage, is now predicting bitcoin prices will breach $1 million per coin in five years. If that prediction doesn’t convince you we are in a bubble, nothing will.\n\nBottom Line on Bitcoin\n\nBlockchain is a new technology. Blockchain will change the world.\n\nThis was true for the Internet in the 1990s, when I made a handsome living as an Internet Commerce analyst. But between the dot-com era and today’s Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) era, a lot happened, and those who got stuck on the wrong side of the trade, in say Pets.Com or Webvan, lost fortunes.\n\nBitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are the dot-com bubble inside the Blockchain reality. You can trade them. It’s exciting. But there is, as yet, no “there” there, because there is no way to be sure that what you have won’t be forked, that your wallet company will support each fork, or that the Chinese and Russian sharks now driving this market from Singapore and Silicon Valley won’t decide to have you for lunch.\n\nWithout government, there remains government of the wealthy, government of the most ruthless. Real governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Real governments have laws that can be enforced. Real currencies depend on laws, not men.\n\nIt’s like my late father said.

It\'s all trust issues,"" Harker said.\n\nHe told attendees:\n\n""And so, when cryptocurrencies and other forms of currency emerge, I think the basis of that has to be how do they create that trust?""\n\nTrust in the government\n\nHarker went on to acknowledge that while citizens have put varying degrees of trust in what he called the ""sovereign states"" that stand behind currencies today, other currency models might be possible. This includes, he said, ways in which trust might come from another ""large player,"" or as in the case of bitcoin, an algorithm.\n\nBut his most pertinent critique was perhaps that cryptocurrencies have not been significantly tested enough to ensure confidence.\n\nDespite issues such as the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the bitcoin\'s network\'s largest exchange, or the ongoing bitcoin scaling debate, Harker argued that cryptocurrency has been largely insulated from ""bad times.""\n\n""Everything can work in good times,"" he added.\n\nThis leads to the second reason Harker said he\'s not concerned about cryptocurrency hamstringing the Fed\'s monetary influence: If – and, according to Harker, when – things go wrong, the Federal Reserve and other state agencies will likely be asked to get involved anyway.\n\n""When things really go bad, where do Americans turn?"" he asked ""Well, they\'re going to come back to the government. That\'s the history of the country.""\n\n\'How do you regulate an algorithm?\'\n\nElsewhere, Harker responded with his thoughts on cryptocurrency regulation, with his interviewer, Knowledge@Wharton founder Mukul Pandya, asking directly how the Federal Reserve might assist or advise on such a strategy. (The Federal Reserve has previously noted that it does not have the authority to directly regulate the technology.)\n\nOn this point, he was inconclusive, suggesting any ideation is today in early stages.\n\n""How do you regulate an algorithm?"" he asked, drawing laughs from the audience. ""I don\'t know yet. The answer is we have to continue to study this.""\n\nStill, that doesn\'t mean there aren\'t possible next steps.\n\nFor example, those studies might include looking more closely at how another algorithm, perhaps one created by the Federal Reserve, might ensure fairness in mathematical form, something Harker said is crucial to any potential cryptocurrency controls.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Before we even think about how you regulate an algorithm, how would you even build an algorithm that would have that sense of fairness in it? It is a fairly deep technical question.""\n\nPatrick Harker image via Federal Reserve\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Shane Hickey reports\n\nThe boss of JP Morgan was unequivocal about bitcoin at a recent conference in New York: the digital currency was only fit for drug dealers and would eventually blow up. “[It] isn’t going to work,” said Jamie Dimon. “You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that the people who are buying it are really smart.”\n\nA few days after Dimon’s comments, the value of bitcoin plunged when the Chinese authorities announced a crackdown on it. It has been an eventful month, even in the context of a currency that is less than a decade old. Since the start of the year the value of a single bitcoin has gone from $1,000 (£750) to almost $5,000.\n\nThe spiralling price of the cryptocurrency, along with the controversy it has attracted in the past few weeks, has meant that interest from buyers has peaked and more consumers are considering whether to invest – or gamble, as some commentators say – in it.\n\n“We continue to see a rise in demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” says Obi Nwosu of Coinfloor, an exchange where people can buy and trade bitcoin. “When senior leaders in the financial community, regulators and government bodies share their views about bitcoin, it further raises interest and awareness in the market.”\n\nSo amid the warnings, should investors see the spiralling price as reason enough to buy?\n\nDon’t dismiss bankers' predictions of a bitcoin bubble – they should know Read more\n\nHow it began\n\nEstablished in 2009 after the financial crash, bitcoin is a digital currency that has no central bank or regulatory authority backing it up. The coins don’t exist in a tangible form but are made by computers and stored in a digital wallet or on the cloud. They can then be exchanged and used in transactions.\n\nThere is a finite number of bitcoin that can be supplied – 21m – and there are currently 15m in circulation. Its price has fluctuated wildly since it was launched. Seven years ago, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 bitcoin. At its peak at the beginning of September this year each bitcoin was worth almost $5,000. As it can be used as an anonymous way to carry out cross-border money transfers, it has been linked to drug dealing and money laundering.\n\nThere are bitcoin ATMs that allow the cryptocurrency to be exchanged for cash, and an increasing number of businesses accept it. Lady Mone, co-founder of underwear brand Ultimo, launched a property development in Dubai with prices in bitcoin, while a London property developer is to allow its tenants to pay their deposits using it.\n\nGrowing interest\n\nThe renewed attention on bitcoin has led to a spike in interest from people wanting to invest. “BTC [bitcoin] and crypto[currency] more broadly have hit the mainstream consciousness,” says Lex Deak, chief executive of alternative investment aggregator Off3r. “I am getting an increasing number of enquiries from late adopters who want to learn more about accessing investment opportunities in the space. It has matured rapidly since the beginning of the year, courtesy of the jump from $1,000 to over $4,000, with a feeling that there is now a little less volatility.”\n\nI have heard of people moving their life investments into bitcoin and this is a bad idea Marc Warne, Bittylicious\n\nGuy Halford-Thompson, the founder of brokerage Quickbitcoin, says he would not be surprised if mainstream brokers and investors started to invest heavily in the near future. At the same time, the financial regulator has warned against a speculative frenzy over initial coin offerings (ICOs) – a digital way of raising funds from the public using cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin – because of their unregulated nature and lack of investor protection.\n\nWhile some investors may be attracted by the massive rises this year, others will be wary of the volatility. In mid-January one bitcoin was valued at $800. By June this had gone to $3,000. One month later, it was at less than $2,000 and then almost $5,000 by the start of September. Two weeks later, it was at $3,200.\n\n“Whether it is suitable or not is down to individual circumstances,” says Deak. “If you are an experienced investor with a balanced portfolio and relatively small exposure, then BTC is an exciting and potentially lucrative investment. It needs to come with a clear warning that there is potential for significant losses and investors need to carefully consider the method of investing.”\n\nTread carefully\n\nElectronic payments expert Dave Birch has said in the past that “one doesn’t invest in bitcoin, one gambles on bitcoin”. Those working in the area advise anyone planning on buying the currency to only invest as much as they are prepared to lose.\n\n“The general sensible view is that the more volatile the investment, the smaller proportion of your wealth you should consider storing in it,” says Marc Warne, founder of bitcoin exchange Bittylicious. “I have heard of people moving their life investments into bitcoin and this is a bad idea.\n\n“The flipside is simple – why not give it a try? If you have £20 to spare, for instance, buy a tiny amount and track its price. If something goes hideously wrong the £20 can be written off and it can be considered a learning experience. If you can, spend it somewhere like at a few pubs that accept it.”\n\nBecause the typical protections surrounding investment are not present with bitcoin, prospective investors should ask for help from those who have traded in them already, says Halford-Thompson. “My advice to anyone thinking about investing in bitcoin is to do their own research, but also to speak to people who have already gone through the experience of investing in it,” he says.\n\n“Most of the dangers are because the protection that investors would normally enjoy on a stock market are not present. If you own bitcoin, you need to make sure you know how to buy, sell and store it properly or you risk losing your entire investment.”\n\nDon’t let the bankers fool you: bitcoin is here to stay | Dominic Frisby Read more\n\nIs it secure?\n\nConcerns about the security of the cryptocurrency have continued to shadow it. Last year, almost 120,000 bitcoin worth around $78m (£58m)were stolen from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, which resulted in a 20% drop in the value of the currency at the time.\n\n“Similar to online banking, people need to take care with their bitcoin account credentials,” says Nwosu. “Whether you secure your bitcoin yourself or with a third party like Coinfloor, we recommend the safest way to go is to keep your security credentials offline.”\n\nDaniel Scott of Coincorner says the currency itself is secure, but the problem surrounds businesses in the industry and the wallets where the bitcoin are stored. “Unfortunately, IT security is a real-world issue, not just for bitcoin but within any industry that uses technology. You only have to do a quick Google search for recent hackings of large global companies to see that any company is open to security issues regardless of size or industry.”\n\nAS RISKY AS TULIPS\n\nWhen Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, dismissed bitcoin as a currency for drug dealers and murders that would end up imploding, he compared its rise to an infamous bubble from the 1600s. “It is worse than tulip bulbs,” he said.\n\nDimon was referring to one of the most notorious periods of speculation in history when the value of tulip bulbs rocketed amid a mania for the flowers. The popularity of the bulbs hit its peak in the 1630s.\n\nThey were traded “frantically”, according to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, and some people even put their homes down as collateral. However, the market crashed in February 1637, leaving many investors penniless."", 'While Bitcoin remains highly speculative – I think it can continue to strengthen from here. Bitcoin is so volatile that I want to reiterate my belief that it only belongs in your portfolio as part of your highly speculative allocation (link). I also think it is worth reviewing my 3 Rules of Bitcoin (link).\n\nThe bullish case is that Bitcoin survived the recent bearish case so well.\n\nBloomberg\n\nBack on September 15, it appeared to me as though not only China, but a number of public figures were trying to crack down on Bitcoin (link). It was successful at first, as Bitcoin continued its decline, dropping from over $5,000 to as low as $3,000. Bitcoin has rebounded sharply since then.\n\nThe ‘evangelists’ of bitcoin argue that the fact it isn\'t controlled by governments is precisely why you should own it. Bitcoin is meant to be function outside of the realm of central banks and governments. Bitcoin seems to have navigated this recent crackdown with great success.\n\nBy passing the recent test with flying colors, Bitcoin should attract some new investors. There are many investors who have watched the rally in cryptocurrencies from the sidelines because they have concerns about the ability of cryptocurrencies to deliver as advertised. It seems likely that some of these investors will dip their toe in the water now - creating new demand for cryptocurrencies in the near term. This additional new demand should help keep prices rising. If there were easier ways for ""mainstream"" investors to get involved in Bitcoin (like ETFs) the rally would be even stronger.\n\nThe cynic in me, needs to point out that many people have strong incentives to prop up the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin miners, in particular, come to mind. Bitcoin mining remains very profitable at these prices. In a world where there are no rules (Rule #2 of my 3 Rules of Bitcoin) we have to consider that some of this rebound may be driven by those who have the most to gain. That incentive and risk of manipulation is always an issue in thinly traded markets, but I think it is an even greater concern in the sometimes murky world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile I still don\'t have a strong conviction on the long term viability of cryptocurrencies, I do think it is impressive that they recovered from this China crackdown, which is positive for prices in the near term.\n\nFor disclosure, I don’t own Bitcoin at the time of writing this, but will likely be adding some back in the near future.', 'Bitcoin\'s valuation is soaring - up 322% since the start of the year - but plenty of critics are throwing shade at the dazzling cryptocurrency.\n\nMost prominently, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this month called the digital currency a ""fraud"" and described it as ""worse than tulip bulbs."" Unsatisfied with his sick burns, he came back a few days later and dismissed Bitcoin as ""a novelty...worth nothing."" And though the haters are going to hate and view Bitcoin as a risky proposition, it may actually offer a safe route to a secure retirement for long-term investors like you and me.\n\nFirst off, as TheStreet contributor Tanzeel Akhtar delineated this week, Bitcoin IRAs are attractive to investors looking for stability during these volatile times. Amid the threat of nuclear war with North Korea and a spate of terror attacks around the world and uncertain legislation stateside, Americans are looking for safe havens, namely in alternative assets, to park their money. And though gold once reigned supreme for this purpose, Bitcoin has taken up the mantel. Though Bitcoin alone, despite some volatility, could be seen as a hedge to market uncertainty, keeping Bitcoin in a retirement vehicle like an IRA is actually doubly safe.\n\nEditor\'s Cut Exclusives\n\nA self-directed IRA is the way to go to allow for the integration of Bitcoin, amid other alternative assets like cryptocurrency Ethereum and gold. Firms like First Digital IRA (FDIRA), Pensco, The Entrust Group and the Millennium Trust Company also allow investors to stick Bitcoin in a self-directed IRA. By being aware of contribution limits - $5,500 annually - and the need to hire a custodian, investors are being prudent with their choice. The flexibility of a self-directed IRA is key.\n\n""The Internal Revenue Service allows self-directed IRAs to hold a variety of investments far beyond stocks, bonds and mutual funds such as gold and other precious metals, along with some non-publicly traded real estate, private equity, partnerships, joint ventures and other alternative investments,"" said Jeffrey Kelley, senior vice president of Equity Institutional, which through Equity Trust Company offers IRAs, retirement and non-retirement plans for alternative and traditional assets.\n\nFor some investors, part of that push for diversification may well entail Bitcoin. Sometimes it pays to think outside the box, even when planning for something like a safe retirement. As TheStreet contributor Larry Light recently told us, even target-date funds, the most run-of-the-mill way to structure your 401(k) don\'t always deliver. And as long-time TheStreet contributor Jason Notte wrote this week, if your retirement savings aren\'t diversified, you aren\'t ready for your golden years. Mixing it up by diversifying your asset allocation through alternative investments in your IRA can be an exercise in prudence, despite associations of danger you may have with Bitcoin as a currency that fuels that Dark Web.\n\nPerhaps it\'s no surprise that as Bitcoin goes mainstream, even prominent retirement account custodians like Fidelity are getting in on the game. As TheStreet contributor Brian O\'Connell noted, in a partnership with digital asset exchange platform CoinBase, Fidelity Labs lets Bitcoin and blockchain users track their crypto investments along with their more traditional investments. And we may soon see approval for a Bitcoin futures-based ETF, the VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF.\n\nBut fads in the investment world are short-lived; true trends stick around when they have legit intelligence behind them. As TheStreet contributor Jordan French points out, the real point of investing in Bitcoin, especially in your portfolio, is diversification. Of course, impediments to Bitcoin\'s meteoric rise - above $5,000 and beyond - include skittish investors, legal uncertainties and structural complexities such as open-end funds and unit investment trusts for Bitcoin. But with Edward Jones finding that one-third of Americans believing their retirement portfolio is not diversified enough to provide a comfortable retirement, it may be the moment to dip a toe in an asset shining enough to make Midas jealous.\n\nAre you investing in cryptocurrency? Don\'t miss TheStreet\'s coverage:', 'Investments follow trends, just like everything else. In the 1970s, anything with ‘tronics’ in its name was a hot item. In the late 1990s, ‘dotcom’ immediately garnered attention. Now, according to Bloomberg, companies embracing ‘digital technologies’ or Bitcoin are the newest Wall Street fad.\n\nOverstock and Goldmoney\n\nThe evaluation is based on news this week regarding a couple of different companies who have embraced digital currencies and have seen substantial upticks in share price and therefore market cap. This indicates a new fad, per Bloomberg.\n\nOverstock, captained by crypto believer Patrick Byrne, added $137 man in market cap after announcing a digital currency trading platform. Goldmoney, who offered its clients the ability to trade and store some cryptocurrencies in insured wallets, rose 15 percent on the news.\n\nComing revolution\n\nThe price surges represent a belief among market investors that the nascent Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies will have massive impacts on the market, in much the same way dotcom companies did previously.\n\nInvestors are seeking to gain traction early in a market where gains may well be sizeable. However, the implicit risk and technical hurdles associated with digital currencies have led to increasing pressure from investors looking for mainstream options for investment. Hence the immediate pop in price when companies announce cryptocurrency exposure plans.']"
