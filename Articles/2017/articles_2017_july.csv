07/01/2017,"[""Bitcoin is currently down about $500, or nearly 17%, from its June 12th peak of $3,000 per coin. Essentially every other major cryptocurrency, including Ethereum and Litecoin, has seen similar declines. There have been fluctuations since the peak, but the overall trend has been steadily downhill for weeks.\n\nWhile it can seem odd to apply old-school securities terms to newfangled digital money, that means the crypto market is nearing the conventional 20% decline that defines bear territory.\n\nFew insiders — or regular Fortune readers — are likely surprised by this. “Bubble” was maybe the single word most consistently spoken by expert panelists at the Consensus conference in late May. Our Robert Hackett diagnosed a speculative bubble two weeks before the peak.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nRecent weeks’ losses weren’t the one-day implosion often associated with a bubble. But the more important feature of bubbles – delirious optimism ungrounded in reality – has been swirling for months. Investment Strategist Matt Prusak, writing at Coindesk, has rounded up some novel examples of “dumb money” (his term) rushing into cryptocurrency. Many of them are quite entertaining if you aren’t among those taking losses right now.\n\nPrusak points out, for instance, this account of amateurs rushing into the market as it peaked:\n\nMost dangerous sign it's a buble: friends 71 year old aunt is being pitched a no-lose investment in ethereum by a coffee shop manager. — Dmitry Buterin (@ChiefApricot) June 14, 2017\n\nThe tweet is particularly notable, of course, because Dmitry Buterin is the father of Vitalik Buterin – creator of #2 cryptocurrency Ethereum. Dmitry, like most insiders, has been watching for a correction for weeks.\n\nPrusak also points out this doubly amusing post from BroBible, titled “What is The Etherum [sic] Cyrptocurrency [sic] and How Will It Make You Rich AF?” It was posted, misspellings and all, as the market was already heading down.\n\nPrusak dives into several other dimensions of crypto-mania, but I’ll cite just one more that’s particularly illuminating. Through the entire course of the runup, the value of Ethereum (ETH) has been tracked closely by the value of Ethereum Classic (ETC). While Ethereum may be the cryptocurrency with the broadest real-world adoption, Ethereum Classic is a so-called fork, completely distinct from Ethereum and with barely a fraction of Ethereum’s adoption.\n\nPrusak says it is “highly likely the price [of ETC] has been driven significantly higher by uninformed investors simply not understanding the difference between the two – similar to how adding “.com” to a company’s name in 1999 sent stock prices up on average 74%.”\n\nTo be clear, calling the cryptocurrency market in a given month a hype-driven bubble is not the same thing as deriding the technology. This is revolutionary stuff with huge long-term potential, and for some, declining prices will mean a buying opportunity. But it’s an extremely volatile, high-risk asset, and there’s every chance that any particular coin – even Bitcoin itself – could end up being worth nothing at all."", 'Experts call for caution about digital currencies, such as bitcoin and Ethereum, but financial firms are considering adopting them or even establishing their own\n\nLast Sunday a message posted on message board 4Chan started the rumor that Vitalik Buterin, the founder of cryptocurrency Ethereum, had been killed in a car crash. News of the 23-year-old, Russian-born programmer’s demise was soon proved false – but not before 20%, or roughly $4bn, had been wiped from Ethereum’s soaring market value.\n\nThe hoax not only drew attention to Ethereum, the second largest digital currency after bitcoin, which had seen its value rise fiftyfold since the start of the year to $300 a coin, but also to the booming market in other so-called cryptocurrencies that could now be on the cusp of mainstream financial credibility.\n\nWhy the US government wants to bring cryptocurrency out of the shadows Read more\n\nLast week Barclays’ CEO for personal and corporate banking, Ashok Vaswani, revealed the lender had opened discussions with UK regulators about adopting digital currencies.\n\n“We have been talking to a couple of fintechs [financial technology companies] and have actually gone with the fintechs to the FCA [the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator] to talk about how we could bring the equivalent of bitcoin, not necessarily bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies into play,” Vaswani told CNBC at a conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\n“Obviously [it’s] a new area, obviously an area we’ve got to be careful with. We are working our way through it.”\n\nVaswani’s comments came after several central banks from across Europe and Asia said they were looking into establishing digital-only currencies in addition to traditional denominations.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China has reportedly run trials, while the Danish central bank is considering a digital-only e-krone.\n\nOn 19 June, the International Monetary Fund issued a staff discussion note stating that banks should consider investing in cryptocurrencies, saying: “Rapid advances in digital technology are transforming the financial services landscape, creating opportunities and challenges for consumers, service providers and regulators alike.”\n\nAt the same time, IBM announced it had made a deal with the Digital Trade Chain Consortium – a group of seven European banks that includes Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Societe Generale and Unicredit – to build a digital trade platform that will run on IBM’s cloud.\n\nAndrew Levin, professor of economics at Dartmouth and co-author of a study on central bank digital currencies, told the Guardian that the concept of private institutions creating new forms of payment was not in itself new, “but the greater need is for consumers and businesses to have access to money that has a stable value and is practically costless to use. We think there’s a strong case for central banks to issue digital currencies that would be free to use.”\n\n\n\nCrypto- or cyber-currencies are digital-only currencies in which encryption and registry techniques, often called blockchains, are used to regulate the generation of units of currency independent of a central bank.\n\nIt is a booming, dizzying market. Since the start of the year, bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, has almost tripled in value to $2,565. By some estimates, the cryptocurrency business could be worth $5tn by 2022. There are now close to 800 cryptocurrencies worth, in total, around $96bn.\n\nOne of the newest offered to market is Tezos, backed by billionaire venture capitalist and early bitcoin investor Tim Draper of Draper Fisher Jurvetson. According to a prospectus, a total of US$893,200.77 worth of XTZ tokens will be issued on 1 July.\n\n“The best thing I can do is lead by example,” Draper told Reuters last month. “Over time, I actually feel that some of these tokens are going to improve the world, and I want to make sure those tokens get promoted as well. I think Tezos is one of those tokens.”\n\n\n\nTezos’ founders, Kathleen and Arthur Breitman, anticipate their ICO will become a “digital commonwealth” or “self-governing network”. The couple’s background in finance speaks to the seriousness of the endeavor: Arthur worked at the high-frequency trading desk at Goldman Sachs; Kathleen at Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund.\n\n“We think our competitive advantage is in our ability to assign governance,” Kathleen told the Observer. “The thing about blockchain is it’s very interdisciplinary. You have to have an understanding of finance and economics, but also game theory, pure science and networking theory.”\n\nShe concedes that blockchain complexity is also cause for investor skepticism. “A lot of people struggle to understand its value proposition, because it offers something different to everyone. I like the idea of putting business logic in a decentralised network, and hopefully, it will help people to conduct business more easily.”\n\nBrock Pierce, a co-founder of Blockchain Capital and a relative veteran of the ICO market, recently launched a tradeable, digital securities token called BCAP that he considers “the next giant leap in the democratization of venture capital and liquidity where everybody has equal access”.\n\nDo digital currencies spell the end of capitalism? Read more\n\nThree days ago, Pierce launched the token distribution of EOS, a blockchain coin (or token) offering that’s already taken in $100m. “This is a 340-day project that’s already broken every record. It’s 100% certain we’re going to surpass Bancor, the most successful ICO to date.”\n\nPierce predicts that the underlying technology of blockchain – essentially a public record of actions – “is going to impact our world more than the internet has”.\n\nHe added: “The implications are huge, and it’s going to have huge implications not only on venture, but private equity, real estate, digitizing currency. This is going to be the technology that democratizes the global financial system so everybody has equal access.”\n\nBut such rapid increases in value is cause for concern. Five-year-old Ripple XRP, which is connected to 75 banks, including Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada, has increased in value by 40 times this year alone. According to CNBC, 100 billion XRP are in existence, each priced 26 cents.\n\n“A lot of lessons will be learned and a lot of money will be lost, before a lot of money can be made,” Peter Denious, head of global venture capital at Aberdeen Asset Management, told Bloomberg last week. “Prices right now aren’t being driven by network usage, they’re being driven by speculation that tokens are going to appreciate. It’s a gold-rush mentality.”\n\nBut Les Borsai, an early investor in Ethereum, believes that what is under way is a re-ordering of the financial systems. At root, he argues, blockchain technology shows “we don’t need a centralized solution for anything. It’s a liberated attitude and the implications are huge”.\n\n• This article was amended on 4 July 2017 to correct a job title.\n\n', 'The crypto markets slumped on Saturday following several days of consistent gains. Both bitcoin and ethereum prices slid into the red, and most altcoins experienced declines as well.\n\nBitcoin Price Falls Below $2,500\n\nToday’s bitcoin price decline was not as pronounced as the one it experienced earlier this week, but it still fell 1.73% to $2,496. More important is the fact that the bitcoin price has experienced a fairly steady skid over the past seven days, as the chart below indicates. Bitcoin now has a market cap of just under $41 billion.\n\nOne must wonder if concern over the impending network fork is fueling the recent bitcoin price decline and encouraging investors to cash out recent gains in anticipation of a potential price dip following the fork. If such a dip does occur, proactive investors will be able to acquire coins at a steep discount from current prices.\n\nCrypto Markets Drop Under $100 Billion\n\nEarlier this week the total cryptocurrency market cap had inched its way back to $100 billion after the Monday Massacre, but today’s events erased that progress. The total market cap slid back beneath $100 billion and currently sits at $98.9 billion.\n\nEthereum Loses Ground\n\nEarlier in June, the ethereum price managed to climb even when bitcoin and other altcoins fell. That has not been the case this week, as the downward trend has often hit ethereum worse than bitcoin. Today, ethereum price fell to $283. This 8% decrease caused ethereum to lose some ground in the fight to supplant bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nAs tends to happen in widespread market downturns, bitcoin regained a bit of its market dominance. Bitcoin dominance rose to 41.5% for a 24-hour increase of 1%.\n\nEthereum controls a 26.7% market cap share with a total valuation of $26.4 billion, down from 27.7% on Friday. Once again, Ripple and litecoin held steady at 10% and 2% of total market cap.\n\nAltcoin Prices Falter\n\nEvery altcoin in the top ten experienced a price decline. The Ripple price fell 2.3%, dropping its market cap below $10 billion. The litecoin price managed to stay above $40, but it still fell by 2.7%. Ethereum Classic dropped 5% following a social engineering hack of Classic Ether Wallet. NEM and Dash declined 4.76% and 2.42%, respectively. IOTA fell 9%, despite news of a new blockchain research partnership with prominent Norwegian healthcare providers. To round out the top ten, Monero fell 4.35% and BitShares fell by 7%.\n\nBytecoin Price Resists the Trend\n\nA few altcoins managed to resist the slump. As the chart below demonstrates, the Bytecoin price rose 28% today, placing it 13th on the market cap charts. If Byetcoin can continue its upward trend, it could threaten to replace either Monero or BitShares in the top 10.\n\nA few smaller altcoins rose as well. PIVX saw a 42% rise to $2.63 and the 39th spot on the market cap charts. Numeraire rose 45% to $53 and the 49th-largest valuation.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The digital currency can now be bought at ATMs around the country\n\nMy journey into the dark economy starts much as expected: in front of a computer screen, late at night. It ends somewhere quite unexpected, in a humdrum setting a world away from the stereotype of modernity, equality and sticking it to the man promised by digital currencies such as Bitcoin: it ends in a used DVD store, my purchase refused.\n\nThe dark economy is moving into the light. In a few scattered places, 40 or so in London, one in Manchester, another in Birmingham, Bitcoin ATM machines have appeared, issuing the cryptocurrency from an unlikely array of convenience stores, vaping outlets and barbershops. Does this mean that the virtual has become real? Can anyone join the Bitcoin challenge? Can you buy stuff with Bitcoin? And what the heck is a cryptocurrency anyway?\n\nHow can I invest in bitcoin? Read more\n\nI find the future of digital trading in the scuzzy hipster oasis of Stokes Croft in Bristol. Standing forlorn among the artisan bakers and cocktail bars is the Best Supermarket. A mainstay of local life, it dispenses all the essentials that an artisan bakery cannot provide. Amid the sweets and quarter bottles of spirits is the Satoshi Point, one of several Bitcoin ATMs run by the company that takes its name from the mythical founder of the online currency, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n“It’s crazy, people come in here all the time,” says Majid Khan from his vantage point behind the counter. “We get all sorts, they travel from all over, from Bath, Bristol.”\n\nThe small grey terminal was installed in the shop a year ago, one of two in the city, and has attracted a growing stream of users ever since, providing the shop’s owner with a steady commission. What they buy with the currency is obvious, at least to Khan.\n\n“It’s underground, illegal stuff,” he says with a grin. “I ask people what they are going to do with it and they just shrug and say, you know… They like the fact that it’s anonymous, that it’s not controlled by the government. One day a guy came in and I saw him put £2,000 cash into the machine.”\n\nKhan even succumbed to the charm of the grey box containing the mystery of Bitcoin, buying £20 of the currency. Did he spend it on something illegal? Did he stick it to the man? “I checked the value every day and it went up to £22. Then a guy came in wanting to buy some Bitcoin and I sold him mine for £20, so I didn’t lose anything.”\n\nSeduced by Khan’s tale of high-wire financial derring-do, I decide to pitch in with the geeks, the rebels, the tyros, the wolves of this virtual Wall Street and buy £20 of Bitcoin. Armed with the Bitcoin wallet app I had downloaded to my phone in the early hours, I press the start button on the terminal. It tells me to scan my phone and records the QR code I had been assigned. I take £20 and insert it into the slot. It disappears and my phone emits a polite “k-ching!”\n\nThe terminal tells me I have bought 9.23 milliBitcoins (0.00923 of a Bitcoin). A sense of prosperity surges through me, suffused with the thrill of illegality. I check my phone: “mBTC 9.23 = GBP 18.26”.\n\n“That’s our commission,” says Khan. “£1.74.”\n\nBuyer’s remorse sets in: my money has been turned into a string of numbers. I wonder if I should get my £20 back, but the only way to do that is to trade online, wait for someone to wander into the shop looking for £20 worth of digital currency or buy some of Khan’s essentials. He smiles again and shakes his head. “No, you can’t buy with Bitcoin here.”\n\nOutside the Best Supermarket a man is smoking something illegal. He must know all about cryptocurrency. He is probably a Bitcoin wizard, able to unlock the secrets of the hidden realm while blowing rings of exotic smoke.\n\nSadly not. “Is that what it is, a Bitcoin machine?” he says. “That’s an iconic shop, there’s always a gaggle of people outside in the middle of the night. Maybe that’s why they put it there.”\n\nI check my phone. “mBTC 9.23 = GBP £18.19.” Oh dear.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Best Supermarket in Stokes Croft, Bristol, where Bitcoin can be bought but not spent. Photograph: Alamy\n\nThere are four places in Bristol that accept Bitcoin as payment for a real-world transaction. Perhaps I can exchange my £20 of virtual number sequence-based money for something tangible?\n\nThe woman at Divino Deli in Clifton peers through the antipasti and pastries and shakes her head. “Sorry,” she says. “We used to do Bitcoin but we stopped.” A couple of miles away, in the notably less chi-chi area of Filton, the three men in Fades barbers look up from their phones when I ask if they do Bitcoin. “The machine’s in the back,” one of them says. I decide I could do with a haircut. Can I pay with Bitcoin, I ask? “No,” he says.\n\nFades got its Bitcoin ATM two months ago, and has a couple of customers a day. “It’s mostly guys in suits,” he says. “I suppose they use it like an investment. It’s going up, up, up, it’s like stocks and shares.”\n\nA year ago, a single Bitcoin cost just under £500. Today it is trading at £2,166.93, despite a steep fall at the start of June. Globally, the combined market value of cryptocurrencies reached nearly $100bn this year and together with its main digital currency rival, Ethereum, Bitcoin has delivered the best investment return of 2017, outstripping traditional entities such as Nasdaq.\n\nIts performance prompted some financial institutions to warn investors of a possible downturn in the value of the digital currency, and others – such as Morgan Stanley – to argue for government regulation. The intrusion of financial institutions into the world of cryptocurrencies has sparked a reaction from those who believe that Bitcoin and its counterparts should undermine the banking system and thereby establish economic equality.\n\nThe third vendor accepting Bitcoin in the Bristol area makes handcrafted furniture, so I go straight to number four: CEX, the high-street chain selling used DVDs, games and tech paraphernalia. The staff pause in unison when I ask if they take Bitcoin. “Nobody’s ever asked that before,” says a woman. “But it comes up on the screen, so I think we can.”\n\nI select some DVDs and take them to the till. “I’m paying with Bitcoin,” I remind them.\n\n“Nobody’s ever done that before,” says another woman. She summons a colleague.\n\n“I can set it up but it has to go through head office,” he explains. “It might be by the end of the day, but it might not.”\n\nI look at the DVDs, envisaging them turning back into a stream of digits floating in a far-off cloud.\n\n“Don’t spend your Bitcoin,” says the woman at the till. “Why would you spend them? There’s only a finite number that can be mined, so when it reaches that point they’ll just go up in value.” She’s done her research: by the year 2140, the limit of 21 million Bitcoins will have been reached and scarcity will set in.\n\nShe takes the DVDs from me, ready to be returned to the shelves. I check my phone. “mBTC 9.23 = £18.09.” I’m trading at a loss.\n\nBITCOIN FACTS\n\n? Invented in 2008 by an unknown programmer or group, under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n? Each Bitcoin is a string of computer code, which is protected by a personal key. It allows consumers to make electronic transactions without commercial banks as intermediaries, and outside the reach of central banks.\n\n? It’s estimated that there are between 2.9 million and 5.8 million active users of cryptocurrency wallets - the space where users store, send and receive currencies. Other cryptocurrencies include Ethereum and Ripple.\n\nRebecca Ratcliffe', ""There is an air of uncertainty among Bitcoiners of what would become of their fate in the near future.\n\nWith the community approaching a significant decision date on the issue of scaling, the outcome of the consensus is looking more like an open secret as SegWit2x and SegWit Support has officially surpassed Emergent Consensus.\n\nBitcoin is still likely to split\n\nHowever, the impact of the anticipated events of August 1, 2017, extends beyond just the expected improved efficiency of transactions within the Bitcoin network.\n\nWith significant opposition still in existence, a possible breakup is expected. This leaves room for a lot of uncertainty, leading to widespread speculation and predictions on what will become of Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem in general.\n\nMichael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins, affirms that SegWit2x and SegWit Support has officially surpassed Emergent Consensus, he identifies this development as a significant milestone.\n\nIt is important to have a backup plan\n\nVogel notes that August 1 will be the next important milestone, explaining that until SegWit is activated on the network, that's when Bitcoin users will have a first-hand opportunity to experience a scaling solution in action.\n\nVogel says:\n\n“If SegWit activation alleviates the network issues we've seen in recent months, then the outcome will be an overwhelmingly positive one. However, in terms of protecting wealth, in Bitcoin (and any cryptocurrency) we're still in relatively early days, so it's important to have backup plans. Nonetheless, I continue to be bullish on Bitcoin and a strong believer in its core value proposition as a currency and store of wealth.”\n\nBetter to keep Bitcoins offline\n\nAleksandar Matanovic of EC District expresses his weariness of the drama surrounding Bitcoin scaling.\n\n“I’m a bit tired of all the drama around scaling. Once this scaling is done, one way or the other, we will soon need another scaling.”\n\nMatanovic notes that the reaction of Bitcoin users to scaling would depend on personal motives and their reasons for participating.\n\nAccording to Matanovic, investors are probably worried about the fork, while speculators, on the other hand, must be excited about it because if there is one thing which is certain for the next couple of months, it is the volatility.\n\nHence, Matanovic suggests that the best approach in the midst of such chaos is to “keep calm, keep bitcoins offline and not selling any of them.”"", ""After Greece and Cyprus, the Italian peninsula is sending alarming signals while new European banking rules are likely to constrain state action.\n\nOn 25 June, the Italian government formalized the rescue of two medium-sized mutual banks - Banco Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca - on the brink of bankruptcy, after finding no investor in the markets to help them.\n\nSuch situations are causing investors all over Europe to question the safety of the banking system. The particular attributes of the unprecedented bailout of Cyprus' banks\n\nin 2013 have led to a significant surge in Bitcoin price, as investors sought safe havens and access to liquidity. We have yet to see how future bank bailouts will impact the alternative financial systems proposed by cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe costly rescue of Venetian banks\n\nThe Italian state will put €4.785 bln on the table so that Intesa Sanpaolo, the country's first retail bank, takes over the two banks. Pier Carlo Padoan, Minister of Economy, said that the total cost of public guarantees in this transaction could amount up to €17 bln, to cover the deteriorated credits of the two banks.\n\nThe rescue of the two banks was carried out by the government, therefore with Italian public funds, and not by a European mechanism. This rescue could allow Italy to settle in its own way this crisis, the latest in an Italian banking sector bending under doubtful debts, which account for one-third of the total in the euro area.\n\nWhat must be noted from this rescue is that it was impossible to liquidate these two banks without calling on the taxpayer's money. This Italian case also shows the limits of the BRRD (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive), which is based on the principle that no more penny of public money should make it possible to bail out a poorly managed bank. It is not without regret in the camp of all those who wanted to break the ties between the States and the banks.\n\nAverted bankruptcy for Banco Popular\n\nSantander has bought Banco Popular Espanol SA after its collapse for a symbolic euro. The group guarantees the continuity of the business of Banco Popular without the depositors being affected. This is the first successful bankruptcy test for the European Banking Union.\n\nThe announcement ends weeks of suspense, during which the management of the troubled bank sought a solution to solve its liquidity problems. The situation had become unsustainable, while Banco Popular was caught in a stock market spiral that saw its capitalization on the Madrid stock exchange plunged from €2.7 bln to €1.4 bln in a single week.\n\nPopular thus becomes the first bank to be rescued by the new European mechanism aimed at preventing the bank crises contagion of States. While the operation imposes heavy losses on shareholders, it will guarantee the security of deposits and the continuity of commercial activity. “We welcome Banco Popular's customers,” announced Ana Botin, President of the Santander Group, on social media. “We will work to provide them with the best service during this transitional period and in the future.”\n\nOn the side of the government which had insisted in recent days on the stability of the Spanish financial sector, the Minister of Economy Luis de Guindos emphasizes that the operation has nothing to do with the rescue of Bankia. In 2012, de Guindos involved the mobilization of €22.4 bln of public funds, causing markets doubts about the solvency of the country.\n\nThis time, the minister notes, “the operation takes place without public funds and without any contagion between sovereign and banking risk. The current situation is very different from that of 2012, due to the good health of the entire financial sector and the Spanish economy in general.”\n\nBank bailouts are back\n\nDespite all of the money spent to improve the situation of troubled banks in the past, countries such as Portugal and Italy are still facing financial instability, as the local economy keeps struggling and further taxpayers injections are required.\n\nAnother public bailout is being prepared in Italy, that of Monte Paschi, the fourth Italian bank. The bailout plans to inject €6.6 bln in state aid, which will be officially announced by European Commission shortly."", 'Bitcoin has left stocks, bonds, and gold in the dust in the first half of 2017.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares have soared 220.59%, while the S&P 500 and SPDR Gold shares rose in upper single digits; and all three investments outperformed the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond, which gained a modest 6.13 percent.\n\nStocks, Bonds, And Bitcoin In The First Half Of 2017\n\nFund YTD Performance SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) +7.68% Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares (GBTC) +220.59 SPDR S&P500 (SPY) +8.17 iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT) +6.13\n\nSource: Finance.yahoo.com 6/30/2017\n\nStocks, Bonds, And Bitcoin In 2016\n\nFund YTD Performance SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) 8.53% Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares (GBTC) +153.09 SPDR S&P500 (SPY) +9.77 iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT) -1.48\n\nSource: Finance.yahoo.com 12/29/2016\n\nA growing divide among investors regarding the state and the outlook of the US economy and the Federal Reserve’s unconventional monetary policies is a major factor behind the Bitcoin rally.\n\nThen, there’s the return of the old fiscal easing and huge budget deficits that feed into inflation, which undermines faith in national currencies.\n\nAnd the shaking up of the public’s confidence are attempts by certain national governments have been trying to manipulate their own currencies, particularly India and Venezuela.', 'Prior to the major clearance of the bitcoin mempool, the holding area for unconfirmed transactions waiting to be picked up by miners, a large number of bitcoin transactions were left unconfirmed for days despite the attachment of high fees.\n\nSuch occurrences emerged due to the variation in the size of bitcoin transactions. Unlike the Ethereum network or other specific blockchain networks, transactions on the bitcoin network have different sizes depending on the number of inputs and outputs. Currently, the median size of bitcoin transaction is 226 bytes but the size of bitcoin transactions can greatly vary at times.\n\nThus, users of wallet platforms that had fixed transaction fee recommendations which failed to take the variation in bitcoin transaction size into consideration struggled with significant delays with their transactions. Instead of calculating the size of the transaction and recommending fees based on the transaction size, the vast majority of wallet platforms simply offered two options: low or high fees that ranged from $0.5 to $2.5.\n\nIn certain cases, users discovered that $2.5 fee was not sufficient for transactions that have many inputs and outputs. 21 Inc’s Bitcoin Fees, an open source bitcoin fee estimator, clearly recommends a fee based on the median transaction size but does not take the variation into consideration.\n\nAfter careful consideration of user feedback, Blockchain, the world’s largest bitcoin wallet platform that oversees nearly 15 million wallets, deployed a new fee estimation program that allowed users to attach fees on a satoshis per byte basis.\n\nOn June 22, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith revealed in an interview with CNBC that the bitcoin wallet startup raised $40 million in funding from Google’s investment arm Lakestar and billionaire investor Richard Branson.\n\nSmith emphasized that with the new funding round and newly acquired capital, the company will focus on addressing scalability of their product and global expansion to meet the increasing demand towards bitcoin from its international user base.\n\n“We are really focused on scaling to meet the record demand we are getting in the market. We started raising this round before the run up in the cryptomarket. It was good timing in the end because while we were closing the round, we were massively up on every level. Our traffic has been growing 15 percent week over week in last two weeks,” said Smith in an interview.\n\nThe implementation of the new Satoshis per byte fee estimator program is a part of the Blockchain development team’s scalability roadmap in that it allows users to adapt to the increasing fee market efficiently without the necessity of manually calculating transaction size and fees.\n\nOther wallet platforms such as Samourai Wallet are also looking into the commercialization of Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd’s Replace-by-Fee method that allows users to attach a new fee in order to process stuck transactions due to low fees.\n\nAs bitcoin approaches scaling, startups including Blockchain are successfully providing its users with more efficient and practical applications to ease the settlement of payments and transactions. With such applications and programs in place, the activation of a viable scaling solution such as the Bitcoin Core development team’s Segregated Witness (Segwit) is expected to further enhance scalability.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple are down by more than one to eight percent today:\n\n// -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace\n\nI want to let you know what I think of the cryptocurrency market we are facing, as I’ve experienced what is happening previously (2014-2015).\n\n// -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD and get access to our secret group on Workplace.

The prices tend to drive sharply upwards until deposits are matched by withdrawals and “take profits”. I believe bitcoin hit that crucial target at $3000 per bitcoin, and I hate to say it, but if history will repeat itself, the bitcoin price, including other cryptocurrencies, might fall by 70 to 80 percent in the coming years (2017 and 2018).

I’m excited.\n\nHave a good weekend all.', 'A Connecticut man pleaded guilty last week to stealing Bitcoin from users of Dark Web marketplaces, said the Department of Justice on Tuesday.\n\nThe FBI arrested the man — Michael Richo, 35, of Wallingford, Connecticut — on November 6, 2014, but only arraigned him in court last year in October.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by Bleeping Computer, Richo had used his technical skills to set up phishing sites for popular Dark Web markets. The documents did not mention the names of these portals.\n\nRicho stole Bitcoin worth over $365,000\n\nOnce he gained access to a user\'s credentials, he used the logins to access the user\'s profile and steal Bitcoin from the wallet associated with the Dark Web marketplace.\n\nThis week, in court, Richo admitted to stealing Bitcoin worth of $365,000. The FBI found over 10,000 stolen credentials on equipment seized from his house following a search warrant.\n\nCourt documents reveal Richo used two techniques to carry out his phishing scheme.\n\nHe would post fake links on forums to these markets which would direct users to a fake login page hosted on a laptop at his house. The login page would look exactly like the real login pages for the various market sites. When users would attempt to log in, he would steal their usemames and passwords.\n\nThe other technique RICHO used to steal login credentials involved posting fake links on forums that when clicked would ""port forward"" the users through RICHO\'s computer server to the actual marketplace site where users would log in. RICHO would keylog all of the user\'s traffic including their login information.\n\nUsing stolen credentials, Richo accessed accounts on these Dark Web marketplaces and transferred funds to his Bitcoin wallet on the Local Bitcoins service.\n\nInvestigators say that when Richo needed money, he would convert the stolen Bitcoin into dollars and deposit the stolen funds into his Bank of America account or Green Dot prepaid debit cards. Additionally, he would also withdraw money via Western Union or MoneyGram transfers.\n\nRicho bragged in online chats\n\nInvestigators also found text chats on his computer where Richo bragged about his phishing scheme.\n\n""I make my own phishing sites for darknet .onion drug sites. I make $1000 a day,"" wrote Richo in a chat, using the username fatfreak82828.\n\nIn another message, he also bragged about having experience with ""exploits, scanning, etc, rooting boxes, backdoors"" and about building a botnet of Windows computers.\n\nAuthorities released Richo on bond with computer monitoring conditions last year. The man faces up to 10 years in prison for one count of access device fraud, and 20 years in prison for one count of money laundering. His sentencing is scheduled on September 28, 2017.']"

Jeff Garzik, Bloq co-founder and SegWit2x lead developer, said in an email that the new code is set to release on June 30, 2017.\n\nDevelopers first introduced the SegWit2x in 2015, which has been one of the most controversial scaling proposals. Many Bitcoin network\'s enterprises and miners commended the proposal, seeing it as a pragmatic solution to the network\'s issues in transaction capacity. Of course, there are still those who derided it as a deal that misunderstands the nature of the cryptocurrency development and its intended design.\n\nDespite some opposition, the Bitcoin scaling proposal emerged as unique, bringing together some of the largest contingent companies and mining pools supporting it.\n\nExpectations on the new version\n\nAfter two weeks of Alpha release testing, Garzik has confirmed the release of SegWit2x new code. This new version is expected to address issues and comments on the previous one and to mark a new phase for the said proposal.\n\nGiven that the proposal is supported by a large number of miners, the code could quickly acquire the necessary backing from the network to activate the upgrade.\n\nLater on, if the project furthers as planned, the Bitcoin\'s long-awaited scaling optimization availability before August is possible. For now, this improvement or change in the network remains a matter of controversy and critique as enterprises and Bitcoin miners wait for it.\n\nAlpha testing\n\nThe developers are not generous to the public when it comes to updating them about the testing process. According to some people who are involved in the project, they spent two weeks for testing, using a new testnet (""testnet5"") and a faucet that spits out fake coins to test the system.\n\nMeanwhile, SegWit2x GitHub site showed that the developers are indeed testing the code. Purse CTO Christopher Jeffrey even identified and fixed bugs during the alpha testing change while others shared inputs and ideas.\n\nLarge companies currently supporting SegWit2 include Abra, Bitfury, Blockchain, BTCC, OpenBazaar, Purse and Xapo have been publicly supporting the development and testing. However, it is still unknown to the public who\'s working on what.', 'Fidelity Charitable 2017, a $16-bln-donor-advised philanthropic fund, has recently announced that their Bitcoin donations are soaring high.

Bitcoin continues to be popular among most people and even among those who are charitable.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of Bitcoin donations is Fidelity Charitable. A media representative at Fidelity Charitable said at the joint collaborations between Fidelity Charitable and Fidelity Labs that their donors to have been able to give Bitcoin donations since 2015.\n\nIn 2017, reports stated that their funds are on the rise, receiving $2 mln more than what Bitcoin donors gave in the whole 2016.\n\nIncrease in charitable trends\n\nAccording to the organization, the report is a ""snapshot of their nearly 150,000 donors and how they give."" They have seen many donors increasingly fund their giving in a variety of ways, including non-publicly traded assets.\n\nWhat was once an untapped source of philanthropic giving is now one of the charitable trends. This is because non-publicly traded assets are a significant portion of wealth the US.\n\nFidelity Charitable has handled this kind of donations, witnessing its notable growth of these methods of charitable giving for the past years.\n\nFrom $391 mln of non-publicly traded assets in 2012, the donations rose up to $796 mln as per their record last year. $125 mln of it is in restricted stock and $7 mln of it in Bitcoin.', 'Tech billionaire Mark Cuban, a self-confessed Bitcoin skeptic, is planning to invest in another digital currency.\n\nCNBC reports that Cuban is planning to participate in one of the hottest trends in the cryptocurrency world today: the ICO or initial coin offering.\n\nMark Cuban says:\n\n""I want to learn more about them. I haven\'t signed the paperwork yet. But it\'s likely it will happen.""\n\nMark Cuban to participate in ICO\n\nAccording to the report, Mark Cuban is eyeing to take part in the initial coin offering of the company he already invested in, the eSports gambling startup UniKrn. Unikrn is an eSports online betting site that uses a virtual currency and is scheduled to launch in September 2017 for the sale of tokens based on Ethereum, the rival of Bitcoin.\n\nAn initial coin offering is a fundraising process for a Blockchain-based project that allows investors to own part of a project via a digital network token. Start-ups in the Blockchain community often find this method of fundraising more attractive than the venture capitalist funding because of the speed and amount they can raise.\n\nCuban calls Bitcoin a bubble\n\nBefore this latest pronouncement from Mark Cuban, he initially called Bitcoin a bubble.\n\nIn a series of tweets last June 6, 2017, Cuban said he thinks Bitcoin is in a bubble and that he doesn’t know when or how much it corrects:\n\n“I think it’s in a bubble. I just don’t know when or how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $=bubble.”\n\nThat tweet from Cuban was in response to Demetrick Ferguson’s tweet asking him if he would be willing to spare 15 minutes of his time to come to The BTC Podcast and discuss a little bit about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\nBut even though Cuban said Bitcoin is in a bubble he too acknowledged its value in succeeding tweets last June 7, 2017. He thinks the Blockchain is very valuable and will be at the core of most transactions in the future - healthcare, finance, etc. - all will use it.\n\nCuban also adds:', 'Bitcoin was designed to be cheap, reliable and fast.

Read more...\n\nAn English businessman, Renwick Haddow has been charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for securities fraud. According to reports, Haddow was promoting a fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platform, causing losses to unsuspecting investors.\n\nHaddow, who has been living in the New York is said to have been running two businesses, Bitcoin Store — a cryptocurrency investment platform and a flexible workspace firm called Bar Works. During the course of their operations, he diverted the investments received by these businesses into overseas accounts created in Mauritius and Morocco.\n\nA leading English daily quoted the director of the SEC’s New York Office, Andrew Calamari saying,\n\n“Haddow created two trendy companies and misled investors into believing that highly qualified executives were leading them to profitability… In reality, Haddow controlled the companies from behind the scenes, and they were far from profitable.”\n\nHaddow, for a while successfully managed to cheat people of as much as $5 million. He came under the scanner after about 27 Chinese investors filed a complaint after they failed to get back their $3 million investment in Bar Works. They suspected Haddow of running a Ponzi scheme.\n\nDuring the course of an investigation, the SEC found discrepancies in the accounts, where the inflow of funds into Bitcoin Store’s account was only $250,000 in 2015, which was way less that what investors had put in. More complaints followed the initial complaint, and eventually, it was discovered the company was selling leases and subleases functioning as investment notes instead of providing workspaces in old bars and restaurants as advertised.\n\nThe SEC claims that it has been unable to find records of any operations ever conducted by the Bitcoin Store, even though there have been millions in gross sales until now. While the SEC put an end to the Bitcoin Store’s operations, there are many similar fraudulent schemes out there that keep popping up. It is advisable for investors to conduct sufficient due diligence before making any significant investment.\n\nRef: The Guardian | Image: NewsBTC', 'Most Bitcoin users know all too well who Craig Wright is. He still claims to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto, which is still untrue at this point. A company which used Wright’s research is now sold to a private equity firm. That is rather intriguing, although it is evident this company continues to ride Bitcoin’s coattails. Craig Wright is trying to get his share of the spotlight once again.\n\nThis particular business deal puts an interesting light on Craig Wright. Although he firmly believes he created Bitcoin, the rest of the world is not impressed by his evidence so far. It is evident Wright wants to remain a key part of Bitcoin moving forward. Whether or not he will succeed in that mission, remains to be seen. According to Wright, Bitcoin needs to be built into a global system with no king. Not the most shocking statement by any means.\n\nCraig Wright Remains Persona Non-Grata\n\nCraig Wright feels he can make Bitcoin scale to what it is supposed to be. That statement is rather significant, considering scaling has been a lingering issue for some time now. Now that nChain Holdings has been sold to a private equity firm, it is possible Wright may focus more on Bitcoin again. Interestingly enough, nChain Holdings is Wright’s company used to file hundreds of Bitcoin patents. Selling that off to a private equity firm seems a very dubious decision, to say the least.\n\nThis new business deal won’t do the reputation of Craig Wright any favors, though. Filing Bitcoin patents has made him a somewhat despised figure in the community. Additionally, failing to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto tarnished his credibility. It is evident he has some good intentions regarding Bitcoin, but he struggles to make a mark. If he was the real Satoshi, he could easily use that name to address these issues. However, he wants to do so under his actual name. Something isn’t adding up in this regard, that much is evident.\n\nThe Bitcoin community is not too pleased with Craig Wright, for obvious reasons. Now that he tries to get the spotlight again, that situation won’t change anytime soon. For the time being, Craig Wright is still not Satoshi Nakamoto. It is highly doubtful he can ever prove otherwise. Even if he did, it won’t matter all that much to the overall Bitcoin community, though. The development of Bitcoin has been “outsourced” many years ago. If Wright wants to make a comeback, he should do so under Satoshi’s name. However, it is doubtful he can, since they are not the same person.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'As the founder and chief executive of OneGram – the Dubai-based technology company behind the first digital currency completely backed by gold - Ibrahim Mohammed is confident his cryptocurrency will be a success , even as competition in the digital currency sphere hots up.\n\nHe says with “100s of new coins releasing every day”, it is OneGram’s unique selling point - the fact that the currency is fully Sharia-compliant - that will set it apart.\n\nThe company has already launched an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) offering, which aims to raise more than US$500 million in capital; the tokens were launched on May 21 and will be available to buy until September 22.\n\nOneGram has partnered with GoldGuard, a Dubai-based online gold trading platform, for the offering, with each token backed by one gram of gold, held in a vault at Dubai Airport Free Zone. Only 12.5 million tokens are available to buy in total.\n\nThe OneGram currency was created using blockchain technology, a digital method of recording data that underpins the digital currency bitcoin.\n\nWhile one bitcoin today is currently worth about US$2,500 (or $2,438 at the time of writing), to buy a OneGramCoin would set you back $45 at current market prices.\n\nAlmost six weeks after the OneGram coin first went on sale, Mr Mohammed, a British Dubai resident with 10 years of experience running companies whose specialisms have included debt collection and business formation, explains how the new digital currency works and how investors can get on board:\n\nWhy did you set up OneGram?\n\nBecause of the ruling that happened in November 2016 from the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) with regards to the gold standard. It was the first time gold was deemed to be a sharia-compliant product and it got us thinking. It evolved into digitisation of gold but then having bigger returns rather than just waiting for the market to go up - so we combined it with a digital currency.\n\nHow does OneGram work?\n\nIt’s like bitcoin; it’s a digital currency but the major difference to any other crypto is that it’s backed with physical gold. Putting it very simply, if you have one bitcoin today that’s worth about US$2,500 and if it crashes and went to zero you’d lose all your money. With OneGram, if you buy today you pay about $45; $41 of that is in physical gold but $4 is in the coin, so if OneGram crashed you would potentially lose $4 and still have $41. Essentially it’s a digital token - a digital form of payment.\n\nSo how can you use this form of payment?\n\nGlobally, these kinds of tokens are mainly used in the crypto community by people that believe in [the concept] and are willing to hold it. What we are trying to develop over the next 12 months or so is a payment solution that retailers can adopt to accept payment. At this stage (until the OneGram coin is listed in September), it’s like holding stocks or shares. The demand is there and the prices are increasing; if you follow the crypto market at all it was worth $20 billion in 2016 and this year it’s worth $100bn as we speak. Most of that jump has happened in the last five months.\n\nWhat is driving that?\n\nPeople see the potential in it. Most governments now are talking about how to regulate the market and control it and bring it into mainstream. The growth is phenomenal. I don’t think investors are risk takers because the model of crypto currencies has been proven. Japan has legalised bitcoin; it’s inevitable that others will follow suit.\n\nHow does OneGram work?\n\nRegister at GoldGuard.com and where you go to buy you will see the live spot price of gold and it will be a live spot buy. Underneath it you will see the coin value of $4 - that’s 10 per cent of the actual transaction and that’s the coin fee. You will see a total price of $45; it’s approximate on the site as it’s linked to the Allocated Bullion Exchange\'s live gold fee. You can transfer funds or buy through bitcoin but we won’t accept bitcoin directly as we don’t know the source of funds, so we use a company called BitPay in the United States. They do all the verifications, as they are regulated by the US government and they will accept the bitcoin and wire us US dollars.\n\nIs the $4 a fee then?\n\nIt’s a kind of administration fee because typically in crypto currencies you are paying the whole amount - so if we didn’t have gold you’d be paying $45 and we’d have all money. But we only take 10 per cent which covers operations, staffing, support, marketing, development, blockchain etc. With typical cryptos, if they are selling at $45 they may pay 30 to 40 per cent commission on transactions and they’ll sell out in a day or two. We’ve adopted a real business model as opposed to a ""let’s loot type of crypto."" So there is a 10 per cent mark up on the price to give our investors the best possible chance of higher returns and that 10 per cent will cover our costs to operate.\n\nWhat happens when you list?\n\nThen you will have your own wallet and you will hold it on your own iPad, phone or desktop. The coin will be listed on a few digital currency platforms, so any buying or selling happens through those platforms and it goes into the secondary market. In terms of where the price can be at launch and where it can be in 24 months is completely beyond our control. Some analysts have said OneGram is the closest coin that has ever come to knocking bitcoin off its pedestal.\n\nWho are your investors?\n\nAs well as crypto tech investors, we’re getting people that have never invested in crypto or digital currencies before but because of the gold aspect and the sharia regulatory aspect they are very comfortable. We get customers buying for $100 and in the same day someone will buy $200,000. There is massive interest from Africa and Pakistan, countries we never expected. We now have 4,000 to 5,000 registered users and the majority are non-Muslims; another surprise.\n\nWhat happens if you don’t sell all the 12.5 million coins?\n\nAnything that is left will be burnt – wiped away. If we don’t sell all of them then it\'s likely the price will go up as there will be less in circulation. We left the first month open for anyone to buy. Now we have our affiliates, partners that will also sell the coin. The first affiliate is $100m, there are a couple more after that. We are not in any doubt that the coin will sell out.\n\nHow many have you sold so far?\n\nTwenty-two per cent of the ICO has already been assigned – that’s about 2 million coins.\n\nOnce the coin is listed what happens to OneGram?\n\nOur ongoing role is to maintain the blockchain and security of it so that the coins can trade. And we make 1 per cent of every trade, the typical fee within blockchain.\n\nWho are you licensed by?\n\nCyptos are not licensed – but the part that needs licensing is GoldGuard, which is a gold trading platform. That is licensed by Dubai Airport Free Zone so we are licensed to trade gold.\n\nCan investors see the gold?\n\nOur vaulting partner may have security issues with that but once we have our own vaulting systems we will be open to anyone that wants to inspect. For verification that the gold exists, our auditors PwC have to physically go and count the gold along with our sharia advisers so I think the investors can rest assured that the gold exists. We buy through ABX and within three days they physically store it for us.\n\nHow could it all go wrong?\n\nIt’s very difficult to go wrong because the exposure is very limited – it’s 90 per cent in gold, 10 per cent in the coin. The demand is there and the market is there so unless someone turns the internet off …\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe’re in discussions about ATM machines. You could have an ATM machine in Dubai, Hong Kong or London where OneGram can be bought and sold across the globe.\n\nahaine@thenational.ae', '""Combined with emerging information markets, cryptoanarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures."" — Timothy C. May, ""The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto""\n\n***\n\nBitcoin developer Eric Martindale has departed what might might be considered one of the sweetest gigs in the industry to follow his dream of building a decentralized information market where any data can be traded without restriction.\n\nHaving left the heavily funded magnet for bitcoin developer talent, Blockstream, earlier this year, the self-identified ""cypherpunk"" last week kicked off a roadshow to tour his idea for a new way to build applications directly on the bitcoin blockchain, and to raise funds from investors.\n\nIn one sense, Martindale’s project, called Fabric, is a decentralized, trustless exchange similar to an increasing number of marketplaces already in the works. What distinguishes the effort, though, is smart contract functionality he believes is superior to ethereum.\n\nMartindale told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'re replacing the World Wide Web with a new type of information exchange. One that is provable, that is guaranteed, and you can verify it. We\'re creating a provable version of the World Wide Web and all of the services that exist on top of it.""\n\nLong time coming\n\nPerhaps best known for his work helping build BitPay\'s open-source developer kit, Bitcore, Martindale was hired with much fanfare a year ago to serve as Blockstream\'s ""technology evangelist"" helping build out the firm\'s open-source strategy.\n\nBut as revealed to CoinDesk, Martindale had already been hard at work on Fabric at the time of his hire, going so far as to sign an early version of the white paper into the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn addition to being a distributed marketplace for information, Martindale described Fabric as the building blocks for a ""much larger system of things and how they interact with each other in the real world.""\n\nThe Internet of Things-ready platform powered by the bitcoin blockchain is being built with what Martindale describes as an ""offline first"" philosophy. He says that applications built on a decentralized version of the internet should be able to fully function without an internet connection, then automatically sync up with the blockchain only when desired.\n\nTo enable the system of smart contract-powered applications, Martindale said Fabric reduces developer behavior to ""verifiable"" actions that can then be coded into a smart contract.\n\n""Fabric is an app layer for bitcoin. And it is a protocol for those apps to interact with each other without having to trust each other,"" said Martindale. ""It’s a protocol for the exchange and manipulation of agreements and contracts and the exchange of data within those contracts.""\n\nThe breakthrough\n\nWhen Martindale left BitPay last year, he said he had already been working on Fabric for about three years, and had been considering giving the idea ""a serious go"" back then, before concluding the technology wasn’t yet ready.\n\nSo far, the bootstrapped project has been largely a solo effort, though he says he ""bounced ideas off"" Blockstream\'s co-founder, Peter Wiulle, and its CTO, Greg Maxwell. A representative of Blockstream has confirmed that the company encourages its employees to work on open-source projects and wished Martindale ""all the best.""\n\nSince initially starting work on Fabric, Martindale said he’s been keeping the work ""close to his chest"" and focusing on what he believes are key improvements to the proof-of-work algorithm. Then, three months ago, he had what he called a ""breakthrough"" in the work.\n\nThough he declined to go into much detail about its nature, he compared his idea to MIT’s Enigma project for off-chain transactions with additional features designed to allow for an infinite series of sidechains. Martindale called this technology ""state bubbles"", explaining that they will simplify the enforcement of complicated agreements.\n\n""We\'re using proof-of-work to perform valuable calculations in a cryptographically secure way by distributing across the network,"" he said.\n\nThe cypherpunk dream\n\nMartindale’s vision for a decentralized marketplace for information is not new. The idea lies at the core of the cyberpunk movement as explained in Timothy C Mays\' 1988 ""Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"".\n\nThe idea of an information exchange was then popularized in the 1980s by economist Phil Salin, who founded the American Information Exchange, later acquired by Autodesk. Since the advent of blockchain technology, the best known information exchange is the Silk Road, which, before it was shuttered by the FBI in 2014, offered for sale banned books and illicit or illegal services in addition to drugs.\n\nMost recently, the idea has taken form in the likes of OpenBazaar (developed by OB1), a decentralized market place. Bitcoin marketplace Purse.io even went so far as to offer its own full node bitcoin implementation, bcoin, to enable the creation of a wide variety of applications.\n\nBut fully functioning stacks for a decentralized internet are still in the earliest stages of development, with venture-backed RSK and Blockstack having just recently released versions of their own attempts to push the technology forward.\n\nTo help bridge the gap between Fabric and the creation of fully functioning, smart-contract enabled applications built on the bitcoin blockchain, Martindale also revealed details about Maki: a compiler for Fabric that is already being tested by early adopters working to build websites and mobile applications using the technology.\n\nNow that Martindale has completed the first leg of an international road trip in search of investors and members of what he hopes will be his founding team, he is preparing to publish an updated version of the white paper he signed to the bitcoin blockchain two years ago, including details of what he believes are improvements to proof-of-work.\n\n""Fundamentally, it is an information market in the truest cypherpunk sense,"" said Martindale:\n\n""I have some pieces of information I would like to trade for something else.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstack, Blockstream, OB1, Purse and RSK.\n\nComplex machine image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Two of the most popular scaling proposals available today — BIP148 and SegWit2x — both intend to trigger Segregated Witness (“SegWit”) activation within a month, which means that the protocol upgrade could be live within two.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, there is a very real risk that Bitcoin “splits.” Both BIP148 and SegWit2x could diverge from the current Bitcoin protocol, which could in turn lead to even more splits.\n\nHere is a list of dates for July, August and beyond to keep an eye on.\n\nThis article was last updated on August 8th.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap: Segregated Witness Activation\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 2nd update: Most of the information in this section is still accurate, but some of it is a bit outdated now. Keep in mind it was written about a month ago, before many of the recent developments occurred.\n\nFirst, a brief recap on Segregated Witness and its potential activation methods.\n\nSegWit is a backwards compatible protocol upgrade originally proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. It has been a centrepiece of the scaling roadmap supported by Bitcoin Core since the protocol upgrade was first proposed in December 2015, and it is implemented on many active Bitcoin nodes on the network today. SegWit is now also part of the “New York Agreement”: an alternative scaling roadmap forged between a significant number of Bitcoin companies, including many miners. And Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148, or BIP148, is a user activated soft fork (UASF) scheduled for August 1st that also intends to activate SegWit.\n\nThe difference lies in how the activation should happen.\n\nThe first and original option was proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. Their SegWit code, defined by BIP141, activates if 95 percent of hash power within a single difficulty period of about two weeks signals readiness before November 15th. Assuming that the miners who signal readiness are actually ready to support the upgrade, risks of a split in Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency are minimal.\n\nHowever, currently only some 40 to 45 percent of hash power is signaling readiness for BIP141. This is why a segment of Bitcoin users plans to activate SegWit with the BIP148 UASF. Starting on August 1st, their nodes will reject all blocks that do not signal readiness for BIP141. If this proposal is supported by any majority of miners (by hash power), these miners should always claim the longest valid chain, which should activate SegWit on all SegWit-ready Bitcoin clients and avoid a split. But if this proposal is supported by a minority of miners, a “BIP148 chain” would split off from the current protocol.\n\nThe New York Agreement, also referred to as the “Silbert Accord” or “SegWit2x,” plans to activate SegWit through BIP91. Like BIP148, all BIP91 nodes would reject any blocks that do not signal readiness for BIP141. But unlike BIP148, BIP91 nodes would only do this once 80 percent of hash power signals that they support BIP91, within a period about two days. This should also minimize the chance of a split.\n\nHowever, the second step of the New York Agreement is a hard fork to double Bitcoin’s “base block size.” This change, as opposed to Segregated Witness itself, is not backwards compatible, and could therefore lead to a “split” as well.\n\nThere is also such a thing as miners signaling intent to support the New York Agreement, but this is effectively meaningless and will be ignored for the purpose of this article.\n\nNow for the dates…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 14: BTC1 Deployment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe software client that resulted from the New York Agreement is a fork of the Bitcoin Core codebase, called “BTC1.” BTC1’s beta software was released on June 30th. But according to the SegWit2x roadmap, July 14th is the day that signatories to the New York Agreement should actually install the BTC1 beta software and test it for themselves.\n\nThis shouldn’t affect regular users or miners much, however.\n\nJuly 17th update: Deployment of BTC1 is delayed by a couple of days, but not in such a way as to distort the remainder of the timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 21: BIP91 Signaling to Start\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SegWit2x development team aims for July 21st to be the day that BTC1 nodes are actually up and running, and, importantly, the day that miner signaling should commence.\n\nThis shouldn’t really affect regular users either.\n\nBut if you are a miner, you may want to help activate SegWit by signaling readiness for BIP91. (This is done by mining “bit 4” blocks; for example, by mining with BTC1 or with Bitcoin software that includes a BIP91 patch.)\n\nJuly 17th update: Several mining pools have already started signaling support for BIP91, even before the announced signaling date. At the time of publication of this update, the hash power threshold has not yet been met, however.\n\n\n\nJuly 21st update: BIP91 is now locked in. See below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 23 (at the earliest): BIP91 Lock In\n\n\n\n\n\nThe precise threshold for BIP91 activation requires that within a pre-defined series of 336 blocks, 269 blocks must signal readiness. That’s some 80 percent of hash power, over about 2 1/3 days. So assuming the SegWit2x roadmap is followed, BIP91 could, at the very soonest, lock in on July 23rd.\n\nAgain, this shouldn’t really affect regular users.\n\nBut if you are a miner and BIP91 does activate, you now have another day or two to comply with the BIP91 soft fork. If you don’t, you risk mining invalid blocks.\n\nJuly 17th update: Since a number of mining pools have started to signal support for BIP91 early, the earliest BIP91 lock-in date has moved forward, too.\n\n\n\nJuly 21st update: BIP91 is now locked in. See below.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 25 (at the earliest): BIP91 Activation\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 25th, another 336 blocks after BIP91 “lock in”, BIP91 could actually go into effect, at the soonest. Any blocks that do not signal readiness for Segregated Witness (per BIP141) should now be rejected by a majority of miners (by hash power).\n\nThis still shouldn’t really affect regular users.\n\nBut if you are miner, you should now only mine blocks, and only mine on top of blocks, that signal readiness for SegWit (BIP141). Else you risk having your blocks rejected by a hash power majority.\n\nJuly 17th update: Since several mining pools have started to signal support for BIP91 early, the earliest BIP91 activation date has moved forward too.\n\n\n\nJuly 21st update: The 80 percent hash power lock-in threshold for BIP91 was reached today (UTC). This means that BIP91 should activate on July 23rd. If at least a majority of miners (by hash power) actually does enforce BIP91 for the next couple of weeks, this should make BIP148 obsolete. For more information, see this article.\n\n\n\nAugust 8th update: BIP91 and/or BIP148 have done its job: Segregated Witness (BIP141) is no past the point of return for lock-in. See below.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 29: BIP91 ""Deadline""\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Bitcoin miners want to be sure to avoid a “split” in Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency as a result of BIP148 activation, July 29th is a first deadline day for them.\n\nJuly 17th update: Since the next deadline is already missed (see below), July 29th is now the second deadline day for miners, not the first.\n\nTo ensure that BTC1’s BIP91 is activated in time to be compatible with BIP148, it should be locked in on this day at the very latest, say, before 08:00 UTC. (That’s 4 am on the U.S. east coast.) But sooner is better: The closer to the deadline BIP91 locks in, the bigger the risk it doesn’t activate in time.\n\nIf BIP91 has not activated by this deadline, Bitcoin may well be heading for a chain-split.\n\nIf this happens, and if you are a regular user, and you haven’t prepared for a potential BIP148 UASF chain-split yet, you now have two days left to do so. And you really should. This article explains how.\n\nIf BIP91 has not activated by July 29th and you are a miner, you now have two days to decide on which chain you will mine on August 1st: on the BIP148 chain, or on the original (“Legacy”) chain. July 17th update: Or perhaps on the Bitcoin ABC chain; see below.\n\nJuly 21st update: BIP91 is now locked in. See above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 31: BIP141 ""Deadline""\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Bitcoin miners want to be sure to avoid a “split” in Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency as a result of BIP148 activation, July 31st is technically the miners’ second deadline day to avoid a split.\n\nOn this day (UTC), at the very latest, either BIP91 must activate, or BIP141 must lock in. In other words, if BIP91 did not lock in in time, there must now have been a two-week difficulty period in which 95 percent of hash power signals support for SegWit.\n\nIn reality, the chance is small that July 31st actually coincides with the closing day for a difficulty period. And even if it does, it’s unlikely that it will take until this day before it’s clear whether the 95 percent threshold will be met.\n\nAs such, both users and miners should have probably already prepared for a potential split, as explained for July 29th. But July 31st really is your last chance to get ready.\n\nJuly 17th update: As of July 15th, this deadline can no longer be met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1: BIP148 Activation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the day BIP148 activates, which makes it the third and final deadline day for miners to avoid a split.\n\nOn August 1st, at 00:00 UTC (note that this is still July 31st in the U.S.), all BIP148 nodes will start rejecting any blocks that do not signal readiness for Segregated Witness (per BIP141). If Bitcoin Core’s BIP141 or BTC1’s BIP91 have locked in and/or activated in time, there should be no chain-split.\n\nIf neither has happened, a majority of miners (by hash power) now have one last chance to avoid a chain-split: by supporting BIP148 themselves. This would ensure they always (re-)claim the longest valid chain according to all current Bitcoin nodes, and will activate SegWit through BIP141.\n\nIf BIP141, BIP91 nor BIP148 have attracted sufficient hash power by August 1st, but BIP148 does gain some traction, the chain could split on this day. If that happens, there will be two types of “Bitcoin,” which we’ll refer to as “148 Bitcoin” or “148BTC” for the BIP148 side of the split, and “Legacy Bitcoin” or “LegacyBTC” for the other side. (This split could resolve over time if 148 Bitcoin ever reclaims the longest chain, or if 148 Bitcoin is abandoned by all miners and users for good, but this is not the focus of this article.)\n\nIf you own bitcoin (that is: private keys) at the time of split you should automatically own both 148BTC and LegacyBTC. Though, to access both types, you probably need to download new software. That said, if you are a regular user, it is probably best to initially halt any and all transactions, at least until the situation is more clear. Failing to do so may cost you money! For more information, see this article.\n\nIf a split happens and you are a miner, you should have by now decided on which chain you’ll mine, and mine on that chain. (Of course, you can still switch at any time. You may simply want to mine the most profitable chain, for example.)\n\nJuly 21st update: The 80 percent hash power activation threshold for BIP91 was reached today (UTC). This should make BIP148 obsolete. However, if a majority of hash power does not actually enforce BIP91 by August 1st, the scenario described here does still hold up. For more information, see this article.\n\nAugust 2nd update: BIP148 has now activated, and so far all is going well. Miners are mining SegWit-signaling blocks-only, which is compatible with both BIP91 and BIP148, which means that all Bitcoin nodes are united on one chain. Segregated Witness (BIP141) is currently scheduled to lock-in on August 8th.\n\nAugust 8th update: Segregated Witness (BIP141) is now past the point of no return for lock-in. All Bitcoin nodes are still united on one chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 4: Potential Bitcoin ABC Launch\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the exact date is not set in stone, August 4th may see the introduction of a new type of “Bitcoin”: Bitcoin ABC.\n\nMajor Bitcoin mining hardware producer Bitmain recently announced that if BIP91 does not activate before August 1st and BIP148 is showing signs of life after August 1st, it will launch a “contingency plan.” More recently, the implementation to embody this contingency plan — named “Bitcoin ABC” — was announced at the Future of Bitcoin conference.\n\nBitcoin ABC will share a common history with Bitcoin up until August 1st, but will, for the first couple of days after that, probably be privately mined by Bitmain. It will also include several new and incompatible protocol rules, perhaps most importantly an increased block size limit.\n\nIf you owned bitcoin at the time of split — August 1st, 00:00 UTC — you should automatically own “Bitcoin ABC” as well. But you may, in that case, need to download software to be able to send (and receive) the coins. More information will likely become available if this event occurs.\n\nIf you are a miner you should be able to mine Bitcoin ABC on August 4th. (And perhaps sooner.)\n\nJuly 17th update: It now seems a bit more likely that Bitcoin ABC will launch, regardless of BIP148. This launch is scheduled for August 1st, 12:20 (PM). It may still take a couple of days before Bitcoin ABC becomes widely accessible for miners and users. At least one mining pool and exchange, China-based ViaBTC, has announced support for the coin, which it will list as ""Bitcoin Cash"", with the ticker ""BCC"".\n\n\n\nJuly 21st update: Contraryto earlier reports, it appears that Bitcoin ABC will not include two-way replay protection. If you want to make sure you don\'t lose access to your Bitcoin ABC coins, you should not send any bitcoins (whether 148BTC or LegacyBTC) until you have ""separated"" your Bitcoin ABC coins. For more information, see this article. (Also note that Coinbase has explicitly stated that users will not have access to their Bitcoin ABC coins.)\n\n\n\nAugust 2nd update: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as the new cryptocurrency is now called, launched yesterday. While the project is off to a slow start when it comes to hash power and blocks, trading has opened, and it seems as if the coin could make it.\n\n\n\nAugust 8th update: Bitcoin Cash (Bcash; BCH) is alive and well as an alternative cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 15: Potential BIP148 Proof-of-Work Change\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this date is not set in stone either, August 15th could see the introduction of yet another type of “Bitcoin,” which we’ll refer to as “NewPoW Bitcoin” or “NewPoWBTC.”\n\nAs a UASF, August 1st’s BIP148 fork should initially be effectuated by users — not miners. Users would start to reject any blocks that do not signal readiness for Segregated Witness (per BIP141). This should incentivize miners to follow the BIP148 chain (ideally, at least for BIP148 users, to the point where it’s the only chain left). But whether this will actually happen remains to be seen. So far, few miners have publicly indicated they will support the UASF.\n\nIf miner support on 148 Bitcoin remains low, (some of) its users may opt to implement a hard fork to change the proof-of-work algorithm. This would “fire” the existing group of miners by making their specialized ASIC mining hardware obsolete on the BIP148 chain, and could open the door for new miners — possibly re-decentralising the mining ecosystem back to home users with CPUs or GPUs. (At least temporarily.)\n\nAn open BIP148 “working group” on a channel of the ""Bitcoin Core Community"" Slack is currently working out the details to be proposed. But it seems that if by August 15th less than 15 percent of total hash power mines on 148 Bitcoin, this hard fork will be deployed. This would make the split with “Legacy Bitcoin” definite. It could technically also lead to another split on the 148 Bitcoin side, if some of its users decline to join the hard fork that changes the proof-of-work algorithm.\n\nIf you are a regular user and owned bitcoin at the time of the August 1st split, and you didn’t spend any until August 15th, you should now also own NewPoWBTC. If you bought or earned 148BTC between August 1st and August 15th, you should now (also) own NewPoWBTC.\n\nBut if you did spend bitcoins on any side of the split, that’s not as certain. Again, if you want to be on the safe side, don’t transact at all until the situation becomes more clear. (For more information, see this article.)\n\nIf you are one of the few miners that was mining on 148 Bitcoin with ASIC hardware, you may now want to point your hardware elsewhere — or shut it down completely. (This depends, of course, on whether or not it’s still profitable to mine 148BTC or anything else.)\n\nAnd of course, anyone should by now be able to mine on NewPoWBTC without specialized ASIC hardware.\n\nAugust 2nd update: As BIP148 has locked in and Segregated Witness seems increasingly likely to activate smoothly, there will almost certainly not be any proof-of-work change any time soon.\n\n\n\nAugust 8th update: Segregated Witness (BIP141) is now past the point of return. BIP148 is virtually made obsolete, and a proof-of-work change will (almost certainly) not be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMid- to late- August: SegWit Lock In\n\n\n\n\n\nIf miners avoided a chain-split through BIP141, BIP91 or BIP148, Segregated Witness should at the latest lock in between mid-August or late August. This should be a bit a non-event if it happens through BIP91 or BIP148, as it would at this point be expected, and wouldn’t change much for anyone.\n\nBut what the lock-in means is that all SegWit-ready clients will start enforcing the new rules in the next difficulty period: after another two weeks. So if you are a regular user and would like to use the new features or want to maintain top-notch security, you now have two weeks to upgrade to software that enforces SegWit.\n\nIf a chain-split is not avoided, the situation could become far more complex. By mid-August, there could potentially be one, two, three or maybe even four “Bitcoins”: “148 Bitcoin”, “NewPoW Bitcoin”, “Bitcoin ABC,” as well as “Legacy Bitcoin”.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, it’s hard to say how best to deal with this situation. For a regular user, it’s always best to hold onto your private keys, and it’s probably best not to transact at all until the situation resolves in some way or another. (For more information, see this article.)\n\nFor a miner, it’s probably best to just mine the most profitable chain.\n\nAugust 2nd update: Segregated Witness lock-in is currently scheduled for August 8th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found.)\n\n\n\nAugust 8th update: Segregated Witness (BIP148) is now past the point of no return for lock-in. (Technically, it will lock-in tomorrow; this is now virtually guaranteed.)\n\n\n\n\n\nLate August to Mid-September: SegWit Activation\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a chain-split is avoided by miners, SegWit should activate around this time. If you’re running a compatible client by now, you can begin to enjoy the new features while maintaining top-notch security.\n\nIf a chain-split is not avoided, the situation is (still) too complex to predict.\n\nAugust 2nd update: Segregated Witness activation is currently scheduled for around August 23th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found.)\n\n\n\nAugust 8th update: Segregated Witness activation is still scheduled for around August 23th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate October to Mid-November: SegWit2x Hard Fork (see update)\n\n\n\n\n\nToward the end of this year (though potentially even up to early 2018), the hard fork part of SegWit2x should take place. To be exact, this hard fork activates on BTC1 clients three months after SegWit locks in. This activation means that a “base block” bigger than 1 megabyte should be mined, which makes BTC1 clients incompatible with all Bitcoin clients that do not have the hard fork code implemented.\n\nAt this point in time, it seems almost certain that not everyone will change their software to support this hard fork. Bitcoin’s development community in particular has almost unanumously rejected the proposal, while several companies have indicated their intentions not to support the change, and not all users seem on board either. As such, this could lead to another chain-split. (Theoretically, this could lead to the fifth “Bitcoin,” though it seems very unlikely there would still be four ""Bitcoins"" by then in the first place.)\n\nHow to deal with this situation as a regular users will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine closer to the actual date.\n\nIf you are a miner and you were only running the BTC1 client to help activate SegWit with no intention to support the hard fork, you should make sure to switch back to a non-BTC1 client before this hard fork takes place.\n\nJuly 17th update: As per the implementation of BTC1, this ""2x hard fork"" should actually activate three months after SegWit activation — not three months after (BIP91) lock in. This moves the hard fork date back by about a month, closer to late November or mid-December.\n\n\n\nAugust 2nd update: With Segregated Witness activation currently scheduled around August 23th, the ""2x hard fork"" should happen around November 23th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found. Over a timespan of several months, this could possibly deviate by more than a week from November 22nd.)\n\n\n\nAugust 8th update: With Segregated Witness past the point of no return for lock-in, the ""2x hard fork"" should happen around November 23th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found. Over a timespan of several months, this could possibly deviate by more than a week from November 22nd.) Apart from Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) the ""2x hard fork"" could lead to a third type of ""Bitcoin."" How likely this is to actually happen remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nBarring unexpected and unlikely events, this article will no longer be updated.\n\n\n\n', 'Japan’s tax reform bill which officially eliminated consumption tax on the sale of Bitcoin came into effect on July 1. Bitcoin trading activities are expected to rise in Japan following the activation of the bill.\n\nIn a report entitled “Japan: Inbound Tax Alert, 2017 Tax Reform Proposals,” Deloitte previously revealed that virtual currencies including Bitcoin were set to be exempt from the eight percent consumption tax in Japan.\n\nDeloitte’s report read:\n\n“The supply of virtual currency will be exempt from Japanese Consumption Tax (“JCT”). Currently, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin do not fall under the category of exempt sales, and as a result, the sale of virtual currencies in Japan have been treated as taxable for JCT purposes. Following the enactment of the amended Fund Settlement Law in May 2016, which newly defined “virtual currency” as a means of settlement, the sale of virtual currency as defined under the new Fund Settlement Law will be exempt from JCT. This change will apply to sales/purchase transactions performed in Japan on or after 1 July 2017.”\n\nJapanese Bitcoin market\n\nOn March 27, the Japanese National Diet officially approved the 2017 tax reform proposals shared by Deloitte, passing the Bitcoin consumption tax bill along with other bills listed on the proposed reforms. The bill, which came into effect on July 1, is expected to drastically increase Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading activities within the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange market.\n\nOn April 1, the Japanese government officially recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method and currency. Since then, the Japanese government has been focusing on creating and establishing a more efficient ecosystem for Bitcoin traders, businesses and users. A major part of the initiative was to render Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading frictionless, allowing traders to easily access cryptocurrencies without having to deal with external factors such as taxes.\n\nThe Japanese Bitcoin exchange market is already well regulated and well-equipped with appropriate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. AML policies are especially strict in Japan and South Korea, it is difficult for traders to take advantage of potential arbitrage opportunities and utilize Bitcoin to move large sums of money outside of Japan without triggering the AML systems adopted by local trading platforms.\n\nBitcoin price increases - a coincidence?\n\nAlthough it could be completely coincidental- since the activation of the Japanese Bitcoin tax elimination bill on July 1, Bitcoin price increased from around $2,450 to $2,570. It is not a fair assessment to wholly attribute Bitcoin’s upward momentum to the Japanese market as it only accounts for 16.2 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market.\n\nHowever, positive signs for Bitcoin trading in Japan could have established a positive precedent across Asia, which controls more than 65 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market share and affected bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin’s tax elimination bill is also important for the ecosystem of Japanese Bitcoin merchants. Recently, some of Japan’s most influential companies including its largest electronics retailer Bic Camera started to accept Bitcoin as a digital currency and a payment method.\n\nSoon, hundreds of thousands of restaurants, cafes and stores could begin accepting Bitcoin as AirRegi, Japan’s largest point of sale machine operator, is looking to integrate Bitcoin by the fall of 2017.', 'FOX News has joined the mainstream networks bullish on Bitcoin, embracing claims it could reach up to $1 bln.\n\nIn a segment of Making Money June 30, anchor Charles Payne hosted a celebration of Bitcoin, the latest rally of which could see it reach $1 mln “within the next few years,” he agreed.\n\n“For the most part we wrote it off as technology’s answer to Beanie Babies,” Payne began, “Well, it’s back, and this time this rally feels different.”\n\nFOX joins networks such as CNBC in its newfound love of virtual currency, which until 2017 regularly received derogatory reviews from hosts and experts alike.\n\nAs Bitcoin circles $2,500 per coin, speculating over its price within five or ten years has become a new favorite sport of finance media looking to get investors excited.\n\n“The reason Bitcoin is a financial revolution is because it’s decentralized,” Payne’s guest Naomi Brockwell, former policy director at the New York Bitcoin Center said.\n\n“The main people promoting this technology are those who understand that governments can be dangerous.”\n\nTaking the current financial crisis in Venezuela, where Bitcoin is providing a genuine lifeline to those who would otherwise not be able to purchase essential goods, Brockwell added the future of the cryptocurrency could only be brighter.\n\n“It’s going to the moon,” she concluded.\n\nBy the end of the segment, the $1 mln price forecast had meanwhile become $1 bln, albeit with no sources referenced.', ""Here's a look at what we are focusing on in the bitcoin price this morning.\n\nAnd we are off on a fresh week of trading in the bitcoin price and – with any luck – we’ll get another good one moving forward.

In June, Coinbase added one mln new users, demonstrating a massive increase in its user base in a relatively short period of time.\n\nAlistair Milne, Bitcoin investor and analyst at Altana Digital Currency Fund, recently revealed a growth chart of Coinbase’s user base dating back to November of 2016. From May to June, Coinbase added approximately one mln new users and in the past 18 months, Coinbase added more than four mln users.\n\nCoinbase has added approx 1million new users in 30 days\n\nThe rate of growth does not appear to be slowing down#bitcoin pic.twitter.com/6EhG7p91Hx — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) June 29, 2017\n\nUsers, not wallets\n\nMilne’s chart above shows the growth in the number of Coinbase users, not wallets. At the time of reporting, Coinbase oversees 27.5 mln wallets, more than leading Bitcoin wallet service provider Blockchain. Apart from that, Coinbase supports 46,000 Bitcoin merchants and 10,000 developer apps.\n\nThe differentiation between the number of users and wallets operated by Coinbase is important to consider because many users and analysts have previously referred to the active user base of Coinbase to compare the number of wallets operated between Coinbase and Blockchain, the two largest Bitcoin wallet platforms in the market.\n\nAt the moment, Coinbase is the largest Bitcoin wallet platform in the market and operates around 12.5 mln more wallets than Blockchain.\n\nMeanwhile, Blockchain raises $40 mln from VC investors\n\nRecently, London-based Blockchain raised $40 mln from prominent venture capital investors including Google’s investment arm Lakestar and Virgin’s Richard Branson. In fact, Bloomberg characterized the investment as one of the largest fintech investments since Brexit.\n\nTom Hulme, Google Ventures (Lakestar) partner, told Bloomberg:\n\n“The pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched. We were impressed by Blockchain’s consistent market traction and dedication to building secure financial products for an increasing number of users.”\n\nAround the same time Blockchain secured its $40 mln funding round, various sources including the Wall Street Journal revealed that Coinbase is set to raise a $100 mln funding round at a $1 bln valuation from a group of widely recognized investors.\n\nAt one point, Coinbase was valued at one-tenth of the market cap of Bitcoin and has consistently been the largest Bitcoin wallet platform since then. With its digital currency trading platform GDAX, Coinbase is also trying to secure dominance over the cryptocurrency exchange market.\n\nAttracting investors into the crypto market\n\nAdam White, the vice president of GDAX, explained that the recent bailout of Ethereum traders on the GDAX platform after a flash crash was also a difficult decision the company approved to sustain its long-term ambition to become the leading digital currency exchange in the world to serve both professional traders and institutional investors\n\nWhite says:\n\n“Our long-term ambition, however, is to be a leader among all exchange platforms and we are committed to serving as the most trusted provider to the world’s largest institutions and professional traders. We are confident that all trades this week were executed properly, however, some customers did not receive the quality of service we strive to provide and we want to do better.”\n\nThe Bitcoin industry and cryptocurrency exchange market are growing at an exponential rate. Companies such as Coinbase and Blockchain are at the forefront of the cryptocurrency sector’s growth, attracting investors into the market.', 'Barry’s Silbert’s New York Agreement (NYA) has received fresh criticism in the form of a dedicated blog post from Bitcoin core developer Luke-jr.\n\nThe post appeared the day before SegWit2x - the code to bring about the roadmap agreed upon at Silbert’s New York meeting - entered beta phase.\n\n“4–8MB block sizes are not sane. Even 1MB blocks are already clearly dangerous to Bitcoin,” he commented on Bitcoin’s future with SegWit2x.\n\n“I cannot foresee myself consenting to the hardfork proposal under almost any circumstances, except perhaps with a softfork to limit the size to something reasonable.”\n\nAdding the whole SegWit2x phenomenon was a “distraction from the upcoming BIP148 softfork, which is already irreversibly deployed to the network,” Luke-jr is another high-profile source of criticism against the increasingly popular scaling solution.\n\nSilbert had faced an uphill struggle from the beginning, as even participants in the meeting, specifically Roger Ver subsequently began showing signs of a U-turn.\n\nIn an explanatory aside, Luke-jr was careful to note that any scheming behind SegWit2x would likely begin and end with NYA participant Bitmain, rather than Silbert or another party.\n\n“I don’t mean to imply that all the participants to the NYA have this goal [distraction from BIP148] in mind! But rather that the design of SegWit2x is such that it fits this purpose,” he concluded.\n\n“Bitmain may very well have done this intentionally, but it seems unlikely anyone else intended it.”\n\nThe post sparked a lengthy debate on Twitter, with the developer rebuffing multiple retaliations from online commentators.']"
07/04/2017,"['When I began to teach in 2012, I decided to start my course with an analysis of how money affects social order. What my students found particularly fascinating was the then-nascent world of cryptocurrencies, which I described at length as a crucial feature in the future of money.\n\nSome colleagues criticized my approach. They accused me of indirectly encouraging students to invest in what they saw as a shady, crime-ridden financial underworld. But I was simply exposing young minds to a fast-evolving, complex phenomenon that in my view would have a major impact on power distribution in the global economy.\n\nBehind most cryptocurrencies is a simple technology known as “blockchain”, a system residing in multiple computers that allows for peer-to-peer financial ledger recording of all transactions occurring in a network.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the collapse of the formal financial system has made Bitcoin an attractive alternative. This results in a transparent open-access registry of monetary flows which makes the intermediation of banking authorities unnecessary. Thus it challenges the conventional belief that money can only work through central planning.\n\nAs I explain in my book, Wellbeing Economy: Success in a World Without Growth, money systems are undergoing an unprecedented transition from centralised authority to decentralised networks.\n\nConventional money is managed by states and banks, with users on the receiving end of monetary policy decisions. By contrast, most alternative currencies are peer-to-peer. That means they are managed by users themselves and do not require intermediaries. Some of them have global outreach thanks to digital technology, while others are locally based.\n\nTake Bitcoin, the most popular peer-to-peer currency in the world, with a market capitalization above 40 billion US dollars. A person buying the equivalent of $1 in Bitcoin in 2009 would now possess roughly $25 million. One Bitcoin is currently equivalent in value to two ounces of gold. Other rising stars include Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple.\n\nTaking the world by storm\n\nMany of these currencies remain quite volatile in the short term. Their upward and downward swings reach over 10% of the value on a weekly basis. But the long-term trend is impressive. States are warming up to them.\n\nA person who bought the equivalent of $1 in Bitcoin in 2009 would now possess roughly $25 million. In April 2017, Japan accepted Bitcoin as a legal payment method for retail markets. After threatening digital currencies last year, the Russian government took a U-turn. President Vladimir Putin met the developers of Ethereum and committed to recognising cryptocurrencies in 2018.\n\nFollowing an initial freeze, the People’s Bank of China readmitted withdrawals in BitCoin in June 2017, catapulting the currency to new heights. In the US, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly accepted as both a method of payment and store of value.\n\nThe Australian government will soon make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate, exempting traders and investors from goods and services tax.\n\nIt’s clear that cryptocurrencies will in the near future become much more common as methods of payment for a wide range of purchases, from online shopping to the local supermarket.\n\nDeveloping countries are leapfrogging\n\nDeveloping economies, too, are opening up to cryptocurrencies. In Venezuela, Bitcoin has become the leading parallel currency. It provides millions of citizens with an opportunity to perform transactions and generate livelihoods, including buying food and other basic necessities in a country where official money is worth almost zero. It also allows them to purchase goods from overseas, overcoming ever-stricter capital controls.\n\nIn East Africa, local innovators have introduced cryptocurrency systems to support cross-border transactions, as exemplified by initiatives like BitPesa.\n\nIn South Africa, cryptocurrencies are becoming particularly popular. In Nigeria, local traders and activists believe this new money presents an opportunity to democratize the economy. This is propelled by the fact that people in Nigeria have been failed by conventional money.\n\nAccording to my colleague Verengai Mabika, founder of BitFinance in Zimbabwe, the collapse of his country’s formal financial system has made BitCoin an attractive alternative. This is especially the case for online payments, which are restricted by banks, and for remittances, which constitute the backbone of the economy.\n\nA growing number of Zimbabweans are also using cryptocurrencies as a saving mechanism (37% of all Bitfinance customers use it for that purpose), Verengai tells me. This is after the massive loss of personal savings during the hyperinflation period of 2008, which led to the collapse of the country’s banks.\n\nDecentralization\n\nThe decentralization of money is indeed at the core of this new trend, with potential repercussions in other fields. For instance, Ethereum is designed as a smart contract platform, that is a trading system completely based on peer-to-peer property rights. FairCoin was developed as the preferential currency for cooperatives, social economies and fair trade networks around the world.\n\nCryptocurrencies are just the tip of an iceberg. According to recent estimates, there are over 6,000 complementary currencies in the world, over 50 times the number of conventional money systems. Most of these are user-controlled and are interest-free. One cannot make money by simply trading in them.\n\nHoarding makes no sense in this new world. This is because value is not in the accumulation but in the exchange.\n\nThe scope is often limited to certain territories or types of transactions (for example, personal care, sustainable mobility and local trade). This creates an incentive to support local economic development and forms of exchange that are valued by communities of users.\n\nRegiogeld, a network of local currencies which I studied when I was a researcher in Germany, has proliferated throughout the country. It has become the world’s largest system of local currencies, supporting small businesses and empowering communities.\n\nIn the near future, we will have a variety of money with different qualities and different purposes. This will make economies more resilient against shocks and will support more equitable and sustainable development, by putting users in the driver seat and reinforcing local economic development.\n\nAs my research demonstrates, a combination of regional, national and local currencies could also be the best way forward for the European Union, engulfed by its monolithic and unsustainable euro, and for any other process of regional integration, from Africa to other continents.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original here.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.', 'Sheba Jafari, the head of technical strategy at Goldman Sachs, recently revealed in a note to Business Insider that he expects Bitcoin price to extend to $3,915 and move closer to the $4,000 region this year.\n\nTechnical analysis on the trend of Bitcoin price is often inaccurate due to the wide range of variables that can potentially affect Bitcoin price in a relatively short period of time.\n\nIn a more general sense, Bitcoin is in a sweet spot regarding global adoption, development and growth of user base. Over the past year, Bitcoin wallet platforms including Coinbase and Blockchain have registered tens of millions of new users as regions including China, South Korea, Japan, Australia and the US. They are planning to introduce more practical and efficient regulations for users, traders and companies.\n\nIn consideration of Bitcoin’s current upward momentum and the rapid pace of growth of the Bitcoin industry, Jafari predicts Bitcoin price to hit $3,915 soon, which would add $22 bln to Bitcoin’s market cap. After two more rallies which may include a minor correction, Jafari expects the market cap of Bitcoin to increase by 53 percent.\n\nJafari said:\n\n""From current levels, this has a minimum target that goes out to 3,212 (if equal to the length of wave I). There’s potential to extend as far as 3,915 (if 1.618 times the length of wave I). It just might take time to get there.”\n\nWhat is pushing up Bitcoin price\n\nThe demand toward Bitcoin is rising at an exponential rate for various reasons. An increasing number of users have begun to adopt Bitcoin as a digital currency. Merchants have started to acknowledge Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method and more regions have introduced plans to regulate the Bitcoin sector to attract the public, casual traders and institutional investors.\n\nIn Japan, Bitcoin has transformed into a major currency, adopted by some of the country’s prominent companies such as the nation’s largest electronics retailer Bic Camera and multi-billion dollar conglomerate GMO Group. Cointelegraph previously reported that Japan might also see the acceptance of Bitcoin by hundreds of thousands of new restaurants, cafes, stores and merchants by this fall through the integration of Bitcoin by AirRegi.\n\nCountries including Japan and Australia have recently eliminated double taxation on Bitcoin purchase and trading to provide clarity for users and traders. South Korea and China are moving forward in adopting Bitcoin as a legitimate digital currency, providing a more efficient ecosystem for businesses and startups.\n\nCointelegraph revealed on July 3 that South Korea is set to legalize Bitcoin in the upcoming months with the help of the ruling Democratic Party’s representative Park Yong-jin. Once the government grants Bitcoin the status of a legitimate and legal digital currency, the cryptocurrency exchange market of South Korea is expected to prosper with increased national adoption and mainstream media coverage.\n\nWith all of these factors in mind and Bitcoin’s recent upward momentum, analysts including Goldman Sachs’ Sheba Jafari expects Bitcoin price to enter the $4,000 region soon.', 'GBMiners creator Amit Bhardwaj has released a book on cryptocurrency for beginners despite allegations he is running a Ponzi scheme.\n\nAs Indian news resource Factor Daily reports quoting research from CoinJournal and The Caravan, Bhardwaj is currently subject to a Change.org petition calling for his arrest.\n\nToday nonetheless a cover of Indian newspaper The Hindu contains a full-page advertisement for his book, ‘Cryptocurrency for Beginners,’ which is available online priced at 1,499 rupees ($23.15).\n\nBhardwaj’s GBMiners currently controls just over three percent of Bitcoin’s network hash rate, while two other projects, Gainbitcoin and AmazeMiners, of which he is CEO, are subject to suspicion.\n\nSpecifically, participants signing up to Gainbitcoin allegedly receive 100 percent profits with no expenditure necessary, something which under normal conditions makes no logical sense.\n\n“He repeatedly contradicted himself, and was evasive about the relationship between GBMiners and Gainbitcoin,” Caravan journalist Aria Thaker meanwhile reported on interviewing Bhardwaj.\n\n“He also admitted, with casual ease, that he had lied to his investors about crucial information regarding Gainbitcoin’s investments (‘They feel good, right? When they get high information,’ he told me about his customers, after admitting to using inflated figures on Gainbitcoin’s website).”\n\nThe petition makes specific reference to AmazeMiners, meanwhile, noting Bhardwaj’s Facebook post about its commission from April contains mostly “comments about payout grievances.”\n\n“I request you all to sign this petition asking the Commissioner of Police, Delhi to arrest Mr. Amit Bhardwaj and make him compensate (sic) all those he has scammed,” the petition concludes.', 'Liudmyla Matviiets, 271 EAK MOTO/Shutterstock\n\nAfter the recent WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, hackers have taken ransomware mainstream. But another type of criminal is also demanding bitcoin in exchange for releasing something, or someone: traditional kidnappers.\n\nEarlier this month, The Indian Express reported a kidnapping gang had attempted to solicit payment in bitcoin. In a sign of how technology and crime intersects, sometimes unsuccessfully, this is far from the only case of kidnappers trying to use cryptocurrency.\n\nSix people abducted a trader called Ashu Jain on May 30, according to The Indian Express. The gang allegedly demanded 20 bitcoins, or around $52,000 at today\'s exchange rate. Deepak Sharma, an IT graduate allegedly led the scheme, the report adds.\n\nEarlier this year, kidnappers targeted a Brazilian woman who was, notably, married to a bitcoin businessman. According to a translated statement published by Cryptocoins News, the officer in charge of the investigation said, ""I spoke with a few colleagues from all over Brazil and there was never a kidnap attempt in which a payment in virtual currency was demanded. This is unprecedented in Brazil.""\n\nBut the practice stretches back at least as far as 2015, when Taiwanese kidnappers pocketed over $1.5 million worth of cryptocurrency, according to Cointelegraph . The gang kept hold of Wong Yuk-kawn, the chairman of a Hong Kong-listed oil company, for 38 days. The same year, kidnappers in Costa Rica targeted a Canadian expat and demanded tens of thousands of dollars in bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is often mistakenly portrayed as some totally anonymous form of currency that allows criminals to obtain funds largely undetected. That\'s just not always true—multiple alleged dark web dealers have been identified by their use of bitcoin. And as soon as the crime involves stepping out into the physical world, such as posting quantities of drugs in the mail, investigators have another avenue to pursue.\n\nThat may be the case with some kidnappers and bitcoin too: in all three of these cases, authorities arrested suspects. In the Indian example, police picked up six people, as did the Brazilians. In Taiwan, investigators arrested 16 people.\n\nBut as bitcoin continues to gain more attention, maybe more traditional criminals will try to merge their trade with cryptocurrency.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .', '“7… 00… 9… 0… 183.” I type in the secret code as printed on the flyer that I found at the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Saint Petersburg the day prior. But to no avail. The steel gate to the inner-city courtyard won’t open, and the buttons I’m pressing seem like some kind of doorbell system rather than a lock anyway.\n\n\n\nAs I’m about to give it a second try — against my better judgement — two more guys show up. They want to enter too and apparently actually know how to do it. Pressing the right buttons, one of them unlocks the gate and lets me in as well. “Are you going to the Crypto Friends ICO Meetup?” I ask. The guys nod.\n\nI try some small talk as we move our way into the courtyard.\n\n“So, what brings you guys here. Are you investing in ICOs?”\n\nOne of them answers. His Russian accent is thick, but his English is good. He says he actually works at a company that helps businesses set up ICOs. His job is to get the message out about a new ICO, as far and wide as possible via forums, chat groups, news sites, whatever it takes. PR, basically.\n\n“The return on investment in these ICOs is insane,” he enthuses. “Put in $10,000, and you can end up a millionaire.”\n\nThe two lead me around a corner to an inconspicuous door with another lock. Here they type in the code on the flyer: 70090183. The door opens, and we step into a small, somber hallway. A doorman sort of guy is sitting in an even smaller room to the left of us. He doesn’t look up. An elevator waits on the opposite side of the hall. We get in, and one of my companions presses the button with a five on it. It takes us to the top floor.\n\n“Have you heard of EOS?” the other guy now asks me. I have but don’t know much about it. I tell him I know that the founder is supposed to be controversial; but I don’t know the details.\n\n“I think it could be the next big thing,” he tells me. I nod, noncommittally. I don’t usually put money in these things.\n\nOn the top floor is another hallway. I notice that the green rubber floor is covered with arrow-shaped stickers. “Crypto friends meetup,” they read. Seems like we made it to the right place indeed. The stickers bring us to the next door. One of the guys knocks, the door opens.\n\nA bit to my surprise, we now step into a luxurious restaurant. The light-filled rooms with big windows are decorated with antique furniture, and large framed paintings hang on the walls. The restaurant itself is relatively empty, but people have gathered in a bar area in the corner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Deal With ICOs\n\nIn case you are that one person who hasn’t heard of the phenomenon yet: ICOs — short for Initial Coin Offerings — have been the crypto-rage for most of 2017. They are essentially tradable digital tokens, sold as some type of company stock, but issued on a blockchain. And without most of the legal guarantees that actual company stock provides — assuming these coins can even be considered company stock at all. Maybe they’re more like gift vouchers… or something. Often, no one really knows.\n\nEither way, companies have been issuing these ICOs to raise funds for their venture. Lots of funds. ICOs have become somewhat notorious for selling tens of millions of dollars worth of tokens within minutes, earning startups — often with little more than a whitepaper to show for themselves — valuations more appropriate for C-series funding rounds.\n\nThe phenomenon has been catching on in Russia as much as anywhere else. Some of the most successful ICO projects are being developed by Russians — although they are often officially based abroad to avoid legal trouble. MobileGo is one of them, the mobile gaming platform that raised over $50 million. Another is Waves, itself a platform for ICO tokens, which raised over $16 million. It’s Waves, founded by Moscow-based Sasha Ivanov, that is sponsoring today’s event.\n\nCrypto Friends\n\nMild electronic music fills the bar area, and small groups of people — perhaps two dozen in total — stand scattered throughout, chatting. Most have a drink in their hands: beer, wine and, in particular, cocktails.\n\nI take a seat at one of the two tables that seems reserved for the event. One other fellow is sitting at the table. He’s wearing a hoodie and shorts, even though the Saint Petersburg summer is not all that warm. He has his laptop open, his eyes focused on the screen. He looks up after a couple of minutes, so I once again try to make some small talk. He tells me he works in fintech. “Real fintech,” he emphasizes. He develops trading apps for investing.\n\n“What we’re seeing here is a mania,” he says when I ask him about ICOs. “There is no underlying value in any of these projects. They better resemble multi-level marketing schemes than proper investments.”\n\nHe’s clearly not a fan. So I ask him why he showed up at all.\n\n“Maybe in five months or so, it could develop into something useful,” he says. “The concept has potential, but it needs to grow into something more serious. It could potentially be an interesting mix between crowdfunding and Initial Public Offerings. Eventually.”\n\nAnother guy joins the table but doesn’t sit down. He seems to be in his thirties, casually dressed as most people are: a landscape architect, he tells me when I ask him. “I invest but only a little. To make some money on the side,” he says. “Mostly in mobile platforms or apps.” His English is a bit shaky. As a friend of his shows up, he bids me goodbye.\n\nI watch the two of them walk away, and it’s only now that I realize that in the back of the bar area, hidden behind curtains next to the bar itself, is another doorway.\n\nThe Actual Crypto Friends\n\nProbably at least a hundred people sit around on sofas throughout this next large, round room, filled with the fruity smoke odor of water pipes. The glass ceiling is covered with cloth to keep some of the light out, and Russian finger food is laid out on coffee tables. The walls around us are covered with paintings, books and even some handcrafted art.\n\nApparently the bar was just for drinks. This is where the actual meetup is. I take a seat on one of the sofas.\n\nThere’s no stage. Instead, a guy with a neat, buttoned-up shirt is standing in the middle of the room with a microphone. He’s giving what seems to be an elevator pitch. Within five minutes, the next speaker is up. And the next one some ten minutes after that.\n\nThe unofficial MC of the night has a spot on a comfortable chair in the middle of the room. Three others are sitting close him: a sort of literal inner circle. They lead the charge in asking questions after each talk. I don’t understand any of it; it’s all in Russian, of course.\n\nDuring the smoke break — we’re back in the courtyard — I walk up to the MC, and ask him if he’s the organizer. He quickly turns me over to Daria, a dark-haired girl in her twenties. I had noticed her pacing around the meetup area during the talks. I learn that she has put together today’s event.\n\n“The speakers today cover just about anything there is to know about ICOs,” she explains, when I ask her what the purpose of the meetup is. “The potential, the risks, the legal aspect of it.”\n\n“So why are people here?” I try. “What do you think, if you’re being honest? Is it just to make a quick buck?”\n\n“It differs,” she says. “The crowd is diverse. We’ve got programmers, professional investors, hobbyists and more.”\n\nThough, she clearly agrees that at least some people are here just to make some easy money.\n\n“Sure, some projects are more valid than others. And yes, there’s lots of hype. But it’s a bit like the early days of Kickstarter. Over time the hype will calm down, and this method of fundraising will prove valuable.”\n\nAnton\n\nAs the smoke break ends, Daria and the others head back to the big round room. I decide to stick to the bar area this time. At least in there I can chat a bit.\n\nHaving bought a beer for some $7— surprisingly expensive by Russian standards — I’m killing some time on my phone when a blond man joins me at the bar. His name is Anton. He has a British accent, picked up from his studies in the U.K., he says.\n\n“I see this as Russia’s chance to take on a leadership role in the technology sector. We’ve been trailing the U.S. and Europe too much,” he tells me, after I ask him my by-now standard question: Why are you here?\n\nAnton is very clearly speaking from a place of passion. He stands close to me, speaking a bit too loudly. He believes in what he says.\n\n“But we’re not just here to make money, man,” he emphasizes after I tell him I work for Bitcoin Magazine. “I don’t want you to see it like that. Blockchains are about much more than that. We’re here to transform society. And that’s important to remember.”\n\nAnton tells me about the potential of blockchains. The typical buzzwords. Transparent. Immutable. Censorship resistant.\n\nI feel almost nostalgic, listening to the way Anton explains himself. I remember a similar vibe from back in 2013, when I visited my first Bitcoin meetups. The air was filled with excitement. Andreas Antonopoulos’ talks were going viral for the first time. Bitcoin was gonna change the world in every imaginable way.\n\n“Blockchain technology has the potential to make an end to corruption,” Anton says. “It can make votes impossible to forge, for example.” He says he believes the Russian political system has been rigged for decades. “Now, we can have provably fair elections.”\n\nBut it also makes me slightly uneasy to watch Anton’s enthusiasm, with the ICO bubble that I’ve witnessed being built up.\n\nThe Bubble… and the Potential\n\nAnd it is a bubble. The valuation of many of these projects is far beyond reason, and the evidence that many of the investors have no idea what they’re putting money into is abundant. And that’s without even getting into some of the outright fraudulent claims.\n\nIn addition to that, the legal status of this whole concept is unclear. There are good arguments to be made that ICOs are really just unlicensed securities, specifically designed to skirt existing regulation. As such, regulators are bound to step in at some point — else they may as well close shop and find new careers. And when they do step in, it could mean that the ICO party is over very quickly.\n\nAt the same time, some of the genuine enthusiasm I encounter in Saint Petersburg makes me wonder if I’ve just grown cynical over the past couple of years. The cryptocurrency and blockchain space has been exhausted by scams, failures and toxicity. It’s had a bit of a disheartening effect on many, including myself.\n\nBut perhaps there’s more to this phenomenon than just scams. Who knows? Maybe the ICO strategy can break down barriers, allowing the common man to access investment markets more easily. Perhaps projects can better raise funds without caring about international borders, restrictions and regulations.\n\nIndeed, perhaps ICOs could at one point be a fruitful “mixture between Kickstarter and IPOs.” If nothing else, the phenomenal valuations suggest that there may be untapped liquidity markets.\n\n“In Russia we have the developers, we have good ideas, and we have the talent,” as one of the meetup attendees tried to explain. “It’s money, funding that’s hard to come by. ICOs are a chance to realize that part of the puzzle.”\n\nNote: Some names have been changed to protect privacy and anonymity.\n\n\n\n', 'In yesterday evening’s analysis, we noted that the bitcoin price seemed to have turned around – at least from a long-term perspective – and that we might see a return to the overarching upside momentum throughout the late session in Europe and as the Asian session kicked off early morning on Tuesday. We did see something similar to this, but things were a little more muted than we might have hoped from a volatility perspective. This wasn’t unexpected – markets are closed in the US today and this is always going to affect volume to a degree – but the lack of choppiness did come as a bit of a surprise.\n\nThere is a good chance that today will be pretty quiet, but this doesn’t mean we won’t have any opportunities to get in and out of the markets. Our strategy is set up so as to take advantage of a variety of different types of market conditions and quiet, consolidating action is one of them.\n\nSo, with this note, here is a look at the levels we have in our sights for today’s session and where we intend to get in and out of the markets according to the rules of our intraday strategy.\n\nAs ever, take a quick look at the chart below to get an idea of what is on. It is a one-minute candlestick chart and it has our key range overlaid in green.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range we are targeting for the session today is defined by support to the downside at 2596 and resistance to the upside at 2623. If we see price break above resistance, we will look for a close above that level to validate an immediate upside target of 2650.\n\nConversely, a close below support will have us in short towards 2575. A stop loss on both trades will ensure we are taken out of the positions in the event of a price reversal.\n\nChart courtesy of Trading View\n\nSaveSave\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

It offers a highly secure way for parties to exchange funds without the need for an intermediary such as a bank.\n\nYet Bitcoin is only one application of the technology that underpins it. Dubbed blockchain, this technology has the potential to revolutionise everything from billing systems and contracts to supply chains and even electronic medical records.\n\nIn reality, Bitcoin is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to blockchain deployments. According to analyst reports, usage is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 61.5 per cent until 2021. This means total transaction values are estimated to rise from $US210.2 million in 2016 to $US2,312.5 million by that year.\n\nThe concept of blockchain\n\nIn essence, blockchain is a system of distributed records that provides a robust way to share information in a peer-to-peer fashion. Blockchain’s appeal comes from its security and verifiability as users can’t delete or update items from a blockchain at a later date. This makes it an irrefutable electronic record of transactions.\n\nIt works by allowing users to add transactions to a block of code. When each transaction is added, a tamper-proof audit log is created using a cryptographic hash. The block is then replicated to all participants who need to validate the transactions.\n\nThe key here is the chain. You end up with each block containing a reference to a previous block that has also been created using the cryptographic hash. If the information in a block is altered, that hash will no longer be valid, and this is what creates the immutable nature of a blockchain.\n\nThe technology also offers the ability for users to embedded business terms within a chain. This allows the automation of processes, such as invoicing, payments and receipts and offers the promise of significantly streamlined business processes.\n\nWhile blockchain is a hot topic, it’s not a new concept as a lot of the underlying technologies have existed for years. What’s exciting is how those technologies have been brought together to create something with extra capabilities.\n\nGrowing interest\n\nBusiness interest in blockchain technology is increasing due the potential for change that it offers, and one of most significant involves the concept of ‘digital mesh’. This is the increasingly tight integration that is occurring between people, devices, content and services. New business models are needed to cope with a world that is increasingly connected and blended, and many believe this is where blockchain will come into its own.\n\nA second area of interest is around the concept of decentralised business networks. There is a growing need to automate business transactions between dispersed participants across a network in an efficient and cost-effective way. The old idea of having a B2B exchange or third-party intermediary is no longer sufficient as they reduce both speed and agility. Blockchain provides an alternative.\n\nA third area is the rising need for integrity and visibility in business transactions. There needs to be a way for them to be conducted openly and securely with full integrity. Many business transactions require an immutable, agreed upon log and this is exactly what blockchains can provide.\n\nKey areas of use\n\nProponents of blockchains have already identified a number of areas in which the technology can deliver business benefits.\n\nOne, dubbed ‘smart contracts’, takes advantage of the ability to add business logic to a blockchain. This can allow a transaction to trigger an action within a business system without the need for human intervention. Examples could include the automatic creation of invoices and receipts for payments received.\n\nAnother area involves supporting product provenance. A blockchain could be used to track progress through a supply chain from raw materials, through suppliers, manufacturers, distribution, retail and finally to the end customer. Historically, if someone wanted an end-to-end view of this process it would have been very difficult to create whereas a blockchain can provide an immutable log of the entire process.\n\nAnother area in which blockchains can add considerable value is in the automation of contracts. These could include anything from insurance claims to renting a car or purchasing a house. Each step in the process can be logged in the blockchain, significantly streamlining the process.\n\nDeploying blockchains\n\nThese benefits are making blockchain technology attractive to a growing number of organisations, but it’s important to temper enthusiasm with a dose of reality. It should be remembered that not every business problem requires a blockchain, and they can’t solve every challenge.\n\nIt is recommended that organisations start with small-scale experimental deployments and determine whether the technology meets a real-world need and can delivered anticipated benefits.\n\nBlockchains clearly have much to deliver, but time spent establishing exactly how the technology should be deployed will be time well spent.\n\nRobert Merlicek is Chief Technology Officer — Asia Pacific, TIBCO', 'An ethical whitehat hacker was said to have helped the FBI in solving a murder case.\n\nBitcoin independent researcher Chris Monteiro who has has breached into the database of phony darknet website which offers hitmen and gunmen for hire and leaked the date into a legit website has accidentally helped solve the murder case of Mrs. Amy Allwine, NASDAQ reports.\n\nSuicide or murder?\n\nIn November 2016, 47-year-old Mrs. Allwine was found dead in their home in Cottage Grove, Minnesota. While her husband Stephen Carl Allwine tried to cover up the death as a suicide by putting a pistol next to his wife’s elbow, further investigations led to the police investigators concluding that it was a case of murder.\n\nHence, in January 2017, Stephen Allwine was charged with second-degree murder based on the evidence collected which all belonged to him.\n\nDark web led investigators to real killer\n\nWhile the suspect has been arrested and charged, Mrs. Allwine’s case was eventually given more light because of the leaked data from “bRpsd” which was put to light by Monteiro’s probing. In May 2016, “bRpsd” breach the database of a darknet website offering hitmen and gunmen for hire: Besa Mafia.\n\nBesa Mafia is offering $5,000 up to $200,000 fee to hire hitmen to kill somebody. From that data dump uploaded to a public internet website, police were able to trace a connection to Mr. Allwine. They’ve found out that Mr. Stephen Allwine has been using the darknet in as early as 2014 using the name “dogdaygod” which is linked to his email address: dogdaygod@hmamail.com.\n\nWith thorough analysis of the data dump, investigators found out Mr. Allwine’s email on the list of Besa Mafia clients.\n\nCriminal complaint records show that Mr. Allwine was supposed to pay Besa Mafia $10,000 - $15,000 as payment for the hitmen who were supposedly to kill his wife.\n\nScam leading to solving the case\n\nHowever, it turned out that Besa Mafia was a scam as they are just collecting Bitcoins from their clients though they do not necessarily carry out their mission of killing their supposed target.\n\nFor Mr. Allwine’s case, after he transffered the funds to Besa Mafia, his communicators advised him that their hitman was apprehended by the police and was jailed.\n\nHowever, investigators have found that no one was apprehended or jailed in Minnesota during that period, thus creating a suspicion that that Mr. Allwin himself did the crime instead of the hitman.\n\nIt is likely that the independent researcher’s data breach has impacted Mr. Allwine’s case based on the various data it has unraveled as the Washington County District Court has charged Mr. Allwine with first-degree murder on March 24, 2017.\n\nAdditionally, police investigators have also discovered that Mrs. Allwine’s body contained a high level of a drug called scopolamine, which investigators later found was ordered by Mr. Allwine on the dark web.', 'Bitcoin continues to trend higher against the dollar but is in the middle of a correction from its recent rally. Using the Fib tool on the swing low and high on the 1-hour chart shows potential support levels.\n\nPrice is nearing the 38.2% retracement level at $2540 and a bounce could take it back up to the swing high or until the channel resistance closer to $2700. A larger pullback could last until the 50% Fib, which coincides with the moving averages that typically hold as dynamic inflection points. Meanwhile, the 61.8% level lines up with the channel support at $2480 and an area of interest as well.\n\nThe 100 SMA is crossing above the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the upside. In other words, the uptrend is more likely to continue than to reverse. The line in the sand for a pullback might be the $2450 mark, as a break below this region could mean that bears are regaining the upper hand.\n\nStochastic is still pointing down, which means that there’s some selling pressure left. Similarly, RSI is heading lower so bitcoin might follow suit. Once both oscillators hit the oversold levels and turn higher, buying momentum could return. If bulls are strong enough, they could even push for an upside break of the channel resistance and start a steeper climb for bitcoin.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Sheba Jafari recently gave bullish forecasts for bitcoin, and many say that this was responsible for the cryptocurrency’s rally at the start of the quarter. Of course it remains to be seen whether it can be sustained by market factors or if the speculation could fade soon.\n\nAs for the dollar, the main event risk this week is the NFP release which might set the tone for the Fed’s policy bias in the second half of this year.

""Those who think it necessary that Bitcoin be regulated, even if they want to be in on making the regulations as sane and harmless as possible, need to remember that every regulation has a punishment attached for violating it.""\n\nOn Friday, a grand jury charged Phoenix-area neurologist Peter Steinmetz with operating an unlicensed bitcoin exchange.\n\nThe Treasury\'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network alleges that Steinmetz, along with co-defendant Thomas Costanzo, ""enabled their customers to exchange cash for \'virtual currencies\' charging a fee for their service"" without a federal or state money transmitting license in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nCostanzo, whose internet alias is Morpheus Titania, established a localbitcoins.com account to conduct in-person exchanges of cash for bitcoin a month after FinCEN made such exchanges without a money transmitters license a crime, according to the indictment.\n\nWhile Steinmetz and Costanzo\'s business failed to attract federal attention for several years, Steinmetz had received $10,000 in Bitcoin funding from an anonymous donor to continue his work researching memory for the Arizona-based Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI).\n\n""It\'s almost appropriate actually, that a cutting-edge method of funding is used to fund cutting-edge research,"" he told the Arizona Republic at the time of the donation.\n\nA month later security arrested Steinmetz for carrying a loaded AR-15 into the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport as a protest against the TSA. BNI cut ties with him soon after.\n\nUndercover federal agents in 2015 initiated a series of transactions with Costanzo, paying him roughly $160,000 in cash in exchange for bitcoin over two years. Agents arrested Costanzo on April 20 and got an indictment issued for Steinmetz two months later.\n\nThe indictment does not make clear what role Steinmetz played in the bitcoin-for-cash business.\n\nSeveral men have already been convicted of similar offenses. In April, a New York man pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business after an undercover federal agent paid him $37,000 for 37 Bitcoins. In May, Missouri tech entrepreneur Jason Klein pleaded guilty to the same crime after making several in-person cash-for-bitcoin transfers with an undercover federal agent.\n\nThere has been some legal pushback to these prosecutions.\n\nIn 2016, Florida State Circuit Judge Teresa Pooler dismissed state-level charges against Michell Espinoza for selling $1,500 worth of bitcoin to an undercover cop he met via localbitcoins.com, ruling that bitcoin did not count as a ""payment instrument"" under Florida law.\n\n""Attempting to fit the sale of Bitcoin into a statutory scheme regulating money services businesses is like fitting a square peg in a round hole,"" Pooler wrote at the time.\n\nPooler\'s interpretation of a Florida statute is unlikely to help Steinmetz.\n\nMaking the square bitcoin peg fit into the round financial regulation hole could mean as much as five years in prison for Steinmetz.

07/05/2017,"['Analysts have discovered a significant similarity between Bitcoin price trend and chip stocks. Over the course of seven months since the beginning of 2017, the price trend of the main Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index has been remarkably similar.\n\nA chart revealed by CNBC showed:\n\nIt is unclear whether the similarity between the price trend of the SOX and Bitcoin is completely coincidental or somewhat relates to each other. However, Evercore ISI technical analyst Rich Ross noted that he has been aggressively encouraging investors and traders to buy biotech and sell semiconductors, considering the recent hike of the SOX value.\n\n""I reiterate my sell call on Semi\'s and continue to see a test of 1,000 on the SOX (-8 percent) as the group continues to display the textbook signs of a reversal in trend and a technical symmetry with Bitcoin, which is down -9 percent overnight and poised for another -17 percent to 2,044,” said Ross.\n\nWhy mainstream media & analysts Compare Bitcoin to stocks\n\nFor the vast majority of casual investors and traders, Bitcoin is a long-term investment, like a safe haven asset such as gold. Investors are building a portfolio of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Litecoin because the cryptocurrency market has the tendency to perform at its highest level in the midst of economic uncertainty and financial instability.\n\nHowever, the consistent and extensive report by the mainstream media on the similarities and differences between Bitcoin and stock markets could be considered as an optimistic sign. The fact that conventional and traditional investors are considering Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general as a legitimate asset class and viable digital currencies places the entire cryptocurrency market at a viable position to grow at an exponential rate.\n\nIn the past, analysts have suggested the correlation between the value of gold and Bitcoin along with stocks such as the SOX, but as the precious metals market including gold stumbled and failed to demonstrate a safe haven asset like quality with diminishing value, analysts have moved onto Bitcoin and stocks.\n\nIn many countries including Australia, South Korea and Japan, mainstream media outlets have been continuously comparing the value of Bitcoin to some of the world’s largest reserve currencies such as the US dollar, Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan, to address the rapidly growing interest towards Bitcoin as a long-term investment.\n\nMost early investors in Bitcoin recognize the real value of Bitcoin which derives from its decentralized nature and its ability to render existing banking systems and global financial networks useless by creating a peer to peer ecosystem for transaction settlement. Hence, there is still a large portion of investors that have purchased Bitcoin with the primary purpose of using it as a digital currency and a medium of exchange.', ""A lot of gamers have been caught off guard by the latest happenings in the world of cryptocurrency. The result has been radically altered graphics card prices, with AMD's RX 400/500 series cards in particular being out of stock at most places. If you haven't heard of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, don't feel bad—while some general awareness of it now exists, many people involved with the movement still don't really know what it is, why we need it, or if we should even want it. The brief synopsis goes something like this, and I'm intentionally skipping a lot of the complexity.\n\nA brief history of Bitcoin\n\nThe core idea is to have a currency backed by the power of cryptography (ie, math), rather than governments, gold, or some other physical good. Neal Stephenson's book Cryptonomicon contained an idea like this back in 1999, and in 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to a cryptography mailing list, with the software going live January 2009. I'm going to focus specifically on Bitcoin for a moment, but most of what I'll say applies (with some exceptions I won't get into) to all cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin is created via a sort of distributed computing competition, dubbed 'mining' after the gold rush, where based on your computational contributions you have a chance of 'finding' a block of Bitcoins. This happens every 10 minutes on average, and the more you participate the higher the chance of mining a block. The block reward started at 50 Bitcoins (BTC) and halves every 210,000 blocks (about four years)—it's currently 12.5 BTC. Mathematically, that means there will never be more than 21 million BTC.\n\nThe block rewards exist to entice people to run the software, because mining also secures the Bitcoin network. Basically, the difficulty of mining a block scales based on the total speed of the network, called the hashrate, and someone would need to control more than 50 percent of the hashrate to have a reasonable chance of hacking the Bitcoin network. So the more people (processors) running the hashing algorithms, the more secure the network, and the harder it is to find a block solution.\n\nThe Bitcoin network hashrate has gone from tens of millions of hashes per second during its first year, to billions, then trillions, and it currently sits at nearly five quintillion hashes per second, or 4.8 EH/s (that's exahash per second, with SI prefixes now used). The reason for the increase in hashrate isn't just more people participating—the processors used for hashing have also gotten much faster.\n\nA dedicated mining ASIC\n\nMining started with CPUs, then moved to GPUs, FPGAs, and eventually to custom ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuit)—processors designed purely for Bitcoin's hashing function. The fastest Bitcoin ASICs now do around 100 GH/s per chip, which is orders of magnitude faster than the best CPU or GPU. But they don't use just one chip—a typical Bitcoin ASIC miner can have anywhere from dozens to 100 or more chips in it, so Bitcoin mining hardware can do up to 14 TH/s. That used to be a lot, but now it means about $15 per day, give or take.\n\nWhy are graphics card prices skyrocketing?\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with graphics cards? Here's where things get a bit convoluted. Bitcoin was released as open source software, and it uses the SHA256 algorithm for hashing. Anyone is free to take the source code and modify it, which has led to the creation of more than a thousand (and counting) alternative cryptocurrencies. Many of these are worthless, but some of them have modified the software in unique and useful ways. Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin are the next three largest cryptocurrencies right now, and each offers a different take on block rewards, hashing algorithm, and more. (Okay, Ripple is very different from the other three, but I'm not getting into the nitty gritty right now—Google is your friend if you want to know more.)\n\nHome made mining PC\n\nThe change in hashing algorithms is the biggest factor in what sort of hardware can be used to mine the coin. The ASIC name says most of what you need to know: it's application specific, and in the case of Bitcoin, the ASICs are focused almost exclusively on running the SHA256 algorithm. A CPU in contrast can run any algorithm, but generally not as fast as an ASIC built for the same task. GPUs are a bit of a middle ground, in that they're far more programmable than an ASIC, but there are certain algorithms that aren't suitable for the hardware. In the cryptocurrency world, however, very few algorithms exist that can run on a CPU but not on a GPU, meaning graphics cards are the de facto mining hardware for any cryptocurrency that doesn't (yet) have an ASIC.\n\nWe've now seen several spikes in graphics card prices over the years, thanks to cryptocurrencies. In mid-2011, people started buying all the Radeon HD 5870 cards they could find for Bitcoin mining (this was before ASICs). In late 2013 and early 2014, AMD's brand-new Hawaii GPUs (R9 290/290X) became nearly impossible to find at MSRP, thanks to Litecoin, other alt-coins, and a massive jump in Bitcoin prices that increased the value of all associated cryptocurrencies. The R9 290 as an example was supposed to cost $399, but for a while the lowest price was closer to $650. And now, in mid-2017, we have another cryptocurrency mining surge going on, driven in large part by Ethereum, but Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are playing a role as well.\n\nAre these cryptocurrencies actually useful?\n\nWhat do you do with these cryptocurrencies, and do they have any value? Some might say no, but scarcity, the lack of bank/government control, and the pseudo-anonymous nature has given them plenty of worth in the eyes of others. Anyone can create a wallet, a 26-35 character address (sometimes more, depending on the coin) that's the public part of a public-private key pair, with the owner keeping the private key. Cryptocoins can be transferred between wallets, protected by the power of cryptography, allowing digital funds to move around the world in a matter of minutes.\n\nToday, a single Bitcoin is valued at around $2,500 (though pricing is admittedly highly volatile), and more than 100,000 vendors accept BTC, including Newegg. You can also buy gift cards using BTC that will work at many other online stores, including Amazon. But it's not all sunshine and lollipops.\n\nA much more serious hashing setup\n\nThere have also been plenty of thefts, scams, and other shady goings on in the cryptocurrency world. Cryptocurrencies end up being a lot like digital cash, meaning it's very difficult to trace or intercept. Money laundering, drugs, and other illicit practices have used Bitcoin, and ransomware viruses exist that encrypt hard drives and demand BTC to get the unlock code and software. That's both the blessing and curse of pseudo-anonymous currencies.\n\nBut despite years of people declaring the death of Bitcoin and others hailing it as the promised Messiah, for most people Bitcoin remains a fringe curiosity. It's currently possible to make money via mining, but the power cost is nearly as much as the value of the BTC mined. Instead of becoming a currency free of the controls of governments and banks, Bitcoin is now largely controlled by a small collection of interested parties who have heavily invested in securing the network. And ironically, greater acceptance of Bitcoin will likely come only with additional regulations.\n\nWhich leads back to GPUs again, where it's more profitable to mine something other than Bitcoin using your GPU, then trade it for Bitcoin—and some software even supports auto-switching between various mining algorithms to select the currently highest paying option. No surprise, individuals and companies have sprung up to build mining farms of GPUs to take advantage of this fact.\n\nIf you're interested in trying to build your own mining farm to get rich off cryptocurrencies, there are many others trying to do the exact same thing right now—this is why many have accused Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies of being Ponzi schemes. Most of you are here because you're interested in PC gaming, and you're probably wondering when the madness will stop so you can buy an RX 580 or GTX 1070 at something closer to MSRP. Having been through this a couple of times before, I have a few hopeful insights.\n\nPatience is a virtue, even in games\n\nEvery mining boom is traditionally followed by a mining bust—some people inevitably strike it rich, but many others will struggle to break even, and some of these will give up and quit. In the case of cryptocurrency mining, however, selling used hardware to recoup some of the initial investment means there will often be a glut of used graphics cards in the future. The R9 290/290X that were going for $650+ in early 2014? A year or so later, the R9 290 (and the subsequent R9 390) was readily available for under $300. The driving factor was that Bitcoin prices had dropped, mining became unprofitable (because mining requires a lot of power), and people lost interest in buying up all the GPUs.\n\nEven if Bitcoin and Ethereum prices remain high, however, the algorithms are designed to respond to large increases in miners by increasing the difficulty of mining. In other words, there's a limited amount of Ethereum, Bitcoin, Library, Zcash, etc. to go around, and if the number of participants doubles, each person will earn half as much. And if the cryptocurrency prices begin to drop—and there are indications that's already happening—then we should see a transition sooner rather than later. But there are a lot of variables, so I won't even venture to guess when we might see AMD's Polaris GPUs back in stock at reasonable prices (for gaming purposes).\n\nIn the interim, here are a few things to consider. At present, most miners are going for midrange cards, as they offer the fastest return on investment. An RX 570 4GB at $170 (which was the initial launch price) for example would be able to pay for itself in about 60 days at current rates. Yeah, no wonder every miner and their dog bought as many as they could! RX 580 8GB at $240 would pay for itself in roughly 65 days, GTX 1070 at $350 breaks even in 80 days, and GTX 1060 6GB at $240 is around 85 days. Buy six of those and use PCIe riser adapters to put them into a single system, paired with a high-end power supply, and you have yourself a mining rig. Because the fastest gaming GPUs can use 250W (or more) of power, they're less interesting for miners, as only four or five would run off a single power supply—so the R9 Fury/Fury X was never very popular for mining, and the GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti have also been relatively unaffected.\n\nFor gaming purposes, obviously there's no debate between spending $550 on a GTX 1080 vs. $550 on an RX 580—the cheapest in stock price I could find at the moment for either card. The 1080 is substantially faster for gaming purposes, by about 60 percent last time I benchmarked the two cards. In fact, even for cryptocurrency mining you could make the argument that the GTX 1080 offers a better value right now, or at least a similar value. GTX 1080 Ti starting at $700 is also a reasonable option—assuming you're willing to go that high, which most of us aren't.\n\nIf you want anything more affordable than that (other than a budget card like a GTX 1050 / 1050 Ti or RX 560 2GB), your best option right now is to simply kick back and wait. Because a GTX 1060 3GB at $300 is a bad value for gaming, period. Companies are also creating mining-specific graphics cards now, cashing in on the craze, but I doubt that will have much impact unless prices are lower than regular gaming cards. Just know that eventually, the harsh realities of economics will kick in and it won't be possible to sustain high graphics card prices.\n\nAs for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, with a current market valuation of more than $100 billion USD, don't expect Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to disappear any time soon. They might even be part of our dystopian cyberpunk future. So far, things have been cyclical, much like the stock market, so don't be surprised if this isn't the last time cryptocurrencies cause a shortage of gaming GPUs."", 'The hackers behind the NotPetya ransomware, which wiped computers in more than 60 countries in late June, have moved more than £8,000 worth of bitcoins out of the account used to receive the ransoms.\n\nThe transfer has added credence to messages purporting to be from the attackers offering to decrypt every single infected computer for a one-off payment of £200,000, after security researchers suggested they may be state-sponsored actors.\n\nIt is possible to see the movement of the ransom payments thanks to the public nature of the bitcoin currency: all transfers are recorded on the public blockchain, although the real-world identities of the individuals or organisations behind a particular payment address can be near-impossible to discern.\n\nCurrently, the blockchain records that the bulk of the ransom money, £7,872 worth of bitcoin, was simply transferred to a second wallet on Tuesday night, but two smaller payments, of £200 each, went to accounts used by two text-sharing websites, Pastebin and DeepPaste.\n\nAround 10 minutes before the payments were made, someone made posts on both those sites claiming to be able to decrypt hard disks infected with the malware in exchange for a payment of 100 bitcoins.\n\nPotential smokescreen\n\nThe £200,000 offer has created more uncertainty about the motivations behind the ransomware. While it originally appeared to be created with the intention of earning a lot of money through ransom payments, researchers quickly pointed out that a number of features of the software made it appear that the ransom element was a smokescreen, with the real goal being widespread damage.\n\nSignificantly, the majority of infections occurred in Ukraine, due to the main attack vector being a compromised version of an accounting program, ME Doc, used to file taxes in the nation.

On Wednesday, it announced that it had seized ME Doc’s servers after “new activity” was detected there, and said it had acted to “immediately stop the uncontrolled proliferation” of malware.\n\nCyber police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko suggested that ME Doc had sent or was preparing to send a new update and added that swift action had prevented any further damage. “Our experts stopped (it) on time,” she said.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how or why hackers might still have access to ME Doc’s servers. The company has not returned messages from reporters, but in several statements took to Facebook to dispute allegations that its poor security helped seed the malware epidemic.\n\nCyber police chief Coonel Serhiy Demydiuk previously said that ME Doc’s owners would be brought to justice, but Kvitko said there had been no arrests.', 'It appears the largest dark web drug and counterfeit marketplace might be pulling off a Houdini.

Bitcoin slid to as low as $2,544.40 today from its high on June 12 on concern that digital currencies can’t reach wider acceptance fast enough and that their gains have been overdone.\n\nMoas says he’s “only a bit concerned that there may be a near-term bubble,” but long term, there’s the potential to make triple-digit returns.\n\nMoas recommends securing cryptocurrency positions through services like the one offered by Trezor.io and reminds clients his post is for informational purposes only and shouldn’t be viewed as investment advice or as a recommendation.', 'Bitcoin markets could rise as high as $3,900 in the future, according to a recent client note from investment bank Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe note from the bank\'s chief technician, Sheba Jafari, published by financial news site Zero Hedge, argues that bitcoin ""could consolidate sideways for a while longer"", highlighting a possible low of $1,857 and ""eventually targeting"" a figure of $3,212.\n\nThe analysis from Goldman comes weeks after Jafari published a more bearish analysis of the digital currency\'s prospects. It was around that time when bitcoin markets briefly surpassed the $3,000 mark. According to the CoinDeskBitcoin Price Index, prices reached an all-time high of $3,018.55 on 11th June. At press time, markets are currently trading around $2,595.\n\nIn the note, Jafari posits that bitcoin markets are in the fourth ""wave"" of a sequence that dates back to late 2010. As for what comes next, Jafari acknowledges that fourth waves ""tend to be messy/complex"".\n\nJafari goes on to write:\n\n""This means that it could remain sideways/overlapping for a little while longer. At this point, it’s important to look for either an ABC pattern or a more triangular ABCDE. The former would target somewhere close to 1,856; providing a much cleaner setup from which to consider getting back into the uptrend. The latter would hold within a 2,076/3,000 range for an extended period of time.”\n\n“Either way, eventually expecting one more leg higher; a 5th wave. From current levels, [bitcoin] has a minimum target that goes out to 3,212 (if equal to the length of wave I),"" Jafari wrote. ""There’s potential to extend as far as 3,915 (if 1.618 times the length of wave I).

Soll man in digitale Währungen investieren, und falls ja, wie? Werner Grundlehner\n\n«Ein Papier, also ein Bitcoin-Zertifikat oder einen ETF, statt eines Bitcoins zu kaufen, ist, wie wenn man eine E-Mail ausdruckt und sie per Fax versendet», sagt Christian Mäder von Bitcoin News zu den neusten Anlageprodukten von Finanzinstituten auf Kryptowährungen. So habe ein privater Anleger keinen Zugang zum Private Key seiner Bitcoins. Damit sei der «Witz» und das Revolutionäre weg. Der Besitzer würde so nicht in den Genuss des Nutzens und der Möglichkeiten dieser neuen Technologie, wie etwa Multi-Signature Transaction u. a., kommen.\n\nSchwer zu verstehen – wie die Lyrics in einem Rap-Song – sind digitale Währungen und ihre Kurstreiber. (Bild: Jens Bonnke)\n\nDie Meinungen zu Bitcoin sind gemacht. Technologie-Interessierte sind begeistert vom System der Kryptowährungen, die dezentral, das heisst unabhängig von Notenbanken und auch geografisch nicht gebunden, in einem Rechnernetzwerk unter Zuhilfenahme einer speziellen Software geschaffen und verwaltet werden. Traditionelle Ökonomen auf der anderen Seite glauben nicht daran, dass Bitcoin, Ether & Co. etablierten Währungen den Rang ablaufen können.\n\nNoch fehlt das Vertrauen in die Emittenten\n\nDazu fehle das Vertrauen in den Emittenten, und es gebe keine hinterlegte Sicherheit. Die gibt es zwar bei Währungen auch nicht, doch spiegelt eine Landeswährung die Wirtschaftskraft und das Vertrauen, das dem betreffenden Staat entgegengebracht wird. Zudem erachten die «Traditionalisten» das Volumen der Kryptowährungen als viel zu beschränkt, um dereinst die etablierten Zahlungsmittel abzulösen.\n\nDoch wenn sich der Wert eines Produktes innert eines Jahres vervielfacht und in den Medien ausführlich darüber berichtet wird, weckt dies das Interesse der Investoren, egal ob sie das System der Digitalwährungen verstehen oder an dessen Durchbruch in der Zukunft glauben. «Ich bin von den technischen Möglichkeiten, die hinter Bitcoin stecken, beeindruckt, aber ich wage keine Prognose, ob es diesen in zwanzig Jahren noch gibt – wir werden sehen», sagt Eric Blattmann, Leiter des öffentlichen Vertriebs von Finanzprodukten bei der Bank Vontobel.\n\nMit einem Tracker-Zertifikat auf den Bitcoin wollte die Bank gemäss Blattmann ein investierbares Produkt für den Durchschnittsanleger anbieten, ohne dass dieser selbst an Bitcoin-Börsen aktiv werden und ein eigenes Web-Wallet führen muss.\n\nErfolgreiche Bitcoin-Wertpapiere\n\nDas Zertifikat ist ein Erfolg: An vielen Tagen ist es das meistgehandelte strukturierte Produkt an der Schweizer Börse. Das anfangs kleine Emissionsvolumen des Zertifikats mit einer Laufzeit von zwei Jahren wurde schnell auf 20 Mio. Fr. aufgestockt und mittlerweile auf 40 Mio. Fr. erhöht. Vontobel kauft direkt an einer Börse Bitcoin im Gegenwert für die verkauften Zertifikate, damit kein Kursrisiko gegenüber dem Kunden entsteht. Ein Produkt ohne Laufzeitbeschränkung und auch ein Tracker auf Ethereum stehen bei der Bank zur Diskussion.\n\nAuch andere Finanzdienstleister bereiten Produkte vor. Die Schweizer Firma Crypto Fund gab jüngst bekannt, bis Ende Jahr den Cryptocurrency Fund lancieren zu wollen. Das indexbasierte, passive Fondsprodukt soll qualifizierten Investoren Zugang zu einem Korb von Kryptowährungen geben. «Die Aufmerksamkeit und die Schlagzeilen zu den Kryptowährungen waren der Grund, weshalb wir mit unserem Projekt bereits jetzt die Öffentlichkeit suchten», sagt CEO Jan Brzezek.\n\nMit solchen Produkten kommen diese Anbieter den Vermögensverwaltern entgegen. Denn diesen erscheint vieles zum Erwerb von digitalen Währungen zu unsicher oder ist schlicht unbekannt. Zahlreiche Fragen stellen sich dem potenziellen Investor: Welche Kryptowährung soll man kaufen, macht man das direkt an einer Börse oder über einen Broker, braucht man für die Coins ein Web-Wallet, was mache ich mit dem ellenlangen Code, der beispielsweise so «5HpHagT65TZzG1PH3CSu63k8DbpvD8s5ip4nEB3kEsreAnchuDf» aussehen kann? Zudem gab es Börsenplätze, die Insolvenz anmeldeten und Zeichen-Codes, die verloren gingen.\n\nDeshalb begrüsse er standardisierte Produkte wie etwa das Bitcoin-Tracker-Zertifikat von Vontobel, meint ein Vermögensverwalter. So müsse man nicht auf einer Bitcoin-Plattform investieren, was er als unsicher erachte. Mit einer Schweizer Bank sei das Emittenten-Risiko doch bedeutend kleiner und die Bonität besser, ergänzt er.\n\nErst wenige verstehen Bitcoins\n\nEs sei ganz normal, dass bei einem «gehypten» Produkt zuerst zu viel versprochen werde, gibt sich Lucas Betschart von der Bitcoin Association Switzerland ganz pragmatisch. Die Organisation wurde 2013 vor allem als Ansprechpartnerin für die Finanzmarktaufsicht Finma und als Kontaktstelle für die Presse gegründet. «Bitcoin direkt kaufen sollen nur die, welche die Technologie durchschauen», sagt er.\n\nDas dürften im Moment nur wenige sein. Alle anderen sollen nach Ansicht von Betschart ein Bitcoin-Anlageprodukt der Banken erwerben. Vorerst könne man Kryptowährungen eben nicht als Währung, sondern als Investitionsklasse wie etwa Gold anschauen. Dabei käme es auch vorläufig noch zu Preisturbulenzen wie bei Rohwaren.\n\nDoch mit der Verbreitung der Kryptowährungen werde auch die Volatilität abnehmen. Der jüngste «Flash-Crash» bei Ether dürfe einen nicht erschrecken. Das sei für eine junge, wenig gehandelte Währung nicht erstaunlich.\n\nBetschart relativiert auch den «Heldenepos» um die Blockchain. Theoretisch seien wirklich viele Geschäftsfälle, die jetzt noch einen Intermediär brauchten, lösbar, doch derzeit könne die Technologie nur rund 1000 Transaktionen gleichzeitig erledigen. Man arbeite aber daran, diese Kapazitäten zu erhöhen.\n\nErste Bitcoin-Automaten in der Schweiz\n\nEiner der ersten – und wenigen – Bitcoin-Automaten der Schweiz steht im Foyer des Beratungsunternehmens EY in Zürich. Das ist ein Mittel, um viele Mitarbeiter zur Verwendung von Bitcoin zu motivieren. «Dabei geht es nicht ums Spekulieren, die meisten Kollegen und Kolleginnen haben nur kleine Bitcoin-Bestände erworben», sagt EY-Partner Michel Stofer, der Finanzunternehmen bezüglich IT berät.\n\nDer Bitcoin sei dabei eigentlich eine Nebensache, es gehe darum, dass die Mitarbeiter Erfahrungen sammeln könnten im Umgang mit der Blockchain-Technologie, Smart Contracts und digitalen Wallets.\n\nEY bietet seinen Kunden an, die Rechnungen in Bitcoin zu bezahlen. Das sei aber bisher nicht genutzt worden. Hier geht es darum, Erfahrungen mit digitalen Bezahlsystemen zu gewinnen. Die Abrechnungen würden zu tagesaktuellen Kursen gemacht, damit der Kunde grosse Bestände und das Risiko starker Schwankungen im Gegenwert aufgrund der hohen Volatilitäten vermeiden könne.\n\nStofer will das Potenzial von digitalen Währungen nicht einschätzen. Die Erfahrungen mit weltweiten Netzwerken, die zuvor so noch nie gemacht wurden, findet er aber spannend und hilfreich. Entscheidend ist für Stofer aber das Potenzial der Blockchain in zahlreichen Bereichen, die sicherer, effizienter und günstiger gemacht werden könnten, beispielsweise das Grundbuch oder das Wertschriften-Clearing. Digitale Währungen brauchten als Unterbau die Blockchain, diese könnte aber für verschiedenste Anwendungen auch ohne digitale Währungen eingesetzt werden.\n\nWer sich nicht zu weit aus dem Fenster lehnen will, aber die spekulativen Chancen der digitalen Währung nicht verpassen will, wird tendenziell auf ein Bankprodukt setzen. Wer die Technologie begreifen und «spüren» möchte, wird eine kleinere Summe in Bitcoin investieren und auf dem Web loslegen.', 'Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy agency, demonstrates how Bitcoin works before the members of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee on June 29, 2017.\n\nAddressing concerns among government agencies\n\nThe growing population of Bitcoin miners and enthusiasts has alerted the government about the security repercussions which eventually led to series of discussions. The aforementioned committee held a hearing assessing the national security involving Blockchain technology transactions.\n\nThe US Congress is concerned about the rise of Bitcoin now that it has been linked to several illegal activities and money laundering with their major worry being its potential use for terrorist funding hence the introduction of Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 bill.\n\nFighting for Bitcoin cause\n\nCoin Center executive director Jerry Brito testified before the committee to explain how Blockchain networks like Bitcoin actually work on hearing entitled “Virtual Currency: Financial Innovation and National Security Implications”.\n\nAccording to the memorandum of the said hearing, they’ve particularly explored “terrorists and illicit use of financial technology (FinTech), the national security implications of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, and the use of “blockchain” technologies to record transactions and uncover illicit activities”.\n\nFor his part, Brito stressed on the fact that lawmakers should be approaching Blockchain technology as purpose-agnostic platform. Just like before the internet hit mass adoption, it was also rich with innovative potentials.\n\nThus, the Blockchain advocacy agency called for a sound government approach on cryptocurrency. Furthermore, they also aim to educate the Committee so that they will understand the whole scenario and avoid relying solely upon third party information when assessing information about digital currency.\n\nClarifying concerns\n\nCoin Center believes that the underlying concerns about the Blockchain technology is the lack of proper regulations and deep understanding of the technology. The agency argued that such issues can be avoided by helping the governing bodies get sufficient working knowledge about cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a demonstration day event held last week, Coin Center shared about the benefits of cryptocurrencies and tackled their alleged risks. They partnered with Xapo, Chainalysis, and Elliptic to show how a typical user interacts with the Bitcoin network.\n\nAccording to Coin Center, the demo covered the processes starting from setting up a digital wallet and a hosted wallet, the stringent AML/KYC process, sending a transaction, to viewing transactions.\n\nWith this educational effort for the cryptocurrency, it is still uncertain whether or not the government will consider the new facts laid before them into their decision making.', 'Russia’s biggest forex trader Alpari has launched Bitcoin trading and will provide courses educating users how to handle cryptocurrency.\n\nAs Finance Magnates reports Tuesday, Alpari, which has been eyeing crypto markets since at least last year, has added so-called contracts for difference (CFDs) for BTC/EUR and BTC/USD.\n\n“The cryptocurrency market is still in its genesis stage,” a technical analysis piece released by the site following the launch reads.\n\nThe move is a firm statement of belief not just in Bitcoin’s outlook globally but in Russia itself, the country signaling a commitment to formal regulation of cryptocurrency markets by next year.\n\nPreviously, cryptocurrency languished in a gray area which more often than not resulted in authorities seeking to block consumer access to associated businesses such as exchanges and information portals.\n\nAs Finance Magnates notes, Alpari is considered something of a “trendsetter” in forex markets, having previously wheeled out now-popular technologies ahead of the pack.', 'While the landscape for blockchain technology is still in its infancy, its potential is transformational and has led to entities across industries to experiment and embrace it. The ‘Big 4’ are no different. The four largest accounting firms in the world, dubbed as the Big 4, are active members of the blockchain revolution that’s all set to fundamentally change the way traditional services are offered and how businesses operate.\n\nHere’s how each of these firms is engaging with Bitcoin and the blockchain technology.\n\nDeloitte\n\nDeloitte uses the words ‘enigma,’ ‘paradox,’ and ‘opportunity’ for blockchain technology. In 2014, Deloitte launched Rubix—a blockchain offering that provides advisory services and builds distributed applications for clients across sectors, including the government.\n\nIn May 2016, Deloitte’s first blockchain lab was created in Dublin followed by a second hub in New York in January this year and more such announcements are expected. Deloitte joined the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) and the Hyperledger Project by the Linux Foundation in May 2017.\n\nOne of the very recent and interesting announcements has been the partnership of Deloitte CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) with Waves Platform for “providing clients with comprehensive initial coin offering (ICO) services and customized blockchain solutions tailored for specific business tasks.”\n\nThe two will also work towards legal mechanisms for regulating ICO projects, something which is much needed.\n\nDeloitte has been open to Bitcoin as well. To improve accessibility, enable hands-on learning—with a motive to push greater blockchain adoption in Canada--the company even installed an ATM in September 2016 at their downtown Toronto office. Bitcoin is also accepted as payment at its internal restaurant, called Bistro 1858.\n\nErnst & Young\n\nErnst & Young (EY) became the first advisory firm to accept Bitcoin for its services (at select locations). EY Switzerland clients now have the option to settle their invoices for auditing and advisory services using Bitcoin (since the start of 2017).\n\nMarcel Stalder, CEO of EY Switzerland, believes, “It is important to us that everybody gets on board and prepares themselves for the revolution set to take place in the business world through blockchains, smart contracts and digital currencies.” EY Switzerland showed further support to Bitcoin by joining the Bitcoin Association as a corporate member in May 2017.\n\nEY’s website reads ‘Blockchain technology is officially on the agenda,’ which conveys its commitment to the cause. Last year, it threw a start-up challenge to explore blockchain solutions for two industries—digital identity and energy trading.\n\nIn April 2017, EY launched Ops Chain, a set of applications and services to facilitate the commercial use of blockchain technology across the enterprise. It also added New York as the third location for its blockchain lab along with London and Thiruvananthapuram (India).\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) sees enormous potential for blockchain in financial services. To exploit and commercialize blockchain, PwC began by recruiting 15 leading technology specialists to set up a new global technology team in January 2016.\n\nSince then, PwC has collaborated with various enterprises—public and private—to push the applicability of the blockchain technology around the world.\n\nIn November 2016, PwC launched Vulcan Digital Asset Services to enable digital assets to be used for everyday banking, commerce and other personal currency and asset-related services in collaboration with Bloq, Libra, and Netki. On the other hand, as per a March announcement, PwC is exploring blockchain solutions with Alibaba and food industry stakeholders to address supply chain fraud and build trust in the food industry.\n\nIn its recent report, ‘Redrawing the lines: FinTech’s growing influence on financial services,’ PwC declares that ‘Blockchain is coming out of the lab.’ It highlights that over three quarters of global financial services companies plan to adopt blockchain in live production systems by 2020.\n\nKPMG\n\nIn September 2016, KPMG launched its Digital Ledger Services—a suite of services designed to help financial services companies realize the potential of blockchain. The Digital Ledger Service includes ‘full lifecycle support—from strategic qualification and business case development to relevant use-case development, systems and operations integration, and on-going management of a company’s blockchain infrastructure,’ according to KPMG. The blockchain initiative by KPMG is supported by Microsoft’s Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform.\n\nBuilding on their strategic partnership, KPMG and Microsoft (MSFT) launched joint Blockchain Nodes early 2017. These are designed to create and demonstrate use-cases that apply blockchain technology to business propositions and processes.\n\nFinal Word\n\nAlthough the possible applications of blockchain technology are vast, only time will tell how many of them will find a place in the real world. Despite the odds, the potential benefits that blockchain offers justifies the efforts and investment going into it.']"
07/06/2017,"['Two new high-profile price predictions put Bitcoin at $5,000 next year and $50,000 within ten years.\n\nIn a note to investment clients Wednesday, Bloomberg reports, “prolific stock picker” Ronnie Moas suggested $5,000 will be the 2018 Bitcoin price.\n\nIn the long term, he forecasts levels of $25,000 to $50,000 by 2027.\n\n“I have little doubt that one percent of the money in cash, bonds, stocks and gold will end up in cryptocurrencies,” Moas added.\n\nBullish sentiment on crypto from mainstream investors is nothing new this year, with multiple sources both inside and outside the cryptocurrency industry remaining similarly positive about Bitcoin’s future.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, which has also increasingly warmed to Bitcoin over the last two months, Moas meanwhile said the $5,000 price tag could happen sooner rather than later this year.\n\n“$5,000 could happen in a few months. It\'s only starting to gain traction right now,"" he told the network.\n\n""... This is not something I could keep my hands off of. What would be more painful than losing [money in cryptocurrencies] is not acting.""\n\nLast week, former New York Coin Center policy director Naomi Brockwell told CNBC host Charles Payne that Bitcoin was headed “to the moon” as banners suggested a possible Bitcoin price of both $1 mln and $1 bln.', 'South Korean lawmakers are preparing a set of bills to give cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, legal grounds in the country, a move aimed at protecting locals from potential risks in transactions.\n\nRep. Park Yong-jin of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea said on Monday that he would introduce three revisions in July to build a set of regulatory frameworks for digital currencies, according to a report by the Korea Herald.\n\nIn the proposal, Park noted the need to address “the void of a state-led protection that guarantees digital currency’s value,” “digital currency’s nonexchangablilty to other existing currencies” as well as “the possibility of wreaking havoc on national economy from digital currency bubble burst.”\n\nMore specifically, a new bill aimed at revising the Electronic Financial Transactions Act would require traders, brokers or other business entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions to get regulatory approval from the Financial Services Commission. Requirements would include the retention of capital of at least 500 million won (US$436,300) as well as data sufficient professional personnel and computer equipment.\n\nAdditionally, revisions to the laws on income and corporate taxes would allow financial authorities to prevent tax evasion from cryptocurrency transactions and impose capital gain tax on these transactions.\n\nMatt Newton, market analyst at eToro, a European brokerage firm that offers bitcoin and ether trading, welcomed the move, stating that the upcoming regulatory framework to regulate and legalize Bitcoin was “a significant move considering South Korea has been a global leader in Bitcoin purchases this year.”\n\n“The growing regulatory infrastructure around cryptocurrencies also helps protect investors from fraud and exchange failures, stabilizing the market – if not the price,” Newton said. “Price volatility in Bitcoin will continue, but as long as real-world adoption keeps gathering pace, the medium-term outlook is extremely positive.”\n\n“Future gains in the value of Bitcoin depend on the legitimization and adoption of the digital currency as an acceptable real-world medium of exchange, using it to pay for bills, groceries and remittances, thus increasing volumes and driving the asset price.”\n\nCryptocurrency trading in South Korea and Japan surged this year, as Japan regulators officially recognized cryptocurrencies as a legal payment method in March.\n\nJapan, which previously accounted for barely 1% of total bitcoin trading volume, is now the second largest market, representing over 30% of the world’s bitcoin trading volume.\n\nBitcoin trading against the South Korean won (KRW) is the fourth largest representing 8% of market share in front of the EUR at 5%, according to data from CryptoCompare.\n\nSouth Korea is the second largest market for ether trading. Ether trading against the KRW accounts for 27% of the world’s total ether trading activity, behind the USD at 31% and ahead of BTC at 23%.\n\nBithumb hacked\n\nThe news of an upcoming regulatory framework for cryptocurrency-related activity comes as Bithumb, the largest bitcoin and ether exchange platform in South Korea, recently lost billions of won in a hack.\n\nBithumb said it realized last week that one of its employees’ home personal computers was hacked. The breach is reported to have occurred in February but only discovered on June 29.\n\nThe exchange said it believes that personal data of 31,000 customers had been compromised, or 3% of Bithumb’s user base.\n\nThe state-run Korea Internet & Security Agency has teamed up with the Korea Communications Commission to investigate the hack, according to the Yonhap news agency.\n\nA local news outlet reported that one customer lost 1.2 billion won (US$1.04 million) in the hack.\n\nBithumb has promised to cover losses of up to 100,000 won (US$86) per customer, and to add to this once it has been able to verify individual losses.\n\nMore than 100 Bithumb customers have filed a complaint with the National Police Agency’s cybercrime report center and are preparing to launch a class action against the exchange.', 'Various sources including Mashable reported earlier today that the dark web marketplace could be pulling out an exit scam with the focus set on stealing user funds and Bitcoin.\n\nRumors emerged that AlphaBay, the world’s largest and most active dark web marketplace, purposely terminated its services and shut down its platform to obtain customer funds and execute an exit scam.\n\nAfter an abrupt termination of AlphaBay servers and marketplace, users expressed their frustrations and concerns over the security of their funds and requested the AlphaBay moderators to provide an official announcement regarding the status of user funds and the platform.\n\nAlphaBay not an exit scam, moderators respond\n\nAnalysts and researchers including Collin Crypto revealed that the AlphaBay moderators responded to the community’s growing criticisms and concerns. In various online communities including Reddit, AlphaBay moderators wrote:\n\n“AlphaBay is currently down. We are waiting for updates from AB admins. Don’t panic and don’t post any more threads telling that AlphaBay is down. Don’t get phished or scammed by fake vendors offering you direct deals. Wait patiently until we hear official updates from the staff rather than speculate.”\n\nMore to that, AlphaBay moderators noted that the AlphaBay platform would be restored soon. The platform went through various server updates and security updates in order to keep customer funds and the entire platform safe.\n\nAnother AlphaBay moderator wrote:\n\n“I have been in touch with our developers and admins and they are working to restore AlphaBay as soon as possible. As I have said before, during downtimes, there are added risks that you should understand and be weary of.”\n\nIn total, AlphaBay experienced a 27-hour downtime. However, both the community and developers of AlphaBay stated that the recovery of the platform and fixes for security flaws would make the AlphaBay platform more resilient to security issues in the future.\n\nUsers storing Bitcoin on AlphaBay\n\nAs previous Cointelegraph reports emphasized, it is not a viable option to store Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies on centralized and custodial platforms. Although users or vendors on AlphaBay could have been storing Bitcoin on the platform in order to execute deals and process payments more efficiently, for security purposes, it is never safe to store Bitcoin on custodial platforms.\n\nFor instance, the July 5 server downtime of AlphaBay could have locked customer funds for an indefinite amount of time. The moderators of AlphaBay did not immediately provide the community with an official announcement until various Reddit threads emerged, criticizing the platform and raising the possibility of an exit scam being executed by AlphaBay.\n\nAt the moment, users can be assured that their funds are safe, as said by the moderators of AlphaBay.', 'The attackers behind the NotPetya ransomware have emptied the Bitcoin wallet used to collect payments, and issued a new ransom demand.\n\nMotherboard reported that someone has moved tokens worth over $10,000 from the Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThey also sent two smaller payments of 0.01 BTC each to Pastebin and DeepPaste. At just under $30, it is the price of a Pastebin Lifetime Pro account.\n\nPosts then appeared on Pastebin and DeepPaste claiming to offer decryption of any hard drive hit by the NotPetya ransomware, excluding boot disks.\n\nThe hacker set the price at 100 Bitcoin – almost $260,000.\n\nThe BBC quoted experts who said the move appears to be a smokescreen to create a false trail for investigators to follow.\n\nThere is currently no reason to think it is possible to recover files encrypted by NotPetya, and its intention from the beginning was to destroy data – not ransom it.\n\nNow read: NotPetya is very different and much worse than WannaCry', 'LIMASSOL, Cyprus--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Contracts for difference for Bitcoin and Litecoin became available in Libertex trading platform to the European traders starting from July 6th, 2017. Now one can stake on either buying or selling of the cryptocurrencies.\n\nLibertex Business Development Manager Andew Nikolaev said: “Nowadays the interest in cryptocurrencies is very high, and the number of people intending to invest money into cryptocurrencies grows in geometric progression. Launch of the contracts for these instruments in Libertex will satisfy the demand from European traders.”\n\nOn the back of the Bitcoin legalization in Japan, the cost of the mentioned cryptocurrencies increased significantly reaching the record value of USD 2,800. At the same time both the amount of people staking on their surge and the amount of people staking on the crash increased.

RSI is also moving down so bitcoin might be due for another test of support around $2500.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nThe dollar took a hit against its peers in recent trading sessions as leading jobs indicators turned out weaker than expected. The ADP non-farm employment change reading, although considered a poor preview of the NFP, showed a smaller than expected gain and a downgrade in the previous report.\n\nAlso, the ISM non-manufacturing PMI signaled a drop in its jobs component, likely erasing the gains from the manufacturing part of the survey. The services sector accounts for a larger part of the economy, though, so this non-manufacturing component could carry more weight.\n\nAnalysts are expecting to see a 175K increase in hiring, larger than the previous 138K rise. Another miss in the NFP report could significantly dampen rate hike expectations for September or December, which might mean big losses for the dollar against bitcoin price. On the other hand, a very strong read could renew tightening expectations and lead to a dollar rally across the board.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The Security Agency, the internet watchdog in South Korea, is looking into the hack after customers complained they lost money.\n\nIn the Yonhap News report, the company said users’ passwords were not stolen. “The employee PC, not the head office server, was hacked. Personal information such as mobile phone and email address of some users were leaked. However, some customers were found to have been stolen from because of the disposable password used in electronic financial transactions,” Bithumb said in a statement regarding the cyberattack, noted the report.\n\nThe report also stated that some of the customers of the exchange fell victim to so-called voice phishing, a hacker attack in which someone will call them and claim to work for Bithumb and steal money from them.\n\nWith prices for certain cryptocurrencies surging in recent weeks, the digital currency is not only piquing the interest of investors, but also hackers, who see it as a new area in which to scam people out of their wealth and personal data.\n\nLate last month, GDAX, the digital currency exchange operated by Coinbase that saw the price of cryptocurrency Ethereum drop in a flash crash, announced it was reimbursing customers. The company said at the time it would reimburse customers who lost money when the cryptocurrency dropped from $320 to the low of $0.10. The price recovered quickly, but the speedy decline in the value of the digital currency forced traders to experience margin calls or stop-loss orders that resulted in steep losses. The exchange noted that it wouldn’t reverse any of the trades, so for those who bought the Ethereum cryptocurrency when it plummeted in the flash crash and made a profit when it rose will get to keep their profits.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

07/07/2017,"['Tom Lee, strategist at the firm Fundstrat, has released his estimate on the value of Bitcoin by 2022, CNBC reports.\n\nIn the next five years\n\nLee, an expert in market commodities and stock valuations, has made his estimate based on Bitcoin’s limited supply and market stabilization. He’s not the first to make such bullish predictions either. Ronnie Moas, the famous stock picker and strategist has also suggested substantial upside, even in the near term.\n\nWhat\'s driving the demand?\n\nLee believes that one of the main market drivers for Bitcoin is a cannibalizing of gold demand. As the economic situation continues to present concern for many investors, vehicles like Bitcoin can be a way to store value similar to gold and other precious metals.\n\nThe limitation on supply, as there can be no more than 21 million inherent units, and the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies make Bitcoin a safe harbor in times of economic uncertainty, according to Lee.\n\n""In other words, substantial upside exists in owning cryptocurrencies here”.\n\nLee did accept the reality that Bitcoin is wildly volatile, considering that the its annualized volatility is 75 percent, but also argued that gold had the same effect in the late 1970’s, saying, “gold\'s volatility approached 90% from 1971 to 1980 as the U.S. abandoned the gold standard — hence, we expect this to improve over time.""', 'A growing number of citizens living in economically and politically troubled countries are turning to Bitcoin and other digital curries, FOX News reports. Citizens of countries such as Venezuela and India have lost faith in their local currencies and seek refuge in the digital currencies such as Bitcoin, DASH and others, as their local currencies gradually decrease in value.\n\nConsumers looking for better value\n\nAccording to the Beach Price Index released by Travelbird, it showcases how currency fluctuations, political change affect the value for money of each destination.\n\nTotal Price = $ Sunscreen + $ Water + $ Beer + $ Ice-cream +$ Lunch\n\nTraditional currencies tend to fluctuate in value due to several factors that would then affect the exchange rates of the countries in question. Political and economic events also affect exchange rates of different countries which is why the prices of each beach would render a different total cost.\n\nAs holidaymakers and consumers seek better value for money, many have turned to cryptocurrencies to protect themselves from further effects of inflation and get better value for their money.\n\nBitcoin to beat inflation\n\nFinance experts believe that Bitcoin actually has the ability to beat inflation. For one, economics professor, Panos Mourdoukoutas, explains why Bitcoin has beat other investments such as stocks, bonds and in some ways, gold included:\n\n“Bitcoin has left stocks, bonds, and gold in the dust in 2016. The digital currency has more than tripled in value, while the S&P 500 and SPDR Gold Shares rose in upper single digits; and all three investments outperformed the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond, which declined in value. Then there are the renewed concerns over the break-up of trade wars, and the return of the old fiscal easing and huge budget deficits that feed into inflation, which undermines faith in national currencies.”\n\nThere are several reasons as to why Bitcoin can beat inflation, but the main reason is that it has the power to appreciate faster than the traditional currencies, especially the dollar. Inflation is an action that happens when the amount of dollars in circulation of the Global Reserve Currency increases.\n\nWith Bitcoin, it is possible not to have traditional fiat in circulation and potentially survive inflation imminent with traditional currencies.\n\nIf more establishments adopt Bitcoin as a payment method, it is possible for consumers to enjoy more stable pricing without having to undergo inflation that comes with most traditional currencies.', 'Pete Rizzo is the editor for CoinDesk, where he oversees content production for CoinDesk.com and CoinDesk research products. He previously served as editor for PYMNTS.com.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Rizzo discusses developments in bitcoin\'s scaling debate, adding color to the cast of characters involved in the hopes of highlighting essential parts of the disagreement at play.\n\n""Thermodynamic miracles... events with odds against so astronomical they\'re effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. I long to observe such a thing.""\n\n– Dr Manhattan, ""Watchmen""\n\nWhile much has been said about bitcoin, this discussion is not without its inherent problems.\n\nOne of the least addressed is the extent to which language itself has done disservice and damage to the development of what can only be considered a human technical achievement still struggling to be understood. Indeed, a great irony that has emerged with ""bitcoin"" is that a distributed system with so many intricate components can even be referred to in singularity at all.\n\nIt shouldn\'t be a surprise then that the idea that bitcoin can or should change the delicate balance of its protocol rules has been the biggest victim of limited vocabulary.\n\nShould bitcoin become a \'digital currency\' or \'digital gold\'? Should this choice be dictated by scientific analysis, or guided by strict interpretation of vision? Any choice of words creates biases that, owing to the system\'s distributed nature, are incapable of being broadly enforced.\n\nBitcoin as an idea is now owned by many real people, all with different backgrounds, who understand the technology in different ways, who have different wants owing to their specific positions related to the protocol and who have profited differently from these associations.\n\nWhat\'s clear now, however, is that at least three principal groups are capable of exercising power over that system – miners, entrepreneurs and developers – all of whom have different understandings of what ""bitcoin"" is and how they believe ""bitcoin"" should be. (Users, the fourth principal group, now seem caught on the sidelines in what can only be described as a power struggle that, at this point, has become entirely a game of human egos.)\n\nFueling the flames of the debate is a specific proposal stands to impact the balance of power between these parties, altering its ideological and sociological balance through technology.\n\nOrganized by investor Digital Currency Group and backed by miners and entrepreneurs, Segwit2x intends to enact Segregated Witness, a network optimization originally proposed by developers, before increasing bitcoin\'s hard-coded block size three months later.\n\nAs a political creation, it is a compromise of long-discussed compromises. But, while the code is a collection of pre-existing ideas, its enactment stands to be quite radical, impacting the system in a way that could, at the very least, reshape bitcoin\'s power structure, and at most, cause bitcoin to splinter into two.\n\nBut if it\'s true that language has impaired development and understanding of bitcoin, so too has it failed to properly categorize how stakeholders see themselves as players on a grand stage, writing a narrative with the ability, they believe, to impart lasting change on the world.\n\nThe following attempts to use – broad generalizations – to relay my experiences and interactions with the various constituents in the hope of explaining their positions and views on the scaling debate in aggregate, and how they relate to repercussions of the Segwit2x proposal.\n\nThe entrepreneurs\n\n""We can do so much more. We can save this world... with the right leadership."" – Ozymandias\n\nPerhaps the easiest group to understand are the entrepreneurs.\n\nOn the whole, they are young, Western, and libertarian. They are doers that prefer action, and (generally) believe in compromise over ideals.\n\nAmbitious founders, natural and charismatic leaders, they are public faces. They have been the subject of magazine articles, they have thousands of social media followers. They have spent years traveling around the globe extolling the virtues of a ""payment system"" that was truly different. That was limited today, yes, but ""capable of change"".\n\nTo them, the prolonged scaling debate has shaken an unspoken core belief, that everything in bitcoin was subject to revision, able to be made better by the other doers and thinkers that would doubtless follow their example.\n\n""Bitcoin is open source. Ten-minute confirmation times can be changed,"" 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan, then the stealth startup\'s chairman, declared in 2015.\n\nIt is likely that this argument was put forward in board rooms. To important people. Celebrities. Influencers. It was both true, and capable of not being true, though this latter complication was perhaps too easily discarded.\n\nI don\'t suppose it would be a stretch to assume that many bitcoin entrepreneurs have had a limited understanding of bitcoin as a technology not in theory, but in practice. While their notions are correct, they have also existed without being challenged by the complex human system of developers and miners that would enact it.\n\nMany seem to have considered the protocol an afterthought, assuming problems would be worked out in their favor and in the advancement of a definition of bitcoin as an open-source payment system that would create new business opportunities.\n\nThat a new philosophy would emerge that would argue that blockchains are protocols that would be unlikely to sustain a significant class of startups, wasn\'t foreseen, and doesn\'t seem to be something that is broadly acknowledged.\n\nIt\'s perhaps this last part that has the biggest impact on their relationship with developers, as extracting value from a system often necessities an intermediary role, one that developers now argue, from a scientific standpoint, might have meant to be eliminated.\n\nThe developers\n\n""Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise."" – Rorschach.\n\nWhat then of the developers? The open-source group often referred to as Bitcoin Core.\n\nThey prize idealism and patience. It was once told to me that new developers are trained in hours-long question-and-answer sessions that run through the night. The knowledge must pass down, drip by drip, to those who could expand their mind and attain it.\n\nThey are also elusive, stubborn in their views and guided by paranoia (though the latter is as much of a strength as a weakness). Not a small number use pseudonyms owing to the belief that bitcoin has successfully culled back human rights from what they perceive as the violence of centralized governments. Early to the software, they turned to bitcoin as an alternative to traditional money, an idea that could reshape society if steadily shepherded.\n\nI once asked two high-profile developers if they cared if they even lived to see bitcoin become what they envisioned. They seemed to think that this was unlikely, and didn\'t seem worse off for the realization.\n\nTo developers, the lack of ""progress"" on scaling is evidence bitcoin is withstanding human collusion. Any advancement that comes at the sake of practicality or a ""greater good"" is a perversion of the system, akin to using a dictator to save democracy.\n\nIt\'s perhaps not an understatement that their relationship with miners is challenging for similar reasons. To most bitcoin developers, miners have been chiefly an intellectual consideration. That is to say, they are considered insofar as they are necessary to the system as vital, but ultimately replaceable parts, of that system.\n\nThey believe that bitcoin derives security from computing power, but don\'t particularly care who provides it. Should one group seek to impose their will on the system, the laws of economics, they seem to think, will eventually bring along a more accommodating crowd.\n\nAs for the startups, there seems to be a lingering resentment between these camps – some have even gone so far as to label the prioritization of the needs of startups as an ""attack"" on the system itself.\n\nThe miners\n\n""I am tired of Earth. These people. I am tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives."" – Dr Manhattan\n\nIt\'s often understated just how amazing it is that bitcoin mining evolved the way it did, mutating quickly from a computer-based competition between individual users to an industry that supports three-to-four distinct and highly specialized business models.\n\nIf bitcoin miners have become barons with outsize influence on the network, even influence that was never intended, they sit on a throne of skulls. Miners outcompeted the world, produced chips faster at scale, filled data centers faster at scale and generally competed better in an industry so difficult that it is in a constant state of reinvention.\n\nBut miners are people. They are predominantly young, of Chinese descent and extraordinarily wealthy owing to the success of their businesses. Most have approached the scaling debate with all the enthusiasm of tag-alongs to a party who were suddenly asked to dictate the music. They were thrust into a situation they didn\'t quite understand (or understood very differently), one that has been exacerbated by cultural differences in governance and business etiquette.\n\nThe constant in-fighting and intellectual combat aren\'t things that they signed up for, or that they seem very interested in participating in. The common mood among them of late seems exasperation.\n\nAs for developers, it might be an understatement to say this is strained (some have gone so far as to call for the Core developers to be fired outright).\n\nWhatever goodwill that once existed has now mostly eroded through public displays of animosity, and the fact that for miners, there are plenty of other ways to make money through a diversified ecosystem of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets.\n\nThe monster\n\n""Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.""\n\nLeft alone, arguments would likely persist without action. However, the situation is now being shaped by the perception of external threat.\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, $90bn has been allocated to alternative cryptocurrencies, all but obliterating the narrative that bitcoin as a specific iteration of cryptocurrency could serve as the ""internet of money"". Once defended by its early lead and network effect, venture capital interest has now largely migrated to ethereum, which they believe is better facilitating this shift.\n\nIn the court of public opinion, investors have already eaten their words.\n\nFor bitcoin, this now poses a moral paradox with two visions at play. Developers seem to be arguing that the power of bitcoin lies in the ability of each and every user to validate the network\'s entire transaction history, and that no sacrifices should be made toward this end.\n\nNot doing so, they reason, is a return to the system of banking today, in which intermediaries are trusted with this role and users are powerless. It is not enough that a system would be faster or more convenient, and perhaps, more decentralized. It is not enough to sacrifice today what could be achieved, however theoretically, tomorrow. The process, they reason, must be slow, as this is the nature of scientific advancement.\n\nEntrepreneurs, however, hear the ticking of the doomsday clock (personified by their runways and business outlooks). The great cryptocurrency bubble, for them, is a necessary monster. Should it not exist, another would be created as a means of benefitting the ""greater good"" (as gauged by the health and success of their businesses in promoting bitcoin).\n\nMiners have already made their choice which of the two visions of the network with which to align. What\'s guiding this choice is less clear, though most, when pressured seem to suggest that they believe it will increase the value of bitcoin.\n\nHow a 2MB block size increase can compete with 1,000x ICO gains, or why an increasingly diversified cryptocurrency ecosystem does anything but strengthen bitcoin\'s value proposition, don\'t seem to be questions any are interested in answering.\n\nThe Ozymandias choice\n\n""In the end? Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends."" – Dr Manhattan\n\nSo, what to make now of this modern missile crisis?\n\nBitcoin scaling has so far been a game played across many continents. It is a muse for which thousands of hours have been spent in the composition of think pieces, proposals, arguments and all manner of human creations.\n\nIt has led the technology\'s best minds to plead and stomp and grind their fingernails into their palms, to vow to never come back to bitcoin again. But, they have always returned with new ideas, new enthusiasm and the promise of something better.\n\nWhat happens then if they go their separate ways?\n\nThe union of startups and miners would appear to be tenuous. What will happen when larger blocks push down opportunities for miners to collect fees? Or when the new developers can\'t match the track record of Bitcoin Core? A marriage of convenience doesn\'t necessarily make a lasting one.\n\nShould developers end up on their own blockchain, who will offer essential infrastructure to ensure the technology is broadly used? True to the idealism or not, many bitcoin users are customers of startups. Much of the narrative the public has consumed is influenced and informed by their success.\n\nDoubtless hard feelings have been inflamed by both sides.\n\nBut more than anything, it would seem any split or change in power would undermine the very thing bitcoin sought to provide to the economically disenfranchised – security. In an increasingly diverse crypto asset ecosystem, more and more devoid of rationality, it\'s hard to see the value in sacrificing what can only be achieved through continued unity.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which organized the Segwit2x proposal.\n\nWatchmen graffiti via Wikimedia\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The price of bitcoin and an ether token, for instance, have been on a tear and are up 121% and 490%, respectively, since April 6.\n\nEther tokens and bitcoin are built on a technology called blockchain. That\'s a kind of digital ledger that records and verifies transactions made on it.\n\nEther tokens, which power Ethereum blockchain, are newer to the crypto-scene than bitcoins, which can trace their origins back to 2009.\n\nMike McGovern, the new head of Investor Services Fintech Offerings at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, one of the oldest private banks in the US, thinks one blockchain is clearly superior.\n\n""When looking at bitcoin blockchain versus Ethereum, there\'s no doubt Ethereum is superior,"" McGovern told Business Insider in a recent phone interview.\n\nBrown Brothers Harriman has been working on blockchain for five years, according to McGovern. It started with an R&D center in Krakow, Poland.\n\nOne reason McGovern thinks Ethereum is better is because it\'s cheaper.\n\n""It doesn\'t cost as much to mine ether tokens, because it requires less electricity than bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nMcGovern\'s second reason relates to the original purpose of the two blockchains behind the currencies.\n\nBitcoin was designed to be a currency from the start. Ethereum\'s platform, however, was designed to allow people to write ""smart contracts"" and people have been using it to raise money online through DIY crowdfundings called ""Initial Coin Offerings.""\n\n""Ethereum is not only cheaper than bitcoin, it is also more robust and has more applications outside of simply financial transactions,"" McGovern said.\n\nHere\'s a handy explanation from Nathaniel Popper, a New York Times reporter and author of Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money:\n\n""Ethereum was designed to do much more than just serve as a digital money. The network of computers hooked into Ethereum can be harnessed to do computational work, essentially making it possible to run computer programs on the network, or what are referred to as decentralized applications, or Dapps. This has led to an enormous community of programmers working on the software.""\n\nMcGovern isn\'t the only person who is more bullish on Ethereum. A survey recently cited by Popper in The New York Times indicates that a lot of businesses are singing the same tune. Almost 94% of surveyed firms said they feel positive about the state of ether tokens. Only 49% of firms surveyed had a positive feeling about bitcoin.\n\nMGT Capital, the company run by John McAfee, is one such firm. It said it would start to mine Ethereum in its latest bid to turn a profit. ""We are more convinced each day of the growth and value of digital currencies, and our company is uniquely positioned to be a leading provider of processing power to relevant blockchains,"" McAfee said in a statement.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Bitcoin reached a huge new peak in value in June 2017, when one unit of the virtual currency was worth US$2,851 (£2,208), up from around US$600 just a year earlier. More than 10m people worldwide are now thought to own bitcoin and more than 100,000 merchants accept it for goods (not counting all those using it to sell drugs and other illegal items on the black market).\n\nPart of bitcoin’s appeal for many of its users is the lack of centralised control or regulation by any government or bank. Instead it relies on a technology known as blockchain to underpin and secure transactions. But research my colleagues and I have conducted suggests that the lack of any social trust in the way blockchain operates poses a challenge for bitcoin’s further spread.\n\nBlockchain is a public database that records digital transactions. These are validated by computers working within a worldwide network that solve complex coded problems. Whereas traditional bank transactions are authorised by financial institutions and controlled by governments through taxation and contracts between parties with known identities, blockchain is decentralised, unregulated and anonymous.\n\nIn our studies of blockchain’s users we found that these features appeal to bitcoin users because of increasing distrust of financial institutions and governments. The technology empowers people to regain control over their money, with no restrictions over where and when they can send it.\n\nBut our findings also indicate that two core aspects of blockchain’s design – the fact that transactions are anonymous and irreversible – pose significant challenges to the social trust among its users. Anonymity has an obvious appeal for people looking to avoid government control. And irreversible transactions were built into blockchain’s original design as a positive feature to address banks’ privilege of reversing transactions, even when the contract states that they were final.\n\nBut in practice, these features are a problem for many people. Most people are used to relying on the reputation of a seller to decide whether or not to buy from them – and the ability of the financial and legal system to help them if something goes wrong. But neither of these things are possible through blockchain.\n\nPaper trails have their advantages\n\nMost transactions don’t just involve moving bitcoin from one electronic wallet to another. In practice, they are often part of a larger, two-way transactions where both parties send and receive assets such as bitcoins, real world currency or physical goods.\n\nThe issue is that the blockchain only records the movement of bitcoin, not the movement of other currencies or goods. Because there is no authority to complain to, this raises a major risk that users could fall prey to dishonest traders who fail to deliver their side of the deal.\n\nShutterstock\n\nIn our latest study, we interviewed 20 bitcoin users recruited from five online groups from Malaysia, most of them with more than two years experience of using bitcoins. Our research indicates that more than 50% of participants would prefer blockchain’s transactions to be regulated and identifiable, so that transactions can be either reversed or the dishonest trader legally sanctioned.\n\nThis shows there is a tension between the freedom and empowerment of blockchain’s unregulated nature, and the lack of security that most people are accustomed to receiving from traditional financial institutions. If this is not addressed, such tension may limit the spread of bitcoin beyond its current base. It could even reduce the number of bitcoin users involved in such two-way transactions, as more people become aware of the risks of dishonest traders. In contrast, the use of blockchain for one-way transactions such as remittance payments will continue to grow, as they are less affected by dishonest traders.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nEven bitcoin’s current users still operate largely under the traditional mindset of centralised and regulated currencies. Bitcoin advocates may need to find ways to encourage users to develop a new mental approach to unregulated blockchain technology.\n\nBut developers could also build tools to address some of bitcoin users’ concerns. For example, there may be a way to record whether the real-world elements of bitcoin transactions are also verified, authorised and stored on the public ledger. Electronic wallets could be linked to a reputation file that users could view before agreeing to a deal, much like sites such as eBay allow consumers to rate sellers. And new mechanisms built on top of the irreversible blockchain protocol could enable individual two-way transactions to be reversed.\n\nWithout doing something to tackle these challenges, the very thing that caught people’s attention about bitcoin in the first place could end up stifling its growth and eventually consigning it to history.', 'One of the key points of contention in the politicization of Bitcoin protocol development over the past couple of years has been the concept of miner signaling. While not intended to be a vote among miners to decide the future of the Bitcoin network, Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo pointed out that miners are now using the signaling process as leverage in the discussion over Bitcoin scaling.\n\n\n\nLombrozo made the comments during a discussion with host Thomas Hunt and Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song on Hunt’s Mad Bitcoins YouTube channel.\n\n“This whole signaling thing is a huge problem that I think created a very terrible narrative,” said Lombrozo.\n\nWhat Is BIP 9?\n\nBIP 9 is a method of rolling out soft-fork upgrades to Bitcoin. The short description of this process is that soft-forked changes will be enabled once 95 percent of miners have signaled to the network that they are ready for activation, using a trick called “version bits.”\n\n“It was an arbitrary system created by developers in order to coordinate smooth soft-fork transitions,” said Lombrozo. “It was not designed to be a political system for voting on controversial issues ever — that was never the intention.”\n\nLombrozo also noted that, in the past, soft forks have been deployed on Bitcoin without any special treatment for miners, and BIP 9 was supposed to solve some of the issues miners could face during the deployment of a soft fork.\n\n“It was introduced for the courtesy of miners to be able to reduce their orphan rates and reduce the probability that they’re going to end up mining blocks that are actually invalid — that was the real motivation behind it,” said Lombrozo.\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, the goal is still to get nodes upgraded and enforce the rules of the soft fork; BIP 9 was simply a technique to coordinate with miners.\n\nThe Ciphrex CEO added that there was nothing like miner signaling in the original version of Bitcoin, and Satoshi Nakamoto never used miner signaling for the soft forks that he deployed on the network.\n\n“It was a mechanism that was created way later,” said Lombrozo. “And once this mechanism was created, it was abused and turned against the developers to try to extort stuff. And now it’s being used against businesses to extort stuff from them.”\n\nBIP 9 Does Not Work With Uncooperative Miners\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, BIP 9 would not have been used for Segregated Witness (SegWit) if the contributors to Bitcoin Core knew then what they know now.\n\n“If we considered that there had been this kind of, like, contentious or adversarial situation, then BIP 9 would not have been used,” said Lombrozo. “We would not have used the signaling mechanism because it obviously does not work under those kinds of circumstances.”\n\nIn Lombrozo’s view, miners are now using the effective veto power that comes with the miner signaling process outlined in BIP 9 as leverage in the discussions around scaling Bitcoin. He also believes Bitcoin Core developers may deserve some of the blame for using BIP 9 in the first place.\n\n“But at the same time, we only had the best of intentions at the moment,” added Lombrozo. “We thought we’d gotten through all these disagreements and it seemed like the miners were for it and going to support it … Obviously, the adversarial case needs to be considered because it’s just the nature of this network and the way that it works.”\n\nLombrozo suggested that miners also used miner signaling as a sort of “propaganda” tool with Bitcoin Unlimited, even though there was no activation mechanism included in the code.\n\nNever Use BIP 9 Again?\n\nAccording to Lombrozo, miners now think they have some control over the protocol due to the use of the miner signaling process outlined in BIP 9.\n\n“Miners started thinking, ‘Hey, maybe we have control over the protocol because of this whole signaling thing,’” said Lombrozo during his discussion with Hunt and Song.\n\nLombrozo claimed that “we’re never going to use BIP 9 to deploy anything almost for sure” if SegWit is not activated via the current BIP 9 deployment.\n\nAs an alternative, Bitcoin Core could turn to BIP 8, which is a variation of BIP 9 from pseudonymous developer Shaolin Fry that eventually activates a soft-forking change whether miners have signaled for it or not. Miners can still activate the change before it is automatically locked-in on the network, but approval from miners is not required before that lock-in takes place.\n\nWatch the full episode here:', 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

It has also developed into a popular destination for gamers and is building a strong anime/manga subculture.\n\nAkihabara attracts masses of tourists, as well as locals, to its high-tech electronic stores, but up until very recently, the electronic marketplace has only been accepting regular fiat currency. Now, there is a movement to integrate with high-tech digital currencies, as you would expect in a district that prides itself on technology and gadgetry.\n\nSuch a district would be predicted to be leading the mass adoption of digital currencies as a payment system, but in all honesty, it has been a slow take off in Akihabara.\n\nCurrently, there is only a small percentage of stores accepting Bitcoin, but there is rapid and recognizable growth.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nForging the way in Japan is BIC Camera stores, they opened doors in Akihabara this week and started accepting Bitcoin immediately using Bitflyer. Other early adopters include Ark Computer Store that takes Bitcoin as well as a local favorite, Monacoin.\n\nRetail stores are booming in their acceptance and adoption to Bitcoin with this week also seeing the retail giant in the country, Recruitment Lifestyle, confirming their Bitcoin-ready point of Sale app is ready to go in 260,000 stores.\n\nBitcoin’s use as a functioning currency is skyrocketing in Japan, and it is not just retail and technology stores. Property management firm Dualtrap, in the same district, also accepts Bitcoin through local exchange Coincheck.\n\nThere are restaurants in Akihabara, such as Au Tokyoite, which features Swiss cuisine, that accept the digital currency.\n\nBig in Japan\n\nThere is still a bit of feeling out and experimentation taking place in Japan in determining the best way in which to utilize Bitcoin in brick and mortar stores, with Coincheck the leaders thus far having built Recruitment Lifestyles payment app.\n\nHowever, many stores accept smart cards such as Suica and Pasmo, and the news is that there are plans in place for turning these smartcards into Bitcoin hardware wallets.', 'South Africa is slipping behind on regulating bitcoin — Vinny Lingham\n\nSilicon Valley based SA entrepreneur Vinny Lingham says South Africa is falling behind when it comes to regulating bitcoin.\n\n“I think we’re definitely behind the times. I mean Japan has just removed taxes on bitcoin yesterday. Singapore’s regulating it more, Australia etc as well. All these countries in the world are being very progressive on cryptocurrencies and whatever else and South Africa hasn’t issued any guidance on it yet,” said Lingham, in a Skype call with Ventureburn yesterday.\n\nLingham is the CEO of Civic which makes use of bitcoin and deploys cryptographic keys to allow for the secure storage of information on mobile phones or other devices.\n\nHe said the Reserve Bank could treat cryptocurrency as foreign exchange, by having certain caps in place.\n\n“I’m sure those concerns are there, we just need regulators to focus on making sure they understand what’s going on and how the rest of the world is responding, as opposed to saying ‘well it doesn’t conform to our view of the world and therefore we shouldn’t do anything about it’,” said Lingham.\n\n‘We just need regulators to focus on making sure they understand what’s going on’\n\nICO raised $33-million\n\nCommenting on Civic’s first Bitcoin Initial Coin Offering (ICO) the company held on June 21 to 28, Lingham said the company sold thousands of tokens and raised $33-million. Bitcoin is currently trading at over $2 500 a bitcoin.\n\n“There was basically at one point 50 000 people waiting in line trying to buy tokens from us. So it was quite a successful outcome,” said Lingham, adding that proceeds from the sale will count as revenue.\n\nHe said the final numbers must still be audited but he estimates about 10 000 people took part in the sale.\n\nCivic has created 1 billion tokens, of which 33% were made available for sale on June 21. A further 33% will be given away to companies and users, while the remaining 33% will remain with Civic.\n\n“If you look what’s happening in the whole cryptocurrency space right now ICOs and token sales have become quite the rage,” he added.\n\nLingham prefers to refer to the sale as a token sale, rather than an ICO. “An ICO is more when you issue a crypto coin. We actually did a token which sat just at the back of a bitcoin blockchain.”\n\nTo guard against any potential abuse from bitcoin holders, no one investee owns more than the equivalent of one percent of the network.\n\nHelp launch network\n\nLingham said the idea now is to build up a marketplace so that companies can connect to one another using the marketplace, adding that those who buy into the network are people who want to contribute to the network, typically through for example partnership deals.\n\n“So for example if a bank has information on you and you want to open up an account at a telco, the bank can validate who you are digitally using your phone. The telco can accept that information from the bank and you wouldn’t have to go through a process like Fica or Rica (South African financial and cellphone regulations, respectively) because the bank has already done that for you.\n\n“So you’re making that process reusable from one entity to another and then the bank needs to pay the smaller fee and they can monetise the information that you have just transferred across to the bank,” he said.\n\nPending announcement\n\nHe said Civic is available worldwide and that a number of organisations are signing up. “We’ve got a few running right now, but we’ve got a few big ones coming up.”\n\nCivic will in the next week or two make a full announcement on what major clients have signed up, he said, adding that currently the number of end-users is approaching 100 000.\n\nLingham said Civic, which launched last year and has so far received $5.75-million in seed funding, has hired two or three developers in Cape Town who are working remotely, following an announcement the company made in May that it would open a South African development office.\n\nRead more: Exclusive: Vinny Lingham to open Civic office in SA following IP rule changes', 'Former senior manager at management consultancy firm Bain & Co, Roberto Ponce Romay, has launched a Crypto Assets Fund (CAF) to attract investments from wealthy families in the Latin American region.\n\nThe fund initially aims to raise $50 million to purchase cryptocurrencies for family businesses. According to Romay, the fund will directly invest in digital currencies as Ripple, Ethereum, Zcash,Litecoin, Dash, and Bitcoin.\n\nAllowing diversification\n\nRomay said in an interview that the CAF will have two purposes, namely, to provide an investment platform to investors in some of the more unstable economies in the region to hedge their investments, and to offer an opportunity to know more about the various digital currencies as new stores of value and prospective investments in the future.\n\n""This fund is investor driven. It is a simple strategy to give access to a new way to invest.”\n\nThe British Virgin Islands-based CAF co-founders are David Garcia of Bitcoin payments startup company Ripio, and ARG Capital partner Miguel Iribarne.\n\nSince savings is no longer a smart option\n\nThe fund will allow new cryptocurrency asset investors to invest their money in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. The service will be free, but 30% of the carried interest will be taken by the fund based on certain criteria.\n\nAs of July 2017, Garcia and Iribarne are already soliciting money from registered family office investors in Latin American countries as Argentina and Costa Rica. Garcia banks on the fact that family investors in Latin America are looking for ways to earn more money, as well as a strategy to hedge against the less stable traditional fiat currencies.\n\n""Storing their savings in the local currency is not a smart option.”\n\nThe CAF funds will be held by Xapo, with over-the-counter trading services to be managed by B2C2 OTC, an electronic market maker, and a British Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-appointed representative.']"
07/08/2017,"['Against the expectations of most analysts, the cryptocurrency market recently experienced a minor correction once again, with the cryptocurrency market cap dipping below the $100 billion mark.\n\nAll of the top 25 cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and Ethereum Classic declined in value, with certain digital currencies such as Stratis, Golem and Siacoin recording over 20 percent drop in their market cap.\n\nStill, some analysts are predicting a short-term rise in bitcoin price amidst a significant rise in bitcoin hash rate, or computing power that fuels the bitcoin network and settles transactions.\n\nBitcoin & Markets, hosted by bitcoin researcher and economist Ansel Lindner, revealed that bitcoin hashrate jumped over 30 percent earlier this week, hinting the emergence of a breakout.\n\n“Bitcoin hashrate jumped over 30% in the last 24 hours. This confirms the price breakout in my opinion. Something big is happening. New hashrate subsiding. Maybe a warning shot across the bow. Estimated difficulty adjustment now 11% and falling,” reported the Bitcoin & Markets research team.\n\nBitcoin’s hash power represents the network’s overall security. An increasing amount of computing power allocated into the bitcoin network makes the network that much more secure and more difficult to centralize.\n\nOften, the rise in bitcoin’s hashrate is tied to major event or rise in confidence by miners and the community regarding a certain project. As Ivey Business School professor Jean-Philippe Vergne’s statement shared by BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp read:\n\n“We found that the best predictor of a cryptocurrency’s exchange rate is the amount of developer activity around it.”\n\nIn January of 2017, Vergne published a research article entitled “Buzz Factor or Innovation Potential: What Explains Cryptocurrencies’ Returns?” on the high-quality peer-reviewed journal Plos One. The article of Vergne actively investigated into the justification of the value of cryptocurrencies and certain measures that can be utilized to predict the price trend of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nInterestingly, Vergne and his team found that most mainstream media coverage on bitcoin negatively associated with returns, due to the extreme and inaccurate narratives certain media outlets have pushed throughout history.\n\n“By contrast, we find that the buzz surrounding cryptocurrencies is negatively associated with returns after controlling for a variety of factors, such as supply growth and liquidity. Also interesting is our finding that a cryptocurrency’s association with fraudulent activity is not negatively associated with weekly returns—a result that further qualifies the media’s influence on cryptocurrencies,” read the article.\n\nAccording to various analysts and experts including Vergne, three important key points to consider when evaluating the price trend of bitcoin are:\n\nRise in hash rate Development activity Media coverage\n\nSo far, mainstream media outlets have been offering bitcoin extensive and fair coverage on bitcoin, comparing bitcoin to reserve currencies such as the US dollar and precious metals including gold. An increasing number of mainstream media companies including CNBC and Wall Street Journal have begun to focus on reporting about the bitcoin industry, its companies, the growth of bitcoin, its user base and network.\n\nOn top of that, the hashrate of the bitcoin network has been rapidly increasing and developers have been collaborating to enable a viable scaling solution to further optimize the bitcoin network and lessen the cost of bitcoin transactions.\n\nIn consideration of the three abovementioned points, it seems evident that although bitcoin has been on a downward trend over the past few days, it is nearing a breakout.\n\nStill, some community members had other theories to explain the sudden jump in bitcon’s hashrate. Some claimed that miners against BIP 148 allocated all of their hash rate into the bitcoin network to influence the activation of Segwit2x, an activation mechanism that would activate Segwit and guarantee the execution of a 2MB hard fork.\n\nWhile that seems highly unlikely, it is important to consider any potential reasons that may influence the bitcoin network in any specific way.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price is heading towards a crucial break against the US Dollar, and for gains BTC/USD has to settle above $2600 in the near term.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price traded in a range above the $2400 handle against the US Dollar, and looking for a break.\n\nThere is a monster breakout pattern with support at $2420 forming on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nOn the upside, a break above the $2600 is needed for the price to gain bullish momentum.\n\nBitcoin price is heading towards a crucial break against the US Dollar, and for gains BTC/USD has to settle above $2600 in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Price Breakout Pattern\n\nThere were swing moves in Bitcoin price below the $2650 level against the US Dollar. The price was mostly seen struggling to gain traction above the $2650-2700 levels. It traded as high as $2623 where it faced sellers and started moving lower. It traded down and broke the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $2287 low to $2623 high. There was also a break below the 100 simple moving average (H4) and $2500.\n\nHowever, the price remained above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $2287 low to $2623 high and recovered. It is currently trading above the 100 SMA and $2500, but facing a major hurdle near $2550. There is a monster breakout pattern with support at $2420 forming on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. The breakout resistance is near $2550-2600. A close above $2600 is needed for buyers to gain momentum.\n\nOn the downside, the price must hold the triangle support at $2420-2400. A close below $2400 might be a short-term trend change and the price could slide back towards $2000. To sum up, we can keep monitoring the pattern and look for a break above $2600 or below $2400.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is attempting to move into the bullish zone.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $2400\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $2600\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Secondly, the market is still reacting to Bitmain’s threat tactics and the risk of a possible hard fork as retaliation for UASF. Ultimately Bitcoin is still up almost 150 percent YTD so I’m not concerned at all. Clearly, the fundamentals are strong and the demand is still increasing.""\n\n2013 revisited?\n\nIn June alone, the ecosystem experienced four brief market crunches which Cointelegraph nicknamed the Crypto Massacre. As this report was being filed, the markets were submerged in another sea of scarlet read. When Cointelegraph asked Marc whether the situation can lead to a revisit of 2013, where Bitcoin price fell dramatically, he disagreed entirely:\n\n""The price increase in 2013 was driven by the use of Bitcoin in darknet marketplaces like Silk Road and the majority of money that was invested was done so without an understanding of what Bitcoin is or how it could be used. The Bitcoin ecosystem today is substantially larger and more mature as a means of payment than ever before.""\n\nTime to buy more?\n\nMarc also holds that merchant adoption is at an all-time high and the ecosystem is seeing record amounts of daily transactions.\n\nMoreover, there is widespread mainstream interest in Bitcoin as a means of payment and there is a basic understanding of what it can do.\n\n""Simply put, more merchants accept it, more people use it and more people want it than ever before. The price increase is a correction of what was an undervalued price of Bitcoin,"" he maintained.\n\nHe urged the community to hold their Bitcoin and not to sell since the Bitcoin price will definitely go up soon.\n\n""As the first mover in the cryptocurrency space and the only coin that has an intended and proven use case as a Store of Value, Bitcoin is a clear hold for me,"" the publisher of Bitcoin Chaser remarked.\n\nHe further suggested now is the time to buy more for anyone that can. From his point of view, a $2,500 price tag may seem expensive to some today, but it’s going to look like a bargain a year from now.\n\nSpeculation pushed price\n\nMarc dissented the last Bitcoin price rally was influenced by speculation and explain that there is speculation in any currency market but that was not the main factor of the price increase. He argued that the price increase has been the catalyst for the speculation and not the other way around.\n\nHe says:\n\n""Since the Bitcoin Blockchain is transparent we can see the actual state of the network and its transactions. And it’s definitely growing. Despite the competition from other cryptocurrencies and the internal scaling debate issues, Bitcoin is being used more today by more people than it was a year ago. That’s network growth. Google searches for Bitcoin are at an all-time high and country after country is adding mass merchant support for payments in Bitcoin.""\n\nHe believes the world is starting to understand and accept Bitcoin as a successful payment method and that is what is driving the price up.', 'The recent meteoric rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led to the appearance of some unlikely millionaires. A recent interview by Forbes magazine shows just how powerful Bitcoin has been over the course of the past decade for those who invested early.\n\nThe interviewee, a former software engineer in Silicon Valley, asked to remain nameless. However, he did explain that he started purchasing Bitcoin in 2010 after doing some research. He decided that the purchase should be sizable enough to provide some real upside, should Bitcoin ever increase in value, and so he bought $3,000 worth, or, at the time, 20,000.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin price really started to jump, he made his first sale of 1,000 Bitcoin, netting him $2.6 mln. Since then, he’s quit his day job and now travels the world, flying first class and staying only in five-star resorts.\n\nAfter explaining his multiple sell-offs, and the $25 mln in profits he’s realized thus far, he explained that he sees Bitcoin values at $150,000 in the long term. “I really do think it will get there,” he says confidently, ""But a lot of governments and companies will have to be on board, first. No amount of speculation in the world will push it that high.”', 'In the race to build public blockchains empowered with self-executing code, at least two competing philosophies have emerged.\n\nEthereum has created a platform that makes it easy for developers to create nearly any type of smart contract that they want, while bitcoin has been added similar functionality at a much slower pace. But bitcoin developers like Lightning Network paper co-author Tadge Dryja argue there\'s a reason for adding smart contract functionality to bitcoin more cautiously.\n\nDuring his work on the transaction-boosting technology Lightning Network, which he has been working on more recently at MIT, he came up with a method of adding some smart contract functionality to bitcoin in a way that he believes could preserve both privacy and scalability.\n\nThe idea behind Dryja\'s Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) is to try to keep the blockchain more decentralized.\n\nDryja told CoinDesk:\n\n""It\'s privacy and scalability focused rather than functionality focused. It doesn\'t do, say, ICOs or Turing-complete contracts or anything like that, so in that sense it\'s more limited than what ethereum contracts can do.""\n\nWhile onlookers often see the two cryptocurrencies as competitors, Dryja went on to argue that his idea may just be more practical as an engineering option in the long term.\n\n""It has much lower impact on everyone else who uses the system, as the contracts take up very little [space] on the blockchain,"" he said.\n\nBitcoin oracles\n\nDryja\'s smart contract idea centers around a popular concept: oracles.\n\nSome of the more complex and interesting smart contracts, as proposed, need the help of an outside data source. Oracles feed that data to smart contracts, which then execute based on the data that they receive.\n\nSay that one user bets five ether that on Friday we will see over 80ºF weather. Two users set up a smart contract that specifies these conditions, and then select a data source that they both trust. (Maybe both users decide that theweather.com is the most trusted resource for timely temperature data.)\n\nNext, the smart contract receives information from this source automatically on Friday. Whoever guesses the correct temperature range wins the five ether. Simple, right?\n\nIdeas for how to do this in bitcoin already exist, but aren\'t widely used.\n\nDryja thinks that could be for a few reasons. One, these oracles need to be aware of users through the whole process, opening opportunities for the two to collude and game the system. Two, oracles will know which users are requesting data from them, which means that users that leverage the construction risk their privacy.\n\nSmart contract privacy\n\nThat\'s where Dryja\'s idea comes in. The interesting part is that the oracle operator can\'t see if anyone is using the data it sends out.\n\n""That\'s the lonely life of an oracle,"" he said. ""You can\'t even tell if there was even a contract even after it happens. So that\'s kind of fun.""\n\nHow does DLC accomplish that? At a high level, the oracle beams out data. (Say it sends out the temperature at a certain time each day.) This key will be mixed with data from the user before it is added to the blockchain.\n\nSince the oracle\'s key is mixed with data that the oracle doesn\'t know about, the oracle can\'t tell if it was ever used and added to the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n""We\'re going to combine the oracle\'s data with our own secret data, so we can recognize it but the oracle won’t recognize it,"" Dryja said.\n\nHe argued that the rationale for this level of privacy is that, more likely than not, companies using blockchain technologies don\'t want to reveal their financial records or a trail of the data they\'re using to the rest of the world.\n\nDLC, like the ethereum project Town Crier, proposes one way of shielding some of the data.\n\nOracle problems\n\nBesides privacy, oracles face some other tricky problems.\n\nIn general, oracles are trusted centralized services. Why does that matter? Remember, the smart contract is going to execute whether it\'s fed correct data or not. So, users need to ""trust"" that the service is sending reliable data.\n\nDevelopers have proposed different ways of dealing with this point of centralization. Decentralized prediction market Augur, for example, plans to use a number of oracles at once to report an outcome.\n\nDryja doesn\'t think there\'s a way of eradicating the problem completely, though he has a couple of ideas for at least ""mitigating"" it. DLC aims to incentivize oracles to report the correct information. If an oracle dishonestly broadcasts different information to two smart contracts, for example, then the oracle\'s private key will automatically be revealed.\n\n""Mathematically it works, but does it actually stop oracles from misreporting?"" he said, adding that it will take more review to find out how well the idea stands up.\n\nSegWit, please?\n\nThe idea is still a work in progress, but Dryja said that he\'s looking for more feedback from the community with the publication of a white paper on DLC.\n\nFor now, he hopes that his idea will help to inspire a new way of thinking about smart contracts; one that is more privacy and scalability focused. As far as next steps for the project, Dryja said that DLC will be his ""next fun project"" after he squares away some of the work he\'s doing on his version of the Lightning Network for MIT.\n\nHe noted that DLC does not require any changes to bitcoin, but it (like many others in the space) will work better when a coding optimization known as SegWit is activated on bitcoin – if it ever is.\n\nHe further said that it\'s possible to code up a version of DLC without SegWit, but it would be ""annoying"" to complete a version of the code that doesn\'t require SegWit\'s activation if SegWit is then activated soon after. So, he will likely wait for its activation to begin work on the project.\n\nTadge Dryja image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If you haven’t heard about the impending deadline for a “user-activated soft fork”, here’s the story:\n\nFor close to six years, the Bitcoin community has struggled to arrive at a consensus on how to scale the 1MB block size to meet growing popularity and adoption. A proposed user-activated soft fork (UASF) is an attempt to nudge the Bitcoin network to embrace and activate segregated witness (SegWit) — which some believe to be one of the most promising scaling solutions — by August 1.\n\nIn 2012, the network confirmed a daily average of 8,000 transactions. Today, that figure is around 350,000. Transaction overflow has resulted in high fees as users compete every 10 minutes for limited space in the Bitcoin block. The time it takes the network to confirm payments has also grown longer, at times going into hours.\n\nChoosing and implementing a scaling solution for a decentralized platform is difficult. Having no central decision-making body is a good thing, for the most part. It makes Bitcoin less susceptible to censorship or takeover.\n\nSegWit\n\nSeveral Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) have been developed to fix the scaling problem. They all require a slow consensus-building process within the community.\n\nBitcoin core developer Pieter Wuille first proposed SegWit in 2015 to solve issues unrelated to scaling. He wanted to fix transaction malleability, or the possibility of an attacker changing the identification details of a transaction before it confirmed.\n\nIt turned out that SegWit could also create about 60 percent more room in the Bitcoin block to accommodate more transactions. It would achieve this by storing signatures separately from other transaction data.\n\nDevelopers, business leaders, and miners present at the December 6, 2015 Hong Kong Bitcoin Scaling Conference signed a statement declaring a pursuit of SegWit as the first layer of scaling.\n\nSlow adoption\n\nA team of developers selected at the Hong Kong meeting released the SegWit code in October 2016. To activate, the code requires at least 95 percent of nodes to signal their support. Miners and nodes owners, however, have not been enthusiastic about SegWit. So far only 33 percent of about 7,500 nodes in the network are signalling support for it.\n\nOn February 25, an anonymous core developer who goes by the pseudonym Shaolinfry published the UASF as BIP148 on the Bitcoin-developer mailing list. He or she also released the corresponding code. The mission of the UASF was to nudge more miners and nodes to embrace SegWit and hasten its activation.\n\nMany who agree with Shaolinfry take the view that miners in particular lack the incentive to adopt SegWit. A full Bitcoin block guarantees them increased revenue in the form of the high fees users pay to speed transactions. It is therefore users who have the interest in pushing for a more efficient system.\n\nIndeed, some users are setting up new nodes specifically so they can use them to signal support for SegWit.\n\nSoft or hard fork\n\nEven though UASF carries the name “soft fork,” meaning a software upgrade that is compatible with the preceding version, it could turn into what is known as a hard fork. If half or more of the miners refuse to meet the demands of soft fork supporters, the upgrade could fail to recognize nodes that continue to run the older version. In the words of Cornell University computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer, “UASF is just the face saving name for a hard fork.”\n\nIndeed, any change to the core software is a hard fork if it alienates those in the network who don’t accept it, and it could therefore lead Bitcoin to split into two independent coins.\n\nThose who oppose a UASF believe SegWit provides only short-term relief. With fast-growing Bitcoin adoption, they believe the capacity created will soon fill up again and the problem will return.\n\nThey also believe those pushing for UASF and SegWit prefer a smaller block size so they can implement their own second-layer solutions.\n\nPreemptive step\n\nTo a majority of those who oppose UASF and SegWit, increasing or removing the cap on the block size is the only way to solve the scaling problem. Some also think UASF poses security risks to the network. Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell, for example, has said, “I do not think it is a horrible proposal: it is better engineered than many things that many altcoins do, but just not up to our normal standards.”\n\nIn the run-up to the potential fork in August, experts are advising users to protect their coins by making sure they use wallet services that support the UASF. A user could also set up a full node and signal for UASF as a way to protect their coins. Developer and blogger Jimmy Song:\n\n“[Users] supporting BIP-148 means they can support both forks when the UASF happens. There are really only economic benefits, not really economic penalties for supporting a BIP-148 fork other than some fixed costs. [Users] do not have to choose which software they run, they can run both and really, they should if they want to maximize their value.”\n\nOn June 17, Chinese miners representing 80 percent of the Bitcoin hash power issued a statement declaring support for SegWit. They’ve also expressed their intent to have the upgrade implemented in July. If the Bitcoin community can agree to adopt SegWit before August 1, there will be no need for UASF.\n\nThe Bitcoin price may drop because of possible contentious forks ahead, but if it does, it will likely recover once the deadline for the UASF passes and a resolution to the present uncertainty becomes more clear. And since investors will want to buy in prior to the recovery, it is also possible a drop won’t happen at all.\n\nRupert Hackett is general manager of Bitcoin.com.au, Bitcoin.co.uk (subsidiary of Bitcoin.com.au), and BuyaBitcoin.com.au.

Those who deal with foreign customers or buy from abroad, for example, were forced to turn to digital currencies which, right now, are in a gray area in the country.\n\nAccording to Der Standard, neither Western Union nor PayPal work in Venezuela. As such, people need to use platforms such as Cryptobuyer, a Venezuela-based cryptocurrency brokerage, which has over 10,000 registered users according to its co-founder Jorge Farias. He stated (translated statement):\n\n“The transaction takes a few minutes, our commission is three to seven percent lower than the banks, and our exchange rate is regulated by supply and demand, making it more realistic than the official”\n\nVenezuelan residents then use their bitcoins to, for example, acquire gift cards they can use in online marketplaces such as Amazon, effectively allowing them to purchase goods from abroad. Recently, Cryptobuyer set up a bitcoin ATM in Banistmo Bank, in Panama, which helps bitcoiners transfer cryptocurrencies to their relatives in Venezuela.\n\nBitcoin Still Unused by Most of the Population\n\nBitcoin is still a niche currency in the country, so much so that according to former president of the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce (FEDECAMARAS) Noel Alvarez, most of the population may still not have access to the cryptocurrency. He stated:\n\n“A maximum of one per cent of the population has access to it, but it is very useful in our situation, and I have had good experiences with it, but the volume is still far too small for major operations.”\n\nInvestors are still not convinced by digital currencies such as bitcoin and dash, despite them being a safe haven against government regulations and hyperinflation. One of the factors keeping cryptocurrency adoption from growing, according to the Austrian publication, is the fact that these currencies are ‘stored’ in people’s phones, and Venezuela is a country in which crime is fairly common.\n\nAlso read: Opinion: Venezuela Proves Bitcoin is the Future of Money\n\nMoreover, digital currencies aren’t regulated in the country, and Venezuela’s past bitcoin crackdown, in which the country’s state-owned internet service provider, CANTV, blocked bitcoin-related websites and mining pools, and the country’s biggest exchange, SurBitcoin, was forced to shut down operations after Banesco bank closed its account. A mining center was also taken down by authorities in Valencia in Carabobo state.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The Week of the Altcoins\n\nThis graph show how prices have changed since the midnight December 7th with prices at that point being rebased to 100\n\nPrices as of 11:59 PM UTC 13/12/17 (Source: coinmarketcap)\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen another week of volatility. Litecoin’s market cap has increased by over 200% as it becomes a popular alternative to bitcoin, as the latter has faced fears of increased regulation. XRP has also been riding the wave, seeing a 50% price hike from last week.\n\n1. Bitcoin Futures Live on Cboe\n\nThe Story\n\nPlans to launch bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange have gone ahead as contracts began trading at 23:00 GMT on Sunday. The contracts will allow investors to bet on the future value of bitcoin. On the news bitcoin’s price rose significantly.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThe contract allows individuals to bet on bitcoin’s price at a specified time in the future. Given bitcoin’s rise of over 1,000% this year, many investors are keen to get in on the action; CBOE’s Bitcoin futures contract will enable investors to do so without actually owning the cryptocurrency. Additionally, it will be possible to short sell the digital asset for the first time, allowing investors to profit from price falls.\n\nThe move suggests the cryptocurrency is now becoming a mainstream investment, however, Bitcoin remains to be traded on unregulated markets. Consequently, its price is likely to remain volatile.\n\nHigh Volatility\n\nIn an effort to ease volatility, the CBOE decided it would suspend trading for two minutes for price fluctuations of more than 10% and five minutes for more than 20%. In the contract’s first session, trading was stopped twice: once for two minutes and once for five minutes. While bitcoin remains traded on largely unregulated markets, it is questionable whether this policy will have any effect on the underlying cryptocurrency’s volatility.\n\nThe Future\n\nBloomberg’s Adam Haigh said the futures contracts was “an incremental step that allows Wall Street and indeed the professional finance community to make a bet either way on bitcoin.” The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is expected to list a similar contract next week, and Nasdaq has announced plans to host such trading too.\n\nLast week Revolut’s decision to facilitate the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could increase demand for the underlying asset.\n\nAllegations that 1,000 people own 40% of all bitcoins in circulation suggest its price could be manipulated by a relatively small number of individuals.\n\n2. 1,000 People Apparently Own 40% of Bitcoin\n\nThe Winklevoss twins invest $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. (Attribution: By cellanr [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Story\n\nRoughly 40% of the cryptocurrency is owned by 1,000 people, claims Aaron Brown, head of financial markets research at AQR Capital Management. In such an unregulated market, Brown said large holders of bitcoin could potentially be working together to orchestrate price changes. Given bitcoin’s recent spike, now could be a great opportunity for these users to part with a portion of their bitcoins, locking in the near 1600% price increase since the start of the year.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nBitcoin appears to be making its way into mainstream investing. Last Friday the US regulator gave the CME group and CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch bitcoin futures. Just yesterday, London-based digital banking company Revolut launched Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether trading for their users.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency becomes a more mainstream investment and demand for it rises, these bitcoin ‘whales’ will be able to part with their bitcoins for a hefty profit. This could leave new investors with an asset in the midst of a bubble.\n\nRoger Ver, a well known early adopter of bitcoin said, regarding ‘whales’ working together, “I suspect that is likely true, and people should be able to do whatever they want with their own money.”\n\nWhile the question of whether Brown’s allegation is true must be approached with scepticism, there is evidence of some very large investors in the space. Bloomberg recently reported that on November 12th, “someone moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, worth about $159 million at the time, to an online exchange.” Bitcoin’s market cap is roughly $270bn at the time of writing, but if this investor was to sell on a single exchange, it could potentially crash the market.\n\nLarge Bitcoin Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who gained fame for attempting to take control of Facebook, invested $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. This amount has many times over.\n\nTim Draper, a billionaire venture capitalist best known for his investment in Skype – during the companies early days – bought 30,000 bitcoins back in 2014. He has since invested in Tezos’ ICO.\n\nBarry Silbert, the founder of the Digital Currency Group, picked up 48,000 bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was worth $350 a piece.\n\n3. Ethereum Wallet Scam Closed Down\n\nThe Story\n\nDigital wallet provider myetherwallet.com announced yesterday that it had no affiliation with an iOS-based cryptocurrency wallet app using its name. The app, which became the third most popular on the finance section of the App Store, allows users to import and open a digital wallet to store ether. Fake digital wallets could lose investors their cryptocurrencies permanently, so it is important investors (and app stores) keep an eye out for scams.\n\nSecurity and Ethereum\n\nIn July, a developer error on the ethereum network meant a hacker pocket $31m worth of ether. While the technology is still in its infancy mistakes are bound to be made. However, several digital wallet hacks have emerged since cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and users need to take security seriously while safeguards are not in place.\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies security, the owness is with the users. Sending ether from a digital wallet means I am responsible for my transfers. If I make a mistake when typing in the amount, or address of the receiver, I cannot call my bank and ask them to void the transaction. Consequently, user’s wallets are being targeted by scammers.\n\nSo far there have been no reports that the fake wallet stole from anyone. The company may have simply used the name for its familiarity in the ethereum community.\n\nMyetherwallet.com have since announced the removal of the app from the iOS store.\n\n4. San Francisco ICO Closed Down by SEC\n\nThe Story\n\nSan Francisco-based restaurant reviewing app Munchee has been forced to stop its initial coin offering (ICO) and reimburse investors after regulators raised concerns over the company’s tokens not meeting securities regulations. Munchee was looking to obtain $15m to “improve an existing iPhone app centred on restaurant meal reviews and create an “ecosystem” in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens,” according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHowever, “in the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasized that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens,” they added. The regulator felt investors were led to believe they would gain a return on their tokens, however, the tokens did not meet the authority’s standards. The company was not fined due to its quick response to the SEC’s requests.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nLast week PlexCoin’s founders were charged with defrauding investors. This was the first time the SEC’s newly established Cyber Unit filed charges. The regulator issued a statement back in July saying ICOs will be subject to US security laws.\n\nBoth cases suggest a serious commitment to ensuring investors are not mis-sold securities, particularly in the ICO space.\n\n5. Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Not A Substitute for Gold\n\nSource: Tradingeconomics.com\n\nThe Story\n\nThe simultaneous rise of bitcoin and relatively poor performance of gold has provoked many to ask whether the two assets are in competition. The short answer is no, they are not.\n\n“Bitcoin has real potential, if it were to become digital gold it might have tremendous space to grow,” said Gabor Gurbacs, Vaneck Securities Director of Digital Asset Strategy. It is this sentiment which has put the two in contest. However, the investor pool for each is “vastly different”, according to Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.\n\nGold based exchange-traded funds are currently at close to their highest since May 2013, suggesting the metal remains part of investor’s portfolios, and not that investors have not cashed out and moved over to bitcoin. The reason this is not the case lies in comparing the function each asset serves and the investors it attracts.\n\nComparing Bitcoin and Gold\n\nBitcoin attracts more speculative investors looking for quick returns, while gold is often held as a portion of investment portfolios to spread risk. In times of economic downturn gold tends to go up in price, balancing any losses from stocks and bonds. The two assets currently serve distinct purposes. Consequently, bitcoin’s price rise is unlikely to have turned investors away from gold.\n\n6. Jamie Dimon Eases Hostility Towards Bitcoin After Futures Contracts Go Live\n\nSource: By Steve Jurvetson (Flickr: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Story\n\nSource: CNBC\n\n“I remain highly skeptical of it,” said JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon, when recently asked about bitcoin. “I’m open-minded to uses of cryptocurrency if properly controlled and regulated,” Dimon added. The executive, who famously called bitcoin a “fraud” appears to have softened his opinion just days after the bitcoin-based futures derivative began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThis is the first time Dimon has spoken about bitcoin for two months. The timing of Dimon’s comments might suggest JPMorgan will offer the bitcoin derivative to its clients. The contract would allow clients to take long or short positions on bitcoin’s price.\n\nSimilar contracts will trade on the CME and Nasdaq exchanges in the near future.\n\n7. Cryptocurrency as Collateral for Loans\n\nThe Story\n\nA growing number of early cryptocurrency adopters, who have seen astronomical gains, will now be able to use their cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans. London-based Nebeus is helping third-party lenders create loans guaranteed by cryptocurrency collateral. The company created 100 of these loans on its first day and has made 1,000 more since says Nebeus’ Managing Director Konstantin Zaripov.\n\nGiven bitcoin’s market cap of almost $300bn, and a total cryptocurrency market cap of over $500bn, the market for these loans could be colossal. However, some worry that these assets are in a bubble, and their collapse makes these loans hugely risky for lenders.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nAround 40% of all bitcoins are held by 1,000 people, Bloomberg reported last week. Prior to this innovation, these users would only be able to cash in on their gains by selling their cryptocurrencies. “I can see a lending industry in the tens of billions of dollars,” said Aaron Brown, former managing director at AQR Capital Management.\n\nThe loans could attract attention from cryptocurrency miners, who earn tokens for processing blockchain network transactions. This group are typically ideologically attached to the idea of decentralised currencies, and such loans could allow them to hold on to their cryptocurrencies while they cover their overheads.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s 1700% rise since the start of the year has caused many to stay clear. A collapse of these digital assets would leave lenders in a tough position.\n\nMust Read Articles\n\nBitcoin, Ripple and Cryptocurrencies: Here to Stay and Prosper\n\nIt is nigh on impossible to observe financial news without hearing about the rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which recently surpassed the $15,000 mark and is continuously setting new all-time highs. ..

It was made public on July 4.\n\nThe report\'s authors argued that technological limitations – a lack of expertise especially – is behind the apparent low usage rates.\n\nThey concluded:\n\n""Few investigations have been conducted on virtual currencies which seem to be rarely used by criminal organizations.

07/09/2017,"['Have you heard about the next big thing in investing? No, it\'s not legal marijuana, albeit pot stocks have been nothing short of unstoppable over the past year.\n\nIt\'s actually digital currency bitcoin, which has risen by nearly 900% over the trailing-two-year period. What once cost a consumer or investor around $255 per bitcoin will now set you back around $2,500.\n\nWhy have digital cryptocurrencies like bitcoin been such a hot commodity of late? It appears to be a confluence of catalysts that have accelerated momentum behind bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies.\n\nWhy bitcoin has risen nearly 900% in two years\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are relishing in newfound media coverage. Between the sheer outperformance of these digital currencies compared to the broader stock market, to recent ransomware attacks (e.g., WannaCry) where the perpetrators demand payment in bitcoin in order to ""unlock"" a computer, bitcoin is in the spotlight.\n\nThe more media coverage it receives, the more interest there will likely be in this burgeoning payment and investment platform.\n\nWeakness in the world\'s most prominent currency, the U.S. dollar, may be helping as well. President Trump has, on numerous occasions, proclaimed the U.S. dollar to be too strong. A weaker dollar can help promote the export of American goods, but U.S. consumers aren\'t typically huge fans of seeing their currency weakened.\n\nSome investors have used the dollar\'s weakness as an opportunity to invest in bitcoin, which is a ""finite"" resource since the maximum number of bitcoin is limited to 21 million. The fact that the dollar\'s monetary base can be expanded infinitely and bitcoin is limited provides the belief to some investors that bitcoin could be a better means to preserve and grow wealth over time.\n\nBitcoin has also benefited from a growing acceptance of the currency by countries, industries, and businesses. Japan declared the cryptocurrency legal tender earlier this year, while some retailers within the marijuana industry have been using bitcoin as a bridge currency between bank-issued debit and credit cards and marijuana product purchases.\n\nSince marijuana is a federally illegal substance, most banks won\'t deal with pot-based businesses, so bitcoin services act as an intermediary by allowing consumers to buy bitcoin and pay for their pot products that way. Bitcoin services then transfer that bitcoin back to cash for the marijuana business in return for a nominal service charge.\n\nBrand-name businesses that surprisingly accept bitcoin\n\nYet what might be most surprising is just how many brand-name businesses are now accepting bitcoin as payment. Here are five businesses that have welcomed bitcoin with open arms.', 'It should come as no surprise that the executives at the top of the banking world are taking notice of cryptocurrencies and the power and success of Blockchain-based financial models.\n\nOne such executive is Mike McGovern, the new head of Investor Services Fintech Offerings at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, among America’s oldest private banks.\n\nMcGovern said,\n\n""When looking at Bitcoin Blockchain versus Ethereum, there\'s no doubt Ethereum is superior. It doesn\'t cost as much to mine Ether tokens because it requires less electricity than Bitcoin. Ethereum is not only cheaper than Bitcoin, it is also more robust and has more applications outside of simply financial transactions such as represent virtual shares, assets, proof of membership, and more..”\n\nMcGovern’s comments are also reflective of the bank’s financial decisions, as they have been following and investing in Ethereum over the past five years. Other capital companies are doing the same, like MGT Capital who has begun mining Ethereum for profit.\n\nEthereum has maintained it’s price point with Bitcoin, even though the volatility has increased over the past month. In spite of price fluctuations and some apparently nefarious trading, the cryptocurrency continues to maintain its popularity.', 'The former CEO of collapsed Bitcoin exchange MtGox will soon head to trial in Tokyo on charges stemming from the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the virtual currency from its digital vaults.\n\nFrenchman Mark Karpeles - once the high-flying head of the world’s busiest Bitcoin trading platform, who reportedly lived in a US$11,000-a-month penthouse and spent money lavishly, including on prostitutes - is facing embezzlement and data manipulation charges.\n\n“He is keeping calm as the trial gets underway,” his lawyer Kiichi Iino said, adding that Karpeles plans to plead his innocence.\n\nThe 32-year-old was first arrested in August 2015 and released on bail nearly a year later over allegations he fraudulently manipulated data and pocketed millions worth of Bitcoins.\n\nMtGox, which claimed it once hosted around 80 per cent of global Bitcoin trading, shuttered in 2014 after admitting that 850,000 coins - worth around US$480 million at the time - had disappeared from its vaults.\n\nThe company initially said there was a bug in the software underpinning Bitcoins that allowed hackers to pilfer them.\n\nKarpeles later claimed he had found some 200,000 of the lost coins in a “cold wallet” - a storage device, such as a memory stick, that is not connected to other computers.\n\nTokyo-based MtGox filed for bankruptcy protection soon after the cyber-money went missing, leaving a trail of angry investors calling for answers and denting the virtual currency’s reputation.\n\nKarpeles, who said he is working as an IT consultant, is active on social media and has commented on issues concerning Bitcoin but not on details of his criminal case.\n\n“The charges (against Karpeles) only cover a subset of the issues which were happening at MtGox, so I don’t expect that we will find out most of the information we want to know,” said Kolin Burges, a British investor who said he lost several hundred Bitcoins in the MtGox collapse.\n\n“I’ve not had any back yet but hopefully, eventually all the creditors will get a small percentage of their money back from the bankruptcy distribution,” he said.\n\nAround the time of his 2015 arrest, Karpeles’ mother told Japan’s top-selling Yomiuri newspaper that her son was a “genius” who learned computer languages at age three and started making simple programs by the time he was five.\n\nIn 2006, Karpeles wrote on his blog that computer crime was “totally contrary to my ethical principles”.\n\nBut four years later, a Paris court sentenced him in absentia to a year in prison for hacking. He had come to Japan to work for a web development company around 2009 and later got involved with the Bitcoin exchange.\n\nIn the wake of the MtGox scandal, Japan passed a bill stipulating that all virtual currency exchanges must be regulated by its Financial Services Agency.\n\nVirtual currencies are generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the world, and are not backed by any government or central bank, unlike traditional currencies.\n\nBitcoin has suffered hacking incidents including one last year in which a major Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex suspended trading after $65 million in the virtual unit was stolen.\n\nDespite the demise of MtGox and concerns about security, Bitcoin and hundreds of rival digital currencies are becoming increasingly popular and accepted by merchants worldwide.\n\nBitcoin remains the most popular. Its market value has ballooned to more than $42.9 billion, according to the website coinmarketcap.com.\n\nThe unit has seen wild volatility during its short life, soaring from just a few US cents to around $2,500 now, more than double its value just a few months ago.\n\nBackers say virtual currencies offer an efficient and anonymous way to store and transfer funds online.\n\nCritics argue the lack of legal framework governing the currency, the opaque way it is traded and its volatility make it dangerous.\n\nBitcoin’s reputation was damaged when US authorities seized funds as part of an investigation into the online black market Silk Road.', 'Bitcoin $55,000? Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, one of the biggest equity bears among the major Wall Street strategists, says it’s possible, but not necessarily for the reasons many bitcoin bulls have suggested.\n\n“One of the drivers is crypto-currencies are cannibalizing demand for gold US:GCQ7 ” Lee wrote in a report. “Based on our model, we estimate that bitcoin’s value per unit could be $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022 — hence, investors need to identify strategies to leverage this potential rise in crypto-currencies.”\n\nThat’s a major jump from the $2,530 level that bitcoin BTCUSD, +6.57% fetched recently. Of course, this would be on top of what’s already been an impressive stretch, with the price more than doubling since the start of the year.\n\nLee predicts investors will look to bitcoin as a gold substitute, and the fact that the amount of available bitcoin is reaching its limit makes this supply/demand story even more compelling for those looking to turn profits in the crypto market.\n\n“Bitcoin supply will grow even slower than gold,” Lee said. “Hence, the scarcity of bitcoin is becoming increasingly attractive relative to gold.”\n\nAnother driver could come from central banks, which he expects will consider buying bitcoin if the total market cap hits $500 billion.\n\n“This is a game changer, enhancing the legitimacy of the currency and likely accelerating the substitution for gold,” Lee wrote.\n\nThe trick is that there aren’t very many ways to play bitcoin, other than via direct investment or the bitcoin ETF GBTC, +1.71% he said, adding that “we will identify other opportunities in the future.”', 'Bitcoin has essentially remained flat for the week, and it is no coincidence that price action has slowed as a protocol altering event, UASF/BIP148 approaches. The spot price appears stuck in heavy triangular consolidation. Traders will note the descending volume profile, and expect a heavy spike in volume upon resolution of the consolidation.\n\nThe Bitcoin network hash rate briefly spiked above 6 trillion GH/s after the last difficulty adjustment on July 2nd, and has moved lower in recent days. There has been a subsequent -0.43% difficulty adjustment, the first negative adjustment since October 22nd, 2016.\n\nThe number of nodes signaling support for a UASF continues to rise. Currently, 17% of core nodes are signaling their support, leading up to activation on August 1st.\n\nThe SegWit2x beta was released on June 30th by Jeff Garzik. Luke DashJr, a bitcoin core developer who did not contribute to SegWit2x, described the entire project as a tactic to “try to stall SegWit longer” in his recent Medium post. The other core developers remain staunchly opposed to SegWit2x. Mining pools continue to strongly support SegWit2x. The code itself remains largely untested, and the community largely unprepared for a hard fork, but ready for SegWit.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nSymmetrical triangular consolidations, in an already established trend, typically represent continuation via re-accumulation, and are known as pennants. This is a key pillar of Wyckoffian logic known as mark up.\n\nHowever, until the direction of the breakout is clear, and due to the proximity of the UASF on August 1st, it is important to have a road map for various outcomes. Consolidation of this duration does not resolve in slow small moves, it typically resolves in large explosive moves. Below, I present evidence for both a bullish and bearish resolution.\n\nI use Bollinger Bands to help determine when a post-consolidation move will happen, not necessarily the direction. The Bands represent one standard above and below the average price over the selected period, with the default being 20. A squeeze in the Bands represents price compression.\n\nTypically, if price remains above the median during the squeeze, this forecasts a bullish resolution, and if price remains below the median during the squeeze, this forecasts a bearish resolution. As was the case prior to the Bitfinex hack.\n\nThere are also scenarios which Bollinger calls “Head Fakes,” which are essentially fake breakouts in the opposite direction of the eventual resolution. One such head fake occurred after the 200+ day consolidation in May 2016, on low volume.\n\nI mention this because it is something to watch for in the current triangle consolidation. The Bands on the daily timeframe, with the current price and using the same settings as the two above examples, are not nearly as compressed. This suggests further compression may be needed until resolution. There is however a definite bearish bias due to the position of price relative to the median line (red).\n\nThe Bull Scenarios\n\nThe Ichimoku Cloud is a constant, auto-drawn indicator which quickly offers an immense amount of valuable information on any time frame. The Cloud is best used at higher time frames as more data generally provides more accurate signals and less false positives.\n\nThe indicator uses moving averages and dynamic support and resistance to make projections of key zones, as well as capturing 80% of any given trend. As long as the price remains above the Cloud, sentiment remains bullish. Price in the Cloud indicates a neutral trend, and below the Cloud indicates a bearish trend.\n\nWhen the Tenkan (T) is over the Kijun (K) sentiment is bullish. K over T would indicate bearish sentiment. When the Lagging Span (LS) is above the Cloud and above the price sentiment is bullish, below the Cloud and price would indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nThe best entry signals for the Cloud occur when the trend is obvious, but 1 or 2 of the signals have yet to become confluent with a higher time frame trend. The current bullish entry signal I’m watching is the TK recross on the daily timeframe Ichimoku Cloud using the 10/20/60/30 settings. I typically use 20/60/120/30, but if price volatility has creeped to a halt I prefer faster signals.\n\nThe prior TK recrosses using these settings have been near the relative bottom of their respective trends. However, the TK recross prior to the Bitfinex hack, during a triangular consolidation period, did not resolve bullish.\n\nThe first target for any TA setup should always include Fibonacci Extensions 1.272 and 1.618. From high to extreme low, this yields targets of $3550 and $4300.\n\nShould the current consolidation resolve as a bull pennant, targets would be the measured move of the pole upwards as well as the 1.618 Fib Extension of the consolidation. This yields a resistance zone of $3400-3600. Note the the pole measurement and fibs here are conservative in contrast to the large capture Fib Extension zones on the above chart.\n\nUnlikely, but worth mentioning, is a long standing Cup and Handle with targets of $4800-5100 based on the fib extension and measured move respectively.\n\nAlthough the resolved Inverted Head and Shoulders never materialized, the target remains at $3200.\n\nThe Pitchfork is showing strong support at the 0.75 diagonal. The median line (red) of the Pitchfork gives the expected mean of the trend. Price will continually attempt to return to this diagonal. Each diagonal of the Pitchfork can be thought of as a potential reversal zone or support/resistance line. The upper yellow diagonal zone being ‘most overbought,’ or the top bounds of the trend, and lower yellow diagonal zone being ‘most oversold,’ or the bottom bounds of the trend.\n\nA rise to the median line would yield a target between $2900-3100, which is essentially the current all-time high.\n\nThe Bear Scenarios\n\nBesides the above mentioned Bollinger Band break down, there is also a bearish entry signal known as an Edge to Edge trade (yellow). Should price close in the cloud, there is a high likelihood that price reaches the other end of the cloud at the very minimum.\n\nThere was a similar setup for this prior to the Bitfinex hack which resulted in a touch of the 200EMA.\n\nWhile the following signals are not outright bearish, they do represent support targets. Firstly, price has never closed below the weekly timeframe Kijun or the daily 200EMA for the entire trend.\n\nSecondly, price has also not touched the Median Line of the longstanding bullish Pitchfork for quite some time. A dip this low, back to previous All Time Highs, would be considered mean reversion and is currently unlikely. This would likely be the ultimate bearish destination should price be unable to recover higher.\n\nLastly, the yearly Pivots will also be important support zones with the R3 pivot being a likely immediate target should price break down.\n\nConclusion\n\nPrice is nearing the end of a heavy period of consolidation just as SegWit is to be activated on August 1st. I expect heavy volatility for both of these reasons. The technical indicators are showing several resistance targets above $3200. Further analysis shows a confluence of support around $1700-1800.', 'After the boom and bust and boom of bitcoin, where some lost millions on discarded drives and others found forgotten wallets with enough to buy a flats in Oslo, the next big thing in the cryptocurrency is here to generate millions of pounds for the lucky few brave enough to invest: the initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nIf you hang out in cryptocurrency circles, you’re used to hearing conventional wisdom being questioned. After all, the sector was born out of the idea that orthodox economics is bunk. From there, there’s nowhere to go but up.\n\nIt’s no wonder Initial Public Offerings are being rethought. They’re too bound up in regulation, too late in a company’s life-cycle and too expensive to pull off to be really useful for a startup. They’re a great way of returning capital to investors, but not for funding your blockchain-based business idea.\n\nEnter the ICO. They’re essentially crowdfunding campaigns for cryptocurrency startups, these days almost always based on the Ethereum platform – a bitcoin spinoff which lets users build distributed businesses all plugged into the same blockchain. The startup’s developer sets the currency up so that a significant batch of initial coins are allocated to them, which they then auction off to investors who want to get in on the ground floor.\n\nOften the only chance of a return is if the value of the coins goes up, but with the examples of bitcoin (increase in value over the past 12 months: 410%) and Ethereum (increase in value: 4,000%) behind them, a lot of investors are prepared to speculate. If the platform takes off, those coins are going to rise in value, and they can cash in.\n\nSome startups take a more complex route, and offer tokens that guarantee the holder a share of the return on the platform – in effect, cryptographically guaranteed equity. A dark web market, for instance, can fairly easily charge transaction fees which are automatically split amongst the holders of its equity tokens.\n\n\n\nHowever they’re run, ICOs are big business. Ethereum itself was launched with a sale that netted 31,591 bitcoin (then around $18.5m) in exchange for its first 60m ether tokens. It’s since been outdone by at least 10 other ICOs run on Ethereum alone, including the Basic Attention Token used for tracking-free advertising on the Brave adblocking browser ($35m raised), the MobileGo token used in a cryptocurrency-based video game marketplace ($26m raised), and the Bancor Network Token, which backs a platform designed to make it easier for users to make and launch their own blockchain tokens ($152.3m raised).\n\nOf course, the risks for investors are sizeable. Despite the name, an ICO doesn’t share a lot of similarities with an IPO. Increasingly, these offerings are made before the company even really exists – perhaps a legitimate choice if the team can’t work until the coins have been issued, but one that leaves millions of dollars flowing into startups which would still be courting angel investors for five figure sums in a conventional market.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy failure to date, of a startup called the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation – DAO – which sold itself as a sort of crowdsourced hedge fund, took around $150m of investor funds with it, after a vulnerability in the code was discovered which allowed funds to be siphoned off by an anonymous attacker.\n\nFor the companies themselves, there’s an added risk: it’s not clear such ICOs are strictly legal. That’s fine if you’re trying to build a company that takes advantage of the pseudonymity inherent to cryptocurrencies to stay on the wrong side of the law; but if you’re planning to break out into legitimate businesses, it’s worth remembering that financial markets are fairly heavily regulated, and the Financial Conduct Authority and the US Securities and Exchange Commission take a dim view of selling unlicensed securities.\n\nBut the cryptocurrency boom has always been for the risky. Where else can you make – or lose – a fortune overnight, on a company run by someone you’ve never seen, or even know the name of?\n\nAnd anyway, don’t listen to me too carefully. If I’d invested £100 in bitcoin every time I told someone else it was silly to buy them, I’d be out in the sun today instead of writing this column.', 'Who says only the government can make money? This year the value of the private currency bitcoin has climbed to unprecedented levels, while at the same time becoming far less volatile than in previous periods of rapidly increasing demand. Bitcoin has reached these new benchmarks despite news that might have depressed its value, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of a fund permitting small traders to invest in bitcoin on the stock market.\n\nThe SEC action prompted obituaries, but bitcoin is thriving....', 'In a move that may surprise many in the cryptocurrency world, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that LedgerX has officially been granted status as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF).\n\nThis represents a major hurdle in the company’s overarching plan of becoming the first federally recognized exchange able to trade Bitcoin options. The final step to this major achievement is the approval from the CFTC as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Once this has been granted, LedgerX will be the “first federally regulated Bitcoin options exchange and clearinghouse to list and clear fully-collateralized, physically-settled Bitcoin options for the institutional market.”\n\nThe company is now among a very rare breed of only 25 financial groups who have SEF status including Bloomberg and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company had been held back by the need for additional capital to collateralize its trades but was able to garner enough support in a recent round of capital raising.\n\nSome would argue that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies demands that government regulatory boards be kept from influencing them. However, their growing popularity has led some to call for greater levels of regulation in order to provide the necessary stability for institutional investors to take part.', 'As a sign of the rising popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the UK-based Dadiani Fine Art Gallery has begun accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptos as entrance payment.\n\nThe art gallery owner Eleesa Dadiani said, “We are combining old world business ethics and practice with the new world of technology the current system is becoming stale and needs to be disrupted.”\n\nShe adds:\n\n""Cryptocurrencies will provide a bridge from the elitist, centralist fine art market to a decentralized open source world where many more will be able to become a part of this exhilarating market.”\n\nThe gallery is offering a set of sculptures made from the exhaust manifolds of Formula 1 cars.\n\nThis most recent cryptocurrency acceptance is another sign of the rising tide of public awareness and acceptance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other early cryptocurrencies were something of an enigma, the public sector is beginning to make use of the power of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies. As more and more companies accept the payment vehicle, the popularity and price of these coins will only continue to increase.', 'Roque Solis never imagined the bitcoin mining equipment he bought in February would have already paid for itself. And on top of that, made him money.\n\nSolis is the president of SoliSYSTEMS Corp, a company that developed an EMV smart card for electronic benefit transfer for the federal assistance program, Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). While attending several conferences last year, Solis was unable to ignore bitcoin. So, he decided to experiment with the technology via mining to get a better handle on whether the technology could be used within his company.\n\nSolis bought a Bitmain Antminer S9 on eBay for $2,400.\n\nAs of this weekend, Solis has mined 1.01 BTC, worth a little more than $2,584 in his bitcoin wallet.\n\nSolis said:\n\n""When I bought the miner, the price per bitcoin was around $1,200. I thought I’d break even in one year, but actually it’s been about five months.""\n\nThese gains, though, are particularly interesting in that, even last year, individual hobby mining wasn\'t profitable anymore. Individuals with just one or two miners couldn\'t compete with the companies mining bitcoin using large warehouses full of servers dedicated to the task (and seeing lucrative returns as the price rose).\n\nBut that was with the price below $600, which, with electricity costs and mining pool fees, would take a person more than 500 days to break even on their bitcoin miner investment.\n\nWith an increased awareness and usage of mining pools, and the price now far higher, hobby miners – as Solis\' experience shows – can break even in several months.\n\nAccording to Solis, the amount of money he’s making per day with the miner jumped from $7 to $16 recently, as the price shot up.\n\nPrice matters\n\nAnd to bitcoin\'s enthusiasts this is evidence that the increase really does benefit the network more broadly.\n\nAccording to Sean Walsh, a partner at Redwood City Ventures, a bitcoin and blockchain consulting and investment firm, the rising bitcoin price has done more than reinvigorate investors, it\'s also led to increased interest in bitcoin mining, a key process that supports the network by securing its ledger.\n\nWalsh told CoinDesk:\n\n""There are a lot of metrics that actually matter, like the number of people that own at least one bitcoin, but nobody cares about that. It\'s just price. It\'s the one score that wakes people up, and when The Wall Street Journal and other financial publications write about bitcoin.""\n\nAnd the Google Trends for ""bitcoin"" and ""bitcoin mining"" tell a similar story. Many of the peaks in the chart for both terms coincide with spikes in price.\n\nYet, it\'s not only the price per bitcoin that\'s luring in new bitcoin mining hobbyists. According to Walsh, while bitcoin transaction fees were relatively stable for a long time, in the past couple years, those fees have seen an uptick.\n\n""This has to do with the block size debate, because the network is a bit congested, and people are having to pay more to get their transactions confirmed,"" he said.\n\nWhereas only a few years ago, around 100 bitcoins per day was paid in transaction fees, in the past couple months, transaction fees have equaled around 350 bitcoins a day, Walsh said, pointing to stats on bitcoin data website Blockchain.info.\n\nAnd with 1,800 bitcoins produced daily, 350 bitcoins is close to 20% of that. This is in stark contrast to a year ago when only 60 bitcoins were paid in transaction fees and 3,600 bitcoins were being produced daily (before the halving), making the percentage paid in fees around 1.6%.\n\n""That\'s a huge boost,"" Walsh said.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""I don\'t know that [increasing transaction fees] are affecting people\'s interest in getting into mining. People may not realize why it\'s more lucrative to mine bitcoins now, but when they run the numbers, the payback period looks better than it used to.""\n\nNew blood\n\nBut those who have been in the cryptocurrency space for a while know this story, and would likely caution against Solis and others thinking that the upward momentum will continue.\n\nWarning of future corrections, Walsh said:\n\n""It’s very important for people entering bitcoin mining that they really understand how to calculate their revenue and expenses. They need to make sure their cost basis and operating costs are very low.""\n\nFor example, if new miners overspend on hosting servers, when there\'s a correction, they\'re over-leveraged. And that\'s a cardinal sin in any investment, said Walsh.\n\nBitcoin was down about 20% over the last couple weeks of June.\n\nWalsh called the downswings just ""normal respiration of an asset class,"" yet others not so versed in investing might be unaware of these fluctuations and get themselves in trouble.\n\nFor Solis, though, it\'s all about learning through experience.\n\nThe Antminer S9 is running in SoliSYSTEM’s server room in the company’s office in Allen, Texas. Solis isn\'t able to identify just how much electricity the miner is using, though, since there’s clusters of servers there already.\n\n""It is noisy, though,"" Solis said. ""Compared to the other servers, it’s very noisy.""\n\nAnd that\'s because it\'s a machine with two specialized ASIC boards, crunching numbers with a fan that rotates at 5,400–7,000 revolutions per minute, he said.\n\nSolis isn\'t only interested in bitcoin. Having been introduced to ethereum\'s ether token and the network\'s smart contract architecture, he had one of his employees buy some immediately via an online exchange several weeks ago. And he plans to start mining ether soon.\n\nHe\'s also researching Hyperledger and other private blockchain systems.\n\nAll this, so he can better envision the use cases for his company. According to Solis, the company is looking into how blockchain could underpin a mobile, closed-loop electronic benefits transfer system.\n\nMiner image courtesy of Roque Solis\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

07/10/2017,"['Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox’s former CEO Mark Karpeles will go on trial next week in Tokyo, Japan to face embezzlement charges in the case of some 750,000 missing bitcoins, now worth over $1.85 billion.\n\nFrenchman Mark Karpeles, who was released on bail a year ago from a Tokyo detention house will be expected to plead innocent, according to his laywer.\n\nSpeaking to AFP, Kiichi Iino, Karpeles’ lawyer, revealed that the former disgraced chief executive of what was once the world’s busiest bitcoin trading platform is keeping calm ahead of the trial.\n\nKarpeles was first arrested in Tokyo in early August 2015 with allegations that he had manipulated bitcoin volumes at Mt Gox. After being in custody for a period of three weeks – the maximum time frame for suspects to be detained without formal charges in Japan – Karpeles was soon re-arrested the same month on charges of embezzlement. At the time, Karpeles was alleged to have stolen 321 million yen in bitcoin.\n\nMt Gox was notorious for its security snafus, suffering a hack as early as summer 2011. Those troubles continued through the years and when bitcoin reached a then-all-time-high near $1,300 in November 2013, Mt Gox stopped bitcoin withdrawals and claimed its vault of 850,000 bitcoins, about $500 million at the time, was plundered by a hack.\n\nBlaming the incident due to “weakness in the system” in early 2014, Karpeles publicly appeared on television to apologize and state “the 750,000 bitcoins we kept for users, are almost all gone.” His claim of the hack being the result of structural weakness of bitcoin was soon debunked.\n\nKarpeles has also been accused of using customers’ bitcoins to fund a lavish lifestyle complete with a penthouse and prostitutes.\n\nAs things stand, a Tokyo court-appointed Trustee has completed a review of a total of 24,750 individual claims by creditors as the effort to reimburse Mt Gox creditors for their lost funds takes shape.\n\n“I’ve not had any back yet but hopefully, eventually all the creditors will get a small percentage of their money back from the bankruptcy distribution,” British bitcoiner Kolin Burges told AFP.\n\nBurges, who claims he lose several hundred bitcoins as a result of the collapse, added:\n\nThe charges [against Karpeles] only cover a subset of the issues which were happening at Mt Gox, so I don’t expect that we will find out most of the information we wanted to know.\n\nIf Karpeles is found guilty by a Japanese court – in a country has one of the highest conviction rates in the world – he could face up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 500,000 yen ($4,000).\n\nFeatured image from news24.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The crypto markets continued to bleed on Monday, as the total value of all cryptocurrencies dipped below $90 billion. Leading the retreat were bitcoin and ethereum, whose prices both fell by at least 4.5%. Altcoins, as usual, were hit even harder, causing 10 of the top 15 coins to post weekly declines of at least 10%.\n\nThe markets had spent the past few weeks attempting to stay above the $100 billion threshold, but even that number now appears out of sight. At $87.9 billion, the current total crypto market cap has reached a monthly low. It is also the first time in July the total market cap has dropped below $90 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Stumbles\n\nDespite a slight decline, the bitcoin price had remained relatively stable for the past week. That changed on Sunday when the bitcoin price briefly increased to $2,635. However, bitcoin’s momentum abruptly reversed course, dropping 4.6% to $2,437 on Monday. Bitcoin’s market cap is now just a hair over $40 billion.\n\nEthereum’s Downward Spiral Continues\n\nThe ethereum price’s downward trend continued on Monday, as the ether token tumbled another 8% to $224. In the past week, the ethereum price has fallen by an astonishing 22%.\n\nEthereum has also seen a pronounced drop in trading volume. At $581 million, ethereum’s 24-hour trading volume is now only 76% as large as bitcoin’s. This is a significant change from last month’s bull run, when ethereum consistently topped bitcoin volume. This also marks a nearly 50% decline in ethereum volume since last Monday.\n\nNevertheless, ethereum investors should not panic. Last week, a prominent U.S. banker told Business Insider he believes the Ethereum blockchain is superior to Bitcoin’s.\n\nAdditionally, Vitalik Buterin recently addressed criticisms of Ethereum, conceding–among other things–that its “scalability sucks.” There is a temptation to circle the wagons when the market is no longer moving in your favor, so his willingness to recognize and frankly discuss these issues in public should help reassure investors that ethereum’s long-term outlook is positive.\n\nAltcoin Markets a Dismal Sight\n\nThe downturn continued to erode altcoin market caps. The Ripple price saw an uncharacteristic 8% decline, falling to $0.218. Ripple’s market cap is now just $8.4 billion. Litecoin fell almost 6% to $47.54. Ethereum Classic dropped 3%–and 10% for the week–to $16. The NEM price fell nearly 9% to $0.14. The IOTA price fell 16% to $0.254; its weekly decline is 32%. Monero, which recently climbed to the 9th-place spot, declined 8% to about $42. Of the top 15 coins, only Dash and BitConnect have managed to avoid weekly declines.\n\nThe downturn hit no major coin harder than EOS. The EOS price fell another 13% on Monday, bringing its weekly decline to 51%. At present, the EOS price is $2.08.\n\nBitcoin Dominates Market Share\n\nEthereum’s price skid has pushed the Flippening further and further out of sight. In just the past week, Bitcoin increased its share of the market by more than 4% to 45.8%. Ethereum, on the other hand, experienced a decrease of almost 3% to 23.7%.\n\nIf this trend continues for even another day, bitcoin could boast a market share more than double the size of ethereum’s.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It’s time for bitcoin traders to batten down the hatches.\n\nThe notoriously volatile cryptocurrency, whose 150 percent surge this year has captivated everyone from Wall Street bankers to Chinese grandmothers, could be headed for one of its most turbulent stretches yet.\n\nBlame the bitcoin civil war. After two years of largely behind-the-scenes bickering, rival factions of computer whizzes who play key roles in bitcoin’s upkeep are poised to adopt two competing software updates at the end of the month. That has raised the possibility that bitcoin will split in two, an unprecedented event that would send shockwaves through the $41 billion market.\n\nWhile both sides have big incentives to reach a consensus, bitcoin’s lack of a central authority has made compromise difficult. Even professional traders who’ve followed the dispute’s twists and turns aren’t sure how it will all pan out. Their advice: brace for volatility and be ready to act fast once a clear outcome emerges.\n\nQuickTake All About Bitcoin\n\n“It’s a high-stakes game of chicken,” said Arthur Hayes, a former market maker at Citigroup Inc. who now runs BitMEX, a bitcoin derivatives venue in Hong Kong. “If you’re a trader, there’s a lot of uncertainty as to what happens. Once there’s a definitive signal about what will be done, the price could move very quickly.”\n\n(Detailed summary of key dates and potential outcomes at bottom.)\n\nBehind the conflict is an ideological split about bitcoin’s rightful identity. The community has bitterly argued whether the cryptocurrency should evolve to appeal to mainstream corporations and become more attractive to traditional capital, or fortify its position as a libertarian beacon; whether it should act more as an asset like gold, or as a payment system.\n\nThe seeds of the debate were planted years ago: To protect from cyber attacks, bitcoin by design caps the amount of information on its network, called the blockchain. That puts a ceiling on how many transactions it can process -- the so-called block size limit -- just as the currency’s growing popularity is boosting activity. As a result, transaction times and processing fees have soared to record levels this year, curtailing bitcoin’s ability to process payments with the same efficiency as services like Visa Inc.\n\nTo address this problem, two main schools of thought emerged. On one side are miners, who deploy costly computers to verify transactions and act as the backbone of the blockchain. They’re proposing a straightforward increase to the block size limit.\n\nOn the other is Core, a group of developers instrumental in upholding bitcoin’s bug-proof software. They insist that to ease blockchain’s traffic jam, some of its data must be managed outside the main network. They claim that not only would it reduce congestion, but also allow other projects including smart contracts to be built on top of bitcoin.\n\nBut moving data off the blockchain effectively diminishes the influence of miners, the majority of whom are based in China and who have invested millions on giant server farms. Not surprisingly, Core’s proposal, called SegWit, has garnered resistance from miners, the most vocal being Wu Jihan, co-founder of the world’s largest mining organization Antpool.\n\n“SegWit is itself a great technology, but the reason it hasn’t taken off is because its interest doesn’t align with miners,” Wu said.\n\nStill, after previous counter-proposals championed by Wu fell through, miners last month agreed to compromise and support SegWit, in exchange for increasing the block size. Wu says the plan will alleviate short-to-medium term congestion and give Core enough time to flesh out a long-term solution. That proposal is what is known as SegWit2x, which implements SegWit and doubles the block size limit.\n\n“You can think of the SegWit2x proposal as an olive branch,” said Wu.\n\nSupport for SegWit2x has reached levels unseen for previous solutions. About 85 percent of miners have signaled they are willing to run the software once it’s released on July 21, and some of bitcoin’s largest companies have also jumped on board.\n\nThe unprecedented level of endorsement is partly prompted by anxiety of bitcoin losing its dominant status to ethereum, a newer cryptocurrency whose popularity has soared thanks to its ability to run smart contracts and its more corporate-friendly approach.\n\nStill, hardliners say that after more than two years of bitter arguments, a split would let people part ways to explore different visions, even if prices crash.\n\nBitcoin dropped for a fourth day on Tuesday, declining 1.9 percent as of 7:49 a.m. in New York, to its lowest level since June 15. The cryptocurrency is down 22 percent from a record high in early June.\n\nSome of Core supporters are pushing a separate agenda called UASF (user activated soft fork). Starting from Aug. 1, it will reject transactions not compliant with SegWit. If a majority of miners do not adopt SegWit by then, two versions of bitcoin would come into existence, triggering a currency split.\n\n“It’s moderates versus extremists,” said Atlanta-based Stephen Pair, chief executive officer of BitPay, one of the world’s largest bitcoin wallets. “It depends on how much a person values the majority of people staying on one chain at least for a little while longer, versus splitting and allowing each pursuing their own vision for scaling.”\n\nMany Core developers continue to reject SegWit2x because they see its development and implementation as being too rushed, which they say could undermine the software underpinning bitcoin.\n\n“To suggest a hard fork happen significantly faster than even the most minor of changes in recent history is irresponsible and dangerous,” said Matt Corallo, a Core contributor and former co-founder of Blockstream, which is among companies that stand to benefit from SegWit.\n\nBelow is an outline of the main events that could unify or divide bitcoin:\n\nWatch This Next', 'In 1.800 Postfilialen können Euro-Beträge in Bitcoin eingetauscht werden, Kooperation mit Wiener Plattform Bitpanda\n\nDie Post wird zum Umschlagplatz für Bitcoins: Künftig können Kunden in den 1.800 Post-Standorten Bitcoins und andere digitale Währungen wie Ethereum erwerben. 50 Euro, 100 Euro oder 500 Euro können umgetauscht werden. Nutzer erhalten dann einen Code, mit dem sie ihre digitale Geldbörse bei BitPanda nutzen können.\n\n""Klassische Währungen nicht ersetzen""\n\nBitpanda gilt als eine der größten Bitcoin-Plattformen.

""Digitale Währungen werden zu zentralen Punkten in unserem Alltag werden, stehen aber nicht in Konflikt mit klassischen Währungen"", so Bitpanda-Mitgründer Eric Demuth in einer Aussendung. (red, 10.7.2017)', 'An unknown cryptocurrency trader turned $55 million of paper wealth into $283 million in just over a month.\n\nThe only clue about this person or persons, beyond a virtual wallet with the identification code 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184, surfaced on a June 11 Instagram posting, in Bahasa, in which he or she (or they) (or somebody posing as them) boasted about the 413 percent profit accumulated earlier this year from ether, the digital money of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n“I get many private messages asking how much ether I have,” the post read, alongside photos that purported to be the hardware powering a mining operation but looked lifted from another website. “One of the cool things about Ethereum is that all wallets around the world are transparent and open for everyone to see. And this is my wallet’s savings.”\n\nHidden identities are a popular feature of the twilight world of virtual money. Now that the total value of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and ether, soared June 6 to more than $100 billion, approaching the market value of McDonald’s Corp., concerned regulators say it might be time to link wallet IDs with actual humans.\n\nNom de Guerre\n\nSecrecy persists from the days, earlier this decade, when Ross Ulbricht, going by the nom de guerre Dread Pirate Roberts, used bitcoin to launder money and traffic in narcotics, activities for which he started serving a life term at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.\n\nThat’s not to say that 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184 or any other entities are doing anything illegal. But opacity may be worsening jagged price movements. The value of ether, for example, rose from about $8 a unit at the start of the year to crest at $400 in June before settling around $250 today. A lack of transparency could also be stifling the mainstreaming of online money, according to draft legislation issued by the European Parliament in March.\n\n“The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes,” the draft said. “In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies” and their potential future popularity.\n\nPseudonymity has always been a big part of the market’s allure. Upending traditional ways of doing business was the lodestar for Ethereum’s inventor, 23-year-old Vitalik Buterin. He released his software in 2015, not long after dropping out of Canada’s University of Waterloo.\n\nFinancial Privacy\n\n“One of its more important features is that you don’t have identities tied to this,” said Spencer Bogart, head of research at venture firm Blockchain Capital. “This financial privacy is an important characteristic.”\n\nEther, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin, is used to pay for applications or programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain, a secured list of transactions that can be shared. That allows for the use of “smart contracts,” or pieces of computer code that make the terms of such agreements operate automatically. The blockchain has the potential to reshape business and finance by enabling immediate settlements of activities such as bank transfers and securities trades.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., BP Plc, Microsoft Corp. and ING Groep NV are among those experimenting with it.\n\nThe current value of all the ether held, $23 billion, means dozens of electronic wallets have accrued nine-figure positions. Many of them could be held by individuals, according to a Bloomberg analysis. Individuals can hold multiple wallets.\n\nCrypto-Billionaire\n\nLikely candidates to be crypto-billionaires include hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a blockchain production studio that works on Ethereum, and Ethereum creator Buterin.\n\nNovogratz, a former executive at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has a long way to go, but he’s been a consistent booster. He said last month that he has 10 percent of his net worth invested in virtual money. That’s a stake worth at least $90 million, given a net worth calculated at $925 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Novogratz declined to comment.\n\nCryptocurrencies could become a $5 trillion industry, but they need to develop sound business principles to satisfy regulators and lend legitimacy, Novogratz said June 27 at a fintech conference in New York.\n\nLubin, the former chief operating officer for Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, which developed the software, could hold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ether, several investors said. The Canadian entrepreneur didn’t respond to requests for comment on his holdings.\n\n“The long-range vision is moving the fundamental transactional elements of our society from analog, friction-filled systems to natively digital frictionless systems,” Lubin told Bloomberg Radio June 21.\n\nButerin said in a Reddit post last month his ether holdings equal what would amount to about $117 million today, according to calculations by Bloomberg.\n\nLike bitcoin, ether is struggling to overcome a reputation sullied by cyberattacks and technology bottlenecks. A flash crash last month saw the price of the cryptocurrency tumble to just 10 cents before rebounding to about $300.\n\n“A lot of lessons will be learned,” said Peter Denious, head of global venture capital at Aberdeen Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut. “A lot of money will be lost before a lot of money can be made.”\n\n0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184 couldn’t be reached for further comment.\n\n— With assistance by Lisa Abramowicz, Pimm Fox, Harry Suhartono, Aansh Mehta, and Matthew Leising', 'In Brief In a time of financial instability, many individuals are turning to the decentralized bitcoin to store their wealth. Due to this as well as its potential to revolutionize the finance system, bitcoin has enjoyed stratospheric growth in recent years.\n\nModern Gold\n\nTom Lee, a Wall Street strategist who works at Fundstrat, has predicted that the price of bitcoin will continue its exponential rise until it reaches $55,000 by 2022. He bases his prediction on the economic principles of scarcity and market instability.\n\nLee argues, essentially, that bitcoin is subsuming the role that gold previous played in the economy. It has become a solid and dependable store of wealth in a time when we have seen recessions and market turbulence effecting people’s savings in their own currency. This is particularly the case in countries where the government controls the currency to achieve a desired effect, as is the case in China and Japan.\n\nMany have criticized bitcoin for its turbulence — it has now reached a volatility of 75 percent — and argue that, for this reason, it cannot be the safe store of value that Lee sees it as. Lee, though, told Coin Telegraph that “gold’s volatility approached 90 percent from 1971 to 1980 as the U.S. abandoned the gold standard — hence, we expect this [bitcoin’s volatility] to improve over time.” Coincidentally, bitcoin exceeded the value of gold earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin’s Rise and Bitcoin’s Results\n\nBitcoin’s rise has been so meteorotic that it is quite unlike any other currency — or asset, depending on who you ask — in recent memory. To give a quirky example, in May of 2010, a developer bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin. These, in total, would now be worth around $25 million, which is enough to buy a 720-year-old Magna Carta — given that one sold for $21 million in 2007.\n\nBitcoin arguably lead the vanguard for cryptocurrenies moving from a quirky financial system in tight-knit tech communities to a talking point for major financial planners. It is now fundamentally changing the way we look at economies in addition to being the leading example of blockchain technology. Simon Taylor, co-founder of a blockchain venture capital fund, said in an interview with Government Office for Science that the tech “brings us near instant asset transfer, asset movement, and security of data movement,” and that blockchain will have a similar effect on exchange that the internet did on communication.\n\nBitcoin has now become large enough for entire countries to consider upending transaction systems that have been in place since the advent of currency itself. India and Sweden in particular are looking to mimic the systems to produce the first cashless societies in modern history. This is perhaps the ultimate testament to how significant the cryptocurrency has become.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in cryptocurrency markets.

Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company.', 'The Internal Revenue Service is significantly scaling back an investigation into customers who bought and sold bitcoins on the popular digital currency exchange Coinbase.\n\nInstead of asking Coinbase for a long list of details about its customers who bought or sold bitcoin between 2013 and 2015, the IRS told a federal court it is now seeking information only for those accounts that engaged in transactions worth $20,000 or more.\n\nThe news will come as a relief to thousands of people who dabbled in bitcoin but faced the prospect of a tax investigation for failing to disclose they sold a small amount of the currency, or used it to purchase goods and services. The IRS launched the investigation in part because the price of bitcoin soared from $13 to over $1,100 during the years in question, and because only 802 people reported their bitcoin gains or losses in 2015 to the agency.\n\nAn IRS spokesperson declined to comment on the investigation’s new scope, which is limited—in the agency’s words—to users with “at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year during the 2013-15 period.”\n\nThe modified request, first reported by CoinDesk, was set out in a court filing titled “Notice of Narrowed Summons Request for Enforcement.” The filing also announced the IRS is limiting the scope of its request for the accounts. (You can see full details of those new limits below).\n\nThe news comes as the IRS is locked in a closely-watched court fight with anonymous Coinbase users who want to a judge to block a summons the agency served on the company last year.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nIf Coinbase had complied with the original summons, it would have forced it to turn over personal details related to over a million accounts, and over 500,000 active customer accounts. The scope of the summons caused an outcry among digital currency owners, and led senior members of Congress to send a sharply worded letter to the IRS that warned its probe was “overly broad” and extremely burdensome.”\n\nPerhaps in response to this pressure, a lawyer for the IRS told a judge last week that the agency would no longer seek password and security settings for the accounts.\n\nThe big question now is whether the concessions by the IRS will lead the anonymous Coinbase customers to withdraw their lawsuit, or whether they will push the court to limit the summons still further. Lawyers at the Los Angeles law firm Berns Weiss, which are representing the customers, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nCoinbase itself is not part of the lawsuit, but it has said it would join in if the IRS failed to limit the scope of the summons.\n\nA spokesperson for the San Francisco-based company declined to comment on the agency’s decision to only seek information on the larger accounts, and referred Fortune to a blog post from March.\n\nThe IRS move did not appear to affect the price of bitcoin, which was trading around $2,400 on Monday evening.\n\nFinally, here are the other changes the IRS made to its request. The bold phrases are my summary of the changes, while the indented text is taken from the original summons followed by the limits set out in the July 6 court filing.\n\nChange 1: Eliminates request for payment information and security settings.\n\nORIGINAL REQUEST: Account/wallet/vault registration records for each account/wallet/vault owned or controlled by the user during the period stated above including, but not limited to, complete user profile, history of changes to user profile from account inception, complete user preferences, complete user security settings and history (including confirmed devices and account activity), complete user payment methods, and any other information related to the funding sources for the account/wallet/vault, regardless of date. NOW LIMITED TO: name, address, tax identification number, date of birth, account opening records, copies of passport or driver’s license, all wallet addresses, and all public keys for all accounts/wallets/vaults.\n\nChange 2: Eliminates request for power of attorney letters and corporate minutes tied to third parties\n\nORIGINAL REQUEST: For any account/wallet/vault with respect to which the registered user gave any third party access, control, or transaction approval authority, all powers of attorney, letters of wishes, corporate minutes, or other agreements or instructions granting the third party such access, control, or approval authority. NOW LIMITED TO: agreements or instructions granting a third party access, control, or approval authority.\n\nChange 3: Limits request for correspondence between Coinbase and users to portions that cover account opening and closing, and transactions', ""Other tokens and coins will influence the price of ETH; and right now is influencing it toward the negative.\n\nThere's still opportunity for its growth, but also doubt as it works out its future uses; Proof of Stake, EEA, transaction speeds.\n\nAnyone that’s being attentive in the cryptocurrency space lately knows about Ethereum—or its tradable coins, Ether. It’s become a sturdy second-place name after Bitcoin, and though it hasn’t reached the broader popularity of the other (still synonymous with crypto in full), it’s got a large community that’s growing by the day.\n\nAnd for good reason. In the last three months, ETH is trading at 600% of its early April-price, and was at 10x when ETH approached $400 in late June.\n\nAfter months of intense growth, however, it’s stabilized and experienced its most significant drop in value (per ETH and market cap) in its entire history.\n\nYet, new speculative investors are hearing about Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other coins, by the day (one popular trading platform said it had a million new users sign up in June). So, is it too late to hop on and earn from an Ether investment?\n\nNo, it’s not.\n\nBut I think the days of growth that ETH saw in May and June are not going to be coming anytime soon. The rest of this article will explain why.\n\nFor me, it comes down to basics: there are enough people (investors) with enough belief in this technology to be widespread. Companies are part of this optimism; and Ethereum has enough innovation potential that it could be the backbone of technology we use daily. At a current $23 billion market valuation (total sum of its “tokens” and their value), there’s lots of room for growth if it becomes even half of what some think it might.\n\nThat’s the upside. And that’s what fueled the ETH rise this year. So why has it gone down?\n\nA few reasons.\n\nThe first is Bitcoin itself. Like any younger brother, Ether is going to follow in the footsteps it sees. And so it’s value is tied together closely with Bitcoin—mostly due to investors seeing crypto (and blockchain) as an industry to invest in, not as separate sets of technology.\n\nBitcoin has seen a uptick in value too (the charts show just how tied these are together)—but it’s dealing with some issues. Its blocks are getting big, “fees” on transactions too high, and a community that is unsure how to scale this amazing technology. It’s too long to go into here, but August 1st represents a big day in the history of Bitcoin. You can read it into here (and much more with a Google search).\n\nWith uncertainty hanging over Bitcoin as August 1st approaches, it’s driving down the value of ETH (and really every other coin).\n\nNext part of ETH to understand is the ICO—initial coin offering. If you’ve only heard about Bitcoin and Ethereum, you should know there are now hundreds of coins, each with its own purpose, aim, or back-end tech. One example is something like Siacoin (aiming to disrupt Amazon’s AWS) as a cloud-based storage provider. Doing it over the blockchain could cut costs down significantly.\n\nWhen these coins (which are almost always an equivalent of a startup company) hit the market they do an ICO—much like an IPO. And there are a ton of them (dozens a month), making a lot of money in these. We’re talking tens—sometimes hundreds—of millions in initial fundraising. Here’s just the most recent one.\n\nSo how does this effect ETH? Well, for one, many coins are “based on” Ethereum (more technological involved than I’ll get into here). The other is that to buy these coins, most initial investors are buying with Ether. So, a new company finds themselves with $50m transferred to them for their coins.\n\nThey now have enormous expectations to produce value and need capital to start recruiting and building operations. So what do they do? They sell the ETH they’ve collected. And that’s what’s happening now, ETH being pumped back into the market at low(er) prices for companies that have just come into capital.\n\nLastly, the biggest criteria in Ethereum’s future and value is the technology itself. Think of this as its product—and since it’s not a profitable product yet—it needs to jump into that with ease and trust.\n\nIn the coming months, there are a number of large-scale updates and changes to Ethereum’s blockchain capabilities. These will need to be implementing without large disruption or losing the momentum it has, especially with the technical crowd. With so many other coins involved in this space now, competition is tight, even for one as big as Ethereum.\n\nOf course too, it will look to take over Bitcoin as the predominant use-case in crypto economics and it needs to succeed on the technological front to do so. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of the updates coming to Ethereum soon.\n\nEthereum has been incredibly successful so far in speculation, and Ether tokens have gained enormous value recently because of this.\n\nThere might not be the same rocketship growth from this point, but I believe there will be a steady value increase with new technological implementations—much to come after August 1st has passed and the future of Bitcoin comes in a bit clearer.\n\nStill time to buy!\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long ETHEREUM.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."", ""As cryptocurrencies continue to build momentum among a larger user base and gain prominence within the non-virtual world, there are likely to be some unanticipated effects. For proponents of Bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market cap, more Bitcoin users means a larger and more competitive market, as well as additional instances of brick-and-mortar stores taking on Bitcoin capabilities. (See also: Russian Burger King to Accept Bitcoin Payments.)\n\nThis means Bitcoin holders can spend their cryptocurrency without having to convert it to fiat money more and more easily as time goes on. Alongside a greater demand for Bitcoin comes a larger number of potential Bitcoin miners hoping to capitalize on the increased interest. (See also: Chinese Investment in Bitcoin Mining is Enormous.)\n\nOn the other hand, some pre-existing groups are feeling negative pressures because of these developments, and one of these is a community that may have seemed unrelated: computer gamers.\n\nGaming and Mining Operations in Competition\n\nWhy would a rise in Bitcoin make things more difficult for the gaming community? According to an article in PC Gamer, it comes down to the basics. Hardware costs for gamers are climbing as demand for powerful rigs and, in particular, graphics cards has driven up prices. It seems that gamers and Bitcoin miners each require some very expensive hardware items in order to most effectively run their operations.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which new Bitcoins are generated. Supporters of the cryptocurrency movement often favor the decentralized status of these currencies, in part because this allows anyone with a powerful-enough computer setup to go about generating new tokens.\n\nAs such, amateur and professional miners alike have set up huge numbers of rigs all around the world, each working through complicated math problems in order to be rewarded with Bitcoin. The mining rigs make use of specialized graphics cards like the AMD RX 400/500 series, and the growing interest in mining has flooded the market with requests to purchase those cards. Many sellers are completely out of stock, and the cards that are available have skyrocketed in price.\n\nGamers Feel the Pressure\n\nGamers, on the other hand, use similar graphics cards for a very different purpose. Many have felt the pressure of increased prices on the graphics cards and other hardware they need in order to stay at the cutting edge of gaming.\n\nHowever, there may be some relief on the way. ASUS, one of the largest manufacturers of graphics cards, recently announced plans to launch a new series of products with cryptocurrency mining in mind. This could lead to new classes of graphics cards with different focuses depending on whether the user is looking to mine or to game.\n\nAs long as interest in mining continues to grow, it's unlikely that the pressure will abate. But in this case, perhaps gamers will find that their graphics cards are not quite so expensive any longer.""]"
07/11/2017,"['Mark Karpelès faces up to five years in jail as Japanese authorities press charges in bankruptcy case that lost 850,000 bitcoins and $28m of user money\n\nThe 32-year-old head of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges relating to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins and cash from what was once the world’s biggest exchange based in Japan.\n\nMt Gox, which handled around 80% of global bitcoin trades, shut down and went bankrupt in February 2014, saying that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins – then worth around half a billion US dollars – and $28m (£22m) in cash from its Japanese bank accounts. The Tokyo-based Mt. Gox blamed hackers for its lost bitcoins, pointing to a software security flaw, but subsequently said it had found 200,000 of the missing bitcoins.\n\nAt a Tokyo District Court, French-born Mt Gox chief Mark Karpelès stands accused of embezzlement and data manipulation, including for accessing the exchange’s computer system to inflate his account by $1m and for transferring 341m yen ($3m) from a Mt Gox bank account holding customer funds to an account in his name during September to December 2013.\n\nKarpelès was arrested in August 2015 and released on bail last year. He denied wrongdoing, telling the three-judge panel hearing his case that “I swear to God that I am innocent”. If found guilty of embezzlement, he could face up to five years in prison, or a fine of up to 500,000 yen ($4,000).\n\nPeople affected by Mt Gox’s failure are still trying to obtain funds they lost and are hoping the trial will help explain what happened.\n\nThe collapse of Mt Gox was a major setback for bitcoin. Critics said the debacle highlighted the risks of bitcoin transactions, while bitcoin proponents contend Mt Gox is just an exception, but the failure badly damaged the image of cryptocurrencies, particularly among risk-averse Japanese investors and corporations.\n\nThe exchange’s bankruptcy also prompted Japan’s government to decide how to treat bitcoin, and preceded a push by local regulators to license cryptocurrency exchanges. Japan became the first country to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges at the national level this year, part of a government effort to exploit financial technology as a means of stimulating the economy.\n\nThe Japanese regulations help prevent misuse of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for terrorism or other illegal activities, including requiring banks and other businesses to verify identities, keep records and report suspicious transactions.\n\nThe regulations implemented in April require cryptocurrency traders to keep customers’ assets separate from their own.\n\nThe value of bitcoin is highly volatile and hit a record high of $2,980 last month. Like other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple, bitcoin has no central authority and relies instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new units to the system – technology known as the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin can be traded on exchanges in the same manner as stocks and bonds. It has also become a mode of payment for some retailers including Japanese electronics retailer Bic Camera, and a way to transfer funds without the need for a third party.', 'Bitcoin managed to escape much of the downward drift that has afflicted most cryptocurrencies today. In the most recent 24-hour period, bitcoin’s price fell 2.82 percentage points to $2,367, according to coinmarketcap.com.\n\nOnly 10th ranked BitConnect, with $387.854 in market capitalization, fared better than bitcoin in the 24-hour period, only dropping 0.57 points.\n\nEthereum, by contrast, lost 10.2 points and continues its downward trend. Ripple, the number three cryptocurrency, lost 14.3 points.\n\nBitcoin Extends Market Dominance\n\nBitcoin, with a market cap of $38.829 billion, extended its lead over second place Ethereum at $18.714 billion. Bitcoin has extended its lead since June 16, when Ethereum commanded 31.93% of the total crypto market and bitcoin had 38.44%. On July 10, bitcoin extended its dominance to 45.56% compared to Ethereum’s 23.6%, according to coinmarketcap.com.\n\nOn Monday, the total cryptocurrency market cap fell below $90 billion for the first time in July. This market cap evaporation continued on Tuesday, as the total value of all cryptocurrencies plunged as low as $77 billion, a number not seen since late May. At present, the market cap is $84 billion.\n\nSmaller Cap Cryptos Lose Big\n\nMost smaller cap cryptocurrencies crashed today following the U.S. trading session, and Ethereum breached a prior correction low, spiking below $200, triggering a string of stop orders. Bitcoin is still roughly following the projection for a correction, and until the base support near $2,000 holds, a bull market remains intact in bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has surged to historic value while its volatility has receded, during a time when recent events might have caused bitcoin to lose value, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission rejecting a bitcoin ETF.\n\nSeveral observers have argued that a big reason for bitcoin’s popularity is that it has advantages over fiat currencies.\n\nAlso read: Crypto calamity: Ethereum, bitcoin prices sink as market plunges below $80 billion\n\nBitcoin Sustains Popularity\n\nA big reason for bitcoin’s popularity, according to several observers, is that many people distrust government currency and want to use bitcoin as a hedge or an alternative payment tool when government currency doesn’t efficiently perform these functions. Millennials are investing in bitcoin at a faster rate than other consumers.\n\nBitcoin does not rely on a government entity that politicians can manipulate. Instead, trust is placed in the decentralized order of the parties that verify bitcoin transactions.\n\nGlobal and national crises will continue to support bitcoin’s popularity. Instability caused by the euro, Brexit and the rising ratio of debt to gross domestic product in western nations undermines the value of established currencies.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Controversial bitcoin scaling proposal Segwit2x\'s testnet forked yesterday, creating two different and incompatible testnets.\n\nNodes running older bitcoin software continued on as they normally would. But nodes running the new Segwit2x code stalled at block 27070, meaning mining pools running the new software were not mining blocks.\n\nOverall, the nodes were stalled for over 20 hours as a result of the issue.\n\nWhile there wasn\'t any real money on the line, the community was abuzz with the news, some dismissing the controversial scaling proposal for perceived lingering issues, while others defended the misstep as only a small stumbling block that wouldn\'t happen during a live deployment.\n\nToo little, too late\n\nSome developers argue the fork is a symptom of a larger trend of Segwit2x developers not listening to other developers who have worked with the bitcoin code for a long time. Bitcoin Core developers, for example, have provided feedback, pointing out perceived errors, but some of that has been ignored.\n\nOn social media, some argued the testnet fork stemmed from the implementation of the 2MB hard fork developers discussed and disagreed upon a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe 2MB hard fork is the second part of the Segwit2x proposal, an effort to double the block size parameter, which will happen three months after the Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation.\n\nThis second part is important in that if not everyone in the bitcoin ecosystem upgrades to the 2MB increase (and many say they don\'t plan to), bitcoin could split into two assets. If that split is not made permanent, one chain could ""wipeout"" transactions that occur on the other chain, potentially leading users to lose money.\n\nOn the project\'s GitHub, developers had different ideas of how to solve that.\n\nSegwit2x went forward with software that requires at least the first block is greater than 1MB. Some contend this is what lead to the testnet fork, since there weren\'t enough transactions in the mempool, the part of the network where transactions are collected before being selected for blocks.\n\nBitcoin developer James Hilliard had proposed what he calls a ""simpler and better"" way of implementing so-called ""wipeout protection,"" where nodes insert a piece of data making their blocks invalid to the other network.\n\nStill, given that it\'s slated to be deployed in two weeks, for many, the bottom line is that it\'s too late for the code to have serious issues.\n\nWorking group members are expected to install and test the code this Friday. Then, mining pools, companies and users are expected to begin running the code on the main bitcoin network as soon as July 21.\n\nJokers to blame\n\nBut Bloq co-founder and BTC1 developer Jeff Garzik argued the fork is not an event to worry about. One of the testnet miners simply triggered an event sooner than planned and without preparation from the working group participants, he said.\n\nAccording to Garzik, this split wouldn\'t happen once Segwit2x is deployed on the main bitcoin network.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""It falls into the category of \'jokers can disrupt test networks, because test networks have very little mining power security.\'""\n\nBTC.com\'s Boaz Bechar, who\'s also working on the Segwit2x implementation, offered a similar explanation.\n\nWhile the testnet isn\'t expected to have many transactions flowing through it, the main bitcoin network will.\n\n""Although unexpected timing, this is otherwise a good field test,"" Garzik wrote on the Segwit2x working group mailing list.

It should provide some comfort to the British capitol as it jostles to hold onto its reputation as Europe’s leading hub for the nascent fintech sector.\n\nThe investment dwarfs the 19.5 million pounds ($25 million) raised by London-based rival Monzo in its Series B round earlier this year.\n\nRevolut, which has around 700,000 customers, over 400,000 of them based in Britain, provides payment cards that can be used abroad to pay for goods and services at the exchange rate used by banks anywhere that Mastercard (MA.N) is accepted.\n\nOther start-ups, such as Monzo and Germany’s N26, offer similar products, but Revolut says it is distinctive in offering interbank exchange rates, zero-fee international money transfers, and in allowing customers to hold and exchange up to 16 different currencies in their app-based accounts.\n\nRevolut was set up in July 2015 by Russian-born Nikolay Storonsky, who first moved to London in 2007 to work for Lehman Bros as a derivatives trader and later also worked for Credit Suisse.\n\nIf he were starting the company now, as Britain heads out of the European Union, Storonsky would still choose London as its base, he said.\n\n“I don’t see any problems with Brexit,” he told Reuters. “London is much more international than anywhere else in Europe, (and) in terms of regulation, it’s a great place to be.”\n\nSome fintech firms are worried about losing “passporting” rights, which give companies licenced in one EU country the right to trade freely in any other. But Storonsky, whose firm has a UK e-money license, said if that happens it would only take a few months to get such a license for the rest of the EU.\n\nStoronsky, 34, said he wanted to set up a business that acted like a bank but had less bureaucracy.\n\n“I just don’t like banks,” he said. “They’re so bureaucratic, with so many managers not really doing anything ... If you fired 80 percent of bankers, nothing would change.”\n\nBITCOIN BET\n\nRevolut also announced that it is adding digital currency bitcoin BTC=BTSP to its app in response to high demand from customers. Users will now be able to hold, exchange, spend and transfer bitcoin the same way they use other currencies. Rival cryptocurrencies Ether and Litecoin will soon be added.\n\nRevolut, whose license does not allow it to invest clients’ money, gets revenue from commissions paid by merchants, from users who change more than 5000 euros ($5,736) per month and from add-ons such as insurance, which is provided by third parties through the app. It is not yet profitable, but that does not worry its founder.\n\n“It’s normal at this point for a start-up – this is how billion-dollar companies are being made now,” Storonsky said.\n\nThe firm had intended on breaking even by November, but it now says that will take longer, because it is using the extra funding to expand the company into the United States and Asia.\n\nRevolut also secured more money from London-based Balderton Capital and Californian Ribbit Capital. The latest cash injection takes its total investment so far to $83 million. It will run a further $5 million crowdfunding campaign this month.\n\n($1 = 0.7785 pounds)\n\n($1 = 0.8717 euros)', 'The Internal Revenue Service made demands to Coinbase to turn over information on every single one of its US users in the May 17 letter.\n\nOverstepping authority\n\nSenior Republicans were quick to point out that the IRS might very well be exceeding its authority.\n\nThe “millions of pages” requested seem out of proportion considering that most users traded less than $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency in the requested period. Coinbase, which frequently denies access to users who fail KYC and AML standards, was quick to defend its customers.\n\nDOJ trial attorney Amy Matchison points out that the IRS has been in talks with Coinbase to narrow its request to only “unreported income” items. The audits will be limited, but not dropped completely.\n\nIRS insists\n\nThe “narrowed summons” released July 7 has made the following notable changes:\n\nEliminates request for payment information and security settings.\n\nEliminates request for power of attorney letters and corporate minutes tied to third parties\n\nLimits request for correspondence between Coinbase and users to portions that cover account opening/closing and transactions.\n\nFurthermore, the IRS is now seeking to probe users who own or trade $20,000.\n\nCrypto and taxes\n\nThe fact that many traders in the cryptocurrency markets are not clear on how to file their earnings might be the root of the problem.

After successful events in London and Milan, The Blockchain Academy is expanding its international outreach to answer the needs of global exposure to Bitcoin and Blockchain Education.\n\nThe consolidated approach on education is the main driver of The Blockchain Academy events. Thanks to the global recognition of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology and considering The Blockchain Academy past experiences, Munich will be hosting another great educational 2-day event.\n\nParticipants will gain proper knowledge about Bitcoin and Blockchain as well as an understanding of how this technology fits into the existing economic framework. The Full Academy (2 days) is designed for those who want a comprehensive outlook on Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology: the first day is made of an introduction which covers most of the relevant topics that any C-Level exec would want to know. Day 2 provides an in-depth analysis of the most important technological breakthroughs made possible by Blockchain. Participants can choose whether to attend the Full Academy or only the first day.\n\nThe Blockchain Academy is proving itself right in affirming that more than a technology Bitcoin and Blockchain represent a groundbreaking cultural paradigm shift. Participants will be able to study as well as practice what they will be listening from Ferdinando M. Ametrano who has been speaking about Bitcoin at Banca d’Italia, Italian Parliament Lower House and IlSole24Ore just to name a few. Ferdinando was Chairman of the Host Committee for Scaling Bitcoin 2016 in Milan. Few innovative blockchain start-ups will also be present at the 2- day event.\n\nMarco Favia, Head of Blockchain Business Board, presenting the event stated that: ”The World Economic Forum in its latest white paper Realizing the Potential of Blockchain suggests that there’s a need for better strategic knowledge about blockchain: we are totally aligned with this approach having started our educational path one year and a half ago. We’ve been suggesting and encouraging a knowledge centered approach when talking about blockchain technology and we’ll continue in this way.”\n\nThe Blockchain Academy is one of the leading blockchain educational program in Europe created by B3 – Blockchain Business Board.\n\nWHO SHOULD ATTEND\n\nC-level execs that need to properly understand what is going on, transaction bankers, regulators, innovators, payment institution managers, technologists, software developers, security experts, lawyers and notaries interested in the digital domain.\n\nWHEN\n\n9/10 October 2017\n\nWHERE\n\nHighlight Towers\n\nMies-van-der-Rohe-Str.8\n\n80807 München (DE)\n\nWould you like to reserve your ticket?

Customers should do their own research before investing funds in any company.', 'According to a recent study by researchers from the University of Tulsa and Tel Aviv University, the massive increase in the bitcoin price in late 2013 was caused by suspicious trading activity on the now-defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange. The study, which is titled “Price Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem,” indicates that 600,000 bitcoins were acquired by agents who did not pay for them, and the bitcoin price rose by an average of $20 on days when the suspicious trading activity took place.\n\n\n\n“Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, we conclude that the suspicious trading activity caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months,” the study states.\n\nAt the center of the study is the infamous Willy bot that was first publicized on a Wordpress blog back in May of 2014.\n\nThe paper details the data used for the study, identifies the suspicious trading activity and notes that these sorts of manipulative practices may still be possible today, especially in the altcoin markets.\n\nThe Data Used for the Study\n\nThis study regarding price manipulation in the Bitcoin markets is based on a data leak of CSV files that included the trading activity on Mt. Gox from April 2011 to November 2013. The researchers behind the study then supplemented that data with more information from bitcoincharts.com.\n\n“We performed additional sanity checks of the data utilizing publicly available historical Mt. Gox trading data from bitcoincharts.[com],” reads the report. “We are confident that the data are high-quality.”\n\nSuspicious Trading Activity\n\nIn the leaked data, the report notes that there are suspicious accounts in which the country and state fields are filled in as “??” Many red flags are then found upon further inspection of these accounts.\n\nIn the case of one account dubbed “Markus,” the report states that no trading fees are paid and the prices on trades are seemingly random.\n\n“In the end, we have concluded that Markus did not actually pay for the bitcoins he acquired; rather, his account was fraudulently credited with claimed bitcoins that almost certainly were not backed by real coins,” states the report. “Furthermore, because transactions were duplicated, no legitimate Mt. Gox customer received the fiat currency Markus supposedly paid to acquire the coins.”\n\nAccording to the study, Markus acquired a total of 335,898 bitcoins in the 225 days the account was active.\n\nAnother entity noted by the study is known as “Willy”; however, Willy controlled many different accounts. According to the study, Willy appeared roughly seven hours after Markus became inactive.\n\nThe data cited by the report indicates that Willy would purchase 10–19 bitcoins at a time until an amount equal to $2.5 million worth of bitcoins had been purchased. Willy would then make a new account and repeat the process.\n\nThe study notes that there are indications that the owner of the Willy accounts was a Mt. Gox insider. For example, Willy was able to trade while the Mt. Gox API was offline, and the user ID numbers used by Willy were high for the time period they existed.\n\nThe study on price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem indicates that Willy acquired 268,132 bitcoins in exchange for $112 million. Much like Markus, Willy did not actually pay for his bitcoins.\n\n“Hence, together, these unauthorized traders ‘acquired’ around 600,000 bitcoins by November 2013,” says the study. “Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is very close to the number of bitcoins (650,000) that Mt. Gox claimed to have lost when it folded in early 2014.”\n\nAccording to the study, Markus accounts for 12 percent and Willy accounts for 6 percent of the total trade volume on the four major Bitcoin exchanges on the days they were active.\n\nIn addition to the possibility of an inside job, the study also notes that an early Bitcoin adopter could have artificially driven up the bitcoin price via a security vulnerability on the exchange in an effort to increase the value of his or her own holdings.\n\n“We do not know for sure which, if either, of these scenarios reflect what actually happened,” says the report. “But that is largely beside the point. Our goal is to demonstrate that these fraudulent trades did in fact significantly impact the price of bitcoin.”\n\nAccording to the New York Times, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles admitted to operating the Willy bot in a Japanese court on Tuesday.\n\nAltcoins Open to Manipulation\n\nThe researchers behind the study indicate that the importance of price manipulation in digital asset markets will increase as this technology continues to go mainstream. The study indicates that many altcoins are open to this same kind of price manipulation right now.\n\n“Similar to the bitcoin market in 2013 (the period we examine), markets for these other crytocurrencies are very thin,” says the report. “Our analysis suggests that manipulation is quite feasible in such settings.”\n\nCivic CEO Vinny Lingham shared a similar sentiment during a recent talk where he compared altcoins to pump-and-dump penny stocks. “With altcoins, [pump-and-dump schemes] are super easy,” said Lingham.\n\n“Regulators may want to begin taking an active oversight role as the Bitcoin ecosystem becomes more integrated into international finance and payment systems,” concludes the study.', 'A BITCOIN MINING WEBSITE is trying to get in touch with a user who accidentally paid a fee 40 times higher than expected, but the anonymity of blockchain technology is proving a sticking point.\n\nBTC.com is a website that mines bitcoins; this means that it processes a series of transactions, composites them into a list called a block and then adds that to the blockchain. On a normal day, it expects to receive about 2BTC from all transactions (£3,725 at the time of writing), but this week found one block with a fee of 80BTC (£149,000) listed.\n\nAlejandro De La Torre, president of business development at BTC.com, told the IBTimes that the figure was ""insanely high. Someone added way too high a transaction fee.""\n\nIn a blog post, De La Torre said that, considering the size of the transaction, the fee should have been around 2BTC.\n\nAlthough BTC has tried to contact the user through its own site, Twitter and Reddit, the company hasn\'t had a (legitimate) response. Because all blockchain transactions are anonymous, it is impossible to track the user.\n\n""We haven\'t heard back from anyone, which is very weird. We believe it is a mistake. The way they did it, they busted out a lot of transactions in one block using custom software. They must have had an error, put in a wrong value,"" De La Torre said.\n\nHe added, ""We don\'t want to keep the money, if it was a mistake, we\'d rather give it back. It\'s not ours. It was just by chance that we mined this particular block, it could have been a competitor."" The company is offering to refund 78BTC.\n\nAs to why the fee was so high, there are a few possibilities; money laundering has been considered, but BTC\'s theory is that it was processed by an old script; because the user didn\'t know what the transaction fees would look like in the future, they entered a high fee to ensure that the block was confirmed.\n\nThe largest transaction fee ever recorded, also apparently an accident, was a 291BTC fee sent in April 2016, to mining pool BitClub. It is not known if this money was ever claimed back by the original sender.']"
07/12/2017,"[""TOKYO—The trial of the former CEO of the collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox on charges of embezzlement and data manipulation opened Tuesday. Mark Karpelès pleaded not guilty on all counts. But even if he is innocent, he is unlikely to win; Japan has a 99 percent conviction rate once someone has been indicted and Japan’s prosecutors really hate to lose.\n\nAnd even if a defendant wins, the prosecution can appeal the case, the accused are retried, and they usually lose on appeal. In fact, “not guilty” verdicts are so rare that a judge in the Osaka High Court has become famous just for actually overturning several guilty verdicts. For Japan, a judge finding people innocent—that’s mind-blowing stuff.\n\nIt has been a long road to this trial, which began with the announcement of Mt. Gox losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the virtual currency known as bitcoin in February of 2014. At the time, angry Mt. Gox customers picketed the headquarters of the company with signs reading “Where is our money!” Many had hoped that Tuesday’s trial would shed light on that question.\n\nBut the courtroom proceedings probably will only make one thing clear: The Japanese police and prosecution have no damn idea where the bitcoins vanished, how they vanished, or who took them.\n\nIn fact, none of the final charges pertain to the missing bitcoins, which show the Japanese authorities’ colossal failure to solve the mystery of what happened. And indeed, that embarrassing failure may be the real reason Karpelès is even on trial.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009, first set out in a white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is unknown. There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger in cyberspace along with all bitcoin transactions. It is traded like gold and other commodities and recently reached a value of $3000 per bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAccording to a copy of the indictment which The Daily Beast was shown, Karpelès is alleged to have moved a total of ¥341 million ($3 million) from a Mt. Gox customer account to an external account between September and December 2013 and this amounts to embezzlement.\n\nProsecutors argued in their opening statements that Karpelès managed the company assets and money entrusted by the company’s clients in the same bank account and failed to respond to requests by company associates to separate them. The Daily Beast spoke to a former accountant for the firm who did confirm that “accounting practices were lax but that in itself is not a crime.”\n\nAt the trial, a slimmed-down Karpelès read out a prepared statement in Japanese: “I swear that I am not guilty. I am sincerely sorry for causing trouble to many clients with the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox,” he said, and repeated previous claims that the missing bitcoins had been hacked by an outside party.\n\nOf the ¥341 million allegedly embezzled by Karpelès, some ¥315 million were used for purchasing a 3D printer business. The prosecutors allege that in addition to the acquisition funds, at least ¥6 million were used to purchase a French luxury bed for Karpelès’ own personal use.\n\nHis lawyers told the court that the remittances were Mt. Gox revenues, rather than customer funds, and that accounting entries related to them were part and parcel of the normal process of exchanging cash for bitcoins, and part of Mt. Gox’s business model.\n\nThe prosecutors seemed confused as to how bitcoin exchanges work. The defense also argued that purchase of the 3D printer business was done as part of the Mt. Gox business plan and that the other money spent was from Karpelès’ salary as a CEO and not taken from corporate funds. Karpelès, the defense said, did not personally profit from the purchase of the new business.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

If the prosecution insists that this act is embezzlement or special breech of trust, then that would mean in our country [Japan] several hundred thousands of these crimes are committed every year.”\n\nWhen Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, it reported that 850,000 bitcoins, worth over $400 million at the time, had disappeared or been stolen by hackers. Later Karpelès found 200,000 bitcoins in “cold storage” and turned it over to the trustee. Ironically, when bitcoin reached a historic high for two days on June 11, trading at over $3,000 a coin—it would have been possible for the trustee to pay all the creditors the money they had lost. The Mt. Gox trustee holds 200,000 bitcoins which would have been worth over $600 million, almost $200 million more than the estimated $400 million owed to creditors. According to a report in the Asahi Shimbun, the trustee is considering cashing in the coins to pay back the creditors.\n\nBut what about the other missing 650,000 bitcoins? The police and prosecutors have no idea where they are and at this point in time, no interest in finding out. Lead defense attorney Nobuyasu Ogata and the legal team representing Karpelès argued in their opening statement Tuesday:\n\n“In order to find out the truth of why Mt. Gox collapsed and what really happened, the defendant cooperated with the police, giving them access to data, hoping they would find the hacker. However, this case has absolutely nothing to do with the company’s collapse... The collapse of Mt. Gox was an international scandal. The Tokyo Police Department began to investigate it as a hacking case, but unable to find the criminal, or prove what happened, and unable to publicly admit it they decided they must do something, they arrested Mark Karpelès instead. By the end of the trial, we will make it clear why an innocent man was prosecuted and that he is not guilty of all the spurious charges that the prosecution has drawn up.”\n\nThe case has taken an unusually long time to come to trial in part because the police arrested and rearrested Karpelès hoping that he would make a confession to the whereabouts of the missing coins. He did not.\n\nThe police and prosecutors failed to get a complete financial statement of the firm in the initial stages of the investigation. At one point, according to sources in the prosecutor’s office, the judge handling the preparation of the case told the prosecutors, “Stop tacking on charges. A throw-everything-at-the-wall-and-hope-that-something-sticks approach to prosecuting an individual is not acceptable. And get the accounting done correctly.”\n\nThe Japanese police do not excel at investigating cyber crimes and in the past have arrested several individuals for making threats and other crimes after they were framed by a rogue hacker. One of the innocent victims was browbeaten into making a confession even though he had not committed the crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue for about six months."", 'Investors are still forging ahead with digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum despite the recent volatility. Many experts and professional investors still believe that there are unprecedented returns on offer.\n\nUnknown territory\n\nInvestors in traditional markets are not used to seeing swings of 50 percent in a month for an asset, such as what happened to Ethereum which dropped from nearly $400 to just over $200, as well as experiencing a flash crash.\n\nThere has also been a huge correction in Bitcoin price that has seen it fall from its high of $3,000. Despite this though, predictions for digital currency are still aimed astronomically skyward. It is because of the popularity and huge increase in uptake that these digital currencies are on the rise, but also due to companies looking into the technology behind it.\n\nTipping point\n\nDave Chapman, managing director of Hong Kong-based commodities and digital assets trading house Octagon Strategy, believes that the rollercoaster ride is only just beginning and that there is a massive rise around the corner.\n\n""We\'re now sort of at a tipping point, where people are now considering Bitcoin or Ethereum or digital assets as more mainstream,"" he told CNBC:\n\n""A lot of the people that we service are actually very comfortable with having one percent of their net worth into Bitcoin or Ethereum. To them, it\'s just a natural extension of all their diversification of their portfolio.”\n\nReturn potential\n\nTraditional investment asset classes such as properties, precious metals or index funds, are now being uttered alongside these digital investment options which offer almost fanciful return potential.\n\nThe volatility of digital currency is something that these traditional investors struggle with the most, but it is a weighing out of the pros and cons of such fluctuation and returns that are exceedingly attractive from these digital assets.\n\nThe CEO of BTCC, a Chinese Bitcoin exchange, Bobby Lee almost shrugged off the violent price swings that have been seen this week pointing towards how young digital currency is as an asset.\n\n""It\'s not a problem,"" he said at the Rise conference in Hong Kong. ""If you think about it, the volatility is natural for an asset class that is so new. There\'s no price discovery for it (yet).""\n\nOf course, another factor that has many investors nervous about taking the plunge is that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are unregulated and decentralized, offering very little protection.\n\nThere are steps in countries like China, Russia and Japan, as well as Switzerland, to control cryptocurrency somewhat but without stifling it.', 'Just hours before two audience members urged viewers to “Buy Bitcoin” during Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s testimony Wednesday, banking giant Morgan Stanley released a decidedly less glowing recommendation of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe skinny of the Morgan Skinny’s analysis: Rather than buying bitcoin, owners need to be spending it.\n\n“Bitcoin acceptance is virtually zero and shrinking,” the team of Morgan Stanley analysts led by James Faucette wrote.\n\nThe bank notes that while five online merchants out of the top 500 tracked by e-commerce analytics site Internet Retailer accepted Bitcoin last year, that figure has now shrunk to three.\n\nPart of the problem?\n\n“Bitcoin owners are reluctant to use the cryptocurrency given its rate of appreciation,” they wrote.\n\nStill, it’s understandable why investors have been so hesitant about spending the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has been on a winning streak for the majority of this year. And it is hard to spend something when it has the potential to add $200 in a day or go from say $25 dollars to $22 million over the course of seven years.\n\n“The [Bitcoin] ecosystem has focused more on value speculation rather than the foot leather-eating work of increasing acceptance,” the team wrote. That focus, they added, has made it “way easier to trade speculatively than convince new merchants to accept the cryptocurrency.”\n\nAs of now, Bitcoin is facing several challenges in its path toward mainstream usage. In the U.S., for example, the regulatory infrastructure for dealing with the currency is still bare.\n\nStill, for at least one retailer that accepts Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency is still flowing. Online furniture retailer Overstock.com said earlier this year that it now handles about 100,000 Bitcoin transactions a week, up from 30,000 a year earlier. And while it’s not being used by the major retailers noted by Morgan Stanley, it is increasingly accepted by marijuana dispensaries.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s note comes at a time when investors from BlackRock to Mark Cuban are crying “bubble” on the cryptocurrency, which has breached several all-time highs this year.', 'A private bank in Switzerland is offering its clients services to help them better manage their bitcoin holdings.\n\nFalcon Group announced today that it is launching the product, one aimed specifically at allowing customers to buy and hold bitcoin with their traditional accounts. The services are being offered in partnership with Bitcoin Suisse AG, a bitcoin brokerage founded in 2013.\n\nArthur Vayloyan, global head of products and services for Falcon, said in a statement:\n\n""We are proud to be the first-mover in the Swiss private banking area to provide blockchain asset management for our clients. Falcon is convinced that the time is right to enter this nascent market and it is our firm belief that this new product will fulfill our clients\' future needs.""\n\nAs part of the announcement, Falcon also revealed it has installed a bitcoin ATM in the lobby of its Zurich headquarters that will be open for public use. The integration reportedly came about following discussion with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).\n\nWhile it\'s rare for a bank to openly embrace cryptocurrency, Switzerland has emerged as active in supporting blockchain-related initiatives in both the public and private sectors. Just yesterday, for example, the Swiss Federal Council revealed the regulator is ""swiftly"" moving toward a legal designation of digital currencies.\n\nIn addition, the city of Zug, which has openly expressed its intent to help move forward the adoption of blockchain technology, and which is backing an industry consortium called the Crypto Valley Association, recently revealed it intends to launch a digital identity service that utilizes the tech this fall.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

According to bitcoin evangelist Paul McNeal, bitcoin\'s blockchain network, the technology that delivers bitcoins, can only process so much information at a time. To put it in more technical language, the ""blocks"" that carry information in the chain are limited in their size to 1 megabyte (MB).\n\nThis, McNeal says, was done on purpose to protect the network from hackers and other cybersecurity threats. But as the number of people using the cryptocurrency has increased, so too has the time it takes for transactions to process. This has made bitcoin transactions more expensive, which is one reason why merchants have been slow to accept it as a form of payment, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThat said, bitcoin faces a chicken and the egg dilemma. Consumers have limited places to spend their bitcoins and it appears merchants do not have enough consumers to make it worth their time to invest the energy and capital to understand and accept it.\n\n""This blockchain size issue has drawn a battle line between two main camps,"" McNeal told Business Insider. ""On one side you have folks, mostly miners, who think the size of ""blocks"" should increase because it would be financially lucrative to do so, and those who want to maintain the status quo - safety and security of the network.""\n\nThe folks who want to maintain the size of the blocks are referred to as the ""core developers."" According to McNeal, they are the guys who maintain the code and are responsible for implementing changes when necessary for future innovation. By doing so they keep the blockchain stable.\n\nTheir view is that an increase in the size of blocks above the current 1 MB cap would jeopardize the entire network.\n\nAs such, they have come up with an alternative solution to the problem called SegWit. According to reporting by Bloomberg\'s Lulu Yilun Chen and Yuji Nakamura, this solution would move some activity on the bitcoin blockchain to an outside network.\n\n""But moving data off the blockchain effectively diminishes the influence of miners, the majority of whom are based in China and who have invested millions on giant server farms,"" Chen and Nakamura wrote.\n\nIn order to find middle ground, some ""business executives and miners"" created a proposal called SegWit2X, which would move the threshold for implementing SegWit down to 80% and also allow for a small increase in the size of blocks on the chain to 2 MB, according to McNeal.\n\nBut ""fundamentalists"" on both sides of the argument are holding their position. This could eventually lead to a split in the bitcoin world, thereby creating more than one bitcoin currency.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nHayes told Business Insider that a split, or fork, is very likely.\n\n""Support for SegWit2x has reached levels unseen for previous solutions,"" according to Bloomberg with about 85% of miners reporting they will agree to the new bitcoin setup.\n\nThose who hold out will either remain with the old system or adopt their own. When all is said and done, Hayes thinks there could be up to four different bitcoin iterations.\n\nAs a result, the price of bitcoin will continue to rise and fall sporadically until the August 1 deadline, according to Hayes. He expects nervous bitcoin investors to move over to Ethereum, the popular bitcoin rival. On Wednesday the price of an ether token, the token powered by the Ethereum blockchain, was up 20%. But that doesn\'t mean he\'s bearish on bitcoin.\n\n""Sure, people are going to get out as a result of this uncertainty and the price will fall,"" Hayes said.\n\n""But there are people with billions of dollars of skin in the game and they will ultimately go with the superior bitcoin network, and then the market will follow,"" Hayes concluded.\n\nIn the end, he thinks the winning bitcoin could reach $5,000 a coin.', 'Retailers were already skeptical about letting customers pay with bitcoin before the cryptocurrency’s price underwent an astronomical rally this year. That rapid surge hasn’t made them any more accepting. In fact, it may have done the opposite.\n\nBitcoin is accepted at just three of the top 500 online merchants tracked by the e-commerce news and analytics publication Internet Retailer, down from five last year, Morgan Stanley payments analyst James Faucette wrote Wednesday in a report, highlighting the ""striking"" discrepancy between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin’s recent gains.\n\n""Bitcoin owners are reluctant to use the cryptocurrency given its rate of appreciation, more evidence that bitcoin is more asset than currency,"" Faucette said. ""Way easier to trade speculatively than convince new merchants to accept the cryptocurrency.""\n\nThe hesitance among retailers may also be linked to bitcoin’s scaling challenges, as transactions become slower and more costly, he added. The consumer, rather than the retailer, bears that cost, which can vary depending on how the transaction in conducted.\n\nInternet Retailer’s 2017 top 500 list, which is based on online sales, is led by Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Morgan Stanley, which based its usage analysis on the information, didn’t say which companies are using bitcoin.\n\nSome cryptocurrency users no longer see the point in using bitcoin for small purchases given increased transaction fees, Atlantic Financial founder Bruce Fenton said in an interview last month.\n\nRead: Bitcoin Is Digital Gold. But Will You Buy a Sandwich With It?\n\n""There’s a problem with the fees being so high -- it does price out certain things,"" said Fenton, who is a board member at the Bitcoin Foundation.

This is possible due to a partnership between bitcoin broker Bitpanda and Austria’s leading postal service provider, Austrian Post.\n\nAlso read: Japanese Bitcoin Exchange Bitpoint Expands into Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan\n\n1,800+ Postal Locations\n\nEuropean bitcoin broker Bitpanda was founded in October 2014 as Coinimal. The Vienna startup rebranded as Bitpanda in June 2016. The company claims to have over 300,000 users currently, with almost 200 million euros in transaction volume.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bitpanda announced that bitcoin, ether, dash, and litecoin can now be purchased at all postal locations throughout Austria. According to the Post’s website, there are “more than 1,800 postal branches and Austrian Post partners throughout Austria.”\n\nBitpanda believes that by partnering with the Post, it will increase both its user base as well as its transaction volume. The company’s co-founder Eric Demuth said:\n\nDigital currencies will become central points in our daily lives, but they are not in conflict with classical currencies.\n\nBuying Bitpanda Vouchers\n\nAt any post office counter in Austria, customers can buy Bitpanda’s paper vouchers in denominations of 50, 100 or 500 euros. After purchasing, they will receive a code per voucher to redeem for their choice of the four cryptocurrencies on the Bitpanda website.\n\nThis service is called “Bitpanda to go” and is exclusively offered through the Post. “All you need is an email address,” the company explained. There are currently three verification levels; starter, bronze, and gold. A fourth level, silver, will be coming soon. Only the starter level is needed to redeem vouchers, which only requires an email address to verify. For other services, “the verification level of your account determines how many bitcoins you can buy/sell each day. A higher verification level will lead to higher limits in your account,” the company detailed.\n\nSome Other Redemption Cards\n\nBitpanda is not the first to offer physically-sold, redeemable vouchers for bitcoin. In nearby France, the European bitcoin broker Bitit offers prepaid gift cards for euros that work similarly to Bitpanda’s vouchers. The cards are now part of a network of physical gift cards that are sold at over 150,000 locations across Europe, according to the exchange.\n\nSouth Korea’s Coinplug exchange also sells bitcoins at convenience stores. Their vouchers called Okbitcards are available at over 4,000 7-11 and Ministop locations across the country, redeemable through a smartphone app. In Canada, Bitaccess offers a similar service using Flexepin vouchers at 6,000 locations.\n\nIn next-door Switzerland, the nation’s federal railway company, SBB, started selling bitcoins directly from their ticketing kiosks late last year.\n\nWhat do you think about Austrian Post selling vouchers redeemable for cryptocurrencies?

Industry firms will also be quizzed on whether and how they educate and inform investors and buyers about volatility risks. Two of those companies include bitFlyer and Coincheck, two Tokyo-based exchanges that are the also the largest bitcoin trading platforms in the country.\n\nNotably, the FSA will also examine the exchange’s books to see if it manages its digital holdings separately from customers’ funds. Bitcoin platforms’ maintenance and inspection habits of its own trading systems will also be looked into. If and when the FSA deems all of the checks to be satisfactory, only then will a company be able to apply for a license.\n\nAs reported by CCN in early May, 18 companies are set to launch bitcoin exchanges in Japan to help fulfill the growing demand for the cryptocurrency. Tellingly, 10 of those companies are new entrants to the bitcoin market, including the likes of Japanese internet giant GMO which launched a bitcoin trading platform later that month. The marked uptick in investments and the subsequent growth of Japan’s bitcoin industry comes after recent legislation that acknowledged bitcoin as a legal method of payment in the country.\n\nAs a part of the new law, bitcoin exchanges and brokers will be required to be registered under the FSA. However, no company was registered as of June’s end. Today’s report ads that business already operating as a bitcoin exchange prior to April ‘may be put off registering until the end of September’ presumably to ensure they have everything in order.

07/13/2017,"['Bitcoin’s uptake with popular and leading online retailers has been slow, but since its rapid surge in value and interest recently, it has regressed. Fewer, rather than more, retailers are accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nLast year five retailers in the world’s top 500 biggest online stores were accepting Bitcoin according to the publication Internet Retailer, now, however, it has emerged that the figure is down to just three.\n\nWhere is the growth?\n\nIt is a perplexing discrepancy in the growth of Bitcoin to its acceptance by online merchants, as noted by Morgan Stanley payments analyst James Faucette. He believes that Bitcoin\'s growth in value is actually a contributing factor to its decline as a functional currency.\n\nFaucette said:\n\n""Bitcoin owners are reluctant to use the cryptocurrency given its rate of appreciation, more evidence that Bitcoin is more asset than currency. Way easier to trade speculatively than convince new merchants to accept the cryptocurrency.""\n\nThus, the fact that people are far happier to hold onto their Bitcoins as an asset rather than a functioning currency means that there is little pressure on retailers to adopt it as another form of payment.\n\nSlow and expensive\n\nOn top of this Bitcoin is facing a number of issues that are making it difficult to use in the context of everyday shopping. The scaling debate continues to rage as it became evident that Bitcoin stuttered when too many transactions were pushed through its Blockchain.\n\nSlower, more costly, transactions are issues that would be hurting the retailer far more than the customer. Transaction prices hovering around $5 will have a huge impact on the retailer who has to bear the expenses.\n\nPricing out\n\nWhen these fees hit such high levels, they essentially cut out a huge portion of the retail market as it becomes nonsensical to use Bitcoin for smaller, less expensive transactions.\n\nAtlantic Financial founder and a board member at the Bitcoin Foundation Bruce Fenton said in an interview that things like sandwiches and coffees are not viable markets for Bitcoin to operate in because the fee can be more than the cost of the item.\n\nFenton notes:\n\n""There’s a problem with the fees being so high - it does price out certain things. There are some micro transaction use cases - a cup of coffee is the big analogy everybody uses - that are being sort of priced out just because Bitcoin is going up so much.""\n\nStill some success stories\n\nIt is not all doom and gloom in the world of retail and Bitcoin though. In Japan, the adoption into brick and mortar stores is on the rise. Recruitment Lifestyle, a retail giant, has implemented a Point of Sale app that is Bitcoin-ready for 260,000 of its stores. Even its popular electronics market place, Akihabara, is on a huge Bitcoin adoption drive.\n\nIn the United States, champion of Bitcoin in retail, Overstock.com has said that since it started accepting the digital currency in 2014, it has seen triple the transactions coming through its online doors.', 'Thomas Trutschel/Getty\n\nA Swiss bank is now offering to buy bitcoins for its clients. As of Wednesday, investors can ask their asset manager at Falcon Private Bank, a boutique investment firm headquartered in Zurich, to purchase and store bitcoin on their behalf – a first for conventional banks. Despite the cryptocurrency’s infamous volatility, this is another indication that is here to stay.\n\n“We have various clients that are interested in buying bitcoin for investment purposes, and we’re making it very convenient for them,” says Arthur Vayloyan, the global head of products and services at Falcon. Because Falcon will be doing the buying and storing of the digital coins, its customers won’t require any specialist knowledge to switch their cash into bitcoin. The Swiss financial authority, FINMA, granted Falcon regulatory approval on Tuesday.\n\nBut some worry that people may be underestimating the importance of decentralisation to the digital currency. Traditional banks that hold large sums of bitcoin for their customers will be obvious targets for hackers. “It’s a lot easier to steal digital currency than a traditional currency,” say Andreas Antonopoulos, host of the Let’s Talk Bitcoin podcast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpaced out\n\n“This is why decentralisation is so important,” Antonopoulos says. Indeed, Bitcoin is built on decentralisation. Instead of central banks and governments, Bitcoin relies on a network of computers that anyone can join to check the legitimacy of transactions. Every Bitcoin is accounted for on a digital ledger called the blockchain that records how many coins each digital wallet holds.\n\nWhenever currency changes hands, everyone on the network updates their copy of the blockchain too. Underpinning the whole system is some complex mathematics that makes it incredibly difficult to deceive or control without infeasible amounts of computing power.\n\nThe wallets are decentralised too. Instead of bank accounts, anyone can create and store their own bitcoin wallet. Because there is no centralised collection of wallets, there is no central target for hackers to try to steal large amounts of digital currency. Or at least that’s the idea (in practice centralised pockets can emerge).\n\nPut lots of wallets in the same place, and the system may no longer hold. If a thousand people each hold a single bitcoin, a certain level of security will be sufficient protection. However, if one place holds a thousand bitcoin, you increase the appeal to hackers a thousand-fold too, which means you have to similarly up the security. “But there is no way to do this. By putting in more eggs you make the basket weaker,” says Antonopoulos.\n\nHack attack\n\nWe have seen this problem before in exchanges, where people trade different digital and traditional currencies. The biggest of these until 2014 was Mount Gox, which at the time was handling more than half of all bitcoin transactions. In February of that year, 850,000 bitcoins corresponding to $450 million at the time went missing, with most thought to have been stolen by hackers.\n\nOnly a few years ago, many conventional banks still thought that bitcoin was doomed to fail, but as the price has soared and it has continued to survive, it has become too attractive for investors to resist. In 2012, you could buy a bitcoin for less than $10, last month they were selling for a record high of $3000. Illustrating the currency’s volatility, it’s currently trading at just under $2500, but overall has tripled in value in the last year alone.\n\nUsers of Falcon’s bitcoin service will have to sign a waiver to show that they understand the risks, as they would with other high risk investments. In future, the bank plans to expand to other digital currencies.', ""Eine weitere Bank springt auf den Bitcoin-Zug auf: Ab sofort bietet die Onlinebank Swissquote auf ihrer Handelsplattform Anlagen in der virtuellen Währung Bitcoin an.\n\nSwissquote sei damit die erste europäische Onlinebank mit diesem Angebot, schreibt das Institut in einer Mitteilung vom Freitag.

Aufgrund der Anonymität wird Bitcoin häufig auch mit kriminellen Aktivitäten in Verbindung gebracht.\n\nBitcoin - kurz erklärt:\n\n(sda/me/jfr)"", '', 'Giving early adopters the first access to new technologies can help diffuse those technologies among the masses. A notable example is Google’s rollout of Gmail: In 2004, about 1,000 select users were given exclusive access and told to invite others. This campaign was so successful that at one point before the email service went mainstream Gmail invites were selling for more than $150 on eBay.\n\nBut what if early adopters are, in contrast, denied access at the initial stage of a rollout? That could greatly stifle broader diffusion, according to a unique new study by MIT researchers that examines adoption rates of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin among MIT students.\n\nIn 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Project offered all incoming freshman access to $100 worth of bitcoins. MIT Sloan School of Management professors Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker saw this as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to study the role of early adopters in spreading technology in a controlled environment, says Catalini, who is the Fred Kayne Career Development Professor of Entrepreneurship. Tucker is the Sloan Distinguished Professor of Management.\n\nDuring the rollout, the researchers randomly delayed giving half the students their bitcoin allotment by a couple of weeks. Students who were identified as early adopters of Bitcoin, but whose payment was delayed, cashed out their balance and abandoned the technology at nearly twice the rate of early adopters who received their payment earlier. The early adopters who cashed out also influenced those around them to do the same in high numbers.\n\nCash-out rates among early adopters were also amplified in dorms, especially smaller dorms where the delayed or non-delayed status of students would be more well-known, indicating that early adopters need to feel like they are part of an exclusive group in order to stick with new technologies.\n\nPublished today in Science, the paper is the first to examine what happens when natural early adopters (NEAs) are purposely denied first, exclusive access to new technologies, Catalini says. “When you study new technologies, how fast and in what ways [they] diffuse through society, you never get to see what would have happened if things had unfolded differently,” he says.\n\nCreating two “parallel universes”\n\nOf the 4,494 MIT freshmen offered access to Bitcoin, about 3,100 joined the researchers’ experiment. Those students had five days to sign up on a waiting list, complete a survey, and create a digital wallet.\n\nThe researchers first identified which students exhibited natural early adopter (NEA) traits compared to the other students, whom they refer to as natural late adopters (NLAs). They classified as NEAs the first 25 percent of students who signed up to the waiting list, all within the first 24 hours. Surveys showed that those NEAs were also more likely to be top computer programmers, to have built mobile apps, and to use peer-to-peer payment apps, among other identifiers. These characteristics align with popular definitions of early adopters, who generally possess advanced technical skills that help them start using new technologies.\n\nBitcoins were distributed a few weeks after the signups. But the researchers randomly delayed distribution of the bitcoins to 50 percent of the students, both NEAs and NLAs, by another two weeks. They then tracked all Bitcoin transactions through the blockchain — the digital ledger used by Bitcoin — and through the students’ digital wallets.\n\nRandomly delaying access created two “parallel universes,” Catalini says, in which to study the S-Curve — the measure of the speed of adoption of innovation in societies. “In one universe, we ended up seeding Bitcoin in the optimal way, by giving it first to early adopters and later to everybody else. In the other parallel universe, the opposite was likely to happen,” he says.\n\nFindings were surprising. The two-week cash-out rate of the NEAs who received their bitcoins late rose to 18 percent, well over the non-delayed NEA cash-out rate of 11 percent. “That people, on all accounts, who were supposed to be NEAs of Bitcoin would abandon it was surprising to us,” Catalini says.\n\nBoth groups of late adopters, on the other hand, showed cash-out rates of roughly 10 percent, suggesting they were indifferent to the delay.\n\nThe cost and value of exclusivity\n\nThe researchers then studied the underlying mechanism of high cash-out rates by comparing behaviors of students living off campus to those in dorms, which function as social clusters.\n\nIn dorms, where it was likely more noticeable which students had received their bitcoins on time, delayed early adopters were 4.3 times more likely to cash out than non-delayed late adopters. Moreover, in smaller dorms, where students are even more aware of each other, or in dorms where NEAs are rarer, cash-out rates among delayed NEAs rose sharply again over their peers. Off campus, however, there was no measurable difference in cash-out rates among early and late adopters, delayed or not.\n\n“When you take students out of the social environment — where comparisons are made and people are aware of each other receiving versus not receiving Bitcoin — we do not see that [cash-out] activity,” Catalini says.\n\nThis points to NEAs finding some value — monetary or socially — in having exclusive access to new technologies, the researchers write: “Our results highlight a novel, understudied mechanism through which NEAs might obstruct further diffusion if they refuse to adopt because their desire to feel unique is challenged or the consumption value they derive from early, exclusive access is reduced.”\n\nBut this behavior also has a “spillover” effect, where NLAs were more likely to drop Bitcoin if NEAs did — possibly because late adopters rely on early adopters to learn about new technologies, Catalini says. After 225 days, the researchers found dorms with an above-the-median share of delayed NEAs had 45 percent fewer active Bitcoin users.\n\n“That’s a large difference,” Catalini says. “This behavior by early adopters, where you see them abandon Bitcoin, seems to have repercussions on everyone else.”\n\nNoting the MIT study’s idiosyncratic setting, Catalini says the results offer a couple of key insights for tech firms. Identifying NEAs before going to market may be valuable, instead of relying on people lining up outside of the store. Firms could then fulfill the NEAs’ need to feel exclusive and capitalize on their potential to encourage wider adoption.\n\n“In settings where the decision to adopt is a social decision, where comparisons or conversations are taking place in communities and when there is uncertainty about the value of an innovation, it can be important for firms to take advantage of early adopters, as they do create this positive effect of others,” Catalini says. “But that comes with a cost, which is exclusivity.”\n\nAvi Goldfarb, a professor of marketing at the University of Toronto, says the study’s results are “interesting and surprising” and “the method is novel” in tracking a type of “what-if?” scenario of diffusion. “Diffusion research has suffered because it is difficult to know what would have happened [had] a new product not appeared,” he says. “Unlike many other areas of research where experiments have taken off, research on new product adoption and diffusion has been limited to observational data. So, a key part of the long-term impact of this paper on the field is to show how to embed experimental design into research on diffusion.”\n\nMoreover, Goldfarb adds, “it does all this in the fascinating context of Bitcoin. We still do not know much about how people will use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. This paper helps us understand some of the challenges of launching such a currency, even without a technology-savvy population.”\n\nTucker points out that the Bitcoin experiment proved to be a boon to the majority of MIT undergraduates. More than 50 percent held on to their bitcoins, possibly hoping for the price to increase further, Tucker says. The $100 in Bitcoin they were given in 2014 is now worth more than $700. Many MIT students have also started experimenting and building novel apps in this space.\n\nThe researchers are currently working on another paper based on the study that examines the decision students made in terms of securing the privacy of their online transactions.', '', 'Business Insider executive editor Sara Silverstein discusses a recent research note from Fundstrat\'s Tom Lee says bitcoin could be a true substitute for gold and cannibalize some of the $7.5 trillion market. Lee estimates the cryptocurrency could be worth $20,300 by 2022. This estimate is based largely on the assumption that bitcoin can increase its share of the ""alternative currency"" market, which is mostly gold, from 0.7% to 5%.', 'The city of Zug, commonly known as the ‘Crypto Valley’ for hosting a number of industry startups, has announced a new Ethereum-based identity service for residents.\n\nCome September this year, residents of Zug will be use a mobile app to connect their identity with a cryptographic address on the Ethereum blockchain.

07/14/2017,"['Much of the bitcoin community is resistant to the idea of centralized control.\n\nSo it shouldn\'t come as a surprise that some have developed a similar opposition to bitcoin scaling proposals that appear to have centralized leadership.\n\nAnd, some would argue there\'s no bigger offender in this vein than Segwit2x.\n\nA majority of major mining pools have pledged to trigger Segwit2x with their combined computing power by the end of this month, activating a long-awaited (though contentious) code change known as Segregated Witness (SegWit) that\'s been at the center of bitcoin\'s scaling debate. Later on, it would set the network down a road to a possible hard fork.\n\nBut, a sizable group of bitcoin users isn\'t looking to follow the lead of mining pools.\n\nMistrustful of this mining group, especially its particularly large players, some users are moving forward with a controversial proposal called BIP 148 on August 1.\n\nIf mining pools do indeed lock in SegWit by the end of the month, UASF supporters might not need to move forward with BIP 148. But they aren\'t sure if mining pools will follow through.\n\n""Unfortunately a few miners ... have a record of manipulation, so their signaling for SegWit2x can\'t be trusted,"" blockchain startup founder and BIP 148 supporter Ragnar Lifthrasir told CoinDesk.\n\nBIP 148 seeks to enact a user-activated soft fork (UASF) which would find node operators upgrading to SegWit.\n\nYet, the move is interesting because of Segwit2x\'s popularity and the recent commitment from mining pools to activate SegWit before August. When asked about this, the UASF\'s GitHub maintainer, Mi?osz Kwiatkowski, responded similar to Lifthrasir, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""Probably because some miners have not made themselves look very trustworthy in the past, and some are actively plotting an attack on the network in the future.""\n\nKwiatkowski added users want to ""feel protected"" in the case mining pools do not follow through with the Segwit2x agreement.\n\nMental tool\n\nMistrust isn\'t the only reason some users continue to support the BIP 148 path.\n\nSome believe the expectation of a UASF activation could change what mining pools do and whether or not they follow through with upgrades to the network.\n\nLifthrasir referenced litecoin as an example, noting how mining pools united around SegWit to upgrade the lesser-known cryptocurrency earlier this year. He believes miners only did so after the litecoin community rallied around a UASF, since this type of soft fork could undermine miner\'s perceived influence.\n\n""To me, Segwit2x is equivalent to the litecoin roundtable, a way for miners to adopt SegWit before the users do it for them,"" Lifthrasir said.\n\nHe believes the same is already happening on bitcoin.\n\n""BIP 148 is already succeeding in two ways. First, the current all-time high for miners signaling for SegWit is a result of the threat of BIP 148,"" he said.\n\nThe original SegWit stalled for months at about 30% hashrate, but around the time BIP148 saw increased interest, this support saw an increase to roughly 45%.\n\nAlthough Lifthrasir isn\'t taking the mining pool\'s Segwit2x pledge for granted, he believes they probably will trigger the change since it\'s in their own interest.\n\nThis idea could be a relieving thought, as support for BIP 148 hasn\'t grown very much over the past month. And while it\'s success relies in large part on the support of major bitcoin exchanges and companies, with two weeks to go, most have not taken a public position on it.\n\nIf not enough of the bitcoin ecosystem supports the BIP148 chain, bitcoin could split into two competing assets.\n\n\'Boycott on steroids\'\n\nThat\'s why BIP 148 is highly controversial.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core contributors, for example, are supportive of upgrading bitcoin to support SegWit, many are wary of doing it the way BIP 148 lays out.\n\nSome of bitcoin\'s most active protocol developers don\'t support BIP 148. Bitcoin protocol startup Chaincode co-founder Alex Morcos and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell are both outspoken opponents. And Bitcoin Core contributor David Harding called it a ""boycott on steroids.""\n\nAlthough deadlines for both BIP 148 and SegWit2x are approaching, there are other longer-term options for boosting transaction capacity, one by way of a different UASF. The upside is that these could be less disruptive in that they require less action from mining pools. The downside is the longer time to activation.\n\nStill, despite this divide, some developers and users plan to move forward with BIP 148 on August 1. In this way, it\'s perhaps been more of a user-driven change, with users such as Coinkite co-founder and CEO Rodolfo Novak and developer Damian Mee advocating for the specific proposal change from early on.\n\nLifthrasir concluded:\n\n""BIP 148 is about more than activating SegWit, it\'s about activating user sovereignty.""\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which acted as organizer for the SegWit2x proposal and has an ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nBreaking ties image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin’s dominance then reached 37 percent on June 20, putting the cryptocurrency on the verge of losing its champion position.\n\nBitcoin conserves its premium status\n\nThe big hype that accompanied Ethereum gaining steam is now calming down, as the convergent trend of the market caps of BTC and ETH became a divergent one. The Flippening might still happen, but the trend is now towards the “Floppening” - a joke term that describes the near miss of Ethereum, which is now struggling to remain over the $200 bar.\n\nThe extreme volatility of the crypto-market shows once more that even major currencies like Ethereum can lose half of their cap in mere days. While Bitcoin dropped significantly as well, it nonetheless better resisted to the recent crypto-massacre. Its market cap decreased from $46 bln to $38 bln, and even though its dominance is far from its position in early 2017, its premium status is still conserved.\n\nHopes for the Flippening at bay\n\nThe massive and record-breaking ICOs of June/July have revealed serious weaknesses in the Ethereum network, causing many to question how much “better” it really is than Bitcoin.\n\nDuring its token sale, the strong hype around Bancor led to a significant increase in pending transactions, as buyers attempted to acquire BNTs. Consequently, the whole Ethereum network was impacted for many hours from such a rush.\n\nPending transactions end up in a dedicated memory space on the network’s nodes, which is more commonly called “backlog.” When this space is saturated, transactions take greater amounts of time to be validated that can go up to hours, as the Bancor case showed.\n\nRegarding congestion, however, it is the Status token sale that created the most on Ethereum. The ICO registered the highest ever number of daily transactions on the network: 308,488.\n\nAs a result, the Ethereum network got clogged up and started slowing down significantly. This network paralysis was so strong that many exchange platforms temporarily blocked ETH withdrawals. MyEtherWallet, one of the most popular ETH wallets, even displayed a note discouraging users to send ETH if their transaction was not urgent.\n\nThese recent network congestions reveal that Ethereum is suffering from currency-specific challenges, which put hopes for the Flippening at bay. The BTC/ETH currency pair has now moved in favor of Bitcoin, but the future remains uncertain as we move towards major upgrades for both cryptocurrencies.', ""This content was published on July 14, 2017 10:17 AM Jul 14, 2017 - 10:17\n\nBitcoins have taken a step towards acceptance by the traditional Swiss banking community. (Keystone)\n\nTwo mainstream Swiss financial companies have started offering bitcoin investments to clients. Falcon private bank and online trading platform Swissquote became the first fully regulated Swiss institutions to foray into cryptocurrencies this week.\n\n\n\nZurich-based Falconexternal link became the first traditional wealth manager in the country to embrace bitcoinexternal link on Wednesday after being given the green light by the Swiss financial regulator. Two days later, Swissquoteexternal link said it has teamed up with Luxembourg trader Bitstamp - the only such exchange with a European Union licence for cryptocurrency trading – to offer bitcoin investments for its 303,000 clients.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts hopes that its introduction into the established Swiss financial system may signal a shift in attitude – from distrust to acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\n“Many investors are interested in cryptocurrencies, but are afraid to trade them because the players in this market are mostly little known and they often require the transfer of funds to a foreign account,” Swissquote CEO Marc Bürki said in a statementexternal link. “As a Swiss bank, we offer our clients a transparent, simplified process without foreign transfers, that is within the reach of everybody.”\n\nSwissquote clients will be able to invest between €/$5 and €/$100,000 with each transaction, but only if they can cover the trade with their own funds (unleveraged).\n\nOne cryptocurrency brokerage already well established in Switzerland, Bitcoin Suisse, will provide the underlying structure to allow Falcon clients to invest in bitcoin. The private bank said its new service might expand to include other cryptocurrencies in future.\n\nCryptocurrency boom\n\nWith the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soaring in recent months, the bank said it was responding to demand from clients. It has also installed a bitcoin ATM at its Zurich HQ.\n\nOne bitcoin was trading at around $650 a year ago, but the price for the cryptocurrency currently stands at nearly $2,400 (CHF2,300). News of spectacular gains in a number of cryptocurrencies has sparked widespread interest in a financial asset that has been declared dead and buried on numerous occasions.\n\nFalcon private bank has even set up a bitcoin ATM at its Zurich HQ. (Falcon Private Bank)\n\nLucas Betschart, President of Bitcoin Association Switzerland, believes the value of bitcoin will continue to rise in the long-term despite – at times – extreme volatility in the market. The combined worth of bitcoin globally stands at around $40 billion.\n\n“I’m not aware of any other bank where you can hold bitcoins,” Betschart told swissinfo.ch. “This will allow people without technical know-how to hold bitcoins in a secure way. Hopefully it will send a signal to other banks in Switzerland.”\n\nBanks spooked\n\nThe mainstream banking community has not always welcomed cryptocurrencies with open arms. The decentralised blockchain technology on which it operates is viewed as a rival to the financial system.\n\nTracking flows of cryptocurrencies on blockchain is relatively simple, but it is not so easy to identify the identities of traders. This has led to concerns about such digital currencies being used for money laundering or tax evasion. This has spooked many Swiss banks that have been already been hit by global crackdowns on tax evasion in recent years. There have been reports of some Swiss banks refusing to accept cryptocurrency traders as clients, according to Betschart.\n\nThis makes Falcon’s accepting bitcoin into the traditional banking sector all the more significant. Falcon said it will apply ‘strict know your customer’ protocols to its clients using bitcoin to circumvent identity problems.\n\nA Swiss bank offering bitcoin services is an “historic milestone”, Bitcoin Suisse CEO Niklas Nikolajsen said in a statement.\n\n“Falcon Private Bank is, to my knowledge, the first private bank worldwide to offer crypto-assets directly to their clients,” he said. “A bank offering crypto-assets is a game changer, as it gives institutional clients and high net worth individuals a counterparty in regard to crypto-assets upon which they can rely: a regulated Swiss bank”.\n\nCrypto Valley\n\nFalcon will now compete for clients with a range of start-ups in Switzerland offering encrypted digital currency asset management services. These include Bitcoin Suisse and other companies such as Melonport that have set up in Switzerland’s growing Crypto Valley based around Zug.\n\nThe Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has been taking steps in recent years to reduce entry barriers for financial technology (fintech) start-ups. Last year FINMA created rules to allow financial institutions to accept new clients digitally without the need for cumbersome paperwork and created a new category of license for those that accepted less than CHF50 million in deposits.\n\nFINMA said it would not comment on specific cases but added that it has been in contact with several institutions in the last years in the field of cryptocurrencies. At the end of last year, Falcon had CHF14.6 billion of clients’ assets under management.\n\nbitcoin image link Here's how a bitcoin transaction works. Click on the image to enlarge.

It\'s all about differing visions over whether and how quickly to adapt bitcoin for wider use in commerce, as opposed to merely serving as a speculative asset like gold. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Anyone holding the digital currency bitcoin could soon face some unsettling problems — up to and including financial losses, whipsawing prices and delays in processing payments.\n\nThough it\'s also possible that nothing much may change. It all depends on whether the people who maintain bitcoin can agree by July 31 to implement a major software upgrade — one designed to improve capacity on the increasingly clogged network.\n\nNot everyone is on board. In particular, some bitcoin ""miners,"" who are rewarded for verifying transactions, aren\'t supporting the changes. Any split between miners and others who use bitcoin, including a number of startups and a few big companies, could cause a panic in the $39 billion bitcoin marketplace.\n\nHere\'s a look at the current dispute.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin, again?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that\'s not tied to any bank or government. Like cash, it lets users spend or receive money anonymously, or mostly so; like other online payment services, it also lets them do so over the internet.\n\nThe coins are created by computer farms that ""mine"" them and verify other users\' transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles. Miners receive bitcoin in exchange. It\'s also possible to exchange bitcoin for U.S. dollars and other currencies.\n\nBitcoin has been touted as a currency of the future, but so far it hasn\'t proven very popular as a way to pay for goods or services. Its price, however, has soared amid the uncertainty. Bitcoin prices peaked in June above $3,000, and while it\'s fallen back to around $2,300, that\'s still more than triple what it was a year ago.\n\nSo what\'s the fuss about?\n\nIn a word, speed.\n\nThe bitcoin network is limited in how quickly it can shuffle around digital money. As bitcoin has grown, payment delays have become more common and worrisome.\n\nSome software developers came up with a new way to speed things up by re-engineering bitcoin\'s universal ledger, a file called the blockchain. Supporters of the new method include Microsoft, the bitcoin exchange Coinbase and a variety of other bitcoin proponents who would like to see the currency used more widely in commerce.\n\nBut this bitcoin software update doesn\'t have unanimous support.\n\nChristopher David uses a Robocoin kiosk to sell bitcoins outside of the 500 Startups\' Bitcoinference in Mountain View, Calif., in 2014. A civil war between the techies that run bitcoin could cause significant disruption of the digital currency by the end of July 2017, possibly leading to wild price swings, transaction delays and even outright losses. It\'s all about differing visions over whether and how quickly to adapt bitcoin for wider use in commerce, as opposed to merely serving as a speculative asset like gold. (Photo: Jeff Chiu, AP)\n\nWhat happened on July 31?\n\nThe reformers say they\'ve run out of patience, and so have set a deadline for moving to the new system.\n\nAt 8 p.m. Eastern time on July 31, they\'re threatening to stop recognizing transactions confirmed by miners who haven\'t adopted the upgrade. That would create enormous uncertainty in the bitcoin economy, since no one could really know if the bitcoin they\'d just paid (or received) was actually moving through the system the way it\'s supposed to.\n\nSome big bitcoin miners — like Chinese bitcoin mining equipment giant Bitmain — haven\'t signaled support for the new system. A rift could result in two or even more incompatible versions of bitcoin.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWhat would that mean?\n\nGenerally speaking, chaos — though mostly limited to those who use or squirrel away bitcoin. No one using bitcoin could be sure which version they held, or what might happen if they spent it or accepted bitcoin as payment.\n\nTaking bitcoin, for instance, could leave you with currency you couldn\'t spend freely — and that might disappear entirely if it ended up being the ""wrong"" kind.\n\nThat\'s one reason the community-supported website Bitcoin.org warned users Wednesday not to accept any bitcoin up to two days prior to the deadline and to wait for confirmation the situation had been resolved before trading again.\n\n""It\'s a rather awful situation,"" said David Harding, who posted the warning for Bitcoin.org, in an email.\n\nWhat\'s behind the fight?\n\nMoney, of course. Some companies that pool miners together believe the new system could result in lower transaction fees, cutting into their profits. At the same time, the reformers foresee new business opportunities in a faster, more reliable form of bitcoin.\n\nSamson Mow, chief strategy officer at blockchain developer Blockstream, said the looming showdown has been propelled by bitcoin users frustrated at having a ""simple bug fix"" blocked by miners out for profit.\n\n""People are fed up,"" he said. ""The users are taking back their voice.\n\nFollow AP Technology Writer Ryan Nakashima at https://twitter.com/rnakashi\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2uZy9Vr', 'India is tabling ideas on how to integrate Bitcoin into the country\'s regulations and, with banning it being an unpopular option, it seems that a goods-and-services tax may be slapped on instead.\n\nIn recent months a legal framework has been discussed by Indian officials as to how best to integrate the booming digital currency into its structures. A taskforce has been working to determine the legality of things like Bitcoin under the law in India as there was once a thought to place a full blanket ban on the currency in the heavily populated nation.\n\nNow, however, it is being reported that taxes are the probable outcome from this enquiry which will render the cryptocurrency legal, but also affect its growth as a decentralized alternative currency.\n\nIt seems likely that the regulatory regime that comes in to monitor Bitcoin and its affiliated digital currencies will fall under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\n\nThis board will then hope to treat digital currencies much like gold; trading it on registered exchanges and thus promoting a formal tax.\n\nThis will also allow the regulators to keep tabs on the transactions in order to stop nefarious uses such as money laundering, terror funding, and drug trafficking.\n\nCompromise\n\nBanning digital currencies has been discussed in India, but also dismissed, which has led the taskforce to consider alternatives that will allow the government some sort of regulation in order to maintain a supervised ecosystem over the anonymous currency.\n\nOne of the officials told The Hindu Publication:\n\n""Banning will give a clear message that all related activities are illegal and will disincentivize those interested in taking speculative risks, but it was pointed out it will impede tax collection on gains made in such activities and that regulating the currency instead would signal a boost to blockchain technology, encourage the development of a supervision ecosystem (that tracks legal activities and may also assist in tracking illegal activities) and promote a formal tax base.""\n\nThis is but one of the ideas that is being tossed around, with another idea to take a less regulated and controlled stance, leaving the risk in the hands of the users.\n\nIn this case, cryptocurrencies would not be recognised by the government, and all risks associated will fall onto those who use them, but any illegal activities conducted through them will be addressed.\n\nBlockchain technology, however, will be promoted and held in a separate light from the digital currency it supports.', 'Online banking service Swissquote is launching a new bitcoin trading feature in partnership with digital currency exchange Bitstamp.\n\nWith the integration, Swissquote customers will be able to exchange bitcoin for euros and US dollars, and vice versa, through their accounts.

It is impossible to predict the future, there are some dangers to note.\n\nBoth Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) have been on a rollercoaster ride this year, rising in dramatic fashion, suffering losses, then recovering to respectable levels. Scalability appears to be at the heart of the issue.\n\nEthereum prices, for instance, tumbled from $400 to $240 before climbing back to $330. Almost simultaneously investors carved out 25% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization, driving BTC prices from $3,000 to $2,260. While Bitcoin prices eventually bounced back to $2,565, the gyrations left many investors uncertain about the future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nI would argue this pattern–hope, followed by disappointment, followed by redemption–is perfectly in line with the history of technological evolution. One has to look no further than Gartner’s famous model of the Hype Cycle to see its truth.\n\nHere is a brief summary of the Hype Cycle:\n\nExcitement .

As second and third iterations emerge, their use cases become clearer. Growth is now a slower process, but one that actually generates real value. Success. The technology is fully formed and functional. It permeates its addressable market, delivers tangible results, and reaches maturity.\n\nThis sequence is littered throughout the pages of history. In fact, it is applicable to the technology sector as a whole. The frantic pace of investment in the late 1990s reflected an excitement in digital technology, yet it ultimately collapsed in what we now call the Dot Com Crisis.\n\nThe disappointment of that period taught both investors and founders to approach their roles more soberly than they had done previously. As is evident from the sharp peak in 2000, digital technologies have exhibited the very phenomenon that digital currencies are now undergoing.\n\nI would suggest that Bitcoin prices and Ethereum prices are in the midst of Stage 2; that earlier volatility in prices reflected burgeoning disappointment; and that maybe the price correction was an attempt to exorcise the worst elements of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWith this in mind, it is difficult to believe that the worst has passed for both Bitcoin prices and Ethereum prices. There are still questionable initial coin offerings slated across the coming months, and consolidation has yet to take place.\n\nWill Bitcoin and Ethereum Survive?\n\nFor Ethereum, the downward pressures of disappointment were compounded by a flash crash and an internet hoax claiming Ethereum’s founder had died. He did not. The relief that caused may have singlehandedly sparked a rally in Ethereum, however it is not sufficient enough to propel ETH prices through Stages 3 and 4. Only fundamental strength can do that.\n\nDoes Ethereum have what it takes?\n\nI certainly believe it does, especially because the majority of ICOs and applications were birthed on the Ethereum platform. Even if those ICOs or applications don’t survive, the very fact that Ethereum was established as a foundation for the rest of the industry should give it some support.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum has practical use-cases which could sustain the platform.\n\nThere is a consortium of energy companies that found 200 use-cases for blockchain. That consortium begun working with Ethereum recently, so I think there is reasonable hope it will survive the coming purge. (Source: “Energy Sector Turns to Ethereum to Test Blockchain,” Coindesk, May 30, 2017.)\n\nBitcoin is a little trickier, because its success or failure has always rested with its grand ambition of becoming a global currency. The degree of political risk wrapped up in that ambition is incalculable, and is beyond my powers of analysis.\n\nOnly central banks can decide its fate now.\n\nDisclosure: This guest post was written by Gaurav S. Iyer, security analyst for Profit Confidential. He advocates for commonsense, buy-and-hold investing. You can find his daily investment ideas and commentary at ProfitConfidential.com', 'Gold and silver mining might be among the top performing industries since the beginning of 2016, but since last summer, when physical gold peaked above $1,360 an ounce and silver touched $21 an ounce, precious metals have mostly been on the downswing. Over the trailing-one-year period, gold and silver spot prices are down 8% and 21%, according to data from Kitco.\n\nWhy precious metals have lost their luster\n\nWhat on Earth is going on? There have been a number of reasonable explanations for the recent tumble in precious metals.\n\nTo begin with, the Federal Reserve has begun tightening monetary policy, which involves raising its federal funds target rate. This, in turn, has the effect of pushing interest rates and yields on interest-bearing assets higher. Assets like Treasury bonds are a preferred investment vehicle because their returns are nearly guaranteed, whereas buying and holding gold or silver offers no near-guaranteed return, and more important, no yield. Thusly, higher interest rates increases the opportunity cost of owning gold and silver.\n\nAnother issue for precious metals is that we\'ve witnessed economic fundamentals improving. In other words, the unemployment rate is a low 4.4%, and the U.S. stock market has been off to the races, hitting multiple new all-time highs. Precious metals tend to feed off of uncertainty and do their best when equities are heading down or moving sideways. A market where bulls are winning in multiple industries usually equates to selling pressure on gold and silver.\n\nThe precious metals have also faced some exceptionally tough year-over-year demand comparisons. For instance, spot gold\'s nominal increase in value in the first quarter of 2016 was its top quarterly performance in 30 years. This wound up dramatically increasing demand for the lustrous yellow metal among investors and central banks. But according to the World Gold Council, though gold bar and coin demand grew 9% in the first quarter of 2017, overall demand for gold fell 18% year-over-year, mainly due to weaker central bank demand. Investors often forget that supply and demand do matter for precious metals.\n\nIs bitcoin to blame for gold\'s and silver\'s recent woes?\n\nHowever, there could be another reason for the underperformance of gold and silver in the near-term: bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, the blockchain-based cryptocurrency that\'s gained notoriety for challenging monetary theory, has gained 253% over the trailing year, leaving the broader stock market and precious metals firmly in its dust. Some pundits have theorized that bitcoin\'s outperformance, along with other digital currencies like ethereum, have been responsible for pulling investment dollars away from gold and toward cryptocurrencies -- and they may be right.\n\nA quick look at the movement of the U.S. Dollar Index (DJINDICES: DXY) provides evidence to this theory. While there are no ""givens"" when it comes to investing, one of the near-givens is that gold and the U.S. Dollar Index tend to move in opposite directions. A stronger dollar usually means a weaker gold price, and a weaker dollar typically yields a higher gold price. However, over the past couple of months we\'ve witnessed gold and the dollar moving lower in tandem, which is odd to say the least.\n\nWhat\'s more, bitcoin shares a perceived commonality with gold and silver: finiteness. Unless we figure out a way to mine gold and silver from beyond our planet, the amount of resources available for production is finite. Similarly, the number of bitcoin that can be mined is considered finite at 21 million. In theory, it\'s possible that the number of peak bitcoin could be increased by changing its protocol, but as of now it looks unlikely that this would happen. Thus, bitcoin\'s rarity and recent momentum could very well be luring in investors who would otherwise have purchased gold or silver in the past.\n\nGold and silver are your better (and safer) long-term bets\n\nDespite the recent outperformance of digital currencies, this Fool continues to believe that your smartest long-term play is going to be traditional precious metals, or more specifically, precious-metal mining stocks, if given the choice between precious metals and bitcoin.\n\nThe biggest issue bitcoin will have to overcome is demonstrating to investors that it\'s worth nearly $2,400 apiece. But without traditional fundamentals that can be used for comparison and analysis, this could be next to impossible for bitcoin. Not to mention, the cryptocurrency\'s lack of a centralized exchange makes legitimizing the currency all the more difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, gold and silver have been used as a currency and store of value for centuries, and I don\'t foresee that changing anytime soon. These precious metals truly are finite in nature since their ""protocol"" can\'t be altered, period!\n\nSo, what investments in the gold and silver mining industry are worth a look given the recent swoon? One of the smarter ways to play precious-metal stocks is to consider a royalty and streaming company like Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM). Rather than focusing on day-to-day mining activity and exploration, companies like Wheaton Precious Metals provide upfront cash to mining companies looking to expand an existing mine or develop a new one. In return, Wheaton receives long-term or life-of-mine contracts for a percentage of production at a per-ounce cost that\'s well below market rate. In the first quarter, the company\'s average cash costs were just $4.54 an ounce for silver and $391 an ounce for gold, leaving it with a massive gross margin.\n\nMining companies with exceptionally low costs are also a good idea to consider. Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX), one of the largest precious-metal miners on the planet, has worked hard to reduce its debt by more than $5 billion since the end of 2014, and it currently boasts the lowest all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of all major gold miners at $720-$770 an ounce forecast for 2017. A low AISC combined with plenty of expansion opportunity in North America should yield healthy margins for years to come.\n\nIn short, yes, bitcoin may be adversely impacting the gold and silver markets in the short-term, but this is unlikely a long-term concern for precious-metal investors.', ""Wall Street investors have been slow to embrace bitcoin, even as the cryptocurrency has soared.\n\nJohn Mack, the former CEO of Morgan Stanley who led the bank through the doldrums of the financial crisis, wants to change that.\n\nThe 72-year-old banker — along with other members of investment fund Venture One — has invested in Omega One, a Brooklyn-based startup that wants to act as a middleman between investors trading volatile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The news was first reported by Bloomberg News’ Matthew Leising.\n\nAs an agency broker, Omega One serves as counterparty, allowing clients like Wall Street banks to avoid the risks that come with these emerging assets while still serving clients who are interested in the space. To avoid crashing a single exchange with a large transaction, Omega claims it can split big trades across platforms.\n\n“We’re the bridge between the traditional capital markets and the crypto markets,” Omega One CTO Alex Gordon-Bradner told Bloomberg. “We will provide everything from balance sheet intermediation to a trusted counter party.”\n\nBanks seem to be more bullish on bitcoin’s underlying technology, blockchain, than they are on actual currency. BNY Mellon, for example, has set up a blockchain ledger that mirror’s the bank’s traditional system. Even Mack's former employer isn’t convinced bitcoin can function as a currency, saying it's more of a value-holding asset.\n\nBitcoin’s price skyrocketed earlier this year to a price of over $3,000 a coin, but has fallen recently to $2,300.\n\n“I have been watching and investing in the cryptocurrency market over the last several years, and as a Venture One portfolio company, I find Omega One to be an important next step in the emergence of this new economy,” Mack said in a statement to Bloomberg.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>""]"
07/15/2017,"['Bitcoin has fallen almost 12 percent in 24 hours as the reality of the Aug. 1 scaling deadline unsettles markets.\n\nCurrent trade prices according to Coinmarketcap, which averages readings from across major exchanges, shows Bitcoin at $2,076 - its lowest price for two months.\n\nThe knock-on effects for altcoins in the top 10 were as palpable as ever, with Ethereum, Litecoin and others following Bitcoin downhill.\n\nEthereum has fared particularly badly over the past week, with monthly losses to its market cap now nearly $18 bln.\n\nAs always, internal reactions with cryptocurrency were mixed, some despairing while others are eyeing a keen buying opportunity.\n\n$5.5million of new $BTCUSD short positions have opened up within the last 12hrs on Bitfinex — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) July 14, 2017\n\nWhile a general consensus points to the upcoming hard fork probability as the principal motivation for market uncertainty, mainstream media have been quick to sound the alarm about Bitcoin once again.\n\n“Rival factions of computer whizzes who play key roles in Bitcoin’s upkeep are poised to adopt two competing software updates at the end of the month,” Bloomberg reported Friday, announcing Bitcoin could be “nearing a total meltdown.”\n\n“That has raised the possibility that Bitcoin will split in two, an unprecedented event that would send shockwaves through the $41 bln market.”', 'Bitcoin price crashed below $2200 recently against the US Dollar, and now BTC/USD is struggling to hold a monster support area at $2000.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price fell sharply during the past few days and broke the $2400-2350 support against the US Dollar.\n\nThere was a break below a major contracting triangle with support at $2420 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nThe price is currently trading near major pivot of $2000, and struggling to hold it.\n\nBitcoin price crashed below $2200 recently against the US Dollar, and now BTC/USD is struggling to hold a monster support area at $2000.\n\nBitcoin Price Breaks Down\n\nThis past week was mostly bearish for Bitcoin price, as it moved below the $2400 support area against the US Dollar. In the last weekly analysis, I highlighted a monster breakout pattern with support at $2400-20 on the 4-hours chart of BTC/USD. It seems like the pair failed to hold the same and settled below $2400. There was a sharp downside move, as the pair traded below the $2250 and $2100 support levels.\n\nAt the moment, the price is trading near another crucial support at $2000. Buyers are struggling to hold $2000, which is why BTC remains at risk. The $2000 support is very important, especially a daily close above or below $2000. If the price manages to avoid a daily close below $2000, there are strong chances of a recovery. On the other hand, if there is a close below $2000, there can be more declines towards $1800.\n\nOn the upside, there is a bearish trend line at $2150 on the 4-hours chart. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $2396 high to $1958 low might also act as a hurdle near $2125. Selling rallies near $2125-2150 may be considered in the short term.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is heavily bearish and signaling more declines\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is attempting a recovery from the oversold levels.\n\nMajor Support Level – $2000\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $2150\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

An internal dispute over the digital currency could soon mean financial losses, whipsawing prices and delays in processing payments.\n\nIt’s also possible that nothing much changes. It all depends on whether the people who maintain bitcoin can agree by July 31 to implement a major software upgrade — one designed to improve capacity on the increasingly clogged network.\n\nNot everyone is on board. In particular, some bitcoin “miners,” who are rewarded for verifying transactions, aren’t supporting the changes. Any split between miners and others who use bitcoin, including a number of startups and a few big companies, could cause a panic in the $39 billion bitcoin marketplace.\n\nSo far, bitcoin’s value in U.S. dollars has soared amid the uncertainty. It’s currently at about $2,300, more than triple what it was a year ago. But bitcoin is notoriously volatile; because the price spiked so rapidly, it also fell quickly, and bitcoin has lost about a quarter of its value since its peak in June at above $3,000.\n\nHere’s a look at the current dispute.\n\nWHAT IS BITCOIN, AGAIN?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that’s not tied to any bank or government . Like cash, it lets users spend or receive money anonymously, or mostly so; like other online payment services, it also lets them do so over the internet.\n\nThe coins are created by computer farms that “mine” them and verify other users’ transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles. Miners receive bitcoin in exchange. It’s also possible to exchange bitcoin for U.S. dollars and other currencies.\n\nBitcoin has been touted as a currency of the future, but so far it hasn’t proven very popular as a way to pay for goods or services.\n\nWHAT’S BEHIND THE FUSS?\n\nIn a word, speed.\n\nThe bitcoin network is limited in how quickly it can shuffle around digital money. As bitcoin has grown, payment delays have become more common and worrisome.\n\nSome software developers came up with a new way to speed things up by reengineering bitcoin’s universal ledger, a file called the blockchain. Supporters of the new method include Microsoft, the bitcoin exchange Coinbase and a variety of other bitcoin proponents who would like to see the currency used more widely in commerce.\n\nBut this bitcoin software update doesn’t have unanimous support.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS ON JULY 31?\n\nThe reformers say they’ve run out of patience and have set a deadline for moving to the new system.\n\nAt 8 p.m. Eastern time on July 31, they’re threatening to stop recognizing transactions confirmed by miners who haven’t adopted the upgrade. That would create enormous uncertainty in the bitcoin economy, as no one could really know if the bitcoin they’d just paid (or received) was actually moving through the system the way it’s supposed to.\n\nSome big bitcoin miners — like Chinese bitcoin mining equipment giant Bitmain — haven’t signaled support for the new system. A rift could result in two or even more incompatible versions of bitcoin.\n\nWHAT WOULD THAT MEAN?\n\nGenerally speaking, chaos – though mostly limited to those who use or squirrel away bitcoin. No one using bitcoin could be sure which version they held, or what might happen if they spent it or accepted bitcoin as payment.\n\nTaking bitcoin, for instance, could leave you with currency you couldn’t spend freely – and that might disappear entirely if it ended up being the “wrong” kind.\n\nThat’s one reason the community-supported website Bitcoin.org warned users Wednesday not to accept any bitcoin up to two days prior to the deadline and to wait for confirmation the situation had been resolved before trading again.\n\n“It’s a rather awful situation,” David Harding, who posted the warning for Bitcoin.org, said in an email.\n\nWHAT’S BEHIND THIS FIGHT?\n\nMoney, of course. Some companies that pool miners together believe the new system could result in lower transaction fees, cutting into their profits. At the same time, the reformers foresee new business opportunities in a faster, more reliable form of bitcoin.\n\nSamson Mow, chief strategy officer at blockchain developer Blockstream, said the looming showdown has been propelled by bitcoin users frustrated at having a “simple bug fix” blocked by miners out for profit.\n\n“People are fed up,” he said. “The users are taking back their voice.”\n\n© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

If you\'ve been moving around in cryptocurrency circles, you probably already know that there\'s value to be found in rebelling against conventional wisdom. Bitcoin was built on a foundation that rebelled against fiat currencies and centralized financial authorities. We\'ve seen the bust and boom cycles of Bitcoin – and the cryptocurrency has proved that it can survive alongside fiat currencies. We have also seen the rise (and occasional fall) of dozens of other cryptocurrencies. Now, braver folks are venturing beyond the shores of traditional cryptocurrencies to seek their fortunes in the ""new way to invest""—Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).\n\nWhy Blockchain Is The Future Of The Sharing Economy\n\nWill Blockchain Ignite Fractional Ownership Market For Homes?\n\nAn ICO is simply a process by which cryptocurrency startups raise funds for new ventures. ICOs are similar to crowdfunding, except that they are almost always designed to raise funds for cryptocurrency projects, that might not be eligible for the capital-raising process of banks and venture capitalists. During an ICO campaign, enthusiasts and potential investors will buy some of the tokens of the new cryptocurrency project. Just yesterday, Tezos announced the largest ICO to date, raising $232 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) coins, making it the largest ICO to date. Tezos is just a part of the current wave of interesting companies who have already been through or are currently in the process of an ICO.\n\nMeet some other interesting ICOs:\n\nAugur\n\nAugur is created to be a decentralized prediction market where people can bet on the possible outcome of events – a betting/forecasting platform of sorts. Augur has practically created a betting platform where you can bet on “everything from elections to the destruction of our solar system.” if your forecast/prediction is correct, you\'ll earn rewards in the form of Augur\'s Reputation (REP) tokens. Augur\'s ICO helped the firm to raise more than $5.2M in a token sale, with $2.5M in the first three days. Augur has already rewarded its early investors as its REPs currently trade around $26 and the price may continue to rise as more people come on board to the betting platform.\n\nChronoBank\n\nChronobank is another cryptocurrency startup that has found a way to fund its business by holding an ICO. Chronobank is simply the Uber of recruitments as it works on creating an ecosystem where freelance projects are bought and sold with cryptocurrency. When the ICO ended, ChronoBank had raised a total of $5.4M collected in seven cryptocurrencies and USD. Chronobank now has a market capitalization of more than 5,400BTC. The firm\'s CEO, Sergei Sergienko notes that ""we have the funds we need to launch a successful platform and forge the relationships to make ChronoBank a major disruptive force in the recruitment industry"".\n\nAgrello\n\nAgrello is yet to hold its ICO, however, it has the potential to become one of the biggest success stories in the cryptocurrency world for smart investors. Agrello is simply a platform for building legally binding smart-contracts, using AI without having any prior legal skills or knowledge of coding. The Agrello token is called Delta ? and it is being offered with Tier 1 at 0.0001?, Tier 2 at 0.00011?, Tier 3 is set at 0.00012?, and Tier 4 is set at 0.00013?.\n\nOne of the key factors that hint at the potential success of Agrello, is its application across a wide range of industries. For instance, Agrello recently inked a partnership deal with Finnish manufacturing giant INCAP, to provide smart agreement prototyping for INCAP\'s labor management process. Agrello also has a deal with ViewFibn to develop a digital identity engine.\n\nNew investment vehicles arrive\n\nInvesting in the cryptocurrency market sounds simple enough by buying cryptocurrencies at a low price and selling them off at a higher price. Sophisticated investors may also consider putting their money into ICOs in much the same way that traditional investors look for promising IPO in stocks.\n\nHowever, as the cryptocurrency markets start to mature, new kinds of investment vehicles and opportunities are coming to the limelight. One of these investment vehicles is the cryptofund, which can be likened to a hedge fund owning different sorts of cryptocurrencies. A cryptofund is simply a portfolio that seeks to make gains by trading cryptocurrencies — some cryptofunds might also be engaged in the mining of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf you want to gain a diversified form of exposure into the cryptocurrency market, cryptofunds can provide you with a smart tool to access these markets. For instance, eToro\'s CryptoFund, provides access to six unique cryptocurrencies in order to offer a balanced exposure to the cryptocurrency market. The diversification of the fund allows investors to be uniquely positioned to record gains across multiple cryptocurrencies and it protects them against massive losses in any single cryptocurrency.\n\nIf you would like to invest directly in startups operating in the cryptocurrency market, you may want to consider investing in Pantera Capital. The firm seeks to provide VC funding to startups working in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries. By investing with a firm such as Pantera Capital, you\'ll get a chance to profit from price gains in cryptocurrencies and profit from the success of the firms behind such cryptocurrencies.', 'Overstock investment CEO Jonathan Johnson has said it is “crazy” more retailers are not already accepting Bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider Friday, Johnson, who is president of Overstock subsidiary Medici Ventures, also confirmed the Internet giant retains 50 percent of Bitcoin payments in the virtual currency.\n\n“The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking,"" he told the publication.\n\n“...I don\'t know why a CEO wouldn\'t want to make it easier for folks to spend money.”\n\nOverstock was one of the first global corporations to add Bitcoin as a form of payment several years ago, Johnson playing a major role in the initiative.\n\nSince then, prices have soared, and consumer uptake has increased throughout the world’s markets.\n\nDespite current upheaval and price volatility, the momentum behind making Bitcoin payment more attractive to the average consumer is still palpable, especially in markets like Japan.\n\n""It\'s actually cheaper for us to complete a Bitcoin transaction than it is to complete a credit card,” Johnson added despite recent prohibitively high Bitcoin transaction fees only returning to normal in the past two weeks.\n\nCurrent downward selling pressure on Bitcoin and the upcoming hard fork possibility meanwhile may temporarily suppress appetite for spending, this nonetheless is broadly considered a temporary phenomenon.', 'The price of bitcoin hit a 49-day low today, falling below $2,000 for the first time in weeks amid a broad sell-off across crypto assets.\n\nThe value of the total supply of all cryptocurrencies and crypto assets tracked similarly, dropping to $72bn, a figure that was 37 percent lower than its all-time high of $115bn set in June.\n\nOverall, the figures observed for both bitcoin and the total cryptocurrency market were the lowest since late May. Further, the asset class was down 11% over a 24-hour span at publication, a time during which it shed roughly $9bn in value.\n\nWhen polled, responding analysts largely credited the decline to short-term concern about the markets, which have undergone a period of rapid appreciation since the beginning of 2017.\n\nOthers pointed to the ongoing debate over bitcoin\'s technical roadmap, as well as uncertain over how planned upgrades could unfold, as a possible reason.\n\n""It could be people who are not comfortable in holding bitcoin because of August 1st due date,"" Andrea Medri, founder of cryptocurrency exchange The Rock Trading, told CoinDesk.\n\nAlso cited is the fact that ether\'s market has been similarly hit with sell pressure, spurred by the economics supporting recent ICO projects.\n\nStill, others suggested it could be a sign of market-fatigue long expected given the influx of relatively new traders in recent months.\n\nWater slide image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

07/16/2017,"['Bitcoin fell below $1,900 today, from around $2,600, as the fast approaching August 1st deadline nears, seemingly considerably increasing uncertainty among traders and investors.\n\nThe currency has been experiencing a downtrend for much of June and July, falling from around $3,000 to just above $1,900 at the time of writing, with the downwards price movement seemingly accelerating in the past few days.\n\nThe main reason is probably because the currency’s more than two years long debate is to reach a conclusion on August the 1st when bitcoiners decide which way they are to go and how.\n\nThe picture is complex and confusing with many clients vying for the bitcoin brand, but they can largely be classified under the small blocks and big blocks umbrella with a third, middle of the way, segwit2x “compromise.”\n\nOn the small blocks end, there is Bitcoin Core and UASF which aim to activate segwit, but their relationship to segwit2x is not clear, with some suggestions they may be incompatible and might chain-split, while others suggest they would be in consensus.\n\nWe tried to speak to Jeff Garzik, the lead maintainer of the new segwit2x client, to gain some clarity on the relationship between segwit2x and Bitcoin Core, but have received no response at the time of writing.\n\nSegwit2x implements segwit largely unchanged, but there are suggestions after the activation the client may only accept segwit blocks, while Bitcoin Core would accept both segwit and non-segwit blocks, which may lead to a split.\n\nHowever, as some 90% of miners seem to be supporting segwit2x, it appears unlikely any miner would produce non-segwit blocks, so they would probably remain in consensus.\n\nOn the bigger blocks side, there is Bitcoin Unlimited and BitcoinABC, which largely follows the approach of Bitcoin Unlimited but goes further in implementing a User Activated Hard-Fork that will chain-split regardless of miners support.\n\nThere are indications some miners will support them, including ViaBTC and potentially the bitcoin.com mining pool which may give its miners the option of supporting the BitcoinABC chain.\n\nAs such, we are likely to have at least two bitcoins on August the 1st, but there may be even more. Bitcoiners, therefore, are strongly advised to not transact on that day until the situation becomes more clear.\n\nOnce the chain does split, BitcoinABC will probably be listed in at least one exchange, thus a period of high volatility and perhaps even trading frenzy should be expected as the market passes judgment on the value of the bitcoins.\n\nEventually, the dust will likely settle with one coin probably gaining some 80% or so of the current bitcoin value, while the minority coin can continue operating in their own network, free to follow their own roadmap and vision.\n\nWhich one will be which only the free market can tell us sometime next month as bitcoin finally makes a monumental and probably highly historical decision, at least for this space.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'This file photo taken on April 17, 2013 shows a young South African Afrikaner boy plays by a painted wall reading ""Welcome in Orania"" in Afrikaans in Orania. Photo: Stephane De Sakutin / AFP\n\nJOHANNESBURG - The whites-only enclave of Orania in Northern Cape is looking to take its currency digital.\n\nThe town of about 1,400 people adopted its own paper money, the ora, to promote self-sufficiency.\n\nOrania was created by Afrikaners on private land in 1991, ahead of the dawn of democracy, and its residents are mostly white farmers or traders. The town maintains its unique racial makeup by vetting and interviewing prospective residents.\n\nIf Orania\'s audacious plan goes ahead as expected, the ""e-ora"" will enter the world of virtual currencies - although it\'s still a far cry from the likes of cyber-money giant Bitcoin.\n\nStrictly speaking, the ora is not a full currency, but serves as a token or voucher.\n\nIt was introduced in 2004 to promote local spending, with users enjoying discounts when they use the local coupons.\n\nAlthough Orania does not insist on payments in ora, the town profits from every sale of its currency by holding the deposited rands in an interest-bearing account.\n\nThe ora is not officially sanctioned by the South African Reserve Bank, but residents can currently exchange South African rands for physical ora at the town\'s self-styled ""central bank"" at a rate of one-to-one.\n\nBy going electronic, Orania - where 97-percent of residents are white, compared with just one in 10 nationwide - will take its first steps into the booming world of digital cash.\n\nThe market for virtual currencies is thought to be worth billions of dollars, but critics argue they help drug and arms dealers and people traffickers.\n\n""What we plan to do is to digitise the existing physical ora and replace it with an electronic one,"" said Dawie Roodt, chief economist at the Efficient Group, a financial consultancy hoping to help the town reduce the transaction costs of the paper ora.\n\n""If you can reduce the cost of the transaction, you can boost economic activity quite substantially.""\n\n\'Significant technological changes\'\n\nThe paper vouchers will continue to circulate alongside the cyber cash, but unlike the physical ""bank notes"", the e-currency will have no expiry date.\n\n""There are significant technological changes taking place in the financial space - like Bitcoin,"" said Roodt.\n\nIf everything goes to plan, Orania could have the electronic ora in circulation as soon as mid-August.\n\nIt is hoped that the virtual cash will reduce the costs of printing the physical notes, as well as expanding the range of goods and services using the ora - helping to grow the local economy.\n\n""I\'m a young guy, I\'m used to mainly doing online banking and the advantages that come with that. So if I can go further and build my own economy with that, I definitely welcome that,"" Orania Movement\'s James Kemp, 35, told AFP.\n\nIt was the Afrikaners who formed the backbone of the National Party that introduced apartheid, and many South Africans regard Orania\'s residents as little more than latter-day bittereinders - a term\n\nAFP', 'Can Bitfury Group replicate its success in enterprise blockchain?\n\nLong a leader in the lucrative bitcoin transaction processing sector, this has been an open question since the startup expanded its mission in a bid to win the trust – and business – of the world\'s biggest financial firms, governments and institutions. But it\'s also a question that now has new context, as Bitfury is today making public an enterprise blockchain initiative that has long been in development in the lab.\n\nRevealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitfury Group is open-sourcing its first private blockchain framework, though it\'s one that offers a twist on the established idea. Called Exonum, the software aims to distinguish itself from DLT solutions by enabling users to secure data using the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAs explained by Valery Vavilov, the CEO of Bitfury Group, despite uncertainty surrounding the protocol\'s technical roadmap, potential clients are actually becoming more aware of bitcoin\'s strength as the longest-running and most secure blockchain in the world.\n\nVavilov told CoinDesk:\n\n""What we observe is a lot of companies and institutions becoming more and more comfortable using the bitcoin blockchain. Those monitoring the system know bitcoin has been around for 8–9 years, that it hasn\'t been hacked and that it is offering security that doesn\'t exist anywhere else.""\n\nAlexander Shevchenko, head of Exonum, further stressed how the notion of adding cryptographic data from private, permissioned blockchains into the public bitcoin blockchain would strengthen the assurances of even trusted parties and networks.\n\n""Anchoring brings security to the solution. Even if all the validators collude and want to go back in time and rewrite an Exonum blockchain, they can\'t do this,"" he said.\n\nAs evidence of interest, the software is also already in use in Bitfury Group\'s ongoing projects – including its land title trial in Georgia, as well as an undisclosed insurance effort.\n\nFor those who want to take a closer look, the source code for Exonum, written in Rust, is now available on GitHub. It will further be on display during an 11-city tour that begins today in the Netherlands, and that includes stops in Beijing, Boston and San Francisco.\n\nFinding a niche\n\nStill, anchoring the data isn\'t the only feature of Exonum.\n\nAlso touted is the auditability the software provides by enabling developers to create both ""full clients"", which validate the full history of the system\'s data, and ""light clients"" that use this record to verify data.\n\nWhile that might sound like a slight feature, Shevchenko cited the infamous ""Heartbleed"" vulnerability, where a code issue in OpenSSL left as many as half a million websites exposed to exploits, as evidence of how Exonum\'s design could be a practical step in improving internet systems.\n\nAs profiled in The New York Times, one of the major issues cited in the aftermath was the length of time it would take for OpenSSL\'s code to be audited, as well as its lack of regular reviews.\n\nBy enabling light clients, Shevchenko contends more nodes can participate in Exonum networks, verifying and auditing data to avoid such issues.\n\n""Each client guarantees correct data storage, and thus overall, it\'s self-auditable. Everything controls its tiny part, and you get this full audit of the system,"" he said.\n\nVavilov continued:\n\n""This is really important. You can build a very strong blockchain system, you can anchor it on the bitcoin system, and if your client is compromised, auditing can help. It closes the full loop of the security of the system.""\n\nCost of use\n\nStill, that\'s not to say public blockchains are without difficulties.\n\nTo this point, Bitfury Group went so far as to address concerns about the rising costs of bitcoin network use, and how they might impact Exonum networks that seek to tether transaction data to bitcoin.\n\nWhile Bitfury didn\'t provide specific figures, representatives indicated that it believes this would represent a ""low cost"", owing to how copies of data are stored on the bitcoin network.\n\nShould a consortium of users want to hash data, for example, they would simply set up a multi-signature wallet and then batch transaction timestamps onto the bitcoin blockchain, using the OP_RETURN feature in bitcoin\'s code.\n\nAs even very small fractions of bitcoin can store additional information, the company argues the costs could be affordable even if the Exonum system was running processing as many as 3,000 transactions per second.\n\n""The only thing we need to have is the bitcoin you need for the transaction fees,"" Shevchenko said.\n\nDLT design\n\nBut what about users that don\'t want bitcoin\'s added security?\n\nAnother major feature of Exonum is a new, unnamed consensus algorithm it claims improves on the Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols most often used today in distributed ledger proofs-of-concept. While the company did not disclose many details about the system, it described it as more robust and capable of achieving greater uptime.\n\nElsewhere, Bitfury Group said Exonum\'s implementations can support features including multi-signature contracts, time locks and oracles.\n\nHowever, in interview, Vavilov mostly kept his sights on the biggest picture for how these features will enable what he believes will be an important leap in the use of blockchain technology.\n\nEvoking the classic comparison of private blockchains to intranets, Vavilov framed Exonum as a natural next step in bridging the gap between these systems, and public, open blockchains.\n\nVavilov said:\n\n""Years ago when the internet started, a lot of conservative organizations didn\'t start using internet, they created so-called intranets to become comfortable. After some time, all intranets are connected to internet. We believe this will help build a more secure and scalable system.""\n\nGoing forward, Bitfury Group said it will seek to update the product ahead of the release of an enterprise version of Exonum in the coming months.\n\nLightbulb image via Bitfury\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Central banks and governments continue to make statements regarding the dangers of digital currencies, or, conversely, extolling their benefits.\n\nThe most recent bank to issue such a warning is the central bank of Albania. The bank issued a strong statement warning citizens that digital currencies were not under the direct purvey of the country’s banking sector regulations and that such vehicles carried extremely high levels of risk.\n\nThe Albanian authorities stated:\n\n“We appeal to the Albanian public to be mature and responsible in the administration of savings or liquidity they possess. One should orient investments toward financial products and instruments offered by institutions licensed and supervised by the Bank of Albania and the Financial Supervisory Authority.”\n\nThe anonymity and decentralization provided by Bitcoin made nefarious activity not only possible, but probable, and the bank warned against the clear risks taken by those choosing to invest.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts would clearly point out that a centralized bank is the very essence of what Bitcoin is seeking to distance itself from, and so a less than glowing review would be expected.', ""More than 2 billion adults lack access to financial services and according to the World Bank, the majority reside in rural areas with a daily income less than $5 a day. A case in point would be Philippines, where Facebook accounts vastly outnumber bank accounts among the population.\n\nBitCoin, a popular form of digital currency, offers benefit to these people as a valuable remittance and transfer medium. With the explosion in the acquisition of smartphones and cheap tariffs for mobile internet, BitCoin becomes a solution to the “unbanked” masses who however are connected via the Internet.\n\nA typical transfer fee for a BitCoin transaction is 1% whereas the minimum transaction value that a traditional finance company would charge would be to the tune of 5%. In addition, a BitCoin can offer more than just the means for effecting a funds transfer. Economies with weak currencies can benefit from BitCoins.\n\nIn Argentina for example, an artificial exchange rate mandated by the government is forcing people to eschew the peso.\n\nIf you receive dollars in Argentina, the Central Bank give you less pesos (30 to 35 percent less) for each dollar than what the real market price is. But if you buy BitCoins abroad and send them to someone in Argentina, the Argentinian will be able to sell them at a real exchange rate and get 100 percent of the money, excluding a small broker fee.\n\nStoring BitCoins in the medium to long-term can be an attractive alternative to a volatile currency. Russia, another country suffering from a currency crisis, saw transaction volumes between the rouble and BitCoin increase nearly 250 percent in December, as the former crumbled on the back of weaker oil prices.\n\nHowever, the adoption of Bitcoins has still to come a long way in developing countries. Most of the unbanked [in India] are uneducated and don’t know how to read or write, and getting them to trust bitcoins will be an arduous task. There are only about 15-20,000 present active users in the country’s 1.2 billion population.\n\nNonetheless, the future does seem to be digital as uncertain economies, hostile governments and advances in technology push us to the new frontier - the digital frontier.\n\n[The author is Co-founder & CEO, SearchTrade.com]\n\n[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of Trivone Media Network's or that of CXOToday's.]"", 'Featured\n\nBitcoin mining has grown into a vast economy over the past few years as large ASIC-powered mining farms process transactions for the $32 billion dollar market. In the early days, people could mine bitcoins using their central processing units (CPU) and they still can, but the undertaking is extremely inefficient. However, a few people still mess around mining bitcoins using older computers and retro devices merely for the fun of it and for experimentation purposes.\n\nAlso Read: Investment Funds That Offer Cryptocurrency Exposure See Big Gains\n\nBitcoin Mining With Classic Computers and Retro Gaming Consoles\n\nThe bitcoin mining ecosystem is a competitive environment of pools processing transactions while simultaneously securing the network. Miners run special software and use application-specific integrated circuitry (ASIC) to mine bitcoins these days, using chips far more efficient than your standard CPU. Currently, older computers can mine bitcoins at a prolonged rate, but it’s still pretty cool to see if a classic system can perform the task of bitcoin mining.\n\nOne bitcoin enthusiast has done just that a few times with older computers. Ken Shirriff is well-known in the bitcoin community for his work on getting the bitcoin symbol added to Unicode. Shirriff also has a popular blog where writes about his projects and how he has mined bitcoins using classic devices from the past. Just recently Shirriff has been working on a Xerox Alto restoration and managed to get the seventies built computer to mine bitcoins at 1.5 hashes/second. The Xerox Alto is a well-known computer classic that was the first device to support a graphical user interface (GUI) in 1973.\n\n“I’ve been restoring a Xerox Alto minicomputer from the 1970s and figured it would be interesting to see if it could mine bitcoins,” explains Shirriff.\n\nI coded up the necessary hash algorithm in BCPL (the old programming language used by the Alto) and found that although the mining algorithm ran, the Alto was so slow that it would take many times the lifetime of the universe to successfully mine bitcoins.\n\nThe computer’s 1.5 blocks per second is significantly slower than the chips used today. Shirriff details the Xerox Alto’s speed would take “5000 times the age of the universe” to mine one block. For demonstration purposes, Shirriff used the input of a successfully mined block to see if the algorithm succeeded. Shirriff’s code is available on Github for those who would like to try out Xerox Alto mining.\n\nAn Old IBM Mainframe From the Sixties Would Take Roughly 40,000 Times the Current Age of the Universe to Find a Block\n\nAnother project Shirriff worked on back in 2015 was mining with a 55-year-old IBM 1401 mainframe at 80 seconds per hash. This computer was the best-selling computer of the mid-1960s and mainly used for business purposes.\n\n“While modern hardware can compute billions of hashes per second, the 1401 takes 80 seconds to compute a single hash,” details Shirriff. “This illustrates the improvement of computer performance in the past decades, most famously described by Moore’s Law — To summarize, to mine a block at current difficulty, the IBM 1401 would take about 5×10^14 years (about 40,000 times the current age of the universe).”\n\nMining Bitcoin With a 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System\n\nLastly, another neat project is another incredibly slow miner built in 2013 out of a 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The creator of the NES mining system was joking around with his friend about mining bitcoins with an 8-bit game console. Well, he took that as a challenge and built a Nintendo that communicated with the network and performed SHA256 hashing. For other portions of the project, he did need a Raspberry Pi for computing that did not take place on the NES.\n\n“SHA256 hashing uses many 32-bit operations, and the 6502 in the NES is an 8-bit CPU,” explains the retro miner creator. “Initially I thought this would be a significant challenge, but with some modifications, I got an open implementation of SHA256 to compile to a 6502 target using the cc65 compiler.”\n\nThe Raspberry Pi gets a chunk of data, compiles it into a ROM that includes the SHA256 algo and current target data, and sends it to the console via USB CopyNES. Each ROM computes and tests a single hash.\n\nIn the end, the NES miner worked and started searching for blocks with Slush’s pool, but the creator said there was plenty of room for build improvements. “What I’m doing now is very slow, and I admit, pretty lame,” explains the retro miner’s blog post. Additionally, bitcoiners have had great discussions concerning mining bitcoin with other gaming consoles like the Playstation 3.\n\nASIC Producers Don’t Need to Worry About Retro Miners\n\nObviously, these types of projects won’t be mass adopted to mine excessive amounts of bitcoins like ASICs because it would take many lifetimes to find one block using a retro device. However even though watching an older computer or gaming console mine bitcoins is super slow it’s very interesting to see that these devices are compatible with the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhat do you think about people testing old computers and retro gaming devices with the Bitcoin network?

Now the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association made up of various regional exchanges is preparing to draft service suspension directives for bitcoin users in the country for that specific date.\n\nAlso read: Mining, Merchants, and Traders—Thailand’s Got the Bitcoin Fever\n\nJapan Cryptocurrency Business Association Considers Guidelines for August 1\n\nJapan has had bitcoin fever over the past few months. Since this past April interest in the decentralized currency has grown quite a bit since the Japanese government legalized bitcoin as a form of payment. Now as the country continues to progress in adoption a possible blockchain split may happen in two weeks, and Japanese bitcoin businesses want to be prepared.\n\nAccording to the Nikkei Asian Review, the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) is currently deliberating guidelines for a one day to one week “freeze on bitcoin transactions.” The JCBA organization says it aims to “actively investigate and research necessary information, consolidate knowledge and exchange opinions, and aim for sound industry development” in Japan. As far as August 1 is concerned, the association made up of fourteen regional cryptocurrency exchanges says it wants to “protect customer assets.”\n\nJapanese Exchanges Detail Suspensions and Decision Announcements\n\nThe publication also details the trading platform Bitflyer is still undecided on its decision but will release an announcement next week. The Japanese exchanges Bitbank and Tech Bureau has detailed trading will be allowed, but deposits and withdrawals will be suspended until the possibility of a fork is resolved.\n\nThe statement from the JCBA and a few Japanese exchanges follows the announcement from the GDAX exchange on July 13. The exchange announced the suspension of deposits and withdrawals on August 1 and the possibility of halting trades as well. GDAX executive Adam White says the decision was based on technical risks and the possibility of “network instability.”\n\nMasayuki Tashiro, a data analyst at the Japanese trading platform Fisco, says the chance of instability could make some transaction records inaccurate.\n\nIf there really is a fork, some transaction records could disappear\n\nThere’s still a possibility that nothing happens on August 1 and the industry is just playing it safe as they did this past March. This weekend the code for Segwit2x will be delivered and Segwit activation could happen, which might stop the potential August 1 fork. The JCBA is just following protocol, and other exchanges will likely do so leading up to the next two weeks in order to protect their businesses from legal repercussions.\n\nWhat do you think about Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association drafting August 1 guidelines?

In addition, the moving averages are close to the descending triangle resistance, adding an extra layer of defense in the event of a larger correction.\n\nThe broken triangle support is in between the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels at $2251.91 and $2349.88 respectively. Stochastic is pulling up from the oversold area to signal a pickup in buying pressure while RSI looks ready to head north as well, so bitcoin price might follow suit.\n\nIf any of the Fibs keep gains in check, bitcoin could resume its drop to the previous lows or much lower. On the other hand, a break past the triangle resistance or moving averages could signal a return in bullish momentum.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nUS economic data turned out weaker than expected on Friday, dampening rate hike expectations for September and December once more. Headline CPI showed a flat reading instead of the estimated 0.1% increase while the core figure printed a meager 0.1% uptick instead of the projected 0.2% gain.\n\nThese undermine the Fed’s view that the slowdown in inflation was just temporary. Instead, weaker price pressures could force the central bank to rethink its tightening time line, along with balance sheet unwinding.\n\nAs for bitcoin price, speculations of further weakness and liquidation of positions after the recent slide led to a steeper drop over the weekend. Experts blamed this on several factors such as fears about the potential hard fork and larger firms dumping their cryptocurrency holdings as well.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Now we will look at some interesting places Blockchain may revolutionize the future and a couple of places it is making a difference today.\n\nDigital currencies, like Bitcoin, are interesting for the future. However, I am more excited about what Blockchain can and will do in the future. I will look at 8 potential uses for the technology and how I think it will change how many things are done today.\n\n1. Smart Contracts in the Legal Profession\n\nThere is a digital revolution going on in the legal industry and blockchain is the technology leading this transformation. The law is being digitized. If you have ever had to close a mortgage or been part of any legal dispute you know that lawyers are good at creating tons of paperwork. I am convinced they are paid by the word sometimes.\n\nIf we can digitize the process of keeping track of the paper trail then it will reduce the cost and potential for human error. It could be a game changer. Firms like Stampery are focused on recording everything on a shared ledger that becomes irrefutable digital proof that this legal event happened between two parties.\n\nThis could be anything from a marriage to a divorce proceeding; a house sale to a land reclamation; and anything else that involves digital proof. Cutting costs out of the legal system from administration to time would be a game changer for the legal profession.\n\n2. Clearing and Settlement\n\nNow this is probably one of the most interesting potential uses for Blockchain when it comes to finance. Clearing and settlement costs the financial industry billions of dollars yearly. Global banking giant Santander believes Blockchain technology could save the industry $20 billion a year which would be a huge benefit to consumers in lower fees for transacting things like wire transfers, money grams, and clearing fees on investment trades.\n\nLet’s look at a simple example. Currently if you sell a stock the transaction takes 3 days (T+3) to complete and settle and the money to show up in your account. If we see a universal adoption of blockchain technology in the financial market that transaction settlement and clearing could go from a 3-day process to an almost immediate process.\n\nWith ISO 200222 standards for real time payments being a goal for the financial industry I believe we will see Blockchain become the backbone of how all financial transactions occur at some time in the not too distant future. It will require a major technology upgrade for the entire industry, but I believe the long-term benefits and savings of time and money will be too good to ignore.\n\n3. Payments\n\nSwift, the interbank payments platform, has been testing a system for a few years that they believe will be how all cross-border payments are processed in the future. It does not currently include blockchain technology mainly because Blockchain in its current state is not ready for this.\n\nHowever, they are building their new system to be able to adapt and include blockchain in the future if it becomes more viable. The biggest hindrance to the interbank payment system using Blockchain today is the sheer volume of transactions that are done. It will require more testing but I think it will get there eventually. In the interim Blockchain is revolutionizing peer to peer direct payments and doing it in real time transactions with no bank delay.\n\n4. Smart Assets\n\nThink of all those components being bought and sold in the supply chains of the world, and then think about all those components being recorded in near real-time on a shared ledger. They have been talking about having real time transactions around bills of lading and letters of credit but the challenge has been recording of the bill and then documenting the movement of the assets.\n\nIf we digitize the bills and letters of credit and you have a more real-time view of the world and supply chain. It is a smarter system because you can record more than just a product’s serial number and value like the current systems allow.\n\nYou can record virtually any other information you want like destination, who is shipping it, who is shipping it when it reaches port, tax, and government clearance. That is why it’s a smarter tracking system. The banks that invests and adopts this sort of system will have a competitive advantage in the future.\n\n5. Digital Identity\n\nIf Digital Identities are recorded on blockchain protocol, then my things can have authorization to transact on my behalf. In other words, I would have an identity recorded on a shared ledger, and then can add devices to my identity.\n\nOver time, I could add smart objects too, from my shoes to my fridge to my car to my heating to anything. This will allow for a more secure way to verify someone’s identity and allow for a reduction in fraud.\n\n6. Voting\n\nThink about it for a minute. A secure voting record that requires authentication of a voter’s identity and has a trusted tally. What would the news media and candidates do without the ability to blame their loss on voter fraud or hacking (Sort of kidding).\n\nBlockchains can serve as the medium for casting, tracking, and counting votes so that there is never a question of voter-fraud, lost records, or fowl-play. By casting votes as transactions within the blockchain, voters can agree on the final count because they can count the votes themselves, and because of the blockchain audit trail, they can verify that no votes were changed or removed, and no illegitimate votes were added. If Blockchain voting were in place today all of the nonsense that surrounded the 2016 Presidential election would have been a moot point.\n\n7. Healthcare\n\nHealthcare institutions suffer from an inability to securely share data across platforms. Better data collaboration between providers means higher probability of accurate diagnoses, higher likelihood of effective treatments, and the increased ability of healthcare systems to deliver cost-effective care.\n\nBlockchain can allow hospitals, payers, and other parties in the healthcare value-chain to share access to their networks without compromising data security and integrity. To give you a simple example a hospital has up to 20 different ways to enter a patient’s date of birth and no ways to standardize it. Blockchain would allow the hospital to tie a patient to their data rather than tie them to their identity.\n\n8. Insurance Contracts\n\nSmart contracts could provide transparency and an irrefutable record for managing claims if it was put on a blockchain and verified by the network. This would mean that identical claims would not be paid thus reducing the potential for fraud and duplicate claims being paid. Blockchain would allow for a more streamlined claims process that would be beneficial to the customer experience as well as save money for the insurance company.\n\nThis is just a small sample of the potential uses for Blockchain. As the Internet of Things continues to evolve the uses and potential uses for Blockchain will expand as well.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\n\nRead the original article on Thorium Wealth Management.

07/17/2017,"[""Last week I pointed to a decline of 23% in the market cap of major digital currencies in July, asking if this was the bottom. Now we have an answer: Not by a long shot.\n\nThis past weekend brought brutal declines for the two biggest digital currencies. Bitcoin fell to around $1,863 (38% off its all-time high) while ethereum hit a low of around $133 (67% off its high).\n\nBitcoin and ethereum are by far the biggest digital currencies but the entire asset class—which consists of numerous other so-called “alt coins”—suffered a similar shock. The trade publication Coindesk reported the overall market cap for digital currencies has fallen from $115 billion to $61 billion in a month.\n\nOn Monday morning the currencies had recovered slightly as bitcoin and ethereum were trading around $2,000 and $160 respectively.\n\nThere is no obvious single explanation for the price collapse, though part of it may simply be a market correction following months of speculative mania that has attracted all sorts of new investors to the market.\n\nRyan Selkis, a well-respected figure in the digital currency community, acknowledged the price drop has been dramatic but also noted the overall market is still well up from the start of the year:\n\nAnother factor driving the price collapse may be an unresolved dispute among leading members of the bitcoin community over how to reform the protocol that underpins the currency. If the dispute, which some are likening to a civil war, is not resolved by an August 1 deadline, it could trigger a further selloff of bitcoin—and drag other currencies down with it.\n\nAdding to the instability is a warning from the popular trading exchange GDAX, run by Coinbase, which warned the protocol controversy could lead it to temporarily suspend bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nA further explanation for the price drop, cited by analyst Anupam Varshney, is a recent spate of “Initial Coin Offerings”—in which founders blockchain companies have raised huge amounts of bitcoin and ethereum, and then dumped some of their windfall on the market.\n\nThe latest price turmoil, however, is hardly the first rodeo for long time followers of crypto-currency. Over the last seven years, bitcoin has been rocked by numerous spectacular crashes only to recover—which suggest bitcoin and some of the other currencies will emerge from this latest joint.\n\nIf you only cared about crypto/blockchain when prices were high and ICOs were hot, you probably don't really care about crypto/blockchain — Adam Ludwin (@adamludwin) July 16, 2017\n\nAs always, digital currency investing is proving not to be for the faint of heart.

The estimated price target of the Head and Shoulders pattern left the previous market value of $2,400 poised to drop steeply to $1,800. If you are reading this article, you are probably wondering what the heck just happened and if the carnage is going to continue ...\n\nFirst, let’s take a look at how the market reacted to the completion of this Head and Shoulders pattern and then extrapolate what that may mean for the overall trend of BTC-USD. The figure below shows the key support levels that were broken during the fall this weekend:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Head and Shoulders Key Support Levels\n\n\n\nAfter the initial breakout of the Head and Shoulders, the price took a steep plunge downward. Ultimately, after several days of a strong bear market (and several significant support levels broken), we reached our price target of $1,800 before bouncing and beginning the process of retesting crucial support (now turned resistance) levels:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Broken Support Levels\n\n\n\nWith very little effort, the BTC-USD market managed to reach its price target and appears to be making a recovery — but is this a fake-out? Are we bouncing back to our previous trend? Not likely. Below are some of the more glaring reasons why I think this bear still has some bite left in it.\n\nOn the higher timescales, BTC-USD is actually showing strength in downward momentum of this move. No MACD divergence (loss in market momentum) is visible. The lack of macro-trend divergence indicates that the market still has plenty of downward pull left in it before it strongly begins to resist the lower prices.\n\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 12-hr Candles, GDAX, No Divergence\n\n\n\nOn a smaller, one-hour scale, the market is strongly diverging in a bearish fashion. Although the market had a decent rebound off the bottom of the recent run, it is quickly losing steam (indicated by the divergence shown on the 1-hr MACD and labeled in pink). Not only is it diverging on the 1-hr MACD, across the length of the bear run, the market doesn’t seem comfortable maintaining the downward momentum across multiple bearish/bullish periods (shown in yellow):\n\nFigure 5: BTC-USD, 1-hr Candles, GDAX, 1HR Bearish Divergence\n\n\n\nIt’s nearly impossible to predict the true bottom of a sustained bear or bull market, so it is very important to keep an eye on the market and constantly update your perspective. At the moment, there are several indicators that BTC-USD has a sustained bear market in its future. And, as we’ve seen over the course of several weeks: what brings Bitcoin down brings everyone down.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Head and Shoulders pattern predicted in previous articles completed its price target of $1,800. There are multiple signs that the BTC-USD bear market still has downward momentum left in it.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The price had made a massive leap from about $100 to over $1000. Early investors were rich, entrepreneurs were energized and a new class of “Bitcoin Millionaires” began to pop up. Around this time we started to see websites like “https://www.bitpremier.com” sprout up to help these new rich members of society spend their money, while new companies like mine, Bitwage, began forming.\n\nA year later, prices had sunk to about $400, but investors were still quite bullish on the recovery of the technology. It was around this time that I went to my first two Bitcoin conferences, Inside Bitcoins and CoinAgenda. This is where I was able to first meet many of the members in the industry I had heard so much about. Brock Pierce, Michael Terpin, and Juan Llanos were there. The sessions and the networking were incredibly valuable, but the traits that I remember much more strongly were the extravagance and the bullish confidence behind it.\n\nMarc Levin\n\nThe preparty for CoinAgenda, right after Inside Bitcoins ended, was held at the two story sky villa at The Palms. This is a $35,000 a night suite with an Infinity pool overlooking the Las Vegas strip. The next night was even more opulent. Mike Tyson’s mansion has a large indoor fountain, multiple pools, and an actual a river of its own.\n\nDespite the energy of the conferences, the price of bitcoin continued to decline, stabilizing around $200 and remaining there for nearly a year. Startup morality and interest was at an all time low. The word “Bitcoin” became taboo among potential mainstream partners, investors and banks. The industry began to slowly shift the terminology from “Bitcoin” to “blockchain”, and private blockchains began to rise in popularity. The investment money dried up and once promising startups Bitwage had become close to shut their doors.\n\nThe price began to slowly recover in early June of last year as people in different countries around the world started to use the technology as a commodity to hedge the risk of country economic slowdowns. China’s stockmarket crashed, oil prices caused mayhem in Venezuela and Russia, a corrupt government in Brazil and ill-thought out demonetization of the rupee in India all caused people to lose faith in their local currencies. People learned they could preserve their wealth by going outside their fiat banking system, and local Bitcoin booms erupted.\n\nEach of these countries saw surges in the price of Bitcoin ahead of global rates. This was great for Bitwage. We saw the rates we could pay out in locations like Brazil and India become incredibly favorable for our workers, often doing 20 to 50 percent better than interbank rates due to the local price rises.\n\nSoon, prices in the US, Europe, and the rest of the world followed suit. Initially with a small increase to $450, then to $600, and then the amazing spike to almost $3000. Now in mid-2017 the price is over $2,000, the word Bitcoin has never been so fashionable, and the number of Bitcoin millionaires has increased many fold. As the money we saw from the first price spike is back in the industry, we are starting to see the return of extravagant conferences, and that brings me to the inspiration for this piece; BIP001, the Blockchain Incredible Party.\n\nDistributed Labs\n\nThe first weekend of July, I was asked to speak at a conference regarding Bitwage in Odessa, Ukraine, called BIP001, organized by the Distributed Labs team. In the Bitcoin industry, BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, which is a process for adding new features to the Bitcoin protocol. The organizers of this event are both a clever and fun group of people and their play on the name of the Bitcoin upgrade method gives you a sense of what things are like there.\n\nI had never been to Ukraine before, so I was not sure what exactly to expect, but what I found was a place of beaches, good food, and beautiful people. And the visit was extremely cheap, we’re talking appetizer, main course, and a drink for $6, then a thirty minute Uber ride home after is just $2.\n\nThe conference was one of the most well put together I have ever attended. High quality speakers from around the world, including Vlad Zamfir, Ethereum Core Developer from Canada, Frank Schwab, serial entrepreneur from Germany, and Giacomo Zucco, CEO of Blockchain Lab from Italy, presented from the roof of the M1 hotel, overlooking the Black Sea. Not only the speakers, but the participants were quite intelligent and high quality. That was surprising and pleasing, because when the Bitcoin price goes up the get rich quick schemers flock to events.\n\nBut the real magic happens outside the conference walls. Every night, the conference sponsored tables at one of the most popular night clubs in Ibiza. Lavish meals with both local and international flare were provided during the day. There was a conference Telegram group where people would be updated on the next meal or event. Those who could stay for the weekend could have attended Bitcoin and Ethereum meetups on Friday, and an all Russian Bitcoin meetup was held Saturday.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about small conferences with many intimate events is how closely everyone connects with each other. When you attend a mature industry conference, you spend five minutes speaking with someone, swap business cards, and maybe have a followup conversation a week down the line. BIP001 attendees were bumping into each other at the beach watching the sunrise, exchanging Telegram accounts, and making impromptu plans for breakfast. When you've got that much time together conversations are much more memorable. What makes it better is that these conversations and friends you make are with potential partners, customers, vendors, investors and investees. Instead of walking away with a hundred business cards for people you barely remember, you walk away with ten telegram numbers for people with whom you're quite ready to do business with in the future.\n\nThe wealth of connections and intellectual conversations had during the Blockchain Incredible Party are quite hard to replicate outside of an environment like this. When the Bitcoin price rises, it's a tide that lifts all boats. If you've been curious, now is the time to find an event that fits your schedule. Maybe I'll even see you there."", ""Bitcoin and its related Blockchain introduced many people to the concept of a Blockchain back in October of 2008. A very strong use case for Bitcoin and Blockchain is 21.co, a silicon valley startup that is using Bitcoin to re-invent and optimize sales, marketing and research in the enterprise. Since then, we have heard about ‘Smart Contracts’ built on Blockchain with much of the news related to the launch of Ethereum in July 2015. New entrants into this space include EOS and Tezos. Given the positive feedback that Brett and I received regarding industry use cases with Blockchain, we decided to extend the Blockchain and digital currency topic, focusing on Ethereum - the second most valuable cryptocurrency, behind Bitcoin.\n\nFuturism The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that runs ‘smart contracts’. Smart contracts are computer protocols intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. It was created and launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2014. Smart contracts store information about who owns what item(s), who should get paid and who should pay based on certain criteria including time frame, and Ethereum will automatically move funds based on those rules. An example could be property title or a car loan. Ethereum is an open source software.\n\n“Ethereum is emerging as one of the most important blockchain platforms today. Ethereum started as an opensource software platform for decentralized applications, where stakeholders needed Ether the token to pay for computational steps and storage operations on the platform, said Joseph Lubin, Co-Founder of the Ethereum Project” --- World Economic Forum\n\nEthereum was designed to be a programmable blockchain - you can build apps on it - and those apps are referred to as distributed apps or dApps. Ethereum’s blockchain is similar to the bitcoin blockchain, but was created to make it easy to digitize anything related to a contractual obligation.\n\nBitcoin’s Blockchain primarily stores financial transactions.\n\nEthereum’s Blockchain primarily stores contractual transactions.\n\nValue and Scale of Ethereum - Ethereum is Turing-complete which, in very general terms, means that it can be used to program anything. ETH or Ether is the main currency of Ethereum network but Ethereum also provides the ability to create other tokens, shares or currency. Ethereum uses a concept of ‘gas’ as a way to calculate a price for network computation or data storage. Gas is the price and the way to pay for the gas is through Ether.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has another amazing feature which is related to how it incents the network of computers used to validate the blockchain. Five times a minute a computer on the Ethereum network gets a reward of 5 ETH or Ether. The prize is stored in the blockchain. At the current price of approximately $180 per ETH, that is about $4500 per minute or about $6.5M per day.\n\nBecause Ethereum is based on code, the contracts are managed exactly per the rules in the code, without any human intervention required. To fuel the dapps, Ethereum uses Ether. Similar to the incentive of bitcoin, Ether incentivizes computers to validate the transactions for the dapps.\n\n“According to Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin, the Foundation’s core tasks include (a) research on the next version of Ethereum protocol and standards; (b) co-development and maintenance of the six different clients such as C++ and Go; and (c) community outreach to both newcomers and existing community members, publishing transcript of core developer calls, promoting developer events and keeping channels of communications open.” --- World Economic Forum\n\nEthereum is a major game changer when you think about how many inefficient, manual or highly people-dependent processes exist related to contracts.\n\nWhat are smart contracts?\n\nSmart contracts allow someone to programmatically create an agreement or contract between multiple people that contain decisions, store information, can be time-based in the sense that conditions are met according to a time schedule, specific actions can executed based on contract logic, can have an associated validation incentive through the disbursement of tokens/coins and can have a payout or payouts based on certain conditions.\n\nAs Vitalik Buterin says, “a smart contract is a mechanism involving digital assets and two or more parties, where some or all of the parties put assets in and assets are automatically redistributed among those parties according to a formula based on certain data that is not known at the time the contract is initiated.”\n\nCreating these smart contracts on a blockchain mean that they benefit from the advantages of blockchain which include decentralization (no central controlling entity), distribution (a network of computers), security and incentives to participants who validate the transactions.\n\nWhat are decentralized apps or dApps?\n\nAn example of decentralized apps are apps that are built using Blockchain. The backend of a dApp runs on a decentralized network of servers (versus servers controlled by one entity) and could be using smart contracts. The apps built on Ethereum are open referred to as dApps.\n\nWhy can’t we just create smart contracts using bitcoin blockchain?\n\nYou could program smart contracts using bitcoin but it’s much more difficult than using something like Ethereum. Bitcoin has a very limited scripting language.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, explains in a Andreessen Horowitz podcast, that he moved towards a more generic protocol when he realized that he needed to create a Blockchain with no features - no specific transaction types. He built Ethereum to be a very generic architecture based on code so that a person could build whatever they want. You can define state, rules, modifications, etc and therefore you can code anything. Ethereum allows for a more complex set of rules so you could integrate things like IoT devices and non-financial applications.\n\nYou can program Ethereum using Solidity which is a ‘contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).’ Remix is a browser-based Integrated Development Environment that has an integrated compiler and Solidity runtime environment without server side components.\n\nWhat are examples of dApps that are built on Ethereum?\n\nEtherisc is creating Ethereum smart contracts to build decentralized insurance applications to make the purchase and sale of insurance more cost effective and provide greater transparency into the insurance industry. Investors are able to buy and trade a decentralized insurance portfolio. Imagine a completely decentralized insurance agency.\n\nuPort is “an open source software project to establish a global, unified, sovereign identity system for people, businesses, organizations, devices, and bots”. uPort is an identity solution built on Ethereum smart contracts. Identities can be for individuals, devices, entities or institutions. Identities are self-sovereign which means that the owned and managed by the creator. uPort can digitally sign and verify claims, actions or transactions.\n\nGnosis is “crowd sourced wisdom” and built on Ethereum. It is a platform on which you can build apps for industries such as insurance, sales and finance - anything related to prediction markets which ultimately help you make better decisions. Specific applications include hedging risk, incentivizing behavior, forecasting weather and election results.\n\nEthlance is a Ethereum smart contract based freelancing solution. You can create jobs or apply for jobs using Ethlance.\n\nAragon is a dApp focused on two main challenges related to decentralized organizations. The first challenge is upgradeability and the second is decentralized arbitration. Aragon implements basic features of an organization like a cap table, token transfers, voting, role assignments, fundraising, and accounting.\n\nUjo is a music platform built on Ethereum. It leverages uPort for Identity and provides licensing and payments through Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nGolem, which was funded in November 2016, is creating a global market for idle computer power. Basically you can sell your idle computer cycles to someone else. Golem leverages the Ethereum blockchain as a smart contract. The Golem Project describes itself as “Airbnb for computers. Rent your unused CPU/GPU cycles and get paid in cryptocurrency. A decentralized network powering true cloud computing.”\n\nSwarm is focused on “serverless hosting incentivized peer-to-peer storage and content distribution. The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum's public record, in particular to store and distribute dapp code and data as well as block chain data.”\n\nEthereum Computation Market is “The computation market is a service for Ethereum that allows for verifiable off-chain execution of computations that would be otherwise prohibitively expensive to execute within the EVM.” In general terms, ECM allows someone to pay someone else to execute a calculation outside of the Ethereum network and then provide the results of that calculation back to the Ethereum network, where it will be validated. This provides a less expensive alternative to performing complex calculations directly on the Ethereum network, since each execution of code on the Ethereum blockchain has a charge associated.\n\nTrueBit provides ‘a scalable verification solution for Blockchains’. As described in their white paper, “Our new system consists of a financial incentive layer atop a dispute resolution layer where the latter takes form of a versatile ‘verification game.’” In general terms, TrueBit outsources computation by allowing anyone to request a computation and someone else providing the result of that computation as well as being rewarded for that result. TrueBit is an Ethereum smart contract.\n\nMakerDAO is an Ethereum smart contract that provides a less volatile coin, a stablecoin called Sai (first version was called Dai), that is tied to the value of the US dollar. There is also an exchange called Oasis, which is built using Ethereum smart contracts, is fully autonomous and has zero fees. This may be one of the most radical example of leveraging Ethereum smart contracts - imagine being able to completely decentralize our financial exchanges, leveraging Ethereum’s distributed network to ensure validity of exchange transactions, without any person needing to be involved.\n\nWhat are Ethereum browsers? Ethereum is its own network of computers. According to ethernodes.org, there are approximately 23,680 Ethereum nodes in the global network. In order to easily access the Ethereum network and the associated dApps, there are a number of Ethereum network browsers that you can use: Mist, Parity, Meta Mask (a Chrome browser extension) and Status.\n\nScaling Ethereum to billions of users - According to Fred Ehrsam, previously co-founder @Coinbase and a trader @GoldmanSachs, there are two necessary steps: 1. Having all of the necessary parts of the dApp developer stack. and 2. Scalability of these components.\n\nFred Ehrsam Scaling Ethereum\n\n“Facebook as a measuring stick - Let’s do the math on running something like Facebook. Facebook handles about 175k requests per second (900k users on the site in any given minute, assume an action is taken every 5 seconds). And this probably doesn’t include API requests, which are a better analogue and probably 3–4x higher. At the moment, Ethereum can handle about 13 transactions per second, which cuts in half to about 7 transactions per second for tokens (4.7m gas limit, 21k avg gas price for standard txn = ~220 standard txns every block, current avg block time 17s = 13 txns/sec, gas requirement roughly doubles for token transactions). And this doesn’t include more expensive smart contract execution.” — Fred Ehrsam\n\nAccording to Coindesk, the overall market cap for digital currencies has fallen from $115 billion to $61 billion in a month. There are a lot of speculation for the digital currency value drop in the past weeks, including simple market adjustments. This is not a new phenomenon, meaning digital currencies have had 7 years of price fluctuations. That said, don’t bet against blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum or other crypto-currencies. Don’t forget the developer that paid 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas in 2010 - at today’s price, that’s $20 million dollars for two pizzas.\n\nBlockchain could power the next generation Internet and Ethereum has the potential to be a significant part of decentralized cyrptocurrencies, smart contracts and how businesses will reinvent themselves through an entirely new set of capabilities born from new business model innovation."", ""Bitcoin's miners weren't expected to start signaling for the controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x until July 21, but some are already moving to show support in advance of another round of software testing.\n\nAs of today, about 43% of bitcoin's mining power is signaling for the change, including AntPool, BitClub, Bixin, BTC.com and BitFury – and other mining pools may be on the way. Slush Pool, which oversees about 5% of the hashrate, said that it will soon signal as well. As of now, there is no way to tell which are running the code.\n\nStill, all miners need to do to lock-in the update is signal support for the change via a code proposal called BIP91. If a total of 80% of miners do so within the next 336 blocks, a period of about two days, the long-proposed code change Segregated Witness will lock-in.\n\nWhile surprising, the move is likely due to a perceived need to upgrade the protocol to support SegWit before August 1.\n\nThat's when BIP148's user-activated soft fork kicks in, a change that could lead bitcoin to split into two competing assets if not enough of the ecosystem supports SegWit.\n\nMining pools are setting a piece of code in each block that they mine to signal for Segwit2x, though it remains unclear what the state of the code is after a test release was delayed Friday. (Users can check to see how many mining pools are signaling for BIP91 here.)\n\nFor more news, guides and updates on the issue, visit our dedicated blog page.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.\n\nGreen light image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Currently, 97 percent of the town is white, in a country where the demographic sees just 10 percent nationwide being classed as white.\n\nApartheid bastion\n\nCreated in 1991 by Afrikaners on private land, ahead of the democratic elections that brought South Africa into the modern world in 1994, Orania was created as a bastion for believers in the cruel and inhumane principles of Apartheid to continue existing.\n\nAs a self-sufficient town, Orania introduced its own currency called the Ora in 2004 in the hopes of promoting local spending and boosting the town’s small economy. Now, with the boom in digital currencies, Orania hopes to implement this forward thinking technology into its socially backward ways.\n\nThis is not the first time a self-proclaimed micronation has made a foray into digital currency as Liberland, on the banks of the Danube river in Europe, has also done something similar with digital currencies. Another example is Liberstad in Norway, which looks to be an entirely privately run city, with a decentralized monetary system\n\nOra goes E-Ora\n\nOra currently functions like a token or voucher with the users benefiting from discount prices in the town. It is of course not recognized by the South African reserve bank, however, within Orania it can be traded for South African rands at the so-called central bank at a rate of one-to-one.\n\nThe next step for Orania is to do away totally with the town’s fiat currency and thus remove transaction fees which are slowing the use of the internal currency.\n\nDawie Roodt, chief economist at the Efficient Group, a financial consultancy hoping to help the town reduce the transaction costs of the paper Ora, says:\n\n""If you can reduce the cost of the transaction, you can boost economic activity quite substantially.""\n\nJust like the Ora is far removed from the Dollar, or indeed even the South African Rand, the E-Ora will be a far cry from something like Bitcoin, but the people at Efficient Group are hoping to take tips and methods from Blockchain currencies in their design of this digital currency.\n\n""There are significant technological changes taking place in the financial space - like Bitcoin,"" Roodt commented, alluding to Bitcoin being the basis on which this currency may be built on.\n\nHighlights the benefits\n\nDespite the obvious social and humanitarian crimes that Orania revels in, the small town acts as an interesting case study as to the value of a full digital currency on a micro level.\n\nThe hope is that the digital currency will take away fees involved in printing and transferring the current paper money system, boosting the economy as people invest wholly in the virtual E-Ora. This, in turn, will boost the town\'s economy and could very well be an economic microcosmic lesson - but definitely not a social lesson.\n\nOrania Movement\'s James Kemp, 35, says:', ""Within two months, the market cap of Ethereum, the second largest crypto asset in the market, has declined from $36 billion to $14 billion. Analysts state that the current price floor of Ethereum is more stable than before.\n\nSince early June, the market cap of Ethereum has been on a decline, along with other crypto assets and cryptocurrencies including bitcoin. The entire cryptocurrency market experienced a major correction, as the market dipped below $70 billion.\n\nIn an interview, eToro analyst Mati Greenspan told Business Insider that the decline in the market cap of Ethereum is a normal correction resulted from its exponential rise since January of 2017. Earlier this year, the market cap of Ethereum was below $1 billion.\n\nGreenspan also noted that concerns around the ICO market and its bubble-like nature have triggered a decline in the market.\n\nRealistically, over the past few months, the market cap of Ethereum rose at a rapid rate due to the emergence of the ICO market and the successful initial coin offerings of Bancor, EOS and Tezos. However, the vast majority of blockchain projects that conducted ICO campaigns did not present any working or viable products at the time of their campaigns and are yet to demonstrate any software that have went through alpha testing.\n\nAs a result, ICOs including Bancor that raised hundreds of millions of dollars fell in value, dragging Ethereum down along with their decline in value.\n\nDidn't Bancor raise $150 million in its ICO? Its current market cap is only $64 million. pic.twitter.com/nvEzsnhFNX — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) July 16, 2017\n\nIn theory, ICO is a phenomenal method of raising funds for startups and projects without the involvement of intermediaries. In order to participate in traditional investment rounds or venture capital, individuals have to be approved and become accredited investors. ICOs enable anyone to participate in funding rounds of projects. More to that, ICO is only a part of the infrastructure Ethereum provides for decentralized autonomous applications or organizations.\n\nHowever, the market has become bloated due to the emergence of projects without viable products. The vast majority of software have not even demonstrated their potential with actual market measures such as user base and stable revenue streams.\n\nEthereum has created an efficient and secure ecosystem for decentralized applications. However, none of the decentralized applications launched on top of the Ethereum protocol have actual user bases and successful commercialized platforms. Hence, until Ethereum secures active users and sees the emergence of successful decentralized applications, its price and market cap should not be overvalued by investors.\n\nAlthough many traders were caught off guard with the recent correction of the cryptocurrency market and Ethereum, a major correction has been long overdue and many analysts have predicted a major correction since last year.\n\nBitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos explained that the recent correction of bitcoin price is also a correction of its exponential growth and the scaling debate or the possibility of chain split did not play a major role in driving its price.\n\n“The ‘reason’ bitcoin price is dropping is the rapid 1500% rise in 2 years, esp. the last 3 mo. The ‘scaling debate’ is just a trigger. Relax,” said Antonopoulos.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:"", 'Bitcoin is making a comeback after taking a weekend plunge.\n\nThe cryptocurrency dropped by nearly 20% over the weekend, putting in a low of $1,758 a coin before recouping some of those losses. It\'s currently trading at $2,048.\n\nAt the low point, bitcoin was down by more than 40% from its record high of about $3,000, set June 12.\n\nThe weekend plunge pushed the cryptocurrency below the target of Sheba Jafari, the head of technical strategy at Goldman Sachs. In early July, Jafari put out a note saying bitcoin was ""still in a corrective 4th wave"" that ""shouldn\'t go much further than 1,857.""\n\nJafari wasn\'t the only one who thought bitcoin was getting ahead of itself.\n\nTech billionaire Mark Cuban suggested bitcoin was in a ""bubble."" Back on June 6, just before the cryptocurrency put in its record high, Cuban tweeted: ""I think it\'s in a bubble. I just don\'t know when or how much it corrects. When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $=bubble.""\n\nAdditionally, Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said bitcoin was in a bubble unlike any we had seen before.\n\nAs for where bitcoin will go from here, Jafari\'s July 3 note suggested that after a big drop, a fifth wave would take bitcoin to record highs. ""From current levels, this has a minimum target that goes out to 3,212 (if equal to the length of wave I),"" Jafari wrote. ""There’s potential to extend as far as 3,915 (if 1.618 times the length of wave I). It just might take time to get there.""\n\nEven with the recent plunge, bitcoin is up 113% in 2017.', 'OKEx, the blockchain asset-only exchange launched by Chinese bitcoin giant OKCoin’s international arm has revealed details of measures being taken ahead of the potential user activated soft work (UASF) on August 1.\n\nLaunched in late May this year, OKEx became OKCoin International’s blockchain asset-only exchange offering spot and margin trading for global users. In an announcement today, OKEx revealed it will suspend Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals between July 31 and August 02 “due to potential technical risks such as replay attacks and other issues that may cause network instability.”\n\n“We believe that the fight for the future of Bitcoin has been based on technical ideas, not on conspiracy theories,” the leverage-enabled trading exchange opined, “or politics amongst various companies and organizations.”\n\nIn the event of a spilt of the bitcoin blockchain, OKEx is promising users of every blockchain ownership of their coins. The digital asset-only exchange is also assuring users of support for any or every possible type of bitcoin as a result of the split.\n\n“On OKEx contracts trading, for existing undelivered maturities, the calculation of the Index price will be the sum price of all Bitcoin types of the respective exchanges should they support them,” OKEx wrote. “After delivery, new OKEx contracts will be tied to a particular version of Bitcoin, and OKEx will take steps to support contract trading for all types of Bitcoin. “\n\nIn stating its stance to support any and all forms of Bitcoin to enable different options to customers, OKEx is also advising users to deposit Bitcoin in advance for uninterrupted trading while taking responsibility to “handle all resulting technical issues” during any potential forks.\n\nThe exchange also warned of measures including suspension of accounts or the roll back of trades if it determines any malicious manipulation of the market during the 3-day suspension.\n\nHaving previously enabled Ethereum trading for Chinese users on its platform, OKCoin urged the bitcoin community to “work together and resolve any outstanding technical issues” in order to solve Bitcoin’s scaling issues.\n\n“No matter how dominant, how much market share you have, if you do not adopt the latest technology and fail to constantly improve on the core user value proposition, time will pass you by,” warned OKCoin in a plea at the time.\n\nIn revealing its plans ahead of the potential USAF on August 1, OKEx now wrote:\n\nWe believe in the years ahead, after a long period of market competition, one or several versions of Bitcoin will be widely adopted.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Since June peak at $3000, Bitcoin lost 35% of it’s value driving the rest of the cryptocurrency market into chaos as 1st August is approaching which is scheduled to trigger activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) and could lead to a split in Bitcoin’s blockchain. There is no need to explain what’s going to happen in the coming weeks as the internet is already full of articles containing the details about it.\n\nWhat’s really important is the price structure and how we can interpret it to get an idea about the possible coming path. We believe that the world market is ruled by technical analysis as fundamentals is only used to trigger the move. So as we have an important coming event for Bitcoin, then usually the market will send us a message through the charts which we can read it with different methods.\n\nLet’s start by taking a look at previous BTCUSD chart and understand what the price has done in the past :\n\nBitcoin December 2013\n\nBitcoin January 2015\n\nBitcoin July 2016\n\nBitcoin seems to be doing a simple 3 waves correction then bouncing higher again, so if you actually bought last year dip or even better the 2015 dip then you should be still enjoying the show from a lower price despite the recent drop. Every instrument around the world is doing the same thing over and over again : after a strong move in a bullish/bearish trend, the price starts a boring correction full of misleading movement to consume time until the next leg starts.\n\nBitcoin is no different from the others and it’s been following the same path in bigger & lower time frames. So why it didn’t rally to new highs after the first 3 waves pullback in June ?\n\nWe mentioned in our previous article how bitcoin can rally to new highs after ending a 3 swings pullback but if the pivot at June lows fails then it will end up extending the correction in 7 swings to the downside. The tricky part is to identify what type of correction is taking place because no one can predict how big the correction will be and how much time will it take.\n\nBitcoin WXY 8H Chart 07/16/2017\n\nWXY is one of the most common patterns in the new adaption of Elliott Wave Theory. This structure is commonly called double three Elliott Wave pattern. Market shows this structure very frequently nowadays in many instruments in almost all time frames. It is a very reliable structure by which we can make a good analysis. What is more important is that it can give us good trading inputs with clearly defined levels of invalidation and destination areas.\n\nConsequently, BTCUSD has already reached the 100% – 161.8% Fibonacci extension area ($1900 – $1400) where we expect buyers to show up looking for a new move to the upside or at least a 3 waves bounce. But as long as the price fails to make new highs then it could be part of a larger corrective structure and it’s only ending the first leg of it.\n\nBitcoin ABC 8H Chart 07/16/2017\n\nThe structure can be counted in a different way if Bitcoin is doing an ABC Flat structure, which is another common type of correction that can be sometimes hard to trade because it tends to extends beyond the 1.618 fib ext level. There is many other scenarios that can play out but i’m only presenting the two most aggressive ones to explain the current “deja vu” situation for BTCUSD.\n\nRecap\n\nMarket condition has changed over the time, instruments can be trending higher or lower in series of 3 wave sequences rather than impulsive sequence and this can be frequently seen in the forex market. Bitcoin is no exception as it’s just another financial instrument leading the correction of the cryptocurrency market and still has the potential to rally to new all time highs. It won’t matter if it will do it from current levels or a lower area, what really matter is how you are willing to manage your position during such movement to protect your investment.\n\nNo one is perfect and we don’t claim to have 100% accuracy, but a system with high accuracy acts as a great trading tool because forecasting is a process of continuous adjustments. A waver (trader) needs to accept when an idea doesn’t work out and adjust to new data.\n\nBecome a Successful Trader and Master Elliott Wave like a Pro.

The early rise probably turned out to be a major reason for the top digital currency to be racing towards conquering a higher price with little or nothing standing practically in its way.\n\nAs at today, the crypto market has dropped to about $80 bln according to current figures from CoinMarketCap with Bitcoin capturing 46 percent.\n\n""When added to the professed agreement for major players to work together on the Bitcoin scaling issue starting September - if it becomes a reality, the price could see between $4,000 and $5,000 before the year ends.""\n\nBuilding up\n\nThough the June lifting of the withdrawal embargo on Chinese exchanges seems to have added to the positive impact the market witnessed last month, the pace at which Bitcoin has moved in the first half of the year crossing the $2,500 price before the end of June speaks volume of what to expect before the year ends.\n\nUsing a simple moving average method to calculate a realistic addition to the Bitcoin market capitalization come 2018, it shows the current cap could sit comfortably at slightly over $50 bln come May - at around $37 bln today. This is based on the four-year market cap figure available on coinmarketcap.com and the approximately 17,062,500 Bitcoins that would have been in supply by then.\n\nPublicity\n\nThe global curiosity level for Bitcoin has risen since the WannaCry hackers’ introduction of the top digital currency to new heights.\n\n""The publicity created by the hack - good or bad - spread inevitably into various countries of the world, into new sectors that would never have considered talking about Bitcoin, and into the lips of those whose curiosity has been seen clamoring to be satisfied albeit in a little way.""\n\nReal questions asked\n\nIt hurt at first when the publicity was somewhat bad. Afterwards, after the digital currency’s security component has been deemed reliable by top security experts - though not everyone would admit this advantage openly - such that it makes it difficult even for the hackers to get away with the ransom easily, real questions are now being asked: What is Bitcoin? How does Bitcoin works? What do you need to know about Bitcoin? etc.\n\nSimple as they may seem, you’d be surprised to know the number of people who still can’t answer these questions at all and the few that have an unreasonable idea of how to go about them. The urge to find answers to these questions about Bitcoin could not have come at a better time.\n\n""A fraction of the risen Bitcoin price could be attributed to being a result of the added number of people who asked these questions - with some of them getting answers that really convinced them to understand what they have been missing on for quite some time.""\n\nShortly after the hack, the latest information from Google Trend showed that Bitcoin rose to the fourth spot as the most trendy term in the US. Globally, it showed that interest in the currency was to the roof (100) in the week of May 15 though it now sits at an 84 score rate.\n\nWhile Bolivia was on top of the list with interest climbing higher in Singapore, Pakistan and India at the time, South Africa now leads today as the country with search interest for the currency followed by Nigeria. Interest is also at the maximum for search terms: Bitcoin price and Bitcoin payment system.\n\n2017 a good year\n\nThe current Bitcoin price decrease is due to the uncertainty around the coming long-awaited SegWit activation, says the founder of Cashaa (Auxesis Group), Kumar Gaurav though he is unsure of what could come next.\n\n“When looking at 2017 so far, it still has been a good year for Bitcoin, starting just below 1000$ and now standing just below $2,000. Whether and to which extent this overall trend will continue will be seen more clearly after some crucial dates such as 1st August. If 80% of the Bitcoin community adopts the updates all should be fine. It seems most likely this will be reached, as the current signaling of intended support is at 87.8 percent, an increase from 83.28 percent in May. Comparable to when in May, following the New York agreement on SegWit2x, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $2,160, it can reach new all-time highs after a successful activation as Bitcoin will be more attractive again and bring users of other cryptocurrencies back to Bitcoin.”\n\nAnother factor influencing the Bitcoin price is the ongoing ICO trend as ICOs are either being conducted in both Bitcoin and Ether or only in Ether, he adds, saying that it is either both digital currencies are being cashed out or only Ether being cashed out for Bitcoin and fiat.', 'Bitcoin reversed steep losses as miners began using new software which aims to bridge an ideological gap that has threatened to divide the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin’s community has been at bitter odds for more than two years about how to solve its scaling problem, which has hampered the cryptocurrency’s growth and allowed rivals like ethereum to steal some of the spotlight.\n\nThe new software, known as SegWit2x, is seen as a compromise for the two sides of the debate: miners who deploy costly computers to verify transactions and act as the backbone of the blockchain, and developers known as Core who uphold bitcoin’s bug-free software. While both sides have incentives to reach a consensus, bitcoin’s lack of central authority has made reaching agreement difficult.\n\nThe price of bitcoin rose to as high as $2,356 before trading at $2,348 as of 2:22 p.m. in New York. The digital currency slumped to as low as $1,758 over the weekend on Coinbase’s exchange. Bitcoin, which has more than doubled this year, climbed to just shy of $3,000 on June 12.\n\nSegWit2x was formally released over the weekend and has already gained adoption by large miners Antpool, BTCC and Bixin. About 55 percent of blocks mined in the last 24 hours were done with SegWit2x, according to coin.dance, which monitors blockchain activity.\n\nIf support reaches 80 percent and maintains that threshold from more than two days, it will move bitcoin closer to avoiding a split.\n\n“Traders are excited by the prospect of a resolution to the scaling debate, which is why the price has rallied,” said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Gatecoin.\n\nRead more about bitcoin’s civil war.\n\nDespite the progress with SegWit2x, some warned that bitcoin isn’t out of the woods yet. Many Core members still vehemently oppose the software, which they say hasn’t been properly vetted for bugs. Also, not all miners support SegWit2x, which they say is a flawed compromise that doesn’t solve the root scaling problem.\n\n“This price rally is a bounce, we are very bearish in the near term for a number of reasons,” said Harry Yeh, managing partner at digital currency dealer Binary Financial, who cites the lack of support from Core developers as one of his biggest worries. “Anytime the price rockets up quickly, it will be followed by a strong correction which we are starting to see. We are definitely headed for some turbulent and volatile times in the short term.”\n\n— With assistance by Lulu Yilun Chen', 'When John McAfee noted that he is willing to stake his name and up to $10 mln on a bet that the Bitcoin price will move above $500,000 within three years or he would ""eat my d**k on national television."" it appears like he meant Bitcoin as we all know it.\n\nHowever, the security expert later clarified in a series of tweets after much questioning that he was referring to the proposed fork of the top digital currency by a group seen to be championed by Jihan Wu.\n\nThat is, as a respondent puts it, McAfee’s initial $500,000 prediction was not for Bitcoin but “a new altcoin that you and Jihan will mine?” to which he responded:\n\n“Jihan and thousands of others. THE Bitcoin. Please... count the f**king votes!!”\n\nTo be precise, McAfee stated that based on his doctorate in point-set-topology - also called set-theoretic topology or general topology, which is the study of the general abstract nature of continuity or ""closeness"" on spaces- the predicted Bitcoin price in three years will be $2,431,013. However, other mathematics systems put it at between $1.9 mln and $2.6 mln.\n\nOn the daily or weekly multiplier he used to arrive at the price over a three-year period, the CEO of MGT Capital Investments, which mines digital currencies, responds: “None. Point-set-topology does not rely on multipliers. It is too pure for such subjectives. A multiplier is a human thought. It is not math.”\n\nHe also added that the projected price would develop over time based on an asymptotic curve. Additionally, he is not trying to stimulate as the price is of no concern to him as a miner, since he will always make 150 percent a year irrespective.\n\nOn Jihan’s fork\n\nWhen asked if he thinks the ecosystem can reject malicious actors like the current Bitcoin Core team in time, he states that he is with Jihan, his friend “and the smartest man” he knows and believes that “the money will follow him (Jihan).”\n\nHe states:\n\n“I\'m hanging with Jihan. That\'s where the money is. And yes, he us (is) a great friend. And the smartest man I\'ve ever met.”\n\nHe didn’t specify if he will mine either BTC-ABC (8mb blocks) or Btc1 (2mb/SW) or (1mb/sw) but rather chose to follow only Jihan\'s fork simply because “I\'m not an idiot.” While he maintains that only Jihan\'s fork will have value, he notes that there will be a huge damage to the main Bitcoin and its price “may go back to $40.”\n\nWithin the given projected period, McAfee puts the Ethereum price at somewhere between a penny and $200,000.', 'VIENNA (Reuters) - European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny warned against accepting bitcoin as an official payment method, saying the digital currency lacked stability and was too vulnerable to speculation.\n\nMany governments around the world are considering how to regulate and classify bitcoin BTC=BTSP, whose value surged in June to hit a record just shy of $3,000.\n\nIn April, the Japanese government recognized bitcoin as legal tender as part of efforts to use financial technology to stimulating the economy.\n\n“Bitcoin lacks the one thing that makes a good currency, namely stability,” Nowotny told Austrian daily Kleine Zeitung in an interview published on Wednesday. “Bitcoin is an object of speculation,” he said.\n\nLike other virtual currencies, bitcoin lacks a single governing authority like a central bank. Instead, bitcoin transactions are recorded on thousands of computers across the world that maintain logs and validate transactions - technology known as blockchain.\n\nInvestors have begun warming to the technology, wooed by its explosive performance and its potential to compete with gold and government-issued money as a store of value.\n\nBitcoin has fallen 20 percent since its record high in June but is still 245 percent over the past year.\n\nWhile the central bank would not prohibit bitcoins, people should be aware of the risks, Nowotny said.\n\nBitcoin can be traded on exchanges in the same manner as stocks and bonds. It has also become a mode of payment for some retailers, and a way to transfer funds without the need of a third party.\n\nThe ECB is doing “experimental work” with the same ledger technology that underpins bitcoin but it needs further research before considering adopting it, ECB executive board member Yves Mersch said in April.', ""One of China's biggest bitcoin investors has raised approximately $82m in an initial coin offering (ICO), setting a new record for the novel fundraising method in China.\n\nLed by entrepreneur Li Xiaolai, Press.One bills itself as a decentralized content distribution platform based on the recently launched EOS blockchain. In total, the ICO collected 5,853 bitcoin, 106,757 ether and 30,430,519 EOS from 14,104 participants.\n\nBut while the figures may be impressive, the final numbers represented less than half the project's initial target of $200m – in part due to a decline in prices across the global cryptocurrency markets.\n\nSince the the ICO began, the prices of bitcoin, ether and EOS have fallen 18 percent, 26 percent, and 46 percent, respectively, shrinking the total market value of the project by an estimated $52m.\n\nICO concerns\n\nHowever, it may not be the decline in prices that was the only factor in the missed target. Skeptics of the ICO have publicly argued that the project is too ambiguous and ambitious, with some also claiming that the project lacks a white paper to explain its technical details and offers limited information on the development team.\n\nUsers of social platforms including 8BTC, Weibo, WeChat and Steemit further expressed concerns over the way the ICO was managed and its legality.\n\nBased on the Press.One website, the purpose of the ICO is to build a public blockchain based on EOS. Other than traditional media, potential competitors to Press.One include content distribution site Steemit, which helps content creators receive rewards for their work and is based on similar technology to EOS.\n\nBesides Li, who serves as CEO, the project lists Li Lu as chief technology officer. The two previously partnered to launch a website named Knewone, which became Less, a lifestyle community sharing application.\n\nAnother unusual characteristic of the Press.one project is the distribution of 10 billion tokens, dubbed PRS, which will only be dispersed to contributors six months after the ICO. Temporarily, though, the tokens are scheduled to be tradable on July 12, 2018.\n\nTeacher turned tycoon\n\nThe other side of the story is Li's growing popularity as a successful and what some portray as inspiring investor.\n\nBorn in the 1970s, Li started a career as a salesman and became a well-known English teacher in China. Prior to the emergence of bitcoin, Li had already made a name for himself by publishing two bestselling books about time management and methods in mastering vocabularies for English tests.\n\nThen, in 2011, he started mining and investing in bitcoin, and by 2014, he reportedly owned over 100,000 bitcoins, making him one of the largest investors in the cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter founding the Bitfund venture capital firm in 2013, Li also established Yunbi, a cryptocurrency exchange based in China. According to Coinmarketcap, that exchange is now the 7th largest in the world by trading volume.\n\nCurrently, Yunbi trades ICO tokens and cryptocurrencies, including several backed by Li, such as EOS, Qtum, Siacoin, the latter of which has just received $400,000 from INBlockchain, another capital fund launched by Li.\n\nLi Xiaolai image via CoinDesk archives\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The creators of Peyta didn’t make as much money as the Wannacry extortionists had made a few weeks earlier, as Petya only raked in around $8,000 worth of BTC. However, the money the hackers accumulated has moved and following those bitcoins has proven to be extremely difficult.\n\nAlso read: Basel Institute: “Take Action Against Digital Currency Mixers/Tumblers”\n\nPetya Ransomware Funds Travel Through the Tumbling Process\n\nThe latest Petya ransomware wasn’t as crazy as the mainstream media portrayed it to be, and the creators only made off with $8,000 in extortion funds. One of the reasons the attackers didn’t make much money was due to their email being shut down. What’s interesting about the Petya ransomware is the hackers chose to use one particular address to collect funds as opposed to multiple addresses commonly used in these types of protocols. After a couple of days, the hackers started moving the money to different addresses. Individuals following the funds believe the money was sent through a tumbler or a platform that mixes bitcoins in order to obfuscate the sending process.\n\n‘A Vast Majority of Transfers had More Than Ten Total Transactions’\n\nAccording to the publication Quartz those bitcoins will be extremely hard for law enforcement to locate. The news outlet says they followed the money as far as they could, but the bitcoins were sent through a series of transfers and one of them was a legitimate bitcoin exchange. After the first few hops, the publication details funds were sent to a “high volume address” which they assumed was the trading platform.\n\nAfter this point Quartz explains, they could only speculate on which transactions belonged to Petya.\n\n“We collected each spent output from that address, then each spent output from those addresses, and so on,” explains Quartz columnist Keith Collins. “In order to limit the number of rabbit holes the crawler followed, we only included transfers that occurred within eight hours of the first outgoing transaction from the first wallet. We considered high-volume wallets to be wallets that had three or more total transactions, as returned from the Blockchain.info API, but the vast majority of those had more than ten total transactions.”\n\nTaking Action Against Digital Currency Mixers\n\nThere are multiple ways for groups and individuals to mix their bitcoins to confuse blockchain surveillance. These include tumblers like Joinmarket and the many other mixing platforms found on the deep web. Further, some users opt to utilize altcoins like Zcash and Monero, because they believe these cryptocurrencies offer better anonymity. In the future, many people think better forms of cryptocurrency anonymization will be coming like Schnorr signatures and other types of Zero Knowledge platforms. However, law enforcement and government officials have been saying for quite some time that bitcoin mixers and anonymizers should be illegal. For instance, the Basel Institute on Governance, Europol, Interpol, and U.S. officials have been discussing proposals to “take action against digital currency mixers/tumblers.”\n\nCan Law Enforcement Really Follow 2373 Hops?\n\nQuartz details that the Petya funds were estimated to be sent to over 2373 addresses over the course of the mixing process. “If we knew what bitcoin address or addresses the Petya money ended up in, we’d likely find hundreds of thousands of transactions between that address and the starting address,” explains the news outlet. “That’s more than we could ever chart.”\n\nThe news comes at a time when blockchain surveillance companies have become a hot topic, and just recently Chainalysis claimed to know the destination of the missing 650,000 Mt Gox bitcoins. With hackers mixing their coins through a series of transfers blockchain forensic companies may be fabricating how well they can follow these transactions.\n\nWhat do you think about mixing transactions?

As per reports, the Finance Ministry is also looking to develop a specialised framework for international transactions using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThese steps will be taken as part of foreign exchange regulations, according to media reports.\n\nAt present, the Reserve Bank of India regards cryptocurrencies as a violation of the country’s existing foreign exchange norms. This is because the conversion of Bitcoins into foreign exchange does not currently fall under the purview of the central banking institution, making such transactions highly unsafe and vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\nIn order to solve such problems, the government is reportedly considering setting up financial awareness programmes, provisions for consumer protection, KYC norms and a framework for monitoring cross-border cryptocurrency transfers. Consequently, the regulatory body will be responsible for monitoring all Bitcoin and other virtual-currency transactions against goods and services.\n\nIn the report, the Finance Ministry has also talked at length about security concerns, including money laundering and terrorism financing activities, associated with the use of Bitcoins. Taking its cue from countries like Canada and the US, the Indian government has highlighted the need for stringent, enforceable acts to curb such unlawful practices. These acts will likely include mandate KYC-enabled customer verification for greater security.\n\nRise Of Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin In India\n\nWith the emergence of advanced digital payment technologies, the global Bitcoin market has witnessed rapid growth in recent times. The crypto-asset market is currently worth more than $35 Bn. Despite a 46.9% decline in the last 30 days, Bitcoin’s total share in the cryptocurrency space is more than 47.1%, as per reports by Coin Marketcap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a new study by Cambridge University, around 2.9 Mn to 5.8 Mn people use cryptocurrency wallets, chief among which is Bitcoin. At present, there are about 90 other virtual currencies operating worldwide. Among the countries that have banned the use of Bitcoin are Russia, China, Iceland, Bangladesh, Sweden, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nAs per a 2016 Trak.in report, India boasts more than 50,000 Bitcoin wallets. Of these, 700-800 Bitcoins are operated daily. In March 2017, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a statement against the usage of encrypted money like Bitcoin. The further use of any such currency will be considered as a breach of anti-money laundering provisions. The Central Bank also warned users, holders, and traders of security concerns surrounding Bitcoin or any other virtual currencies.\n\nThe Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal told Inc42, “The absence of counter parties in usage of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, for illicit and illegal activities in anonymous/pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA month later, the country’s Finance Ministry announced the formation of a special committee that would be suggesting measures for minimising security breaches and vulnerabilities related to cryptocurrency usage. The committee’s report carried the following points:\n\nBitcoins would fall under the purview of RBI’s 1934 Act.\n\nBitcoin investors should be taxed.\n\nThe RBI would have to issue guidelines regarding investment and purchase of Bitcoins.\n\nIf any foreign payment is made through Bitcoins, it would fall under the purview of FEMA Act.\n\nReturns from investment in Bitcoins need to be taxed.\n\nIn June 2017, it was reported that the government may be inching closer to legalising virtual currencies in India. KYC norms will make the task of customer protection more thorough, experts believe. Over the last few years, a number of startups, such as Zebpay, Coinsecure, and Unocoin, have sprung up in the cryptocurrency space. The domain has already witnessed an increase in funding opportunities in the last year or so.\n\nBengaluru-based Bitcoin startup Unocoin raised $1.5 Mn in a Pre Series-A round from Blume Ventures, Mumbai Angels and ah! Ventures in September 2016. Ahmedabad-based mobile Bitcoin wallet startup Zebpay raised Series A funding of $1 Mn from angel investors in January last year. Another Bitcoin trading platform Coinsecure secured $1.2 Mn as part of its Series A investment round from an undisclosed investor in April of 2016.\n\nBy instating a robust framework as well as KYC norms, the Indian government will be able to wield greater control over the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry in general and its chief player Bitcoin, in particular.\n\n(The development was reported by DNA India)', 'Bitcoin price might be done with its correction and the Fibonacci extension tool shows how low it could go from here.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is completing its pullback to the broken triangle support at $2400.\n\nThis lines up with a Fibonacci retracement level and the extension tool shows the next potential support areas.\n\nTechnical indicators are showing that the selloff could resume around these levels.\n\nBitcoin price might be done with its correction and the Fibonacci extension tool shows how low it could go from here.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside.

This could also limit the Fed’s ability to hike interest rates as the economy could slow later on.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin price has been able to benefit from the return in risk aversion in the markets on lower commodity prices and fresh catalysts.

Instead, they are partnering with the IOTA Foundation due to faster transactions with much lower fees.\n\nBitcoin has been the original Blockchain technology on which a number of businesses have built their services on. SatoshiPay is just one of those companies to use Blockchain technology, but they are now looking beyond that to a microtransaction Blockchain-less crypto token called IOTA.\n\nSatoshiPay began using Bitcoin in 2015 as a system to settle these micropayments, and back then it was a viable option as fees for Bitcoin transactions were around $0.02. However, recent congestion on the Bitcoin Blockchain, from an increase in interest, has sent fees skyrocketing towards an average of $3, and up to $5 at times.\n\nSatoshiPay will now be relying on the IOTA network for its micro payments as it believes this is a superior technology for its services.\n\nSuperior technology?\n\nThe IOTA network is the eighth biggest cryptocurrency in the total value of its supply, but most importantly, it is a technology that boasts almost zero-fee transactions. It also has no limit as to the amount of transactions it can process per second.\n\nThe IOTA protocol runs off of Tangle, which has similar functionality to a Blockchain yet acts more like an emulated version giving it more versatility. Tangle’s representation is an acyclic graph, which has an order yet can go in any finite partial order represented by the original structure.\n\nIn describing IOTA, the co founder, David Sønstebø put it thusly:\n\n“IOTA is a decentralized, very lightweight micro-transaction token that is optimized for the Internet-of-Things. It is essentially a blockless ledger without any sort of fees on transactions. ‘Money of IoT.’”\n\nNew advancements\n\nIt seems that while Bitcoin was the pioneer of this new form of Blockchain technology, there have been advancements around it that have overtaken it.\n\nBusinesses looking to utilize decentralized chains and tokens now have a range of choices that have improved upon the original Bitcoin.\n\nSatoshiPay CEO Meinhard Benn said:\n\n“We love Bitcoin for its pioneering role in the creation of our industry, but some Blockchain networks it inspired have evolved faster than Bitcoin itself, so we decided to move on to superior technology.”\n\nNot the first time, won’t be the last\n\nThe switch to altcoins, as well as so-called superior technology, is not new in the world of Blockchains and cryptocurrency.\n\nYours, a Blockchain based social network, announced recently that it would be switching away from Bitcoin to Litecoin, for similar reasons surrounding fees and speed of transactions.\n\nThere is a lot of worrying developments and discussions surrounding Bitcoin at the moment, especially about the scaling debate.

07/19/2017,"['Bitcoin has rebound to $2,400 and Ethereum is up 25 percent in a day as optimism returns to cryptocurrency markets in a big way.\n\nThe shift into the green coincides with reaching the required consensus for BIP 91 to lock in for Bitcoin. This paves the way for SegWit activation without the need for a hard fork.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has recovered spectacularly from last week’s seismic losses, currently trading at an average of $242 according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nReacting to the price performances, traders and commentators alike were buoyant.\n\nCoincidence? Perhaps. Or perhaps the Bitcoin market is speaking. pic.twitter.com/n2s7U9G6jW — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) July 18, 2017\n\nBitcoin had been tipped to decrease further in the run-up to Aug. 1, the date when the likeliness of a hard fork occurring would become clear.\n\nDespite the overwhelming support for BIP 91, however, business are still announcing preparations for mitigating against problems arising from a hard fork.\n\n13 Japanese exchanges have now joined Chinese heavyweight OKCoin in announcing they will halt trading from July 31 to protect users from the possible fallout.\n\n“...We have decided to suspend withdrawals and deposits at each exchange until the issue surrounding the Bitcoin fork is resolved,” a statement from the umbrella Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association confirmed.', ""Money is pretty simple nowadays: A piece of paper or a digital asset that you can exchange for goods and services. Someone else takes care of all the fine print. Some kind of central authority issues the money, calculates its value, and makes sure that that wire transaction you've sent goes to the right recipient.\n\nBut money is changing. First there was Bitcoin, a digital currency that takes care of the issuance and payments parts all by itself — by means of technology instead of authority. And then there was Ethereum, which adds another layer over Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain, by letting anyone run complex commands from within the digital coins themselves.\n\nIf the concept makes you dizzy, you're not alone. Even figuring out how to correctly operate a Bitcoin wallet can be daunting, and this smart contract stuff sounds either like hardcore sci-fi or incomprehensible babble, depending on how technical you are.\n\nAnd yet, I strongly suggest you invest some time into learning how smart contracts work. If you don't, in the future you might be too ignorant to understand what's happening with the money you own.\n\nSEE ALSO: These are the most promising cryptocurrencies right now\n\nHere's a non-definition that I like: Ethereum makes your money alive.\n\nYou can do a lot of very advanced stuff with regular money. Invest it into the stock market and place an order that sells if the price goes below a certain point. Have it transferred to another person in case you die. Place it in an escrow account and have it transferred to some entity if certain conditions are met.\n\nEthereum makes your money alive.\n\nBut to do every one of those things, you need a different authority, with which you have to confirm your identity and possibly pay a significant sum of money.\n\nWith Ethereum, all of that stuff is baked right into the money itself. You can literally purchase some ether (Ethereum's currency) right now, and create a smart contract that does any of those things, and it will stay valid as long as Ethereum exists.\n\nBut someone will figure out a way to simplify this, right?\n\nThis may sound like that time in the '90s when everyone warned you'll need to learn how to code if you want to be a human in the future. That never happened, except, in a way, it did. You don't have to know how to code to function in the modern life, but life is easier if you can — if only by the simple virtue of never being out of a job.\n\nYou don't really have to know how to code to be an adult these days, but it sure as hell doesn't hurt.\n\nLearning how smart contracts work is by no means necessary right now, and if the concept lives up to its promise, in the future there will be people who will handle the fine print instead of you... for a fee. But you will once again be putting trust into someone else's authority, which undermines the very concept of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's better if you can do it yourself.\n\nHere's something that might hit closer to home. In the past couple of months, a lot of people who knew what smart contracts are and how they work earned money — and you probably didn't. They did it by investing in ICOs, for example, or by building cool new things on the Ethereum platform themselves. There are no guarantees, of course, but those who recognized the potential of this technology early on had a much better chance at succeeding.\n\nAnd if you tried to invest without the necessary knowledge, you could've easily lost money. A smart contract that might look promising at first could be flawed in many ways, and one that seems boring could be revolutionary. For an example of how tough it can be to determine which Ethereum-based project is promising and which one is flawed, read this elaborate critique of the recent Bancor ICO (here's the response from Bancor).\n\nI'm not saying everyone should drop what they're doing right now and start learning about Byzantine-fault-tolerant multiparty consensus systems (an actual term from the Ethereum white paper), or take courses in Solidity (the programming language of the Ethereum platform). But familiarizing yourself with the basic concepts and learning enough to be able to read an upcoming ICO's white paper might pay dividends in the future.\n\nWhere do I start?\n\nI can tell you where I started. I read what I could find online. I follow the key people on Twitter and the community of investors and traders that gather around influential blogs and on Reddit. I've bought some ether, and I (unsuccessfully) tried to participate in an ICO or two. I've read the Ethereum white paper, several times. I'm learning the basics of Solidity and dabbling with my own smart contracts.\n\nBut you don't have to do all of those things.\n\nHere are some basic concepts you need to know. An Ethereum smart contract is a piece of code that runs on Ethereum's blockchain, and as such is by definition decentralized. It is impersonal, transparent, unyielding. It does not care about who wronged whom, or what your name is. It does what's written in the code. Once it's live on Ethereum's blockchain, no one can alter it. This is precisely what makes it great.\n\nYou also need to know that, despite these facts, it's possible that a contract is bad for you. Maybe one of its functions calls parameters from the outside that can be changed at a later time. Maybe some stuff in there is defined in such a way that the digital assets you think you own can be erased or devalued. It's very tough to figure out these things on your own (if you're not an expert), but now you at least know some questions you can ask.\n\nFinally, know that Ethereum may just be the beginning. Other platforms that are in some ways even more advanced, like Tezos and EOS, are cropping up. And Ethereum itself is under very active development; what's true today may not be true in a year or two. So you need to know that you can't just learn a thing or two and forget it; you have to keep up with the times.\n\nA future ruled by knowledge and technology instead of authority\n\nThe possibilities of this new technology is vast. It's not unimaginable that a decade from now, a platform such as Ethereum will handle stuff like trust funds and wills. It might become an important part of your life. Who do you want to be: The person who doesn't have a clue and has to fully trust an expert, or someone who can tell when they're being swindled?\n\nI still don't know everything there is to know about Ethereum — in fact, I've barely scratched the surface. But I do know, roughly, how a smart contract works, and I've built a foundation that'll make it easier to learn more in the future. I strongly suggest you do the same.\n\nDisclosure: The author of this text owns, or has recently owned, a number of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH."", 'As lending startup SoFi expands from student loans to full-service banking, it is also venturing into one of the trendiest areas among big Wall Street banks at the moment: blockchain.\n\nYet while Bitcoin, the original blockchain, commands the lion’s share of attention—and also the biggest valuation of any cryptocurrency—SoFi sees much greater potential in its younger sister, Ethereum.\n\nThat’s because bitcoin, although designed to be used as a currency, is not a very practical one, whereas the Ethereum blockchain can be used to facilitate all sorts of other financial transactions, SoFi CEO Mike Cagney said Wednesday.\n\n“If the dollar didn’t exist, and all we had was Bitcoin, we would be fine. But the fact that it trades [in dollar terms] and its value fluctuates so significantly makes it nearly impossible…to use as currency,” Cagney said at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen, CO. “The blockchain on Ethereum, on the other hand, has absolutely fascinating infrastructure applications.”\n\nAn upstart cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s price has surged so dramatically in recent months that it now commands nearly as much market share as Bitcoin itself. Driving that rise is excitement about the way Ethereum allows its blockchain technology to be used to develop myriad other projects, as Cagney described.\n\nIn particular, SoFi, which is valued at more than $4 billion, is exploring a way to use blockchain to revolutionize title insurance, a standard requirement for many home buyers.\n\nSoFi got into the real estate business when it began offering mortgages in the fall of 2014. But the title insurance process, which involves checking property ownership records to determine whether a house can be rightfully sold, is still painfully old-fashioned, Cagney said. Under the current system, a home buyer typically pays thousands of dollars to hire someone to go to the county courthouse and search through documents for any outstanding liens on the property.\n\nInstead, those paper records could be moved to the blockchain, where a transaction log can be securely stored—and still easily accessible—on what’s known as a distributed ledger, “where you have absolute truth in terms of what those liens are and what that information is,” Cagney explained. In order to generate revenue to fund the development of such a system, he suggested, the information could be encrypted, and SoFi could sell the key to unlock it.\n\nThe main challenge for SoFi to pull this off is persuading a county government to agree to fully switch over to the digital system—a move without which SoFi wouldn’t be able to monetize it. “If you run [both systems] in parallel, the blockchain or the Ethereum aspect of it is not enforceable, because [users] can revert back to the paper trail,” Cagney said. “So you need to find a county that’s willing to do a complete conversion onto a distributed network, and when you have that, there’s an interesting application there. And that’s a multibillion dollar industry.”\n\nFortunately for SoFi, it has already found a county willing to get on board, Cagney said. (He didn’t specify which county; a follow-up question to a SoFi spokesperson went unreturned.) But the company may reveal more details soon. Asked whether SoFi expects to launch the blockchain system for title insurance later this year, Cagney responded, “We’re trying.”', 'Early adopter he isn’t. So, when prominent financial blogger “Downtown” Josh Brown announces that he has made an entree into the realm of digital currencies, it may be worth taking notice.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brown, a regular contributor on CNBC’s “Halftime Report” and chief executive of New York investment advisory firm Ritholtz Wealth Management, said via Twitter that he made an investment in bitcoin BTCUSD, +7.13% (and he told MarketWatch he’s also looking into bitcoin rival Ethereum too):\n\nI bought my first Bitcoin https://t.co/QION1crgW5 — Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) July 18, 2017\n\nBrown’s purchase is part FOMO, fear of missing out, and a recognition that the recent ascent (and subsequent stumble) of so-called cryptocurrencies demand Wall Street’s attention, and should’t be summarily dismissed as newfangled, buzzy, millennial-driven hokum.\n\nRead: Opinion: Stay away from bitcoin and ethereum—they are complete garbage\n\n“I don’t think crypto is something you can understand fully by reading a book, so I’m getting my hands in. If it turns out to be a bust, I will probably still come away with something valuable.” Josh Brown, CEO at Ritholtz Management\n\nHere’s how Brown described his investment to MarketWatch:\n\n“I would add that I view it is as my responsibility as a money manager to try to understand trends that are happening and how they may someday affect markets and the economy. I don’t think crypto is something you can understand fully by reading a book, so I’m getting my hands in. If it turns out to be a bust, I will probably still come away with something valuable.”\n\nBrown’s bitcoin dalliance comes as digital currencies broadly are drawing a wave of mainstream attention from average Janes and Joshes to heavy hitters like Abigail Johnson, the chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments. Johnson told attendees at a digital-currency and blockchain (the digital ledger underpinning most cryptocurrencies) conference in New York in May that “huge new markets and products will be built on these platforms.” She said the big barrier to more rampant adoption is better regulation.\n\nThe compelling aspect of bitcoin and other so-called decentralized money systems is that they threaten to knock fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.23% BUXX, -0.14% the euro EURUSD, +0.1698% and the British pound, GBPUSD, -0.0372% for example, on their rear.\n\nOne bull argument for cryptos is that central bankers around the world have been printing money at an unprecedented clip to support global economies rocked in the aftermath of the 2008-’09 financial crisis, with fears of asset values inflated from this central-bank policy helping in part to lift currencies like bitcoin higher. Also, because bitcoin and the blockchain ledger, which can computerize and record individual transactions without an intermediary, threaten to disrupt financial markets in the same way the internet upended media and communications and every other industry.\n\nA number of others heavyweights have thrown money at digital currencies, including former Legg Mason Capital Management investor Bill Miller, who told Forbes in a recent interview that he invested 1% of his net worth in bitcoin in 2014. Assuming that Miller bought at the beginning of 2014 when a single bitcoin was worth $770.44, bitcoin has rallied more than 200% to $2,345 as of late-morning Wednesday, according to popular digital-currency site Coindesk.com. And had Miller invested even earlier his gains would be truly winning, with a $1,000 invested in 2010 reaping more than $35 million today (not adjusting for inflation).\n\nThe digital currency Ether, which runs on the Ethereum network and wasn’t even around two years ago, has climbed more than 2,800%. (It is worth noting that bitcoin has been around for less than a decade).\n\nBy comparison, the broad-market equity benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, -0.41% has climbed 18.72% on a total return basis since the start of 2014, and nearly 100% over the past five years, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.31% has rallied 13.11% since 2014 and 46.5% in the past five years, according to FactSet data.\n\nDigital currencies more broadly , however, have come off their best levels over the past month, following the brisk run-up, which had been supported by the aforementioned Wall Street enthusiasm and hints that non-fiat based currencies would receive the imprimatur of regulators to trade as the underpinning for exchange-traded products.\n\nSome of the bullish bets on the outlook for bitcoin seem absurd on their face. John McAfee, the outspoken founder of the namesake antivirus software company, is betting that single bitcoin will be worth $500,000 in about three years.\n\nTo be sure, there is a palpable degree of mania around cybercurrencies. And caution is merited for those who have forgotten the debacle that was Mt. Gox.\n\nMt. Gox, which at one point handled more than 80% of bitcoin transactions, ceased operating suddenly back in 2014, due to a massive hack. Many individual investors complained that hundreds of thousands of dollars were lost or stranded. In the end, the losses tied to that security breach have been pegged at nearly a half-billion dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, another digital-currency trend is raising eyebrows: so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs. The term used to describe crowdfunding for blockchain-related startups using new digital currencies rather than existing cryptos, has been described as a “ticking time bomb” by one the founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nFor Brown’s part, digital currencies are worth a look. And it is perhaps the approach average investors should take.\n\n“I think at this stage in the game, it is important to be open-minded and not afraid to lose money or look foolish. I’ve invested into way dumber things in my life. And as far as what the future holds—if the disruption hippies turn out to be right, and the 21 million BTC that will eventually be the limit are out there in public hands, it is hard to imagine them not appreciating in price.” he said.', 'After closing down almost 25% last week, bitcoin has recovered almost 75% of the loss, and is now comfortably back above $2000. The wildly volatile week followed more than 25 days of consolidation. The last consolidation period of this length was in June and July 2016. Both periods resolved with large down days followed by a quick reversal.\n\nThe Bitcoin network hash rate has also varied violently recently, spiking to over 6 trillion GH/s since the last difficulty adjustment on July 14. The last adjustment added 13.53% to difficulty, making the cumulated change +97.35% since January.\n\nNodes signalling for UASF/BIP148 continue to rise, despite about 75% of blocks now supporting BIP91. The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal lowers the activation threshold for SegWit from 95% to 80%, and initiates activation within 336 blocks instead of the 2,016 required by SegWit/BIP141.\n\nAt this point, after years of debating scaling size and solutions, this resolution should be welcomed by miners, users, and speculators alike. Even still, a “contingency plan” for UASF, named UAHF or “User-Activated Hard Fork,” continues to be promoted and touted by miners and proponents of increased block size. UASF activates on August 1st.\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin transactions per day recently peaked around 320,000, and pulled back with price consolidation.\n\nThe Mempool size, or transactions waiting to be confirmed, has dropped precipitously in recent days as well.\n\nGlobal OTC volume shows a similar pattern, having pulled back from recent highs, which is to be expected during periods of consolidation.\n\nOn the exchange side, USD and JPY continue to account for the majority of Bitcoin trading volume, with Bitfinex and Coincheck holding top volume in each country respectively.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe Ichimoku Cloud is a constant, auto-drawn indicator which quickly offers an immense amount of valuable information on any time frame. The Cloud is best used at higher time frames as more data generally provides more accurate signals and less false positives.\n\nThe indicator uses moving averages and dynamic support and resistance to make projections of key zones, as well as capturing 80% of any given trend. As long as the price remains above the Cloud, sentiment remains bullish. Price in the Cloud indicates a neutral trend, and below the Cloud indicates a bearish trend.\n\nWhen the Tenkan (T) is over the Kijun (K) sentiment is bullish. K over T would indicate bearish sentiment. When the Lagging Span (LS) is above the Cloud and above the price sentiment is bullish, below the Cloud and price would indicate bearish sentiment.\n\nOn the daily chart, price has perfectly traversed the cloud twice now, finding support and resistance on the respective edged. The cloud itself represents a no trade zone and should be thought of as an uncertain future overall. Until price breaks above or below the cloud no further trades should be taken. The Kumo Breakout, would be the first indication of actionability, followed by the remaining signals aligning for further confluence.\n\nOn the four hour chart, signals are mixed, but again, a Kumo Breakout with bullish TK cross would be the first indication of a long entry signal. I would also watch for the four hour 50/200EMA cross as bullish confluence. The last two such crosses proved to be extremely accurate signals.\n\nNext, let’s review the high probability support targets of the trend so far.\n\nPrice has never closed below the weekly Kijun or daily 200EMA, despite events such as: developer Mike Hearn selling all his coins and making sure everyone knew about it (January 2016), Bitfinex being hacked (August 2016), the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) unleashing additional regulatory burdens against Chinese traders (January 2017), COIN ETF denial by SEC (March 2017), or current SegWit miner shenanigans (July 2017).\n\nPrice has also rarely closed below the ML of this pitchfork since 2015. The median line (red) of the Pitchfork gives the expected mean of the trend. Price will continually attempt to return to this diagonal. Each diagonal of the Pitchfork can be thought of as a potential reversal zone or support/resistance line. The upper blue diagonal zone being ‘most overbought,’ or the top bounds of the trend, and lower blue diagonal zone being ‘most oversold,’ or the bottom bounds of the trend.\n\nDrawing a new pitchfork, using the Bitfinex hack as the anchor low, and the pre-PBoC announcement high and post ETF rejection low, yields the beginning of a similar pattern. I would consider this pitchfork valid based on the number of times the diagonal support/resistance have been respected.\n\nThis would leave price hanging in the upper blue quartile suggesting there is a higher likelihood of downside than there is upside potential.\n\nThere is also potential inverted head and shoulders based on price structure, albeit unlikely due to the lack of descending volume profile. Nevertheless, this would yield a target of ~$3000. The structure also respects the yearly pivot supports almost precisely.\n\nConclusion\n\nThanks to BIP91, SegWit seems all but guaranteed now without a UASF. However, the ongoing threat of a hard fork looms. Longstanding high time frame support has held after a bearish resolution to a period of extended consolidation. Trend remains intact. For bullish entry signals, look to the daily and four hour cloud. There is also a potential but unlikely inverted head and shoulders forming, with a measured move target of ~$3000.', 'Thirteen bitcoin exchange operators in Japan said they will suspend deposits and withdrawals of the virtual currency from midnight July 31 in order to prevent confusion caused by an expected split of the trading system.\n\nThe move is aimed at protecting customer assets.\n\nThe number of bitcoin users is rapidly increasing partly on the back of low commissions for overseas remittances. But the growing transaction volume has led to an increase in speculative trading, and the exchange operators are taking longer to execute transactions as a result.\n\nSome in the bitcoin industry are planning to set up a new system enabling faster transactions, while others are calling for the continued use of the current system.\n\nA virtual currency association to which the 13 operators belong said it is difficult to estimate the degree of confusion but that a serious problem cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe operators are planning to indicate by Aug. 4 when trading will resume.', 'Bitcoin has held strong support and has its sights set on a test of the $3,000 level, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a note sent out to clients on Monday, Sheba Jafari, the head of technical strategy at the bank, updated her recent chart work on the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe $1,856 to $1,790 area ""has the potential to act as strong support,"" Jafari wrote.

To further accelerate support for BU\'s vision of a scaled network, nChain will build on the BU client software and further address the needs of bitcoin miners. nChain\'s development team will contribute its staff and processes to strengthen the BU software with (1) rigorous software testing and quality assurance - including a Secure Software Development Life Cycle, and comprehensive testing that includes unit and regression testing, as well as performance, loading and explorative testing; (2) thorough software documentation; (3) strong software support; and (4) detailed project management.\n\nOn July 24 and 25, 2017, teams from nChain and BU will meet for a workshop in Vancouver, Canada to discuss technical improvements to the BU software. nChain will also explore additional ways to use its innovations and expertise to collaborate with BU, and to jointly support on-chain scaling of the bitcoin network.\n\nnChain\'s Chief Executive Officer Stefan Matthews comments:\n\n""nChain\'s mission is to enable exponential growth of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and the bitcoin network for everyone\'s benefit. We have confidence that the BU client software provides a solid foundation for this mission, and are pleased to provide our expertise and resources to improve the software. This will open a future of massive on-chain scaling where everyone, especially miners, reaps financial rewards, as the value of bitcoin dramatically increases.""\n\nAndrew Stone, Lead Developer of Bitcoin Unlimited, remarks:\n\n""I am excited to work with the nChain team to make Bitcoin Unlimited a stronger, more useful client. Bitcoin Unlimited already has significant support as an alternative to Bitcoin Core, but better software will only enhance its role as the foundation to a faster, more powerful network -- the network that the bitcoin community has always envisioned.""\n\nProviding technical expertise for BU software is the first among many steps nChain intends to take to support the broader bitcoin community. Mr. Matthews observes:\n\n""Bitcoin has reached a critical juncture, and its community has become highly polarized. It\'s time to remember we\'re all on this bitcoin journey together, and there is more than enough opportunity for everyone to succeed. While reasonable minds may disagree on how network growth should occur, let\'s not artificially divide the community. Instead, let\'s find more ways to collaborate and foster \'coopetition\' to achieve a rewarding bitcoin future for all.""\n\nIn addition to its support of BU, nChain is researching and developing tools, protocols and applications to support blockchain growth worldwide. This includes a software development kit to enable programmers to develop applications on the bitcoin blockchain, solutions for scalability of the bitcoin blockchain, inventions to improve security, on-chain scripting for smart contracts and a decentralised trading platform that uses autonomous agents.\n\nABOUT NCHAIN: nChain is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies. Its mission is to enable massive growth of the bitcoin network and dramatic increase in the value of bitcoin for everyone\'s benefit. The nChain Group of companies has grown to a team of in excess of 60 world-class scientific research, engineering and other professionals primarily based in London, United Kingdom and Vancouver, Canada.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nCONTACT: For media enquiries, please email media@nChain.com\n\n\n\n\n\nor contact Infinite Global at:\n\n\n\n\n\nKelsey Eidbo (Infinite Global, US/ASIA)\n\n415.732.7804\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Gilleard (Infinite Global, EMEA)\n\n+44 (0)207 269 1430\n\nView original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nchain-announces-technical-support-for-bitcoin-unlimited-client-software-300490986.html\n\nSOURCE nChain']"
07/20/2017,"[""Within a 24-hour period, Bitcoin price increased from $2,300 to $2,600, recording a staggering 13 percent surge in value.\n\nEarlier this week, miners began to signal for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal BIP 91, a kludge between the original Segregated Witness (SegWit) proposal and the Digital Currency Group-led SegWit2x, also known as the Silbert accord.\n\nDespite its short timeline that may cause difficulties for developers resulting from technical instability, BIP 91 was the last chance for miners and the Bitcoin community to avoid a network split, which would have led to the creation of two Bitcoin Blockchains or Bitcoins.\n\nIn contrast to user-activated soft fork, BIP 91 is a miner-activated soft fork, which will activate SegWit, a transaction malleability fix and scaling solution developed by the Bitcoin Core development team at an 80 percent activation threshold, as listed on the SegWit2x proposal.\n\nThe 80 percent activation threshold was surpassed on July 18 with major mining pools including Antpool, BTCC and Bitfury signaling for the activation of BIP 91. At the time of reporting, hash rate signaling BIP 91 is at 83.3 percent and analysts including Squeeze have noted that BIP 91 could be fully locked in within the next few days.\n\nDemand Increases\n\nSince mid-2016, the Bitcoin industry, its businesses, community and users have highly anticipated for the activation of a scaling solution to optimize Bitcoin blocks and ultimately, lessen Bitcoin fees.\n\nIn an interview with BraveNewCoin, Laurent, the French developer behind Bitcoin analytics platform OXT, claimed that he is 95 percent confident affected the Bitcoin mempool and number of transactions until January of 2017.\n\n“Considering that the published elements are the result of an exploratory analysis, I would say that I'm 95 percent confident. 100 percent confidence will require an in-depth analysis which is currently outside what my financial resources allow me to do,” said Laurent.\n\nWhen SegWit activation seemed likely through SegWit2x, the size of the Bitcoin mempool abruptly decreased, and experts including Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow expressed their concerns over intentional spam attacks.\n\nAt the moment, leading Bitcoin wallet service providers including Blockchain are recommending a fee of around 90 satoshis per byte for a median size transaction, which would range from $0.5 to $0.9. Only a few months ago, average Bitcoin fees spiked to over $5.\n\nThe activation of SegWit will lead to a 75 percent optimization of Bitcoin blocks and a substantial decrease in Bitcoin transaction fees. Optimism surrounding SegWit and the scalability of Bitcoin has pushed Bitcoin price up, from $1,850 to $2,600 within a week."", 'HATFIELD, Pa. (AP) — A self-described computer hacker claims he stole over $40 million in the virtual currency bitcoin, and told officials he was planning to flee to London by using a fake passport in the name of actor Jeremy Renner.\n\nCourt documents say Theodore Price, of Hatfield, told police he had written software to steal as much as $50 million in bitcoin. The Morning Call reports (http://bit.ly/2vDJzh7 ) Price is charged with access device fraud and identity theft described in a Wednesday court filing.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency with no ties to any government. It can be exchanged for U.S. currency and other national currencies. The current exchange rate is over $2,600 U.S. dollars for 1 bitcoin.\n\nPolice began investigating Price after two laptops were reported stolen by a Holland Township couple. Price\'s girlfriend later discovered Price had stolen the laptops from her parents, and reported the theft to police.\n\nPrice was also charged with unauthorized access to a computer for personal financial gain, but the charge has since been withdrawn. Assistant U.S. Attorney would not say why Price was not charged with theft, saying federal prosecutors have about a month to seek an indictment from a grand jury.\n\nBased on the evidence it hears, a grand jury can recommend whatever charges it sees fit.\n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security officials say they found stolen personal information in Price\'s possession, which he claims to have purchased from a ""dark web"" store. The ""dark web"" is a network of encrypted internet sites often used by cyber criminals.\n\nAccording to Cornell University Professor Emin Guin Sirer, who studies cybersecurity and virtual currencies, bitcoin is a common target for hackers as there is no regulation — so no higher authority can reverse a fraudulent transaction.\n\nWhile theft is common, Sirer says it is unusual to actually locate the person responsible for a theft.\n\nPrice\'s public defender didn\'t immediately comment Thursday.', 'Bitcoin.com’s mining services continue to grow exponentially as pool.bitcoin.com commands roughly 3 percent of the Bitcoin network’s global mining power. In addition to the company’s mining capabilities, Bitcoin.com is partnered with the largest U.S.-based bitcoin mining data center allowing the company to leverage mining services like no other business in the industry.\n\nBitcoin mining is a very competitive industry as miners worldwide are verifying transactions while securing the network for economic incentives. Bitcoin.com takes mining seriously with its world-class mining pool as well as offering the best cloud mining contracts in the industry. In the last quarter alone Bitcoin.com in partnership with a large confidential North America-based data center has purchased over US$15M worth of Bitcoin mining equipment and have sold more than $8M in cloud mining contracts.\n\nCloud mining is a unique service that allows anyone to earn bitcoins through the mining process without having to purchase specialized hardware or use complicated software. In essence, users purchase the mining power from a data center enabling them to obtain bitcoins. Bitcoin.com started its cloud mining operations back in May and has seen record sellouts ever since.\n\n“Our hashrate demand seems to be growing in lockstep with the Bitcoin price, and it doesn’t show signs of slowing,” explains Bitcoin.com developer Shaun Chong after the first wave of cloud mining contract sales were sold.\n\nBitcoin.com’s CEO Roger Ver is thrilled to see pool.bitcoin.com and the firm’s cloud mining services gain so much interest.\n\n“This clearly shows that Bitcoin.com is one of the most profitable companies in the entire ecosystem today. With our continued efforts we will pave the way for the future mass adoption of Bitcoin via on chain scaling as originally outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto.”\n\n\n\nWe can see the significant interest for bitcoin mining as specialized hardware and chips are getting harder to obtain because global manufacturers can’t keep up with the demand.\n\nOur partnership with one of the largest data centers in North America has enabled us to purchase millions of dollars worth of mining equipment. This allows Bitcoin.com the ability to offer the best cloud mining services in the industry.\n\nAs one of the main security components for bitcoin, the most trusted and tested blockchain worldwide, mining will continue to be a profitable industry. Bitcoin.com’s pool aims to sustain its leadership by offering the very best mining structure to its clients with 110 percent block reward and 0 percent fees. Further, our cloud mining offering includes three contract durations for maximum flexibility: three months, six months, and lifetime (while profitable) plans. Bitcoin.com sells cloud mining to continue growing its hashrate that supports on-chain scaling, and utilizes sales revenue to purchase more mining hardware.\n\nBitcoin.com is a leader in the digital currency and blockchain industry by leveraging multiple facets of this emerging and innovative technology. The company’s mining pool and cloud services are growing in unison with bitcoin’s natural development as the future of money.\n\nFor more information please visit www.bitcoin.com and pool.bitcoin.com.\n\nMedia contact: Mate Tokay\n\nMedia contact e-mail: mate@bitcoin.com', 'SoFi CEO Mike Cagney recently backed Ethereum over Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency of the future. According to Cagney, the nature of Bitcoin, its inextricable link to the dollar and its inherent volatility make it virtually impossible to use as a commercial vehicle of value. In contrast, Ethereum provides an infrastructure that promotes widespread and varied usage, while at the same time maintaining equal levels of security and protection. At a recent conference in Aspen CO, Cagney said:\n\n""If the dollar didn’t exist, and all we had was Bitcoin, we would be fine. But the fact that it trades [in dollar terms] and its value fluctuates so significantly makes it nearly impossible...to use as currency. The Blockchain on Ethereum, on the other hand, has absolutely fascinating infrastructure applications.""\n\nThe contrast between the two systems is not unique. Many have cited the potential for a ‘flippening,’ or a scenario where Bitcoin is overtaken by Ethereum in market share and valuation. With the recent collapse of Ethereum prices, however, this does not look to be a likely event in the near future. Regardless, the existence of such alternative cryptocurrencies does put pressure on the Bitcoin marketplace.', ""Theodore Price, a self described computer hacker, has claimed responsibility for one of the biggest digital currency heists when he was investigated by police for two stolen laptops and a gold necklace.\n\nPrice came clean to a local detective, as well as a Homeland Security Agent, who approached him in an investigation of missing jewlery and computer equipment from his girlfriend’s parents house.\n\nIt is alleged that Price wrote software to steal between $40 and $50 mln worth of Bitcoin by replacing wallet addresses through malware.\n\nSimulated Bitcoin wallets\n\nIf the heist can be proven to be true, it would rank in the top five digital currency thefts of all time said Cornell University computer science professor Emin Gun Sirer.\n\nStill at the top of that pile is the Mt.Gox hack which saw $480 mln dollars emptied from their digital coffers.\n\nPrice allegedly achieved this feat by writing software that simulates the code used to create Bitcoin wallets. From there, the malware was distributed on a number of Internet forums and injected into email addresses.\n\nThe software steals the Bitcoin keys by replacing other people’s wallets with Price’s during transactions.\n\nPrice admitted that one of the Bitcoin wallets in his possession contained $34.6 mln and that he was planning on laundering it and fleeing to London, England.\n\nAvengers assemble\n\nPrice had begun his planning for fleeing the country while still trying to figure out how to use his stolen Bitcoins. With the transparent nature of the Bitcoin ledger, he could remain anonymous, but his transaction could be noted and draw attention.\n\nPrice’s plan included chartering a private jet for England under the name of Jeremy Renner, the actor who plays Hawkeye in the Avengers movie franchise.\n\nCaught by a gold chain\n\nPolice began investigating the Pennsylvania man when Price’s girlfriend's parents return home to find two laptops missing from their home, as well as a gold necklace. The hacker was approached by his girlfriend about the burglary, as he had access to the house but he denied it.\n\nLater on, it was discovered that Price sold her father’s laptop for $150, when two laptop bags with the mother’s computer, stolen credit cards belonging to people related to the girlfriend and the dark web credit card information were discovered in his possession.\n\nAll the money in the world, nowhere to spend it\n\nIt seems strange that Price, who is admitting to having over $40 mln in Bitcoin, would be hawking laptops for the paltry sum of a few hundred dollars. It is the fact that laundering money with Bitcoin is not that simple as the ledger is public.\n\nHackers will often try and process large amounts of Bitcoin through “tumbling” which means intermingling it with other people’s transactions."", 'Bitcoin has shot up 20% in a day as a true reversal of the weekend’s downturn gets underway across international markets.\n\nSudden Surge Will Likely See Best Daily Growth In History\n\nData gathered from across major exchanges by CoinCap shows a current average price of $2605 – up almost $500 in 24 hours.

This week, investing icon Bill Miller and Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown both revealed they have made small investments in bitcoin.\n\nBut buying bitcoin and Ethereum isn’t as easy as buying shares of popular stocks.\n\nFirst, investors need to choose a digital currency wallet. Bitcoin owners must store their digital currency in one of these downloadable wallets until they are ready to sell or spend. Coinbase Wallet is one of the most popular options for both bitcoin and Ethereum, but other digital currency wallets include Mycelium, Electrum, Exodus and Jaxx. Different wallets provide access to different exchanges and have different security features.\n\nAfter choosing a wallet, investors must choose an exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly without the assistance of a broker. Coinbase, Poloniex and CEX are among popular exchanges. When choosing an exchange, investors should consider the fees the exchange charges, the regulatory compliance of the exchange and its security history. Several cryptocurrency exchanges have dealt with security breaches in the past.\n\nFinally, investors must decide on a payment method. Different exchanges accept different payment methods, including direct bank account transfers, credit card payments, wire transfers and PayPal transfers. Coinbase accepts all of these payment methods.\n\nRelated Link: The History Of Ethereum, In One Infographic\n\nAn alternative method of buying bitcoin is by going to a physical bitcoin ATM. At the ATM, users can insert cash and receive bitcoin in return. Buyers get either a receipt with a code that can be used to stash the bitcoin in a digital wallet or the transaction is directly recorded in the wallet on a smartphone.\n\nAs of March, there were more than 1,000 cryptocurrency ATMs already installed around the world, but that number is growing rapidly on a weekly basis. At this point, the vast majority of these ATMs are bitcoin ATMs, but Ethereum and other cryptocurrency ATMs have started to pop up as well.\n\nThe biggest downside to using ATMs to buy cryptocurrency is the transaction fees, which are typically around 5 percent.\n\nFor new cryptocurrency buyers who want to keep things simple, Coinbase is probably the best way to go. Investors can download the Coinbase digital wallet on their smartphone, link their bank account or Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) PayPal account and get started buying bitcoin or Ethereum on the Coinbase exchange.', ""Slush, the CEO of Satoshi Labs, the company behind the Trezor Wallet and other efforts in the cryptocurrency space, also the founder of one of the first Bitcoin mining pools, stirred up a bit of a discussion on Twitter recently when he said that he believed scaling changes are being rushed.\n\nBIP91 is too rushed. Serious stability fixes at last moment. We're doing our best to deploy on time & responsibly to not endanger network. — slush (@slushcz) July 20, 2017\n\nThe debate on the scaling of Bitcoin and the various solutions that aim to make that happen is to reach a tipping point on August 1st, with mining nodes either signaling or not the way forward that they want to go. In one scenario, miners which do not signal in favor of a certain proposal will be blacklisted from the larger blockchain. Scenarios like this can lead to chain splits. Chain splits can lead to market uncertainty.\n\nRecently, it seems there was a significant dip in the value of Bitcoin, and then a requisite rebound already took place. This rebound is incomplete, of course, for people who bought at the high. Those people may have some time yet to wait, as the volatility that may come along with impending uncertainties will play its role on the price as well as usability of Bitcoin proper.\n\nMany comments on the Twitter thread suggested that running Bitcoin Core and the BIP91 patches is the best way forward.\n\nNevertheless, in a separate Tweet, Slush clarified that his pool would be going with the flow of things, not fighting some political agenda:\n\n@slush_pool will start signalling #BIP91 tomorrow. Please calm down everybody, we don't play any political game. — slush (@slushcz) July 19, 2017\n\nNon-politicized stances would have been preferable all the way through the scaling debate. Instead, hyper political activities on both sides of the debate led to all time high and a fever pitch of raging pitch forks going both ways. Neither side was quite sure why they were so angry at the other, but both sides took to the web with all the vitriol of jilted lovers. The whole scene did not give a good look to Bitcoin as a whole, and whether you believe there was a bubble or not, newcomers witnessing such nonsense in a season of such robust price rising were probably spooked. That this contributed, in part, to the downfall of the recent all time high cannot be disputed – certainly Bitcoiners do not look like much more than a childish bunch of accidentally wealthy libertarians from a high level view, after a certain point. Not the sort of thing to throw a lot of money into, in short – although these episodes fade, and then fresh money flows in, inevitably, as we’ve seen over the past few years.\n\nAll things being equal, less drama would lead to a better Bitcoin.

07/21/2017,"['Bitcoin has risen as much as 28% over the past 24 hours, driven by news that an imminent split in the cryptocurrency has been narrowly averted. The price of bitcoin nearly hit $3,000 late on July 20, within spitting distance of its all-time high, set last month.\n\nThe remarkable rally took place as bitcoin’s miners coalesced around one of several competing proposals that would increase the number of transactions that can be processed on the network. The issue has gained urgency in recent months, because one of the measures, known as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP 148), would lead to a split in the cryptocurrency on Aug. 1 if implemented.\n\nThe price rallied as bitcoin’s miners began broadcasting their support for a less radical proposal, BIP 91, in increasing numbers yesterday. This proposal avoids the so-called “hard fork” by stopping short of altering the hard-coded limit on transaction capacities that is the bone of contention within the bitcoin world, while offering slightly enlarged transaction capacity.\n\nThe threshold for activating BIP 91 is 80% of all the processing power on the bitcoin network. That was achieved in the early hours of July 21. Currently 97% of the processing power on the network, which is largely controlled by miners, is voting in favor of BIP 91.\n\nBut it’s not settled yet. Although enough miners have signaled support for their preferred proposal—a process akin to broadcasting a preference over the network—enough of them must now run the software that implements this proposal within the next two and a half days. Failure to maintain a simple majority of the processing power, also called the hash rate, would mean BIP 91 does not activate. This would put the bitcoin world back at square one, with just a week to go before the potentially destabilizing hard fork on Aug. 1.\n\nThere are also still signs that the fundamental disagreement that led to this showdown—a “civil war,” as some call it—is far from resolved. The fight is between bitcoin’s miners and the influential programmers who contribute to bitcoin’s open-source code, known as the “core developers.” The core devs say bitcoin is at risk of being controlled by a cartel of miners who, by virtue of their huge investments in processing power, are able to dictate what changes are made to the code—anathema to bitcoin’s decentralized founding ethos. But the miners, and other heavy users, like payment processors, point out that the bitcoin network could be abandoned if it doesn’t enlarge its limited capacity soon.\n\nThe architect of BIP 91, James Hilliard, a miner himself, told industry publication CoinDesk: “This is where mining centralization makes things easier, because I can just message everybody on WeChat and help them if needed.” That may be so, but it won’t comfort the parts of the bitcoin world concerned with centralization of the cryptocurrency, even if the current fix to bitcoin’s problems goes according to plan.\n\nRead next: Bitcoin’s civil war threatens to blow up the cryptocurrency itself', 'It\'s raining gold, and I mean it, Bitcoin prices in the last one year has only headed north.

The main benefit is the blockchain (aka distributed ledger) on which they\'re based. Blockchains let you transact without needing the blessing of a third party or banker middleman. Bitcoin is a kind of cryptocurrency that uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.

As proponents of the change celebrate, here’s what some have to say about what may be next.\n\nAdam White, head of cryptocurrency exchange GDAX\n\n“We’re going to see greater utility of the network. Now people can use bitcoin as a way to transit value more easily, more quickly, more cheaply. And that tends to attract in new users to the network.""\n\n“Going forward, there will probably be open-blockchains like bitcoin, which tends to move more slowly or conservatively, but there will be other blockchains like ethereum that may move more quickly and introduce a larger surface area for developers to build on top of. I think both of those things complement each other, not compete with each other.""\n\nMatthew Werner, head of payments engineering at Coinbase\n\n“It’s a great step for bitcoin. There were a lot of question marks, obviously this has been in contention for quite some time now, but reaching consensus for how to scale bitcoin further is a huge step, clearly. SegWit activating and allowing things like Lightning Network is going to be huge for allowing more activity with existing user base, and down the line once we start to expand the blocksize, we’ll be able to expand the number of users on the network.""\n\n“The fact BIP91 came through is a good signal that everyone wants to be growing this network further. And there’s a lot of ways that it’s accomplished, but the fact there is way forward is encouraging. You’ll never know what happens between now and a few months down the line, in the cryptocurrency space especially, but I’m encouraged everything we saw in the past few weeks.

If miners fail to continue joining forces to enact BIP91 and Segregated Witness, then the UASF and UAHF plans could still happen, in fact, the UAHF may happen regardless. Below is a compiled list of exchanges that have detailed their contingency plans for an upcoming fork, as some of them will be halting deposits and withdrawals and taking the necessary steps to secure their trading platforms and customer assets.\n\nA List of Current Exchanges That Have Issued Statements Concerning a Possible August 1 Fork\n\nXapo\n\nThe bitcoin company Xapo has issued a statement about August 1 telling customers that bitcoin transactions during a fork will be suspended. Xapo says if users need to do transactions during a fork, customers should get their bitcoins off Xapo before August 1. Coins held on the exchange will be available after the network change and “Xapo will keep your bitcoins safe,” explains the firm.\n\nGDAX/ Coinbase\n\nCoinbase and GDAX have made similar statements because they are the same company. The San Fransico-based firm has detailed that it will suspend deposits and withdrawals during an August 1 fork scenario and may halt trading. As far as the user-activated hard fork is concerned GDAX and Coinbase have also announced they will not support that chain and its associated token. Coinbase recommends that those interested in acquiring UAHF tokens should remove their bitcoins from their exchanges.\n\nHuobi\n\nThe Chinese exchange Huobi has issued a report on its plans to suspend bitcoin deposits and withdrawals on August 1 due to “potential technical risks.” The exchange details, “if there is no fork, and the network is stable, we will resume deposits and withdrawals from Bitcoin.” Further, the company says that if customers are not comfortable with their wallet or feel they are not protected with anti-replay attack software, then they should deposit funds on Huobi before August 1.\n\nBTCC\n\nBTCC has also announced its contingency plan stating that the exchange will honor both a minority and majority chain. However, the trading platform has not detailed if it will suspend deposits and withdrawals at this time. “In the case of a hard fork, BTCC will give existing customers tokens on the minority chains based on how many tokens they have on the majority chain at the time of the hard fork. We will update users as the situation progresses,” explains the Chinese exchange BTCC.\n\nOkcoin\n\nAnother Chinese exchange, Okcoin has announced that it will suspend deposits and withdrawals. The company’s statements are nearly identical to Huobi’s contingency plan. The company does say that if Bitcoin splits into several blockchains, the exchange will honor “every blockchain and give users their rightful ownership of their Bitcoin.” Further Okcoin says that if anything “unexpected” happens the trading platform will suspend bitcoin trades as well.\n\nGemini\n\nThe Gemini exchange issued its statement concerning August 1 saying the company will do their “best to support chain withdrawals.” However, the exchange details that unlike the Ethereum / Ethereum Classic bifurcation last year they cannot “guarantee” they will be successful as there is a lack of “bidirectional repetition protection in the different bifurcations of Bitcoin Core (including Segwit2x, UASF, BitcoinABC, and Bitcoin Unlimited).”\n\nBity\n\nThe Switzerland based cryptocurrency exchange Bity has detailed it will be suspending deposits, withdrawals, and trading as soon as the 29th of July approaches. The company says it is preparing replay-protection and will “start bitcoin trading as soon as the dust settles and we know which chain(s) is(are) surviving.”\n\nKraken\n\nThe exchange Kraken has not officially given any statements about the fork. However, during a recent podcast, Krakens CEO Jesse Powell details that the trading platform will have to freeze deposit and withdrawal funding. “Everybody with a balance on Kraken would have two coins” in the event of a fork says, Powell. Depending on the risks of replay attacks customers should receive both tokens.\n\nThirteen Japanese Exchanges\n\nAccording to Japan’s Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA), thirteen exchanges have announced suspending bitcoin services on August 1. This means participating exchanges will suspend deposits, withdrawals, and possibly trading. The exchanges suspending services include Bitbank, Bitpoint, Quoine, Fisco, Coincheck, Btc Box, Tech Bureau (Zaif Exchange), GMO-Z.com, Campfire Corporation, Bit Trade, Bitcrements, Tokyo Bitcoin, and Minnano Bitcoin.\n\nBitflyer\n\nJapan’s largest exchange that wasn’t included in the JCBA list, Bitflyer published its plan on July 21. Bitflyer says that customer assets will be protected and a “coin made by each of the two (or more) chains after branching will be given to customers.” Additionally, Bitflyer is taking countermeasures for replay attacks that may occur during blockchain branching. Alongside this, the Japanese exchange will also temporarily stop deposits and withdrawals until the protocol changes are complete.\n\nMany More Exchanges Still Haven’t Told Customers Their Contingency Plans, But Have Issued Statements in the Past\n\nThat sums up the list of exchanges that have issued statements concerning a potential split and suspension of services. There still are many exchanges that have not revealed their plans such as Poloniex, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bithumb, Korbit, and a host of other trading platforms. At the moment people speculate that certain exchanges may be relying on the issued statements many trading platforms made last March or during the Ethereum split.\n\nAre there any exchanges that you’ve heard from that’s not on this list? Let us know about it in the comments below.\n\nFeature Image via Shutterstock.', 'The South African Reserve Bank, which functions as the country’s central bank, is partnering with blockchain-based solutions provider Bankymoon to experiment with digital currency regulations. Bankymoon will serve as a “sandbox business” as the team works with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the ultimate goal of understanding and legitimizing the growing adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\nSupport For Regulation\n\nAs with any new technology that becomes mainstream, regulation becomes an issue. However, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology they are based upon are, by nature, decentralized. Therefore, there is, at some level, a fundamental tension between the government’s need or desire to regulate and the structure of the technology (not to mention the intent of its users).\n\nHowever, government regulation of digital currencies could legitimize the technology. Gamaroff believes that regulations will strengthen and give legitimacy to Bitcoin and other digital currencies for novice users, “I think the regulation will move things along and make people on the street comfortable with Bitcoin. With these new regulations, these everyday people can now trust that Bitcoin is not just for hackers and criminals.”\n\nThe initiative also enjoys the support of some of South Africa’s leaders and biggest businesses. Former First National Bank CEO Michael Jordaan, for example, believes that digital currency is on track to render central banks and the entire traditional banking model obsolete. Only time will tell whether the government can involve itself in a meaningful way with this kind of regulation — or if the technology will simply continue to expand without that type of constraint.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets. Their personal investment perspectives have no impact on editorial content.', 'DEFINITION of \'Hard Fork\'As it relates to blockchain technology, a hard fork (or sometimes hardfork) is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice versa), and as such requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. Put differently, a hard fork is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain, and nodes running previous versions will no longer be accepted by the newest version. This essentially creates a fork in the blockchain, one path which follows the new, upgraded blockchain, and one path which continues along the old path. Generally, after a short period of time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the blockchain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.\n\nSo, what happened, see, was that the Bitcoin developer community achieved consensus on something called BIP 91 - that\'s \'Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91\' to those of you too shy to ask.\n\nThis is what those of us in the Bitcoin community (pulls hoody further over eyes) call a SegWit Activation Kludge. What is a kludge? you ask. Well, it\'s a ""a workaround or quick-and-dirty solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend and hard to maintain"", see?\n\nWhich does make one worry a little. Like it could easily all fall apart, or something?\n\nBut, when the cyber bulls are running, like when the housing market was whistling like a kettle, or when sub-prime loans looked like a really clever way to help poor people, who cares?\n\nCertainly not me. Not today anyway.\n\nMEANWHILE, IN EUROPE ...\n\nAn Austrian called Ewald Nowotny has warned against accepting Bitcoin as an official payment.', 'For any currency to be usable for IoT, there are some non-negotiable requirements:\n\nSupport for transactions, especially small ones\n\nStable store of value\n\nPredictable low latency\n\nSupport for very high volumes of traffic\n\nAt first sight, bitcoin seems like an ideal choice for IoT. But if you look closer, bitcoin and other virtual currencies are deeply problematic.\n\nThere’s lots of information on how bitcoin works out there, but for our purposes it can be summarized as follows:\n\nBitcoin is a ledger of transactions.\n\nSo A decides that B now owns one of his bitcoins.\n\nThe change of ownership is put into a queue.\n\nLots of people working in lots of places take that queue and search for bitcoins.\n\nWhen somebody finds a bitcoin, the change of ownership is baked in using a complicated hash that prevents people from changing older versions of the queue, and the hash it results in is used in the next batch of transactions.\n\nBecause many different people are processing the same queue at the same time, and the process never stops, it’s more or less impossible to make a retroactive change. The ledger is in multiple places and is updated constantly with changes which build on prior modifications.\n\nDownload this free guide Download Now: The Developer’s Guide to IoT The Internet of Things (IoT) world may be exciting, but there are serious technical challenges that need to be addressed, especially by developers.

For a transaction to finish in bitcoin, we need to know that bitcoin (the ledger) has finished processing.\n\nIn IoT, credit card fraud and telecommunications operations, latency is measured in either milliseconds or microseconds. A typical transaction, such as checking someone’s mobile phone credit when connecting a call, will take from 350 microseconds to 3.5 milliseconds in the real world, depending on the circumstances.\n\nNow consider that a transaction is not just a one-way “fire and forget” operation. It is an event whose outcome matters and is not known in advance. If we’re just recording usage, the end result may not matter. If we’re spending some resource, (for example, money), the outcome does matter as we may be told we can’t complete a call due to low minutes, complete a purchase due to low account balance and so on. This is where latency suddenly becomes very important. Until we get a yes or no response, the client’s application can’t do its job.\n\nIn an IoT context, where we’re making decisions at computer speed (milliseconds) not human speed (seconds), poor latency can render a good idea unworkable. As I write this, it takes 31 minutes for a bitcoin transaction to be confirmed, which makes it utterly useless for automated transactions. Bear in mind that if we’re trying to implement some kind of iterative micropayment approach, IoT devices could be spending money every couple of minutes, which means we either deny services until the payment goes through, or we could have a massive queue of transactions in the system and be carrying the risk they will start to fail. There’s also an issue with predictability. The transaction confirmation time can, in practice, be anything due to the way bitcoin works.\n\nThe second major issue is support for the anticipated traffic levels we will see in IoT. A single IoT application could easily generate well over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). In comparison, Visa is capable of handling over 56,000 TPS globally. Bitcoin is limited to 7 TPS. Not 7,000 TPS, 7 TPS. Think about that. Not only is it implausible for real-time transaction processing for an IoT app, it also calls into question if bitcoin’s architecture is even relevant when we’re planning on hundreds of thousands of TPS.\n\nThis brings us to our next issue: small transactions. In April 2013, the developers of bitcoin introduced a limitation on what they referred to as “dust” transactions. Transactions less than $0.007 were no longer accepted. This in turn raises two problems. The first is that some IoT applications might plausibly need transactions that are 7/10 of a cent or less. The second is a broader governance issue. If the people who run the currency can decide to change the minimum transaction size with no notice, what’s to stop them for doing it again?\n\nFinally, we come to stability. Bitcoin has weekly price swings of up to 60%. While it’s been an excellent platform for speculation, who could plausibly price a product or service in it when its value is continuously changing? Bear in mind that a lot of IoT plays will be operating on razor-thin margins that could be wiped out by a currency swing.\n\nWhile it’s clear that IoT will require some form of micropayments architecture, the current state of bitcoin renders it more or less useless as an IoT payment mechanism. What’s equally disturbing is that as a consequence of bitcoin’s lack of central control — despite issues concerning latency and scalability being obvious to anyone who cared to look — no substantive progress has been made in resolving them. We could, at this point, start looking at other digital currencies, but that opens up a further rat’s nest of questions about convertibility and survivability. The internet of things presents enough of a challenge as it is without bringing bitcoin on board.\n\nAll IoT Agenda network contributors are responsible for the content and accuracy of their posts.

07/22/2017,"['Traders and investors are coming back to Bitcoin due to the lock-in of BIP 91 and the high probability of Segregated WItness being activated in the near future.\n\nBitcoin’s dominance over the cryptocurrency market is closing on 50 percent, with the Bitcoin dominance index currently at 48 percent.\n\nA month ago, when the Bitcoin scaling debate was being prolonged and the mining community pushed for the activation of SegWit2x without the BIP 91 activation mechanism, the dominance index of Bitcoin dropped to an all-time low at 37.47 percent.\n\nThe dominance index of Bitcoin dropped from nearly 60 percent to 37.47 percent in a period of a few months due to the certainty in Bitcoin scaling and the reluctance of miners to activate SegWit. As user-activated soft fork (UASF) and SegWit2x asserted pressure toward the mining community to avoid a chain split and scale the Bitcoin network securely and efficiently, the mining community including Bitmain, which previously revealed the possibility of an Aug. 1 hard fork, began to signal for BIP 91 and SegWit.\n\nAlready, BIP 91 is fully locked in and the community anticipating for the signaling of Bit 1, which would then finalize the activation of SegWit. Bitcoin Core developers including Peter Todd stated that there is a 25 percent chance that SegWit will not be activated if miners decide to shift away from the BiP 91 activation mechanism.\n\n“The reason why I think it\'s [failure to activate SegWit] as high a chance as 25 percent is because there\'s a few ways to renegotiation on SegWit with plausible deniability. For instance, miners could ""accidentally"" mine a bunch of BIP-91 invalid blocks - e.g. claiming it was due to validationless spy-mining - and then decide not to reorganize out those blocks,” said Todd.\n\nBut, it is highly likely that SegWit will be activated in the near future, as major mining pools including Antpool, the largest mining pool in the market operated by Bitmain, has started to signal Bit 1 in their blocks.\n\nAs a result, traders and investors that lost confidence in Bitcoin and Bitcoin scaling who likely panic sold during a major market correction earlier this month returned to Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms including Coinbase experienced a drastic increase in users, with Coinbase adding a staggering 100,000 users in three days.\n\nThe activation of SegWit will also lead to the creation of Lightning Network-based Bitcoin micropayments applications. Some Blockchain infrastructure providers and Bitcoin firms including Bitfury have developed Lightning-focused wallet platforms to allow users to transact micropayments with zero confirmations.\n\nHence, the activation of SegWit through BIP 91 will trigger the Bitcoin development community and will lead to the emergence of unique and innovative applications that will likely further scale the Bitcoin network.\n\nAlthough other major Blockchain networks including Ethereum have also recovered from the previous major market correction, Bitcoin has shown a speedy recovery with the activation of SegWit and demonstrated a 11 percent increase in the Bitcoin dominance index.', 'more-in\n\nThe best case scenario for the Bitcoin economy in India at the moment would be the creation of a self-regulatory body rather than burdening regulators like the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), according to Sandeep Goenka, co-founder, Zebpay, India’s largest Bitcoin exchange.\n\n“In the beginning, because there are so many changes happening to the industry and it is very difficult for the government to follow, they can simply allow us to form a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) on the lines of the Mutual Fund Association of India, Internet & Mobile Association of India, or the Payment Council of India,” Mr.Goenka said in an interview.\n\n“SEBI also started as a self-regulating organisation. They themselves created the regulatory structure which after many years became an official regulatory body,” he said.\n\nWhile Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies are currently not regulated in India, the government is considering various options, including banning such currencies, or allowing them to be transacted under the regulation of SEBI.\n\nMr.Goenka said the government should not consider banning Bitcoins as they are increasingly being used as store of value. The Bitcoin trade on Zebpay has risen from ?100 crore per year as of last year to ?200 crore per month this year.\n\nZebpay currently accounts for 70% of the Bitcoin market in India and trade on their exchange shows a rapid increase in the demand for the crypto-currency in India, he said.\n\nHowever, Bitcoins in India are still viewed as investment options rather than as a currency, like it is in countries like South Korea. This brings with it the added complication of how to regulate it—as a currency or as a stock.\n\n“With a lot of these payment technologies it becomes difficult to decide that it is just one thing based on an older existing model,” Mr Goenka said. “It is a complicated decision for the government. But international best practices have been that currently, Bitcoins are being regulated by the central bank. But that will remain a challenge, because many times it works like a stock.”\n\n“That’s the beauty of an SRO, that while the industry is evolving, the government does not take the burden of the responsibility. Instead, the industry does,” he added.\n\nExploding Demand\n\n“We are currently where the internet was in 1994-95, before mass adoption,” he said. “I think it (mass adoption) will happen globally in 3-5 years. It just takes one company like AirBnB or Uber to start accepting Bitcoins globally, and it’ll be like the Paytm moment that happened when Uber partnered with them.”\n\nIn 2010, a Bitcoin was worth only Rs 5, which quickly rose to Rs 30,000-40,000 last year, and now it is at Rs 175,000, according to Mr Goenka.\n\n“It is still affordable, since you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin,” he said. “People are still buying with the anticipation of prices still going up. They are buying it as an investment, but there are no transactions in India since merchants are likely waiting for a critical mass of users and adoption.”\n\nVerification Process\n\nMr Goenka also stressed that the perception that crypto-currencies are predominantly used for illegal purposes is not based on fact, and that the world over, the verification process to trade in Bitcoins was quite stringent.\n\n“Typcially, everybody (in India) has to do a verification process where you submit your PAN card and bank account details,” Mr Goenka said. “It is self-regulation. We want to avoid bad actors and this is a great discouragement where all transactions take place only using banking channels and the PAN is attached to every transaction. We do not all cash or even e-wallets. All the exchanges globally have similar verification processes.”\n\nHe added that the volume of Bitcoin trade globally is about Rs 25,000 crore a day and less than 1% would be used for illegal activities, if that.\n\n“Even with the US dollar or Indian rupee, the bulk of the currency is being used for normal, legal transactions,” Mr Goenka said. “It is only a small fraction that is being used for illegal operations. It’s the same for Bitcoins. For most people in the world, it is used for potential investments.”', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The Bitcoin price surged to $2,915 from $2,100 in just three days. As of this writing, Bitcoin price is hovering at $2800 levels.

Additionally, when Segwit gets activated the wallet will utilize the protocol for further LN functionality.\n\n“All on-chain transactions sent by this wallet are segwit transactions, thus benefitting from a fee discount compared to legacy transactions,” explains Acinq. “Of course, because segwit is fully backward compatible, our wallet can send/receive transactions to/from all bitcoin wallets, even non-segwit ones.”\n\nA Regular On-Chain SPV Wallet and a Lightning Wallet\n\nThe wallet’s user interface records both on-chain and off-chain transactions with different icons highlighted in the transaction log.

There’s no need to reset the app to accept LN channels as the platform will recognize and filter through both types of sending procedures.\n\n“So basically, you are free to use the wallet on-chain only, but if you wish to pay less fee and make instant payments, just open one or more channels, and you’ll be able to pay through Lightning,” the startup details.\n\nTesting Out the Lightning Network at Acinq’s Virtual Coffee Shop ‘Starblocks’\n\nSince Segwit isn’t fully activated yet, Acinq’s Lightning Network wallet is only available using Bitcoin’s testnet. However, the startup has created an LN-enabled coffee shop called Starblocks where testers can open a channel and buy a coffee.\n\n“The purpose of this website is also to demonstrate how easy it is for merchants and businesses to receive funds through Lightning. We intend to provide merchant services in the future, and will be releasing a stripe-like API and a dashboard soon,” Acinq Adds.\n\nWhat do you think about the Lightning Network?

Such is the case with the Bitcoin ABC scaling proposal, which may split the Bitcoin blockchain via a user activated hard fork (UAHF) on August 1. The solution was announced by bitcoin company Bitmain as a contingency plan for the user activated soft fork (UASF) that is scheduled for that day.\n\nIn anticipation of this split, ViaBTC has begun trading Chinese Yuan for their new Bitcoin Cash (BCC) coin. This token will support the new blockchain should the hard fork occur.\n\nBCC opened for trading on July 22, where it managed to reach a high of 5,999 CNY ($886.64). It has since fallen to around 1,923 CNY ($284.17). Such a price slump could indicate that investors are still skeptical over the new coin and Bitcoin’s potential split.\n\nViaBTC Preparing for UAHF\n\nViaBTC announced their intention to support the new blockchain on July 17. Their decision was made following inquiries from miners and users looking to support Bitcoin ABC:\n\nAs a professional cryptocurrency platform who guarantees superior customer service and maximum protection for customer assets, we decide to make precautions for the upcoming UAHF and provide a new option for users, on the basis of our support of SegWit2x under New York Agreement. We will designate the token “Bitcoin Cash” (BCC) to the possible split coin led by the activation of UAHF…\n\nViaBTC is allowing its customers to trade their current Bitcoins for 1 BCC and 1 BTC_FROZEN2. The BTC_FROZEN2 tokens cannot be traded before August 1, but will be redeemable for 1 BTC following the chain split.\n\nA Fork in the Road\n\nWith ViaBTC now supporting BCC, a Bitcoin split now seems almost certain. It remains to be seen whether other mining pools will support the new blockchain following the fork.\n\nSo far, ViaBTC is the only exchange which has announced support for the new token. Coinbase, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, has already announced they will not support the new blockchain:\n\nShould the UAHF activate on August 1, Coinbase will not support the new blockchain or its associated coin. Any BTC within customers’ accounts will remain accessible over the main blockchain only, and will not be converted into BTC on the UAHF chain.\n\nIn the meantime, the main Bitcoin blockchain will retain its BTC ticker and price. Should the new blockchain gain the majority hashpower in the coming months, however, BCC may overtake BTC as the dominant Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHow do you feel about a Bitcoin split? Which blockchain will you support?

One particular subject that came up on the BTC1 repository was the idea to incentivize the development community with time-locked bitcoins to smoothly activate a hard fork.\n\nAlso read: The Bitcoin Scaling Countdown: Miners Begin Running Segwit2x Software\n\nTime-locked Incentive for a Bitcoin Hard Fork\n\nThe hard fork has gotten a bad name over time mostly because of the contentious fork that took place with the Ethereum network. Hard forks aren’t forward-compatible, which means that the entire ecosystem of miners, wallet providers, exchanges, and merchants need to upgrade to the new code. The Segwit2x plan aims to activate Segregated Witness (Segwit) and follow up with a hard fork a few months down the line.\n\nThis week Oleg Andreev, product architect of the blockchain network company Chain introduced Issue #72 to the Github repo called “Time-locked incentive for Bitcoin hard fork.” The scheme Andreev says is to incentivize the community with coins that cannot be spent for a period of time until after the completion of a successful hardfork. The idea comes at a time when Segwit2x offers a compromise of both Segwit and a 2MB hard fork, but the problem is some people think the second part of the agreement won’t be fulfilled.\n\n“It is well-known that cryptocurrency development can be incentivized by long-term time-locked coins,” explains Andreev. “Meaning, that the coins cannot be spent in the peak of a bubble, or right before a disaster that was not prevented or worked around. For instance, Greg Maxwell claims that Blockstream uses such scheme.”\n\nWhat Are Time-locked Bitcoins?\n\nTime-locked bitcoins cannot be spent until a specified time or block height by using a distributed contract recorded on the blockchain. Over the years there have been added improvements to this type of time-locking infrastructure with code development like Check-Lock-Time-Verify, Relative locktime, and Check-Sequence-Verify. Bitcoin luminary and author Andreas Antonopoulos discusses the subject of time-locked bitcoins in his book “Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain.” Moreover, in 2016 Thomas McCabe gave instructions on how he successfully spent a time-locked bitcoin transaction.\n\n“Bitcoin’s scripting language is very powerful, but access to resources with regards to learning how to build a script is scarce,” details McCabe.\n\n‘Measuring the Amount of “Skin in the Game” to Gauge Responsibility’\n\nChain engineer Andreev believes this technology could smooth the process of completing a successful hard fork.\n\n“Considering that any hard fork by definition carries an increased systemic risk: from producing chain splits inadvertently (due to overlooked software incompatibility), to splitting the market and shattering the faith in the technology and perspectives of our social experiment.”\n\nIt makes sense to introduce a special kind of time-locked incentives that get unlocked only on a hard-forked chain. Such incentives allow community to measure the amount of “skin in the game” to gauge the responsibility of the people behind a hard fork proposal.\n\nForward Compatibility\n\nAndreev gives specifications to his idea, and a few other developers including Jeff Garzik thought the concept was interesting. Additionally, Andreev’s proposal offers forward compatibility and “the code is expected to be modified to preserve the spirit of the proposal for the future hard forks,” explains the developer. Adding an incentive to smoothly activate a fork or fund bitcoin development, in general, is a unique concept but it’s likely this plan won’t be included in the Segwit2x working group’s current roadmap. There are multiple comments and suggestions made by developers that won’t make the final cut including funny ones like finding the Mt Gox missing bitcoins.\n\nWhat do you think about incentivizing hard forks with time locked bitcoins?

A Singapore-based startup says the answer is its Visa card.\n\nTenX is pitching its debit card as an instant converter of multiple digital currencies into fiat money: the dollars, yen and euros that power most everyday commerce. The company said it takes a 2 percent cut from each transaction and has received orders for more than 10,000 cards. While transactions are capped at $2,000 a year, users can apply to increase the limit if they undergo identify verification procedures.\n\nTenX debit card. Source: TenX via Bloomberg\n\nTenx’s bid to make digital currencies easier to spend comes amid massive volatility and infighting within the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin, the most popular, slumped after reaching a record in June amid concerns about a split in two, only to recover as fears faded. The company has built an app that serves as a digital wallet connected to the Visa card so that when it’s swiped at a cafe or restaurant, the merchant is paid in local currency and the users’ crypto account is debited.\n\nJulian Hosp. Source: TenX via Bloomberg\n\n“You’re mixing two worlds that are night and day,” co-founder Julian Hosp said in an interview. “When the user spends the cryptocurrency, we have to instantly switch these currencies to fiat and pay to Visa straight away. It’s a lot of pathways.""\n\nHosp said transactions are processed immediately and it doesn’t impose any charges on top of the conversion fee that is set by cryptocurrency exchanges, which typically is 0.15 to 0.2 percent. The card now supports eight digital currencies, including the lesser-known dash and augur, and aims to offer about 11 of them by the end of the year.\n\nTenX currently processes about $100,000 of transactions a month. By the end of 2018, it’s targeting $100 million in monthly transactions and a million users.\n\nTenX has an advantage in moving early, but the startup can expect competition in the future from major financial institutions and venture capitalists with deeper pockets and direct access to clients and databases, said Mati Greenspan, a Tel Aviv, Israel-based analyst at social trading platform eToro.\n\n“It’s an incredible concept,” said Greenspan. “At the end of the day, it’s going to depend a lot on customer relations. Are they meeting the customers’ expectations? Can somebody else do it better?”\n\nTenX’s efforts to make digital currencies spendable come as it joined the many blockchain-based startups taking advantage of initial coin offerings. ICOs are a cross between crowdfunding and an initial public offering that firms use to raise funds by issuing digital tokens rather than stock.\n\nIn its token sale last month, TenX raised $80 million with about half to be used to expand operations while the rest will provide liquidity for a cryptocurrency exchange in the works, said Hosp.\n\nThe company had previously raised $120,000 from angel investors and $1 million in a seed round led by venture capital firm Fenbushi Capital, which lists Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, as a general partner. TenX isn’t expecting to become profitable in the next two years as it focuses on expanding services.\n\n“One thing we want to offer in the end, is that you can switch cryptocurrencies within the app,” said Hosp. “If we do this, we can become the market maker, which can bring in a lot of revenue.”', ""What Is Bitcoin United and Should You Trust It?\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin United and Should You Trust It?\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

They themselves created the regulatory structure, which after many years became an official regulatory body,” he said. While Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are currently not regulated in India, the government is considering various options, including banning such currencies, or allowing them to be transacted under the regulation of SEBI.\n\nMr. Goenka said the government should not consider banning Bitcoin as they are increasingly being used as store of value. Bitcoin trade on Zebpay has risen from Rs. 100 crore per year as of last year to Rs. 200 crore per month this year.\n\nZebpay currently accounts for 70% of the Bitcoin market in India and trade on the exchange shows a rapid increase in the demand for the crypto-currency in India, he said.\n\nHowever, aBitcoin in India is still viewed as investment option rather than as a currency, like it is in countries like South Korea.\n\n“With a lot of these payment technologies, it becomes difficult to decide that it is just one thing based on an older existing model,” Mr. Goenka said.\n\n“It is a complicated decision for the government. But international best practices have been that currently, Bitcoins are being regulated by the central bank. But that will remain a challenge, because many times it works like a stock.”\n\n“That’s the beauty of an SRO, that while the industry is evolving, the government does not take the burden of the responsibility. Instead, the industry does,” he added.\n\nExploding demand\n\n“We are currently where the Internet was in 1994-95, before mass adoption,” he said. “I think it (mass adoption) will happen globally in 3-5 years. It just takes one company like AirBnB or Uber to start accepting Bitcoins globally, and it’ll be like the Paytm moment that happened when Uber partnered with them.” In 2010, a Bitcoin was worth only Rs. 5 which quickly rose to Rs. 30,000-Rs. 40,000 last year and now it is at Rs. 1,75,000, according to Mr. Goenka.\n\n“It is still affordable, since you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin,” he said. “People are still buying with the anticipation of prices still going up. They are buying it as an investment but there are no transactions in India since merchants are likely waiting for a critical mass of users and adoption.”\n\nVerification process\n\nMr. Goenka said the perception that crypto-currencies are predominantly used for illegal purposes is not based on facts and world over, the verification process to trade in Bitcoins was quite stringent.\n\n“Typcially, everybody (in India) has to do a verification process where you submit your PAN card and bank account details,” he said. “It is self-regulation. We want to avoid bad actors and this is a great discouragement where all transactions take place only using banking channels and the PAN is attached to every transaction. All the exchanges globally have similar verification processes.”\n\nHe said the volume of Bitcoin trade globally is about Rs. 25,000 crore a day and less than 1% would be used for illegal activities.\n\n“Even with the U.S. dollar or Indian rupee, the bulk of the currency is being used for normal, legal transactions,” Mr. Goenka said.\n\n“It is only a small fraction that is being used for illegal operations. It’s the same for Bitcoins. For most people in the world, it is used for potential investments.”', 'It seems as if Coinbase, the world’s largest Bitcoin wallet and trading platform, is not ready to integrate Ethereum Classic just yet.\n\nEarlier this week, various analysts and Ethereum Classic enthusiasts suggested the possibility of Coinbase integrating Ethereum Classic in the near future after a community member discovered an API link to Ethereum Classic on the Coinbase platform. These included Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, a Bitcoin and Blockchain-focused investment firm that has invested in some of the most successful startups in the Bitcoin industry.\n\nHowever, almost immediately after Silbert shared the API link of Ethereum Classic on the Coinbase platform in online communities and social media, the Coinbase development team clarified that the API link is simply a relic from the previous Ethereum Classic payout. Coinbase said:\n\n“We have no plans to support ETC at this stage. This API call is a relic of the ETC withdrawals.”\n\nWhy did Coinbase have an API link to Ethereum Classic?\n\nOn July 20, the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum development team executed a hard fork in order to recover funds lost in the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), one of the first smart contract and Ethereum-based decentralized applications to raise funds in an initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nAt the time, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote:\n\n“The recovery contract is already returning DAO token holders’ Ether; about 4.5 mln ETH has been sent to DAO token holders, and about 463,000 ETH is in the control of the curator; a contract to facilitate extra balance payments is currently undergoing security review. We thank our developers and the community for working together to make the transition as smooth as it has been, and look forward to working together to continue to make the Ethereum ecosystem and protocol a success.”\n\nSome investors, businesses and users of the Ethereum network did not agree with the approach of the Ethereum Foundation and development community in regard to the bailout of investors from the DAO, as the loss of funds from the DAO resulted due to certain vulnerabilities of the DAO software. Hence, the development team of the DAO and its investors should have been held responsible for the loss.\n\nBarry Silbert along with other experts supported the newly created or forked Ethereum Classic, a new Blockchain project that aimed to continue the core principles of the original Ethereum project. At the moment, Chinese sources state that the majority of the Chinese cryptocurrency community considers Ethereum Classic as the original Ethereum Blockchain network.\n\nSo, will Coinbase support Ethereum Classic?\n\nAfter the launch of the Ethereum Classic Investment Trust, an investment vehicle that allowed investors in the public market to invest in Ethereum Classic, the cryptocurrency has continued its upward momentum.\n\nEthereum Classic remains the sixth largest cryptocurrency in the market, with a $1.5 bln market cap. Although Coinbase representatives stated that they cannot provide any more information in regard to the cryptocurrencies the platform intends to support, analysts and experts have been encouraging Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, to consider integrating Ethereum Classic.', 'There are a number of advantages built into a blockchain voting system. Arguably the greatest strength of a blockchain voting system is that people can vote from their mobile phones. The government could issue voting tokens to citizens through a unique mobile wallet address connected to voter registration information, and voters could send the tokens to their preferred candidates.\n\nBlockchain ledgers are transparent to all of the participants in the network. Anyone can see Bitcoin’s blockchain; the entire record of transactions is publicly available. This gives users faith in the integrity of the network because it can be audited and verified in real time by the entire network of users. With a blockchain voting system, we could see the record of votes as they happen in real time with almost instant verification.\n\nDistributed ledgers like blockchains are not stored on any one particular server, but distributed among nodes in a network. The strength of distributed systems like blockchains is that a local failure of any node in the network cannot crash the whole system because the other nodes in the network still update and maintain the blockchain. This feature also means it is very difficult to alter a blockchain entry once it has been recorded without a massive amount of computing power or a shutdown of the entire network. This makes such a system less vulnerable to hackers.', 'With a year-to-date growth of almost 4,000%, at the close of the second quarter of 2017, it was Ripple that was the star of the cryptocurrency world.\n\nThe growth of Ripple, and its token, XRP, has been phenomenal in a market that is used to seeing astronomical growth. The XRP token closed out the second financial quarter of 2017 on June 30th priced at $0.26 USD. That is a 1,159% increase for the quarter alone and an impressive 3,977% increase for the year to date.\n\nTime to Give Ripple the Respect It Deserves\n\nWhile the major players in the digital currency marketplace have always been Bitcoin, and Ethereum more recently, Ripple comes in at a respectable third on the market capitalization. At publishing, Ripple had about a third of the market cap as Ethereum, which is still hugely impressive taking into account the low price of the XRP token.\n\nFurthermore, in the last quarter, it has not only seen huge growth in its value but also in its popularity as it is now listed on 30 exchanges, 25 of those accepting XRP in the last two months.\n\nWhat Makes Ripple Different?\n\nWhile growth is common place for digital currencies in the current climate, Ripple’s growth is slightly different as XRP is owned largely by Ripple, unlike Bitcoin and Ether. In May, an announcement was made as to how the sculpture of the sale of the currency would go and that is believed to be a strong driving force in its growth.\n\nAccording to Miguel Vias, Ripple’s head of XRP markets, it is the fact that XRP has a clear reason for its existence, a clear use, that it is thriving.\n\nVias explained:\n\nWith respect to XRP, we are incredibly focused on international payments, I think we are probably the only digital asset that has a clear use case with respect to what we are trying to do with the asset.\n\nAs for the future, Vias hinted in an interview with CNBC that new announcements may be forthcoming:\n\nWith respect to growth and outreach, we will continue to partner with digital asset exchanges for listings and most importantly … it is really all about payments and in this quarter, you will see some very interesting developments with respect to our partnership in payments, with respect to XRP in particular.\n\nRipple’s Exponential Growth\n\nAt the start of the year, XRP came in at $0.0065, but by the time the second quarter started, just before the end of March, the price started to spike hitting a high of $0.35 on May 18. There was a drop as the quarter closed, to $0.26, but that still saw it land just short of that 4,000 percent growth mark.\n\nThere has been a further drop which sees Ripple now at $0.19, but Vias still believes there is a lot of reasons to be optimistic about XRP, and digital currency in general:\n\nWhat we have seen is an embracing of digital assets broadly by really established institutions. When you have folks like the Bank of England, which did a proof of concept with us, as well as the Bank of Japan coming out and saying, we are considering this as legal tender at some point — when you see those developments, you can’t help but feel that we are on the right path, that interest is going to continue to grow.\n\nIs Ripple the next big digital currency?

With the approval, LedgerX is set to become the first federally regulated digital currency options exchange and clearinghouse in the U.S. as interest and volatility in the method of exchange surges.\n\n“It’s an important milestone for the digital currency market broadly,” said Paul Chou, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader, who is LedgerX’s chief executive. “This will pave the way for others globally to look at the space and the appropriate way to regulate a new market like this.”\n\nThe New York-based company plans to offer one to six month bitcoin-to-dollars options contracts in late September to early October, Chou said in a telephone interview. Contracts for other digital currencies including for Ethereum’s ether are expected to follow, as well as longer-term protection.\n\nThe CFTC had granted LedgerX authorization to trade digital currencies earlier this month.

Bitcoin had been under pressure as feuding factions disagreed on how to help the digital asset scale, until prices rebounded last week on signs an agreement is near.\n\nChou said the ability to hedge digital assets will attract institutional investors who had been on the sidelines.\n\n“We’re getting people that want to hedge and people that want exposure to a new asset class that they can add to their portfolio and help diversify, and get potential upside of potential digital currency,” Chou said. “We want to keep it to a certain size in the beginning before we scale up over the next couple of months.”\n\n— With assistance by Benjamin Bain"", 'Bitcoin has become so successful that the way it operates needs upgrading, and fast. Trouble is, there are opposing views on how to do that and no all-powerful administrative body to determine which method to adopt. After all, part of bitcoin’s allure is its lack of central oversight. The arguments between the different camps transcend the purely technical to encompass philosophy and politics, raising the prospect of the cryptocurrency splitting into two or more versions. That scenario came close to reality in July before a compromise was reached. Another serious test awaits in November but in the meantime there’s been an unexpected development: a minor split.\n\n1. What’s the problem with bitcoin?\n\n\n\nIt was built with security more in mind than the kind of volume its success has brought. To prevent counterfeiting, bitcoin transactions are verified by so-called bitcoin miners in batches called blocks. The blocks are then strung together to form the decentralized open ledger known as the blockchain that’s one of the currency’s biggest selling points. Worries about cyberattacks led the system’s designers to cap the size of blocks at 1 megabyte. But as bitcoin grew in popularity over the past nine years, transaction times and processing fees soared to record levels.\n\n2. How big is the issue?\n\nThe average time to confirm a bitcoin deal ballooned to six hours at one point this year from under 20 minutes, according to blockchain.info. The backlog of transactions rose to a record, pushing up fees as bitcoin holders offered miners increasing amounts to deal with their transactions sooner. In recent weeks, the congestion (and fees) have lightened significantly as some users have steered clear of the traffic jam.\n\n3. Who are the opposing sides?\n\nAs bitcoin is open-source software, anyone can tweak it as they see fit. That’s allowed various factions to propose different solutions, with most opinions falling in two main schools of thought. First are the bitcoin miners, the thousands of individuals who form a vital part of the blockchain process by deploying their expensive, powerful computers to verify transactions. They support increasing the number of bitcoin transactions in each block. Second are the so-called Core developers who have been instrumental in constructing bitcoin’s bug-proof system. Their proposal: Allow some data to be moved outside the main network, in effect creating multiple ledgers called sidechains. If the two camps follow their own proposals and reject a compromise, two versions of bitcoin’s blockchain would probably come into existence -- effectively splitting the cryptocurrency.\n\n4. But that wouldn’t be the first split?\n\nCorrect. In late July, a small group of miners -- in a move unrelated to the main debate -- began backing an offshoot with block sizes of 8 megabytes. It’s called Bitcoin Cash. On Aug. 1, they successfully deployed their version of bitcoin’s software, triggering the split. The price of bitcoin hardly moved, perhaps because Bitcoin Cash has little support from miners. Even so, its market value soared to $7.3 billion the next day, one-sixth of bitcoin’s.\n\n5. Why is Bitcoin not out of the woods?\n\nIn July, the broader community compromised with a proposal called SegWit2x -- a combination of the Core developers’ suggestion (called SegWit, for Segregated Witness) and the miners’ proposal. The first step of SegWit2x has been locked in and bitcoin’s network will probably adopt SegWit technology at some point in August. Then, in November, bitcoin will face its next big challenge when some of the world’s biggest miners move to adopt phase two, the doubling of the size of the block. That could lead to bitter disagreements. Opponents among the developers argue that increasing block sizes will leave too much power in too few hands, since the technology required will get more expensive. Miners fear that moving some of bitcoin’s workings off the main network will diminish their importance.\n\n6. Would such a split be more dramatic?\n\nIndeed. Greater volatility would probably ensue as more members of the community are likely to take part in casting a vote for one currency or another. One side effect of the relatively peaceful split by Bitcoin Cash: Others may be encouraged to create more versions of bitcoin, splintering it further.\n\n7. What’s been keeping the bitcoin community together?\n\nMiners and Core developers need each other to function, survive -- and prosper. Research analyst Ronnie Moas sees bitcoin’s scarcity and acceptance by investors doubling its value to $5,000 by next year, then surging to as much as $50,000 in the next decade. Miners are paid in new bitcoin. Then there’s the nine years of blood, sweat and tears, not to mention investment, that’s made bitcoin the world’s preeminent cryptocurrency. So far it’s been enough to counter the competing ideologies of what bitcoin should be.\n\n8. What are those different ideologies?\n\nCreated in 2009 by a person or a group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin initially attracted an array of figures including libertarians who wished to counter the control of sovereign regulators and central banks. One attraction is that, in contrast to limitless printed currencies, there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins. And as bitcoin’s market value has surged to $45 billion, the debate has intensified over whether it should embrace more mainstream capitalism or fortify its position as a libertarian beacon. More practically, the debate has revolved around whether bitcoin should become like gold and other assets that store value or develop as a payment system and platform for economic activity.\n\nThe Reference Shelf', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""Accepting crypto-currencies broadens my client base,"" says Eleesa Dadiani\n\nWhy is the art world getting excited about digital currency Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain?\n\nEleesa Dadiani owns and runs an art gallery in London\'s famous Cork Street. She was born in Georgia in the Caucasus and was ""breastfed by gypsies"".\n\nBut she is also a passionate believer in the power of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nWhen we meet she is busy preparing for an exhibition of sculptures made from the exhausts of former Formula 1 racing cars.\n\nOne of these strange rib-cage-like creations made from the super-strong alloy inconel has been gold-plated and will sell for about £35,000.\n\n""These are pieces of history,"" she tells me.\n\nIn a first for the tradition-bound art world of Cork Street, her international clientele will have the opportunity to pay using Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency underpinned by blockchain technology.\n\nThe gallery will also accept other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Litecoin, and soon, Monero, she says.\n\nWhy?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The number of retailers that accept Bitcoin is rising, but it is still relatively small\n\n""This is not a demand-driven decision at all, it\'s intuitive based on the way things are going,"" she says.\n\nShe believes paying by cryptocurrency will become as normal as paying by cash or credit card. She also hopes it will attract a new, non-traditional type of art investor.\n\nBlockchain, the underlying technology, is a digital ledger or record of transactions that is distributed across, and verified by, thousands of computers in a network.\n\nOnce the network has reached a consensus that a transaction has happened, the ledger is updated and cannot be tampered with.\n\n""Blockchain is a borderless, open source, decentralised peer-to-peer network that governments cannot shut down,"" she says. ""For me, the blockchain is going to be the biggest thing since the internet.""\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAnd the fact that there is no centralised body - like a bank head office, for example - makes cryptocurrencies safer, she argues, despite their reputation for being volatile, high-risk and the favourite ""store of value"" for criminals and hackers.\n\nBitcoin payments can be anonymous and potentially beyond the grasp of tax authorities, but this isn\'t the reason she\'s offering payment by cryptocurrency, she assures me.\n\nSo how easy is it to accept a Bitcoin payment?\n\n""It\'s really very simple,"" she explains. ""I give the client my public key [a long string of letters and numbers] and they use that to send bitcoin to my account from their digital wallet or bitcoin exchange,"" she says.\n\n""My wallet is linked to my personal bank so I can then convert those bitcoins into pounds, euros or dollars.""\n\nMs Dadiani is such a fan of cryptocurrencies - she trades in them as well - that she is launching her own version, Dadicoin, later this year.\n\nImage copyright Igor Miske Image caption Have you ever fancied owning an Old Master painting? Now you can, or a share of one at least...\n\nThe $60bn art world in general is warming to the potential of cryptocurrencies, partly because of blockchain\'s dual ability to establish the provenance of works of art and thereby reduce the reliance on brokers and other middlemen.\n\nMarcelo Garcia Casil, for example, is chief executive and co-founder of Maecenas, an online marketplace that will enable art owners to sell shares in their expensive works of art (worth more than $1m) and raise money far more cheaply than they could though a bank.\n\nAnd the owners also get to keep possession of their artworks while sharing up to 49% of the ownership.\n\nInvestors, who ordinarily wouldn\'t be able to afford multi-million-dollar works of art, will be able buy shares or units in the work using cryptocurrency. They will then be able to sell these units later in the marketplace. Each transaction is recorded cryptographically on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n""We want to make fine art accessible for everyone,"" says Mr Casil, who was born in Argentina, now lives in Singapore, and has a background in investment banking.\n\n""The old auction houses like Christie\'s and Sotheby\'s have controlled the art market for centuries, so we think the opportunity for disruption is huge.""\n\nEstablishing the authenticity of works of art is critical to their value, and this will still need to be done by skilled professionals, admits Mr Casil.\n\n""But once the provenance has been recorded in the blockchain, you never have to do it again,"" he says. This takes a lot of cost out of the system.\n\nImage copyright Maecenas Image caption The Maecenas marketplace will give investors a chance to buy shares in fine art\n\nMaecenas has already attracted works of art worth $100m (£77m; 86m euros) in total, says Mr Casil, and the marketplace is due for launch in September.\n\nThe art world has been flirting with Bitcoin for a few years now, despite the likes of auction house Sotheby\'s saying they have no plans to accept the currency.\n\nIn April 2015, the Austrian Museum of Applied Art/Contemporary Art (MAK) was the first museum in the world to buy a work of art using Bitcoin.\n\nDutch artist Harm van den Dorpel created a limited-edition screensaver that was cryptographically authenticated through blockchain.\n\nAnd online gallery Cointemporary exhibits digital artworks by international contemporary artists that can only be bought with Bitcoin.

Here are more details:\n\nTenX is pitching its debit card as an instant converter of multiple digital currencies into fiat money: the dollars, yen and euros that power most everyday commerce. The company said it takes a 2% cut from each transaction and has received orders for more than 10,000 cards. While transactions are capped at $2,000 a year, users can apply to increase the limit if they undergo identify verification procedures.\n\nTenX, however, is hardly the first company with ambitions to increase bitcoin’s footprint in the marketplace by piggy-backing on existing card networks. In 2014, the bitcoin storage company Xapo announced a Mastercard tied to digital currency wallets, but the credit card giant immediately disavowed the partnership. Since then, Xapo has created a bitcoin-backed debit card that works with Visa.\n\nMeanwhile, the San Francisco-based digital currency exchange, Coinbase, launched the Shift Card, which lets users pay with bitcoin using the Visa network. From a merchant’s perspective, however, the transaction is no different from a regular Visa transaction since all of the bitcoin-related elements occur behind the scenes.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nUnsurprising, none of these cards appears to have caught on beyond a handful of hyper-niche users. The primary reason is likely that there is no real advantage to using them: Why go to the trouble of acquiring a card and funding it with bitcoin when you can just use a credit or debit card instead? And while it could provide a way to pay for those without bank accounts, such people already have an alternative—it’s called cash.\n\nFor ordinary consumers, a bitcoin-Visa card has an obvious drawback in that it doesn’t offer rewards points like any regular Visa card worth its salt will do. And for merchants, the “2% cut” TenX plans to take is no better than what they must pay out already.\n\nAs for the credit card companies, they are lukewarm at best. They may allow bitcoin companies access to their networks to process payments, but would no doubt them off if digital currency comes to present any sort of threat. Visa, which not reply to a request for comment about the TenX launch, is also conspicuously absent from any bitcoin-related marketing efforts.\n\nThe bottom line is TenX, like other firms, might carve out a tiny niche with hardcore bitcoin enthusiasts. But as for these cards “taking Bitcoin into the real world” and making them mainstream, there’s as much chance of that as bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto becoming head of the Federal Reserve.', 'Less than a week ago BIP91 became locked-in and we all cheered. The risk of a major split in our beloved Bitcoin had passed. We could all get back to sipping our fine wine and HODLing like crazy. End of story.\n\nExcept it isn’t the end of the story. August 1 could still happen (As a Bitcoin-relevant event, that is. As a date it almost certainly will happen), and the Bitcoin blockchain could still be split by a User Activated Hard Fork (UAHF).\n\nAs Bitcoinist reported on Saturday, some exchanges have already started trading a new token, Bitcoin Cash, in anticipation of this.\n\nWhat the Fork?\n\nBIP91 was proposed in May 2017, as the solution to the block-size scaling debate, supported by a significant majority of the Bitcoin industry, in the New York Agreement. It required a minimum of 80% hash-power support to avoid the User Activated Soft Fork (UASF/BIP148) planned by the Bitcoin Core developers for August 1, 2017.\n\nYes, support hit 80% and we locked-in to BIP91, but that was never by any means guaranteed. So back in April, Bitmain devised the UAHF as a contingency plan, in case the UASF was implemented and looked to pose an imminent risk to the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nSo We Don’t Need It Now?\n\nNo, we don’t need it, but a developer group advocating a larger block size proposed Bitcoin ABC at the Future of Bitcoin conference. This is essentially a development of the UAHF, although no longer controlled or endorsed by Bitmain.\n\nThis may, however, still be implemented on August 1, causing a split in the blockchain and creating the new token. This is currently dubbed as Bitcoin Cash (BCC), with the existing blockchain (confusingly also called Bitcoin Core) retaining the Bitcoin branding and BTC acronym… for now.\n\nSo What Will I Have in My Wallet?\n\nIn your wallet, you’ll still have Bitcoin Core, but you will also be the owner of the same amount of Bitcoin Cash. At the point of the split both blockchains will be identical, so your private keys will access the same balance on the new blockchain too.\n\nYou will have to download a BCC client to make transactions in the new token, as your current wallet probably won’t support it. Your current exchange probably won’t support it either, but lists of both exchanges and wallets supporting BCC is published on the website.\n\nDouble Money! What’s the Problem?\n\nIt isn’t double money, it’s the same amount of two different tokens. The value of each can vary widely. Having said that, there shouldn’t really be a problem.\n\nThere is the possibility that investors will see the split as a sign of instability, which could harm the price of both currencies. But most parties seem to favor one token and think the other will just carry on as a minor altcoin.\n\nCoinbase has stated that they will not be listing BCC for trade or allowing withdrawals of the currency. This has led to cries of theft from some users, and the movement of funds by other (more savvy) users.\n\nBitmain has stated their support for Segwit2x, but don’t rule out the possibility of supporting both coins in the future, depending on how BCC fares.\n\nChandler Guo tweeted this very erudite message.\n\nSo it seems like most folks are backing BTC, myself included. But if you’re going to get some BCC for doing nothing then why not? Just shift your BTC out of Coinbase before August 1!\n\nDo you think a UAHF will happen on August 1? Are you stockpiling Bitcoin in anticipation of a possible split and chance for free BCC?

These exchanges are members of the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA). Merchant services were also suspended, causing Japanese retailers to halt taking bitcoin payments during that time.\n\nAlso read: Thousands of Japanese Stores May Suspend Bitcoin Payments on August 1\n\nThe July 23 Suspension Lifted\n\nThirteen Japanese bitcoin exchange, members of the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA), halted their bitcoin services on July 23, after BIP91 was locked in three days prior. All exchange members followed through with the suspension of bitcoin deposits and withdrawals as well as any payment services they offer.\n\nOn Monday, the JCBA issued a statement canceling the precautionary suspension. Stating that 24 hours have passed since the suspension began, the association wrote “so far concerns of the occurrence of a split that interferes with the operation of the blockchain was not recognized,” adding that:\n\nAs for the stop measures for accepting and withdrawing bitcoins, we decided to cancel the suspension based on the judgment of each member at this time, and already some members have resumed bitcoin deposits and withdrawals.\n\nSome exchanges were planning to halt bitcoin service longer. Bitpoint, for example, suspended bitcoin services at 13:45 Japan time on July 23. The exchange originally planned to resume its bitcoin services at 16:00 on July 25, but will now resume on July 24 at 16:00.\n\nMerchants Temporarily Halted Accepting Bitcoins\n\nAlong with their bitcoin merchant service providers, Japanese retailers and restaurants that accept bitcoin payments also stopped accepting the cryptocurrency during that time. NHK reported on the 23rd that along with bitcoin exchanges, “at restaurants and other places where payments can be made with bitcoins, the service cannot be used at this time.”\n\nAmong them is Numazuko Ginza sushi restaurant in Tokyo, which had to notify customers visiting the restaurant that the bitcoin payment option was not available after Coincheck suspended its merchant services, the publication detailed. Restaurant manager Ken Nagahama has seen a rise in customers wanting to pay with the digital currency over the past few months. He said “I think that this is a useless measure for improving Bitcoin, and I hope that stability will continue,” the news outlet quoted him saying.\n\nAugust 1 Suspension Still On Schedule\n\nThe JCBA and its bitcoin exchange members will still suspend bitcoin services on August 1. They have also been preparing for how to deal with the new cryptocurrency, to be called “Bitcon Cash” which is expected to result from the planned hard fork on that date. The association reiterated in Monday’s announcement:\n\nSince there is a possibility of a split by hard fork on August 1st, each member will take measures such as establishing a suspension period again in order to deal with it.\n\nDo you think bitcoin exchanges and merchants should suspend bitcoin services on August 1? Let us know in the comments section below.\n\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock and News4europe', 'The operators of a regulated, Jersey-based bitcoin fund have officially closed a new $5 million fund aimed at investing in cryptocurrency tokens and initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nBacked by fund manager and former JP Morgan trader Daniel Masters, the offering by Global Advisors is the latest in a string of funds aimed at offering accredited investors exposure to the burgeoning crypto asset class. However, it may be unique in that those who committed investment funds did so in ether, the native cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to CoinDesk, chairman Daniel Masters stressed this detail as the fund\'s defining attribute.\n\nMasters said:\n\n""I\'m sure this was the first fund in the history of finance where everyone who subscribed to the fund did so via ethereum.""\n\nIn statements, Masters added that key selling points for the fund would be its ""discretion and caution"" at a time of ample innovation.\n\nAs such, the fund is structured to offer managed exposure to the emerging space, allowing investors to participate ""cautiously and intelligently.""\n\nICO prologue\n\nElsewhere in conversation, Masters gave an additional assessment of the ICO investment landscape.\n\nIn his view, the ecosystem began diversifying in May 2017, spurred by the publicity for major ransomware attacks, which he cited as driving demand for cryptocurrency payments to the point of a breakout rally.\n\n""Bitcoin was underperforming but was being pulled higher as the whole cryptocurrency complex exploded upward,"" Masters said.\n\nDuring this time period, bitcoin saw its percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap collapse, falling from above 90% to below 50% as investors sought exposure in less established areas of the market.\n\nIn particular, Masters said interest was driven to ethereum.\n\n""In a nutshell, we concluded that ethereum, and the ERC-20 tokens it spawned, were a really significant innovation in digital assets,"" he said, adding:\n\n""What we saw was a very rapid increase in the number and the size of these so called initial coin offerings. The ICO has taken a number of forms. Some of them are legitimate and some of them are misconstructed. It\'s very much a caveat emptor space.""\n\nWhat makes a good ICO\n\nFrom there, Masters formulated what makes for a strong ICO. (Already, his firm has directly invested in a token sale for Aventus.)\n\nFirst, it calls for a team of experienced, motivated and technically savvy founders. Second, the ICO must solve a real-world problem in a way that cannot be done without the use of blockchain technology. Third, the solution should have a strong enough network effect so that its code can\'t be easily copied into a possible competitor.\n\nIf you have those three elements in place, according to Masters, issuing an ethereum-based token may make sense.\n\n""We\'ve seen debt coins, equity coins and rail coins, which purports to transfer another coin across the ecosystem. I don\'t think any of those spaces are promising. What I do think are promising are new protocol coins,"" he explained.\n\nAccording to Masters, token offerings and ICOs offer powerful economic incentives to entrepreneurs who are able to effectively exploit the technology.\n\n""It enables small- to medium-sized technology companies to leapfrog years of efforts in the management of their capital structure. You can go from a friends and family round to an angel round to Series A, to Series B, and even arguably Series C in one go,"" he said.\n\nFrom the perspective of the investor, Masters said, the lure of ICOs can also prove quite powerful. ""You probably have liquidity within one week of your investment,"" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, the risks to individual investors who jump into the ICO space by themselves can also be quite significant, he said, framing this as a value-add for the fund.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""The disadvantages are quite clear. Nobody is looking after you. You\'re on your lonesome in this one.""\n\nDaniel Masters image via Vimeo\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, it is the spike in growth that is worth noting as the numbers coming out of the small nation are indicative of Bitcoin spreading outside the African powerhouses and into the more rural nations.\n\nIn total, Tanzanians moved around 14 BTC in the second week of July, which is almost a 33 percent increase from the week prior.', 'I’ve been closely following the Bitcoin craze for many months now, ever since demonetisation sent Bitcoin prices rocketing in India.\n\nBeing part of numerous shady cryptocurrency groups finally paid off when someone posted about an Indian website that allows for booking domestic flight tickets using Bitcoins.\n\nFor those not in the know, Bitcoin is digital money used for secure and instant transfer of value anywhere in the world. It’s the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is not controlled or issued by any bank or government — rather its value is determined by buying and selling in the open market, similar to stocks or property. A bitcoin’s price changes in real time based on the number of people who want to buy or sell it at a given moment.\n\nIt was worth roughly $13 in early 2013 and went up to $260 in early 2015 before skyrocketing to a record-high of $3000 in June this year. It is currently hovering around the $2600 mark.\n\nIndia accounted for almost 11% of global cryptocurrency trade in the past month, according to data from a Bitcoin trade analyst, Chris Burniske.\n\nThis isn’t particularly surprising as the meteoric rise of Bitcoin prices recently has led to it becoming a viable alternate investment vehicle with the potential for quick short-term gains. The value of Bitcoin in India soared to over Rs 1,70,000.\n\nAlso read: A Y2K moment for Bitcoins as the cryptocurrency may be headed for a split\n\nThere are a number of startups that have opened Bitcoin exchanges in India, making it easy to buy the cryptocurrency in Indian rupees. Unocoin, Coinsecure and Zebpay are the three main bitcoin players in India, with over a million users among them.\n\nAlthough Zebpay and Unocoin allow you to recharge your mobile, DTH, datacard and buy movie tickets on BookMyShow, most Indians aren’t really using Bitcoins for purchases.\n\nBecause of the ubiquity, security and ease of use of fiat currency (legal tender backed by the government, unlike cryptocurrency), Bitcoin today fulfils the “store of value” function of money more than the “medium of exchange” function that economists traditionally use to define money.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has many advantages over traditional currency: It is inherently scarce (the protocol specifies that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be created), it’s decentralised (its price cannot be manipulated by any government), it’s readily transmissible over the internet, easily stored and infinitely divisible, to the average person all of this means nothing.\n\nWhile we early-adopters in the tech industry may try something for potential, it can only cross the chasm into the mainstream by transforming that potential into actual experience.\n\nThe average person on the street today needs to have many more experiences where using Bitcoins is much more easier, secure or more advantageous in some way than using fiat currency. For them to use Bitcoins without knowing any of the underlying protocols is just like using the Indian rupee without really knowing how the Reserve Bank of India functions.\n\nAlso read: An eatery in Bengaluru may be India’s first to accept Bitcoins, but geeks show no love\n\nWhile there have been a few cases of merchants in India who’ve started accepting Bitcoins, which makes for a great tweet, there hasn’t been a clear articulation of why paying in Bitcoins is substantially better than using other modes of payment.\n\n@Unocoin @AaryamanVir First restaurant to accept bitcoin as payment in Mumbai.

When I checked the price for the same on Flybit, I was pleasantly surprised to see it being more than Rs 450 lower at just Rs 3,049.\n\nCheaper prices on Flybit!\n\nFlybit asked me to pay 0.01843519 in Bitcoins to a specific Bitcoin address, and sent me the tickets within a couple of minutes of payment.\n\nAccording to Prayank Gahlot, who runs Flybit, the prices on most domestic routes are discounted by more than 15% compared to traditional OTAs, but he wouldn’t reveal the name of the travel third party that provides the APIs behind Flybit. He also plans to provide a free Ola/Uber coupon with every domestic flight ticket soon.\n\nFlybit calculates the Bitcoin-INR exchange rate by taking the mean of all the rates on the Indian exchanges at any moment in time, which also means that those who buy their Bitcoins from US exchanges (where it’s cheaper by 1.5%-2%) can save even more money.\n\nFlybit is currently running on a break-even basis to provide the cheapest possible domestic air tickets for users, to promote adoption of Bitcoins in India.\n\nMore and more such cryptocurrency projects are cropping up in India: meet Pocketbits — that lets you buy any product from ecommerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal with Bitcoins.\n\nSohail Merchant, who is bootstrapping PocketBits, told me that while the potential of the market has attracted a lot of speculators and traders, the entire ecosystem around Bitcoins has to come up (and not just Bitcoin exchanges) for the mainstream, ‘noob’ crowd to get in.\n\nHe started Pocketbits after becoming the victim of multiple credit card frauds and having seen the breeze of using Bitcoins to shop on international ecommerce sites. Since launching in February, he claims Pocketbits has crossed more than 15,000 signups and transactions worth more than 1,200 Bitcoins have taken place on the shopping service.\n\nAlso read: A Bitcoin robbery in small-town UP?

Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively” — Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens.\n\nMoney then, is the ultimate network effect and it kind of only works because everyone believes in it.\n\nIf I believe that you’re going to accept Bitcoins as money, then I want more of Bitcoins and you want more of them too, and so it goes, to create a network effect. The attraction of Bitcoins is even more so as it is completely decentralised and no government can declare it worthless as happened in India late last year with the demonetisation.\n\nWhile Bitcoin crossing the chasm into the mainstream may still be a number of years away, for now, I’m happy getting a good deal on my flight tickets.\n\nLead visual: Nikhil Raj\n\n\n\nThis article was first published on Medium.']"

That’s possible because derivatives are a varied group that includes options and future contracts.\n\n“Our recently-granted licenses give LedgerX an enormous regulatory advantage for serving our institutional customers,” wrote the company’s CEO Paul Chou in a blog post after the decision. “LedgerX offers our customers a one-stop shop for tools to buy and sell spot bitcoin, derivatives, and all manner of specialized cryptocurrency swaps.”\n\nFor more on Bitcoin, watch Fortune’s video:\n\nLedgerX, which plans to roll out bitcoin options first starting in the fall, may also make it easier for investors to short cryptocurrencies. While it isn’t the first to offer bitcoin options, LedgerX is the first to offer options regulated by the CFTC. In 2015, a San Francisco-based bitcoin options trading platform Derivabit, also known as Coinflip, was asked to cease operations by the CFTC in 2015 for failing to register with the agency.', 'Bitcoin is on the road to increasing its capacity – but it\'s not there yet.\n\nDespite the claim bitcoin has been upgraded to support Segregated Witness-style transactions, there are more steps that need to occur before its distributed network can process additional data.\n\nIn fact, due to the complexities of keeping bitcoin\'s distributed network in unison, the change might not take hold until late August.\n\nThe timeline\n\nThat said, with BIP 91 activated, bitcoin is now headed down a path toward that possible outcome.\n\nIn context, this means that BIP 148, a proposal that seeks to upgrade the network to SegWit using different code, is no longer likely (though it\'s still possible). As such, one avenue that would find bitcoin splitting into two blockchains has been diminished, though it would be wrong to say it has been eliminated entirely – even in the short term.\n\nRather, SegWit now needs to follow a timeline designed to give miners and node operators ample time to upgrade their software, one that must also operate within the larger constraints of bitcoin\'s design.\n\nHere\'s a best-case scenario of how this might unfold:\n\nAs illustrated above, miners must now signal support for SegWit until the code achieves ""lock in"" and ""activation,"" two separate milestones with unique requirements.\n\nShort-term complications\n\nStill, things could go awry.\n\nFor example, it\'s possible that bitcoin\'s miners could stop signaling support for SegWit ahead of the BIP 141 ""lock in"" deadline (although they\'d risk having their blocks rejected by the network, losing the rewards).\n\nWhile all nodes appear to be signaling correctly, it\'s hard to know exactly who is running the software – this means that miners could fail to reject a block that wasn\'t signaling for SegWit, continue adding new blocks on top of that block, and ultimately, produce an alternative chain.\n\nAdding to the argument is that miner support for the idea has notably wavered in the past, with some asserting it\'s largely the threat that users could push through a change that could lead to a split that has kept miners in check.\n\nLitecoin\'s attempts at integrating SegWit adds context to this theory.\n\nAs much as 75% of litecoin\'s mining hashrate, for instance, was signaling for SegWit in April, meaning it reached the necessary threshold to lock in SegWit. But miner support dropped off soon after. This sparked protocol creator Charlie Lee and other litecoin users to threaten to code an alternative user-activated soft fork (UASF) proposal.\n\nShortly thereafter, a roundtable was held that united major miners, at which time they agreed to signal support for SegWit.\n\nShould similar psychology come into play here, the idea is that (after averting a UASF on bitcoin on August 1), miner support for SegWit may wane, though the economic stakes here are arguably higher.\n\nLong-term complications\n\nBut even if SegWit passes, that still only enacts one-half of the Segwit2x proposal.\n\nAn informal agreement among businesses and miners reached in May, the goal of the initiative was to push the capabilities of the software even further (some would argue too far beyond what should be advocated by prudent development).\n\nAs developer Jeff Garzik put forward in an interview this weekend, he still plans to help push forward an effort that would seek to upgrade the block size to 2MB, and to enact the upgrade via a process known as a hard fork.\n\nThe argument against that approach is that research in this area is still underdeveloped, though Garzik has argued SegWit could fail to introduce the capacity changes promised by those who have championed its integration.\n\nThis determination (as well as the acrimony Garzik\'s outlook has caused in the developer community that argue this claim and others he\'s made are false) could make a split later in the year more likely.\n\nAnd it\'s quite possible this chart will become more complex as this date approaches and different groups attempt to influence the outcome.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which acted as organizer for the Segwit2x proposal.\n\nOld compass image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A select group met at the Aspen Institute for a breakfast roundtable discussion on Wednesday morning.\n\nHeadliners on the panel included Balaji Srinivasan, CEO and cofounder of 21.co, a cryptocurrency startup that has raised more in traditional VC funding than almost other one. Another was Peter Smith, CEO and cofounder of Blockchain, a U.K.-based cryptocurrency wallet company that recently raised $40 million from GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet, parent company of Google (goog). And Kathleen Breitman, CEO and cofounder of Tezos, a blockchain startup that this year raised more than $200 million in an initial coin offering, or ICO, and which counts celeb investor Tim Draper among its backers.\n\nThe crew of experts weighed in on everything from the longevity of Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency and blockchain, or cryptographically secured public ledger, to the latest trend of hosting so-called token sales to fund projects, especially on Ethereum, a rival blockchain to Bitcoin’s, to the future of a decentralized web. Here are some of the predictions we heard.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\n1. Bitcoin and Ethereum are here to stay.\n\nMost people who are enthusiastic about cryptocurrency appear to agree that Bitcoin and its newer rival Ethereum have staying power, though they may be more bullish on one versus the other. “In terms of 5 to 10 years, Bitcoin and Ether will be around I bet,” Balaji Srinivasan told the room of more than 70 people.\n\nPeter Smith said his company, Blockchain, which was early to Bitcoin, has only just started to warm up to newcomer Ethereum. In contrast, Mike Cagney, CEO and cofounder of SoFi, a personal finance company, said during a separate session on the main stage that he was hotter on the latter technology.\n\nBitcoin “has some purpose but its application for commercial transaction is limited right now,” Cagney said. “The blockchain and Ethereum, on the other hand, have absolutely fascinating infrastructure applications,” he continued, mentioning the possibility to overhaul title insurance, which involves policies related to real estate, as one example.\n\n2. As yet unknown coins will hit the big time.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum may have stolen the show at this point, but the innovation won’t end there. Expect more winners on the horizon.\n\nKathleen Breitman is hopeful that Tezos, her own blockchain bet, will fill a niche that solves problems with extant blockchains. In particular, she and her project’s developers are designing Tezos to automatically push software updates out to the network, thus, in theory, avoiding the divisive feuding over upgrades that has wracked systems like Bitcoin over the past few years.\n\nNo one can say how many tokens and coins and blockchain protocols will eventually win out, but the experts seem to think there’s room for a multitude. “It’s likely that another one or two dominant ones we haven’t seen yet in the market,” Smith projected. “Another really dominant coin could come out this year or next year.”\n\n3. Sure, people will get burned.\n\nFor the time being, token sales might seem like a fantastic way to raise a lot of money quickly and with few questions asked. Will this lead to riches for some? Undoubtedly—indeed, it already has. And rip-offs for others? Almost certainly.\n\nSmith said he presumes that market manipulation and insider dealing is rampant among purveyors of initial coin offerings. “We’re cautious about it in the short term,” Smith said of his company. “But you have to temper that with the idea that every new technology is going to be like that in the beginning.”\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple and a former executive at Yahoo, voiced his less forgiving concerns about the sector on a separate panel. “Heavily regulated markets are typically heavily regulated for a reason,” he said. “Frauds are happening, people are going to jail.”\n\n4. ICOs will (eventually) give Silicon Valley and Wall Street a run for their money.\n\nThe days of making a pilgrimage to the homes of the holders of purse strings are coming to an end. In a world where anyone can participate as an investor online, physical location matters much less.\n\n“It used to be you had to come to Silicon Valley, walk up Sand Hill Road, network with individuals,” Srinivasan said about entrepreneurs seeking funding, often strolling up a strip to the west of Palo Alto that long has been associated with venture capital firms. ICOs change all that.\n\nProjects are already getting funded this Kickstarter-like new way. Breitman said she that when she set up Tezos’ token sale, she aimed to “get as many people who wanted to participate in the ecosystem to contribute.” The company raised more than $200 million to date and, according to her, more than 30,000 Tezos wallets have been opened.\n\n5. Regulations will stick.\n\nElena Kvochko, chief information officer of the security division at Barclays, said that her bank has had talks with regulators about Bitcoin, blockchains, and their ilk. The rule-sticklers appear to be open to the idea as long as “know your customer” laws are obeyed, although its still early days.\n\nMeanwhile, as governments settle on sets of rules of the road, countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and Estonia are jostling to develop frameworks that easily accommodate the new technology, Srinivasan said. They’re seeking to displace geographic incumbents and become hubs for a new wave of business financing. “If you’re a U.S. person or business, you have a good deal to be concerned about,” Smith said.\n\nBreitman added that until the rules are agreed upon, it’s “best to be transparent” about what one is doing.\n\n6. Speculation will subside as “killer apps” take hold.\n\nAs cryptocurrency prices fluctuate wildly, speculators have been having a field day. However, there’s reason to believe the markets will become more stable, as Bitcoin gradually has over the past couple of years (despite its still big price swings), Smith said.\n\nIn order for these computer coins to catch on big-time, they need a use-case that beats traditional money. Ideally, this ought to be better than merely “buying drugs,” as Jeff John Roberts, Fortune reporter and the session’s moderator, noted.\n\nSrinivasan proposed one possible scenario. Imagine that “all your waking hours are spent in the Matrix,” he said, referring to a virtual reality in which everyone is enmeshed in the future. As people from all over the world meet and interact, they will need a medium of exchange. “To transact, you can’t just hand over a dollar bill,” Srinivasan said. “You need an international currency for that.”\n\n“It might take a while but there’s going to be more of a need to transact across borders than there is today,” he said.\n\n7. Cryptocurrencies will pressure incumbents to improve.\n\nWhenever a consumer swipes or dips a credit card, payment processors charge a fee.\n\nNicko van Someren, chief technology officer of the Linux Foundation, pointed out that the fee companies like Visa or Mastercard charge exceeds the cost to clear or settle transactions. These businesses can potentially process transactions quicker and cheaper, he contended.\n\nOne potential outcome of the adoption of alternate systems, like Bitcoin, is to provide companies with the impetus to improve their services. “Bitcoin is good because it will make banks move toward the real cost of handling these transactions,” van Someren said. (By extension, in Ethereum’s case, one could imagine upstart companies built on it forcing giants like Amazon, Facebook, or Dropbox to reconsider or improve their respective offerings.)\n\nSmith, meanwhile, was less optimistic about incumbents’ ability to adapt to such change. “I don’t think be lot of room for banks to simply adjust their price models,” he said.', 'Bitcoin is again falling Tuesday as last week’s miraculous gains look set to correct downwards.\n\nCross-exchange data from Coinmarketcap shows a seven percent drop in the USD price per Bitcoin at press time, with 1 BTC worth $2,562.\n\nA rally last week, much of which centered on Thursday’s trading, saw prices on some exchanges shoot up over $500 within hours. Much of the optimism focused on the lock-in of BIP 91, a way forward for the Bitcoin network which would avoid a hard fork.\n\nOn Twitter, commentators and investors were cautious.\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin Cash over the past few days could present an antidote to the recent calm on the hard fork topic.\n\nBitcoin Cash, supporters of which demand a fork of the Bitcoin Blockchain, could well go ahead next week, reintroducing uncertainty and ‘versions’ of Bitcoin feared by opponents to drive down prices in the long term.\n\nMeanwhile across the top ten cryptocurrencies, broad losses triggered, with Ethereum down almost 10 percent and Ripple almost 12 percent.\n\nEthereum Classic, which had been slower than most to grow last week, also fell, dropping below $15 to reach its lowest levels since mid-May.', 'Just as the bitcoin world thought it was safe, a new threat to the cryptocurrency’s stability has emerged.\n\nLast week, the price of bitcoin rallied near all-time highs as a proposal to increase its transaction capacity was backed by over 97% of the cryptocurrency’s miners, reducing the odds of a so-called “hard fork.” But now, a weird new proposal has emerged that guarantees a split in the currency on Aug. 1. This time, however, the bitcoin world isn’t freaking out about it.\n\nLast week’s relief rally came in response to what was called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. Nearly all miners—who process transactions and introduce new bitcoins to the money supply—backed it. But BIP 91 stops short of delivering what a vocal faction of the bitcoin world wants: A greatly increased limit on the number of transactions the network can handle, also called the “block size” limit.\n\nSome quick background on this increasingly messy situation: Bitcoin’s creator set an arbitrary cap on the block size of 1 megabyte. The so-called “civil war” in bitcoin over the past few years has centered on whether that limit should be changed, how, and by how much. BIP 91 will double the maximum number of transactions on the bitcoin network but, crucially, without touching the hard-coded 1-megabyte limit. It achieves this with a workaround called Segregated Witness, or “SegWit,” that cleverly cleaves off chunks of transaction data, freeing up space for more transactions.\n\nSince SegWit doesn’t change the block-size limit, some bitcoiners feel that it’s simply kicking the can down the road. They also fear it could diminish the bitcoin network’s importance, as SegWit paves the way for “layer two” solutions that will allow speedy and voluminous transactions to take place outside the bitcoin network. This creates a scenario in which most transactions take place off the bitcoin network, with the occasional settlement transaction on the network.\n\nWhich brings us to the new proposal, which is confusingly named “bitcoin cash.” It calls for an eight-fold increase in the block-size limit on Aug. 1. Its name alludes to the faction that wants bitcoin to be a payment network—as readily available and easy to use as cash—as opposed to the group that sees bitcoin as akin to digital gold.\n\nOne exchange has started a futures market for bitcoin cash, since it doesn’t actually exist yet. On its first day of trading, on July 23, one unit of bitcoin cash traded for around half a bitcoin. It has slipped to around 0.2 bitcoin per bitcoin cash at the time of writing.\n\nAlthough bitcoin cash is certain to enact a hard fork in the cryptocurrency, that will matter only if it attracts enough miners to keep it going. Then, bitcoin and bitcoin cash could end up like ethereum and ethereum classic; two separate but viable coins that originated from the same blockchain. If miners ignore bitcoin cash, it will simply fade away as its transactions are rejected by miners.\n\nWith a week to go until Aug. 1, the value of bitcoin cash versus bitcoin will gauge the market’s confidence in this new rival prevailing in bitcoin’s raging internal conflict.\n\nRead next: Bitcoin’s civil war threatens to blow up the cryptocurrency itself', 'The cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex has said it “cannot commit to supporting any specific Blockchain” in the event of a Bitcoin split.\n\nIn an announcement to traders outlining its stance on next week’s decisive moment for Bitcoin, Poloniex said it would leave all options open.\n\n“At this time, we cannot commit to supporting any specific Blockchain that may emerge if there is a Blockchain split,” it wrote.\n\n“Even if two viable Blockchains emerge, we may or may not support both and will make such a decision only after we are satisfied that we can safely support either Blockchain in an enterprise environment.”\n\nBitcoin’s price had surged as concerns that a hard fork would remove value from the network calmed last week.\n\nJapanese exchanges even resumed operations following a temporary shutdown in preparation for forecast disruption.\n\nPoloniex, meanwhile, has said it would cut off access to its platform “anytime we deem necessary” over the coming weeks.\n\n“The length of any possible downtime is unknown as this is highly dependent on network stability,” the blog post continued.\n\n“Our objective will be to bring the wallet back online and enable deposits and withdrawals as soon as we believe it is safe to do so. Trading will be unaffected during these periods.”\n\nThe exchange received scorn from users last week as Bitcoin gained rapidly after it froze Litecoin trading, leaving them temporarily unable to profit from the altcoin’s uptick.', 'In a report on Bitcoin, Merrill Lynch\'s commodity and derivatives strategist Francisco Blanch, has noted the similarities of digital currencies to gold but says it can take the next step up in money’s evolution if issues on safety, liquidity and return are addressed.\n\nThe report has looked at the history of trading commodities and how those gave rise to paper money, noting that Bitcoin could be the latest innovation that has seen people switch from salt to dollar notes.\n\nCollateral damage\n\nOn this path to legitimacy, Blanch mentions that Bitcoin’s first and biggest hurdle is to be accepted as collateral as an asset, once that happens, it will take a huge step to global asset legitimacy.\n\n""We are not aware of any major institution that takes cryptocurrency as collateral at the moment,"" Blanch said\n\nDespite this though, Wall Street is warming to the digital currency as a potential investment product.\n\nWorth its salt\n\nBlanch begins his report with a brief history of commodities and their value as a currency explaining that practical needs, innovation and new discoveries have seen money evolve.\n\nIt seems logical then that because Bitcoin addresses some of the issues faced by paper money, it could become legitimized, but there are some of its own issues it needs to sort out.\n\nSafety\n\nSafety has always been a sore spot for Bitcoin and digital currencies, and it has been noted by Blanch too.\n\n“The lack of a centralized decision-making process or authority creates risks such as a currency split,"" he says. ""Also, risks such as hacking, identity theft or outright scams are a recurring problem.""\n\nHowever, in terms of its volatility, another hallmark of the digital currency, Bitcoin actually outscored silver on few occasions.\n\n""Bitcoin\'s volatility is very high compared to the euro, the yen or even gold,"" Blanch said. ""But it fell twice last year below the volatility of silver, the world\'s currency for 400 years.""\n\nSource: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nLiquidity\n\nUnsurprisingly, for an asset that is practically on the margins of society, it is being outperformed by stocks, traditional currencies and fixed income when it comes to market liquidity, but Bitcoin’s trading volumes are hard to ignore.\n\n""It is hard to ignore that trading volumes for major digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have skyrocketed in recent years,"" he said. “Noting that since 2012, daily trading volumes for Bitcoin have grown five times to $2 bln a day,” Blanch added.\n\nReturn\n\nOne area where Bitcoin does score high is its returns. The digital currency has more than doubled its value this year while rivals in the same sphere, such as Ethereum, are seeing more than a 1,000 percent growth.\n\nHowever, linking it back to gold, Blanch believes that it is the difficulty in mining Bitcoin that is making it so valuable.\n\nIn a rather too simplistic assumption, Blanch believes things could be different: ""This could change with the advent of quantum computers or through agreements among developers to adopt simpler protocols.""\n\nTruly is digital gold\n\nMining, as well as its increased difficulty, alongside an upsurge in interest, has seen Bitcoin climb in ""a pattern similar to gold"" and ""over a much more compressed time period.”\n\nSource: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\n""There is no certainty that [similarity to gold] will continue and, most certainly, no way to predict it,"" Blanch said. ""In our view, cryptocurrency returns will mostly depend on the faith placed by individuals, corporations, and financial institutions on this emerging technology,” Blanch concludes.', 'Bitcoin is is trading down 4.7% at $2,623 a coin. Tuesday\'s selling comes after a strong day of gains on Monday as traders continue to jockey for position ahead of the August 1 decision on whether or not bitcoin will be split in two.\n\nAccording to Sheba Jafari, the head of technical strategy at Goldman Sachs, bitcoin ""may need another few swings"" before the trend continues.\n\nThe cryprocurrency\'s inability to breakout above its June 13 high of $3,000 suggests it is forming a triangle pattern that could see as many as five swings, and a low of $1,786, Jafari writes.\n\nBut fear not, says Jafari, because a run at record highs is in the cards as bitcoin remains in the fourth wave of a five wave series. ""Anything above 3,000 (Jun. 13th high) will suggest potential to have already started wave V, which again has a minimum target at 2,988 and scope to reach 3,691 (the latter being a preferred target as this assumes a new high.),"" Jafari wrote in a note to clients sent out on Monday.\n\nSo far Jafari has been spot on in her analysis. In early July, Jafari suggested bitcoin wouldn\'t fall too far below $1,857. It fell to somewhere between $1,758 or $1,852 (depending on which data you use). A few weeks earlier, Jafari predicted a big drop was coming after bitcoin hit $3,000.\n\nBitcoin is up 166% so far in 2017.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'FMW-Redaktion\n\nDie Nachrichten in kompakter Form..\n\n1.

Controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x tried to remedy this by joining two code change ideas – the code optimization Segregated Witness (SegWit) and a block size increase.\n\nToday, SegWit is just a couple of steps away from activating on bitcoin, but some bitcoin users are unhappy about the outcome.\n\nOthers who originally backed the Segwit2x proposal appear to be losing confidence in an eventual block size increase and are now taking matters into their own hands by making their own version of bitcoin – and they\'re doing so on a short timeline.\n\nOn August 1, at precisely 12:20 UTC, the group claims that they will split off from bitcoin, creating a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash.\n\nDeveloper Calin Culianu, who\'s contributing code to an implementation of Bitcoin Cash, is one user who doesn\'t like SegWit, suspecting that others feel the same way.\n\nCulianu told CoinDesk:\n\n”If the Segwit2x agreement fails to implement the 2x part, which is not entirely unreasonable, and only ends up being being basically SegWit without the 2x, many miners will likely defect to Bitcoin Cash.""\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nSo, what is it? And how does it differ from bitcoin?\n\nThere are two main changes of note:\n\nIt increases the block size to 8 MB.\n\nIt removes SegWit, a code change that might activate on the bitcoin blockchain by the end of August.\n\nSome, including a few of the project\'s supporters, call Bitcoin Cash an ""altcoin,"" a term that usually denotes a fork of the software that creates a new cryptocurrency, with its own market.\n\nIndeed, the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $461, meaning it\'s worth about 18% of bitcoin\'s current price of $2,568, in an already-open futures market.\n\nUnlike other altcoins, though, Bitcoin Cash\'s transaction history would be the same as bitcoin\'s – at least up until the point of the split. So, if and when Bitcoin Cash splits off, users would have bitcoin on both blockchains.\n\nAnother difference is the project says it will support multiple implementations of its software, a move that\'s not surprising given the criticism that Bitcoin Core\'s software is too dominant on the bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoinABC is the first software to implement the Bitcoin Cash protocol, but the goal is for there to be many implementations.\n\nCulianu said that both Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic, other implementations that aim to increase bitcoin’s block size, are working on a version compatible with Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThese might or might not be ready for August 1.\n\nWho\'s involved?\n\nSo far, most bitcoin companies, mining pools, users and bitcoin developers seem uninterested in the effort. Yet, there are some eager supporters.\n\nBeijing-based mining firm ViaBTC, which boasts roughly 4% of bitcoin’s computing power, is the clear ringleader.\n\nThe firm, which also operates an exchange, has become the first to list the cryptocurrency and also has plans to launch a new mining pool dedicated solely to Bitcoin Cash. (Though, so far, it\'s not clear how much of its 4% mining hashrate it will commit to the effort.)\n\nAsked if he believed Segwit2x would fulfill its roadmap, CEO Haipo Yang responded: ""I doubt it.""\n\nFurther, Bitcoin Cash has attracted support from some users who want a block size increase, as well as developers of other proposals such as Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nWhat might be more surprising, though, is who\'s not involved.\n\nEven former supporters, including mining firms Bitcoin.com and Bitmain, seem hesitant to back the effort. For now, they remain committed to controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x.\n\nMining company Bitmain even inspired Bitcoin Cash. Yet, the firm said that they only planned on going through with making the switch under certain conditions. Still, the firm might support both Segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash in the future.\n\nIn a PSA statement, Bitcoin.com said that it will allow miners in its pool to choose if they want to mine the Bitcoin Cash token BCC.\n\nFor now, though, it will mine on Segwit2x chain, though it said it ""will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively"" if the block size increase part of SegWit, scheduled for roughly three months from now, falls through.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nThere are a few reasons users and mining pools might like to break off from bitcoin:\n\nThese users want an increase in bitcoin\'s block size parameter, and believe that the cryptocurrency\'s future depends on it.\n\nSegWit is likely going to activate soon and some users want to avoid the feature.\n\nThere\'s a possibility that Segwit2x\'s block size parameter increase will ultimately fall through.\n\nThis mix of ideological and technical reasons was also on display in conversations with users.\n\nWhen asked by CoinDesk what BitcoinABC\'s goal is, Culianu responded:\n\n""To save bitcoin. We want to scale bitcoin up so that it won\'t die. It\'s already a bit sick and dying.""\n\nWhat\'s different here?\n\nMany other efforts over the last couple of years have said they would split off from bitcoin, if they gained enough support from those operating the computers that secure the network. But, to date, no group has actually carried through with this plan so far.\n\nBitcoin Cash might be unique in that it\'s actually committing to a deadline to split bitcoin into two, and that deadline is less than a week away.\n\nIf miners and users indeed go ahead with the split, it would mark the first time a cryptocurrency split off from bitcoin, carrying with it bitcoin’s transaction history.\n\nLike past efforts intended to replace the bitcoin used today with a new bitcoin, however, Bitcoin Cash has the same goal, but it seems willing to wait and see if users join the effort.\n\nRather than call it bitcoin, ViaBTC, as well as a group of bitcoin companies in China, signed an agreement to label it a ""competitive currency,"" not the ""real"" bitcoin.\n\nThe move could set up the split to happen more quickly, as in the past exchanges have expressed confusion over how to handle a fork.\n\nWhat\'s next?\n\nIf a new cryptocurrency splits off from the main bitcoin network, it will mark a first. So, some users are curious to see what happens.\n\nStill, without much support from miners and users, it might not end up having that much of an impact on the course of the main network.\n\nNonetheless, it might if be worth watching if the second half of Segwit2x falls through. That\'s when it might see some more supporters.\n\nCulianu, for example, concluded on an optimistic note:\n\n”My secret gut feeling is Bitcoin Cash may surprise all of us. It is not entirely impossible that it will be the de-facto bitcoin after a few months. The much roomier 8 MB block space is attractive.""\n\nBitcoin voucher image via CoinDesk archives\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

(AMD) surprised the Street on Tuesday as it narrowed its loss in the most recent quarter and received a revenue boost from demand for its graphic processor units (GPUs), driven largely by the cryptocurrency\u200b mining craze. Shares of the Intel Corp. (INTC) competitor spiked over 10% afterhours, hitting a 10-year high following its better-than-expected Q2 results and Q3 outlook.\n\nCryptocurrency miners use graphic cards from AMD and its rival NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) to “mine” new coins through intensive computation, which are then sold or held for future appreciation. According to data from CoinDesk, the cryptocurrency Ethereum\u200b is up 2,400% year-to-date (YTD), while Bitcoin has gained 160% over the same period. AMD stock spiked last month after news that a jump in digital currency prices had driven demand for the tech firm’s graphic cards to a point where major computer hardware vendors had sold out of its recently introduced RX 570 and RX 580 models.\n\nSustainable Mining?\n\nDigital currency mining was a key topic among analysts during AMD’s earnings conference call as they asked for clarification on the magnitude and sustainability of the demand. While management noted that GPU revenue upside was driven by cryptocurrency applications, they weren’t specific on how much. Analysts at Jefferies highlight the fact that AMD is mitigating future downside risk and choosing not to incorporate continued digital currency mining outperformance in its guidance.\n\nOf further upside to AMD, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lisa Su told Barron’s there will be another semi-custom chip win that will ramp in 2018, though she can not yet tell who it is for.\n\nTrading up 7.6% on Wednesday afternoon at $15.18 per share, AMD reflects a whopping 118% gain over the most recent 12-month-period and a 34% return YTD. (See also: AMD and Nvidia Could Fall On Cryptocurrency Trend.)', 'Howard Marks, billionaire investor and founder of Oaktree Capital Management is adamant about his stance on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ether and others: “They’re not real.”\n\nMarks reiterated this three times to clients Wednesday in his latest Oaktree memo.\n\n“I’d guess these things have arisen from the intersection of (a) doubts about financial security — including the value of national currencies — that grew out of the financial crisis an (b) the comfort felt by millennials regarding all things virtual,” writes Marks. “But they’re not real.”\n\nMarks has clearly done his homework. The 22-page letter is full of research notes and quotes from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and others about blockchain-based currencies. But he’s still unconvinced that they hold any long-term promise.\n\n“Some people are eager to speculate on digital currency for profit,” he writes. “Others want to put a little money into these to-date-profitable phenomena rather than run the risk of missing out. But they’re not real!”\n\nIt all comes down to optimism, says Marks. As soon as our current bull market takes a nosedive, bitcoin and ether speculators could take a big hit.\n\n“They’re likely to keep working as long as optimism is present,” writes Marks. “But their performance in bad times is far from dependable. What will happen to Bitcoin’s price and liquidity in a crisis if people decide they’d rather hold dollars (or gold)?”\n\nMarks isn’t the only old-school Wall Street player to be skeptical of digital currencies. Major banks like Morgan Stanley have recognized bitcoin’s use as a value-holding asset, but are hesitant to call it a true currency.\n\nFor people like Marks, Bitcoin has a steep learning curve. It’s not as simple as traditional fiat currency, with notes backed by a central bank and transferred through clearinghouses. Instead, bitcoin utilizes a blockchain, which can instantly credit and debit ledgers of parties involved in a transaction.\n\nIt looks like Marks has some more reading to do to catch up.\n\n“Nobody has been able to make sense to me of these currencies,” he writes.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', ""Bitcoin is set to be given the same financial safeguards as traditional assets. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has granted LedgerX, a cryptocurrency trading platform operator, approval to become the first federally regulated digital currency options exchange and clearinghouse in the US.\n\nDespite reaching dizzying new highs this year -- and overtaking the value of gold -- Bitcoin has so far gone unregulated. LedgerX's new role will allow investors to hedge against price swings in digital currencies in the same way that traditional assets are protected."", 'The cryptocurrency market has been resilient as of late, retaining its value even as bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faces a potential hard fork in less than a week.\n\n""Resiliency is the key term here,"" said Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy, noting the market\'s ability to hold on to the sharp gains it produced earlier this year.\n\nFor most of the last week, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has remained above $80 billion, compared to $17.7 billion at the start of the year, CoinMarketCap figures show.\n\n[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\n\nBitcoin\'s Scaling Dilemma\n\nBitcoin\'s future remains uncertain as its network faces challenges in addressing the cryptocurrency\'s scaling dilemma.\n\nSegregated Witness, a proposal that would reduce the size of transactions and therefore allow them to be processed more quickly, has come closer to being implemented, as reported by CoinDesk.\n\nIn spite of this progress, a group of individuals has announced plans to create a separate Bitcoin network called Bitcoin Cash on August 1. Futures based on Bitcoin Cash were trading at $448.74 at the time of report, according to CoinMarketCap. This figure is less than 20% of Bitcoin\'s price of $2,503.56.\n\nScaling Situation A \'Soap Opera\'\n\nAs bitcoin\'s scaling dilemma continues, one analyst voiced his concerns about the uncertainty created by the situation. Rabaglia stated that:\n\n""The continuing soap opera over which camp will prevail come August 1st has been rocky at best.""\n\nFortunately, long-term cryptocurrency traders have been able to look past these difficulties, said Matthew Newton, senior market analyst at eToro. These market participants have recognized that the underlying technology is sound and contains ""no major flaw,"" he asserted. As a result, experienced traders can benefit from the situation:\n\n""Traders and investors who have been in this situation before can block out the noise, knowing there was going to be a great opportunity to pick up coins and tokens at a really good price.""\n\nCrypto Markets Still Immature\n\nHowever, Newton also provided a word of caution, stating that the cryptocurrency markets are ""still maturing and attracting a lot of new investment that may or may not be informed.""\n\nHe is certainly not the only one who has warned about these developments, as market observers have observed that in certain cases, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are raising millions of dollars with little more than a whitepaper.\n\nBubble Concerns\n\nThe surging use of ICOs-along with the sharp climb in digital currency values-has prompted certain market observers to warn that these digital assets may have entered bubble territory. Some have likened the robust gains enjoyed by these currencies to the rally that stocks enjoyed before the dot-com crash.', ""There’s plenty of talk about bitcoin, but do you know what it is and how it works?

For the final post in this series I’d like to review the Bitcoin wallets available for iOS. Five years ago, your choices for bitcoin wallets was more limited, but in 2017 there are so many options that it can be overwhelming at times.\n\nBefore going any further, make sure you familiarize yourself with the basics of Bitcoin wallets through this video:\n\nNow that we’ve got the basics covered, it’s time to review the best Bitcoin wallets available for your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIf you’ve watch the video from start to finish you probably already know that bitcoin wallets for iOS devices are, in many ways, the least secure wallets available.\n\nWhy? First, your phone can be stolen, and even if you have a password or fingerprint sensor, a skilled thief might be able to gain access. Second, you could simply lose or break your phone. If your bitcoins are stored directly on your phone, it’ll also contain your private key. Thus, if something happens to your iPhone or iPad your bitcoin wealth will be at risk.\n\nHowever, you can create a backup wallet using 12 to 24 word seed phrase. With this phrase on hand, you’ll be able to access a backup of your wallet. It’s recommend that you put your seed phrase in “cold storage”, or physical form. And if you do store in digital form, make sure it is heavily encrypted and otherwise protected.\n\nNow let’s move to the list of wallets.\n\nFirst Thing’s First- Coinbase is Not a Wallet\n\nMany people just getting started with bitcoin think that Coinbase is a wallet. It’s not. It is an exchange, or marketplace where you can buy and sell bitcoins. In the past, Coinbase positioned itself as a hybrid exchange/wallet. However, the inherent difficulties and risks of such a setup has resulted in the company shifting towards being a pure exchange.\n\nDo. Not. Store. Your. Bitcoins. On. Exchanges. This is one of the biggest rookie mistakes you can make. Exchanges are not meant for long-term, safe storage. Wallets are. So, get a wallet!\n\n#1- Breadwallet iOS Bitcoin Wallet\n\nIf you’re looking for a “bread and butter” wallet, Breadwallet should be at the top of your list. This wallet is stupid easy to use. There are two primary functions: send & receive. It’s a simple as that that. Open source code helps make this wallet a bit more secure, however, a lack of advanced security measures mean it might not be as secure as some other wallets.\n\n#2- MyCelium iOS Bitcoin wallet\n\nFirst, let’s jump into the downside of MyCelium: it’s a touch more complicated than other wallets. The reason why, however, is a tremendous upside: the “complications” are a result of advanced security futures. When it comes to bitcoin and protecting your wealth, the slight “inconveniences” (I struggle to even call them that) are more than worth it.\n\nFurther, MyCelium is an open source software. That means the whole community is on the look out for security flaws. Also, updates are frequent, and they usually result in increased usability and security.\n\n#3- Copay iOS Bitcoin Wallet\n\nCopay is designed by Bitpay, this co-signature wallet requires two people to sign off an on a transaction before it can be completed. This makes it more difficult for hackers and other unsavory types to try to steal your wealth. Available not just on iPhones or iPads, but also Android and desktop, this is a great wallet for security.\n\n#4 Jaxx iOS Bitcoin Wallet\n\nJaxx is a bit of a controversial wallet, and that needs to be put front and center. Proponents of the wallet argue that it’s one of the best mobile wallets, and with good reason. The wallet works with a huge range of crypto-currencies, has a great, easy-to-use interface, and can be paired across devices.\n\nCritics note that it’s not an open source platform. It’s hard to see the code behind the machine, so to speak, which makes many people uncomfortable. Give this, I’d recommend storing only a small amount of bitcoin or other currencies on Jaxx. Should the software be made open source, Jaxx might rise up the rankings.\n\n#5 Airbitz iOS Bitcoin Wallet\n\nAirbitz is an open source wallet. Its interface resembles the user-friendly BreadWallet interface, but the wallet also features some “newbie” friendly features. For example, there are listings of merchants that accept bitcoin, and ways to buy discounted gift cards.\n\nConclusion – Words of advice for your iPhone / iPad Bitcoin wallet\n\nRemember, a bitcoin exchange IS NOT a safe place to store your bitcoins. A bitcoin wallet will offer much better security features than your typical bitcoin exchange. Even when using a wallet, we recommend adhering to the following points:\n\nALWAYS set a pin to protect your wallet\n\nWrite down your 12 – 24 seed phrase and store it somewhere safe\n\nDO NOT store large amounts of bitcoins on your mobile wallet, only on hardware wallets\n\nTreat bitcoin like you’d treat your other typical financial accounts, gold, and over valuable assets. If you have any comments or questions feel free to leave them in the comment section below.', 'It’s taken the Bitcoin industry years to reach an agreement on how to best scale Bitcoin and begin the process of activating Segregated Witness, a solution which was originally proposed in December 2015.\n\nDespite extensive analysis from experts including Blockstack co-founder Ryan Shea which proved SegWit to be a secure and practical solution which solves a number of additional issues as well as scalability, miners have been reluctant to activate Segwit, largely due to the disagreements that emerged following the Bitcoin roundtable event that took place in Hong Kong. In an analytical blog post entitled “Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness: More Than Just Malleability Fixes and Scaling,” Shea wrote:\n\n“‘Segregated Witness’ or ‘SegWit’ is a Swiss army knife in terms of benefits. It leads to improvements on so many levels it’s actually surprising. It’s really, really good. So good that it’s worth listing out all of the benefits.”\n\nTwo of the major advantages of SegWit are its ability to drastically enhance security measures on bitcoin hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger as well as infrastructure changes that allow for the creation of 2nd layer solutions including the Lightning Network and TumbleBit.\n\n“SegWit is a blessing for hardware wallets for many reasons. I actually think that rolling out SegWit will increase security, because it will reduce huge complexity in hardware wallets as it is today,” said Marek “Slush” Palatinus, CEO of Satoshi Labs and the lead architect at Trezor.\n\nThough Segregated Witness offers so many improvements to Bitcoin, it has been met with opposition from some parts of the community and thus forming consensus has been slow. Only in recent months with the emergence of the UASF proposal and Segwit2x has the community moved closer to activation.\n\nDiscussing the progress that has been made by Segwit 2x, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum commented:\n\n“Segwit2x is a political solution to a totally political problem. Two sub-communities with radically different political viewpoints on scaling that need to find some short-term way to get along.”\n\nHowever, analyst and tech investor at Runa Capital Nick Tomaino explained in a recent post that the fact that the fact it is difficult to alter the Bitcoin network is an benefit, not a disadvantage.\n\n“Bitcoin is the purest cryptocurrency that uses cryptography and incentives to achieve social scalability. That social scalability is achieved because you’re not putting any trust in any central party when you use Bitcoin *and* you can be fairly certain that the protocol will not change much over time. Bitcoin has no competition in that respect today and the strongest brand and network effect as a result of this social scalability.”\n\nDifficulty in upgrading the protocol or making changes to the bitcoin network also means that Bitcoin is resistant to attacks from outsiders or groups with political intent looking to manipulate the network to their advantage. Within the post, Tomaino points to 3 other unique features that he feels separates Bitcoin from cryptocurrencies that have been lauded as having stronger features:\n\nNo one central party controls Bitcoin The lack of a founder and undisputed leader means that the protocol is extremely difficult to change (even seemingly obvious changes like the block size take years to change) People around the world can use the protocol with a high degree of confidence that its core features (total coin supply of 21 million, a block reward that decreases by half every 4 years) won’t change\n\nIn regard to the finalized activation of SegWit, Tomaino emphasized the necessity of agreement amongst all parties within bitcoin\n\n“The miners have rejected this change for years, but they recognize that if they don’t now, users will take things into their own hands with a User Activated Fork, which would be likely to split Bitcoin into two,” wrote Tomaino.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is decentralized and transparent, Tomaino along with other analysts believe it will scale, new features will be developed and eventually it will achieve mainstream success. Concluding his post, Tomaino goes on to suggest that one day Bitcoin could become a major reserve currency\n\n“Bitcoin is the primary digital asset to bet on for the next decade and is likely to be the reserve currency for the whole asset class.”']"
07/27/2017,"['The Russian “internationally sought ‘mastermind’ of a crime organisation” accused of laundering more than $4bn in bitcoin, including funds obtained from the hack of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, has been arrested in Greece.\n\nA US jury indicted Alexander Vinnik on Wednesday after his arrest in a small beachside village in northern Greece on Tuesday, following an investigation led by the US justice department along with several other federal agencies and task forces.\n\nVinnik was described by the justice department as the operator of BTC-e, an exchange used to trade the digital currency bitcoin since 2011, which was allegedly used to launder more than $4bn for people involved in crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking.\n\nUS authorities also linked him to the failure of Mt Gox, the Japan-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014 after being hacked. Vinnik “obtained” funds from the hack of Mt Gox and laundered them through BTC-e and Tradehill, another San Francisco-based exchange he owned, they said in the statement.\n\n“Just as new computer technologies continue to change the way we engage each other and experience the world, so too will criminals subvert these new technologies to serve their own nefarious purposes,” said Brian Stretch, US attorney for the Northern District of California.\n\nVinnik’s arrest is the latest in a series of US operations against Russian cybercriminals in Europe, including the taking down of two of the biggest dark web marketplaces for drugs, guns and other illicit items, AlphaBay and Hansa, last week.\n\nThe prosecutions also coincide with intensified scrutiny of Russian hackers after US intelligence officials determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election using cyber-warfare methods to help Donald Trump, something Moscow denies.\n\nDuring his time in the digital currency market, US authorities allege Vinnik facilitated crimes including hacking, fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud, public corruption and drug trafficking. Greek police described Vinnik as a “an internationally sought ‘mastermind’ of a crime organisation”.\n\nBTC-e, which has been out of service for more than a day, attributed this to “unplanned maintenance”. In a tweet on Wednesday after the arrest of Vinnik, BTC-e said it would restore service in the next five to 10 days.\n\nThe exchange is one of the oldest virtual currency platforms. It allows users to trade bitcoin pseudonymously against a variety of fiat and virtual currencies, and is known in cryptocurrency markets as having relaxed standards for checking users’ identity, and for not collaborating with law enforcement.', ""BTC/USD 27.07.2017\n\nThe market participants and, probably, the entire cryptocurrency community are waiting for Aug. 1. Following the adoption and activation of BIP 91, a significant increase in the BTC/USD pair from $1,900 to $2,900 was observed during July 17 to 21. Then there was little adjustment; it’s not surprising because smart money began to record profits in the resistance zone. This happened in the course of resumed fork negotiations, and because the Chinese miners' intention to launch Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWhat is going to happen with the price?\n\nAs of today, the key points are as follows:\n\nCarefully monitor the hash rate. It's difficult to say what version will have a larger hash rate. Therefore, the distribution will directly affect the price.\n\nMonitor the projects running above the BTC Blockchain. The price will also be affected by their selection.\n\nMost probable scenarios:\n\nDespite the absence of specific data, Bitcoin Cash seems to have little support. Companies that supported SegWit at Consensus have major interest in the market. Therefore, the most probable scenario is that on Aug. 30 to 31 the owners of 90-95 percent of the hash rate will publish a joint press release on the support of the agreements signed at Consensus 2017. Therefore, BCC will receive about five percent capacity or less, which is most likely. Then BTC price will test the resistance zone.\n\nOne of the companies might announce its refusal from the agreement and support of Bitcoin Cash, which is less probable but still likely. In this case, the consequences can be hardly assumed. Everything depends on the hash rate share obtained.\n\nThe first scenario is most likely to happen because the second one seems to have unpredicted consequences.\n\nFor the majority of Bitcoin holders, the best option might be to wait for the outcome, keeping money in the place blocked by the known private key.\n\nIn addition to conventional storage, there are hedge strategies. For example, LTC is demonstrating its high strength, and it might be a great hedge for BTC.\n\nETH/USD 27.07.2017\n\nThe situation with BTC is definitely influencing the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nETH is now showing the local range of $190 to $237. According to the technical analysis, there is a good opportunity to enter the market at the moment.\n\nHowever, it should be considered that Ethereum price is affected by the recent statements of SEC, BTC news and absence of positive news. Despite all this, purchase volumes around $190 are observed.\n\nPerhaps, the idea of the 0.077 support zone will work out well against the problems with BTC. Monitor the volume and search for interesting entry points.\n\nLTC/USD 27.07.2017\n\nLTC is strengthening its position in the cryptocurrency market. Currently, LTC is a good hedge against the situation with BTC.\n\nThe $36 support zone demonstrates good positions. Due to the overall volatility, spikes and offsets below $36 may occur, but this is a fundamentally good zone for purchases.\n\nVolumes are also essential. The multi-directional trading between BTC and LTC and the increased trade LTC volumes are good triggers for transactions.\n\nUnlike the rest of the crypto market leaders, LTC has substantially very good positions.\n\nZcash/USD 27.07.2017\n\nZcash seems to find itself in a very attractive position. We are probably witnessing the failure of the downtrend. The $160 support zone has already passed retesting. However, due to the volatility, another level test may occur. This price will be adequate for the opening of long positions.\n\nThe $160 to $230 channel was formed in this pair and can be advantageously used.\n\nWhen reaching and fixing at $230, a new uptrend will be formed.\n\nCurrently, Zcash is a rather attractive coin, not only regarding trading but also in terms of investment."", ""In Brief While Bitcoin has been suffering some hard knocks of late, Goldman Sach's senior Sheba Jafari has reassured clients by referring to a 1938 economic theory that sees turbulence as a necessary aspect of growth.\n\nIt is a turbulent time for Bitcoin — the cryptocurrency has risen to highs of $2,850 and sunk to lows of $1,836 just in July alone. But now, an influential voice has entered into the equation — Goldman Sachs, whose chief technician Sheba Jafari has claimed, in a report to clients on Monday, that soon Bitcoin will rise to $3,600.\n\nJafari wrote that “anything above 3,000 (June 13th high) will suggest potential to have already started wave V, which again has a minimum target at 2,988 and scope to reach 3,691.”\n\nWave V refers to the Elliott Wave theory, described in his 1938 book The Wave Principle, which is a means of technically analyzing financial cycles using stages of growth and fluctuation. Wave V indicates the final period of growth in which “news is almost universally positive and everyone is bullish.”\n\nDespite Bitcoin’s variable month, which also involved a severe hack and a potential crypto civil war being avoided, 2017 has been an astonishingly successful year for the cryptocurrency — and cryptocurrencies as a whole, for that matter.\n\nBitcoin has risen from $997 to today’s rate of $2,512, which is an increase of 151 percent. Correspondingly, it is being used ever more for real world applications. It is now accepted as a legal form of tender in 260,000 stores in Japan, and many countries, such as South Africa, are now considering how to regulate it — which is a testament to the cryptocurrency’s growth and potential legitimacy.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets. Their personal investment perspectives have no impact on editorial content."", 'CRYPTOCURRENCY Bitcoin is likely to split into two after 1 August as a result of disagreements between \'miners\' over how its blockchain should change in order to scale better.\n\nA hard fork is a scenario that most miners and holders have been keen to avoid, the majority instead favouring the adoption of a consensus technique known as ""segregated witness"" or ""SegWit"", which would ease the scaling difficulties but also allow it to remain compatible with the existing chain, avoiding forking the code. Until last weekend, this option looked the most likely outcome.\n\nHowever, a group of miners, developers, investors and users has now come out in favour of supporting a hard fork known as Bitcoin cash (BCC). BCC will have a larger block size (up to 8mb compared with the 1mb limit) and with ""upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale"", according to the BCC website.\n\nChanges to the Bitcoin code require a consensus among its miners (organisations running the server farms that essentially secure the blockchain); if a consensus is not reached then the code is forked. This is what happened to the Ethereum currency, which split into two (Ethereum and Ethereum Classic) following the failure of the DAO exchange.\n\nThis eventuality appeared to have been avoided by Bitcoin when a proposition called Bitcoin Improvement Process 91 (BIP91) that would, in theory, lead to a soft fork and SegWit was ""locked in"" by miners. However, not everyone is happy with SegWit, seeing it as a short-term solution at best, and it now seems that consensus will not be reached by the deadline of 1 August meaning a hard fork is likely.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining borkage sees mysterious user lose £145,000\n\nThe hard fork will result in two currencies, Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. Holders of Bitcoin who also hold their private keys will automatically receive the new currency if and when the split happens. However, holders whose Bitcoins are held in online exchanges such as Coinbase, that do not allow access to private keys, will not receive the new currency. This is likely to lead to a major exodus of Bitcoin from these services in the short term.\n\nOne uncertainty is which currency miners will ultimately choose to support. Bitcoin cash will only succeed if enough miners choose to mine it. Another is how protocols such as Omni, which operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and on which a number of cryptocurrencies and tokens are based, will be supported once two versions of the blockchain are in the wild.\n\nWhile the dollar price of Bitcoin has dropped a little from recent highs, the falls are smaller than occurred when the split first became common knowledge, so there appears to be a reasonable amount of confidence in the currency\'s future whatever happens after 1 August. Some people, no doubt, will be buying bitcoin because of the prospect of free bitcoin cash if the hard fork takes place.\n\nSome people, no doubt, will be buying Bitcoin because of the prospect of free Bitcoin cash if the hard fork takes place. µ', 'News\n\nThis week’s the U.S. regulatory agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced in a report the organization conducted research on the current state of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and last year’s DAO debacle. From the letters perspective, the days of all these token sales and the “Wild West” ICO period is likely coming to an end.\n\nAlso read: ICO Hype Attracts Investors but Also Skeptics and Regulators Worldwide\n\n‘The Market Anticipated This Announcement’\n\nBitcoin.com recently reported on the SEC announcement on July 25 detailing the agency’s opinions concerning last year’s Ethereum-based DAO crowdfund and the current ICO hype happening right now. The report conveyed a few key statements that established that U.S. federal securities laws would apply to ICOs and digital token sales. Due to the past six months of ICO excitement, raising millions of dollars in crowdsales based off of the Ethereum protocol, some within the cryptocurrency community seemed to welcome the SEC’s news. Many cryptocurrency and blockchain proponents believe the ICO market was getting out of hand, while others believe regulators need to step aside.\n\nThis week a few members of the bitcoin and blockchain community reached out to Bitcoin.com to make a statement about the SEC’s recent announcement. Ari Meilich, Project Lead at Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual world, said the market was expecting the SEC’s statements.\n\n“The SEC weighing in represents public acceptance of blockchain instruments,” explains Meilich. “They said that the DAO tokens were a security, and that all securities must be registered according to the law. The market was anticipating this, and the price of non-security tokens, like Ethereum, did not fluctuate when the SEC report came out.”\n\nAny Organization Failing to Comply With U.S. Securities Laws Will Be Held Responsible\n\nSteven Nerayoff an early Ethereum advisor and lawyer who came up with the name “Gas” for the digital currency said the industry already knew this regulatory proclamation was coming.\n\n“The SEC’s decision reinforces what the blockchain industry already knew: Federal securities laws apply to all new types of technologies,” Nerayoff told Bitcoin.com.\n\nIf anything sold has the characteristics of a security, one must follow U.S. securities laws. This is the case for all technologies. And it should be expected that any organization that fails to comply with the requirements of U.S. securities laws will be held responsible.\n\n‘Significant Fallout for Companies That Have Conducted ICOs’\n\nThe largest bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) network Coinsource’s General Counsel member Arnold Spencer believes the SEC’s statements cannot be said enough and it is clear to him the regulatory agency will be enforcing these guidelines soon.\n\n“It is now clear that some digital currencies will be viewed as securities, depending on how the tokens or coins are structured,” Spencer details. “Secondly, and more importantly, it is now clear that the regulators and law enforcement in the United States will be enforcing these laws. The pipeline for ICO’s just got a lot smaller.”\n\nI predict some significant fallout for the companies that have conducted ICOs in the past six months that are structured similarly to the DAO. Many ICOs are out there that will now be viewed definitively as securities, and yet are unregistered.\n\nThe ‘Wild West’ Crowdfunding Period May Be Coming to an End\n\nPerry Woodin CEO of Node40, a blockchain accounting and masternode hosting service, also was not surprised by the SEC’s report on the DAO and token sales. “The number of businesses supporting blockchain applications has exploded over the past couple of years, and with them, we’ve seen new tools for raising capital,” Woodin explained to Bitcoin.com.\n\n“The SEC’s report on ICOs was not a surprise,” the Node40 founder adds. “Many of the ICOs were aiming for that compliance gray area. They wanted their offerings to be considered ‘crowdfunding’ even though they could not meet the requirements of the Regulation Crowdfunding exemption. Now we’ll see what happens as companies attempt to fit within the SEC’s guidelines.”\n\nThe SEC’s announcement on ICO investments and its recent research into the DAO project suggests that regulators found lots of red flags involved with the DAO crowdfund but have chosen to let that particular project slide. However, it seems the past six months of “Wild West” ICOs and token sales may be subject to these securities laws and many projects may fall by the wayside for not meeting SEC requirements.\n\nWhat do you think about the SEC’s recent announcement?

It has a direct membership of over 1,600 corporate entities and serves more than 45,000 indirect members in the business community.\n\nAt the event, the PHD Research Bureau released a survey-based report outlining the present status, mechanism, regulatory aspects, and future prospects of bitcoin in India. The survey asked 223 stakeholders, from industries such as garments, textiles, drugs and pharmaceutical, electronics, machine tools, auto components, and leather, according to Money Control. The publication wrote:\n\nThe study found that 97 percent of the respondents were aware of bitcoins.\n\nHowever, none of the respondents have actually used bitcoin for their businesses, the survey revealed, adding that all of them “were unaware of the payment mechanism involved in bitcoins,” the publication noted.\n\nRegulation Could Boost Bitcoin Adoption\n\nSurvey respondents cited “safety and security of the system as a major hindrance” to bitcoin adoption.

He also pointed out that it is not legal tender in many parts of the world.\n\nFor bitcoin to thrive, he said it needs to become a pledgeable collateral. He further noted that bitcoin must be viewed as safe to become a trusted store of value.\n\nBitcoin trading, meanwhile, has increased to more than $1 billion daily in recent months. On some days, trading has surpassed $2 billion.\n\nVolatility Still High\n\nBlanch said bitcoin’s volatility lessens as it builds liquidity and scale. But its volatility remains higher than emerging market currencies. In addition, he said, cryptocurrencies do not correlate with gold, oil, Group-of-10 currencies or equities.\n\nCryptocurrency returns rely on price appreciation that will mainly depend on faith from financial institutions, corporations and individuals, he said. Bitcoin currently trades at more than $2,500 per coin, which more than doubles the price at the beginning of the year.\n\nMost regulated financial companies permit clients to borrow against physical and financial assets, but they do not take cryptocurrency as collateral at the present time, Blanch observed. This view matches that of Morgan Stanley analysts who stated in June that government acceptance is needed for cryptocurrency appreciation, coming at the cost of regulation.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrencies more assets than actual currencies, says Morgan Stanley\n\nBofA Aligns with Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley stated in a white paper in June that both investors and regulators view cryptocurrencies as assets more than actual currencies. The analysts, including James Faucet, stated that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple, are more like “investment vehicles” than fiat currencies that people can spend on products and services. Morgan Stanley analysts added that bitcoin represents a “marginally more inconvenient way to pay,” and there are only a handful of reasons to use the cryptocurrency instead of a credit or debit card.\n\nMorgan Stanley could only list some “guesses” about the price increase of bitcoin. According to the report, the analysts do not have a clear reason why the cryptocurrency has been on a massive surge.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'In recent months, major financial institutions have warmed to Bitcoin, increasing coverage and providing increasingly positive information. In their latest report, Bank Of America revealed that the trading volume of Bitcoin has surpassed that of GLD, the biggest gold ETF in the market.\n\nDigital Currency Group founder and CEO Barry Silbert tweeted in May 2016 that the total amount of gold in circulation was over $7 trillion.\n\nBitcoin market cap ($8 billion) as a percent of gold in circulation ($7 trillion) = 0.114% — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) May 28, 2016\n\nSince then, bitcoin has exponentially grown, with the market cap rising from $8 billion to $42.6 billion in just over a year. Analysts have attributed the rising price of bitcoin to the increase in demand from casual and institutional investors, legalization of the digital currency by various countries including the U.S.A, South Korea, the Philippines, Japan and Australia, as well as an increase in mainstream adoption.\n\nIn response to the increasing price, Sheba Jafari, the head of technical strategy at Goldman Sachs, provided some technical analysis predicting that the price could reach $3,915 in the upcoming months and sustain an upward momentum.\n\nWhile Bank of America and its analysts were reluctant to predict the short term price of bitcoin in their report, they noted that the daily trading volume of has surpassed that of GLD:\n\n“It is hard to ignore that trading volumes for major digital currencies like bitcoin and ethereum have skyrocketed in recent years. For example, daily trading volumes for bitcoin were $400 million in 2012 and have now moved up to about $2 billion a day at present,”\n\nPrior to the major correction that occurred last month, the combined market cap of cryptocurrencies in circulation surpassed 115$ billion. Furthermore, the daily trading volume of the market hit a high of $5.2 billion on the 13th of June as the demand for bitcoin and ethereum skyrocketed.\n\nA chart provided by BoA and published by Zerohedge further revealed that the trading volume of GLD, the largest gold ETF, was significantly higher than that of bitcoin less than 8 months ago, maintaining a relatively high volume of daily trading throughout January 2014 to December 2016. However, during December of 2016, the trading volume of bitcoin took over that of GLD, as the demand towards gold decreased but interest in bitcoin surged.\n\nAdditionally, the report from BoA emphasized the expansion of the cryptocurrency market in general, citing the growth rate of Ethereum and other public blockchain networks.\n\n“Meanwhile, ethereum had daily trading volumes of $1.5mn when it first launched in 2015 and it is now experiencing daily trading of about $1bn. Most importantly, for a digital token to become a currency, it must build to a certain scale, a bit like the silver mine in Bolivia found by the Spanish. In some ways, this is exactly what has been happening in recent quarters, with the total market value of digital tokens growing exponentially from $1.5bn to around $87bn at present,”', 'Over the past eight years bitcoin has been involved in a few conspiracy theories, and even though they are highly improbable, they are pretty humorous, to say the least.\n\nAlso read: One of the Largest Bitcoin Mixing Services Closes its Doors\n\nThe New World Order and Bitcoin\n\nJust recently we reported on the Rothschild Investment Corporation purchasing bitcoin shares and how some people thought it was Lord Rothschild, the alleged owner of the world’s largest fortune for three centuries.\n\nSince the end of time, humans have always liked to tell ‘tall tales.’ Bitcoin itself is often considered a weird subject because an anonymous developer made the software and this has led to many conspiracy-like discussions involving the digital currency. Some have said the protocol was created by the CIA or some underground government agency plotting to rule the world. Today we will discuss two tales that have often been tethered to bitcoin by those who wear tin foil hats. After reading this, you may find yourself in a Faraday cage with your ‘bug-out bag’ waiting for the next EMP, so please proceed with caution.\n\nThe Mark of the Beast\n\nThis particular tale is tied to a religious belief based on the Christian’s book of Revelations where bitcoin could be considered the “Mark of the Beast.” Yes, there are a couple of random people on this earth who believe that the digital protocol may be the tool of the Antichrist that allows you to purchase food and survive under the Devil’s rule. The Illuminati has many tricks up their sleeve, and this one is fantastically clever.\n\nThe Mark of the Beast comes from a story in the Bible’s New Testament, in the book of Revelations chapter 13. In that section, particularly 13:17, it says that people on earth will have to get a mark on their bodies in order to purchase living necessities. The mark is forced upon everyone from “the great, the small, the poor and the rich.” Now because society is gravitating toward a cashless society some curious characters believe bitcoin will be the notorious mark.\n\n“And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name,” explains Revelations 13:17\n\nSo you might be still asking yourself — How the hell is bitcoin associated with this mark? Well, more recently the subject of “biohacking” and microchip implants have become a popular trend. Some people in this movement have installed chips into their hands with a bitcoin wallet inside. Because Revelations states people will “receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads,” some consider this the missing link to bitcoin and the mark.\n\nHowever, there are those in religious circles that think this theory of bitcoin being the mark might be the opposite of what’s really happening. The publication Christian Money says bitcoin might be a way people can fight the beast.\n\n“One of the key elements of the Mark of the Beast is to be able to prevent those that refuse to take the Mark from buying and selling. Bitcoins are decentralized and prevent any such control,” explains Christian Money.\n\nThe One World Currency\n\nAnother story conspiracy theorists have up their sleeves is the “One World Currency” scheme. Another speculative theory thinks that the whole globe will share one single currency, likely owned by the Rothschilds and the Bilderberg group. Now, this conjecture is again tied to the ‘cashless society’ progression, and if you want to be even more clever, this theory can be related to the Mark of the Beast. The one world currency will be trackable, and everyone on the globe will likely be forced to use these funds. That’s where bitcoin comes in, and some speculators believe that because the blockchain is traceable and the technology is part of the ‘cashless society’ paradigm shift — Bitcoin will be the one world currency. For instance, the website Occupy Corporatism believes this may be the case.\n\n“The technocratic push toward cyber-currency or e-money, is a march toward complete control over global currencies with the development of supporting technologies and the distribution of such that facilitate an online representation of money that can be used for exchange with another fiat system,” explains Susanne Posel, of Occupy Corporatism.\n\nThe reason why conspiracy theorists believe a global currency is on its way is because many Keynesian economists have bolstered this idea over the years. Even John Maynard Keynes himself has been cited as a single world currency advocate. This school of economic thinking believes it would help the global economy and improve international trade. The introduction of the Euro, a currency that covers many countries was considered the beginning of this effort. However, in recent times certain countries like Britain, for example, have distanced itself from the Euro during the Brexit vote. As far as bitcoin is concerned becoming the world’s reserve currency, some forecast it to be the sixth largest reserve currency by 2030.\n\nSo to some of these theorists, bitcoin is just another catalyst towards the cashless one world currency secretly crafted by the elite. In essence, any electronic currency is suspect for being part of the ‘1 percent’s’ plan to enslave the ordinary plebs of society. Even the other day on July 25, 2017, the publication Beforeitsnews published a report called “The globalist one world currency will be very similar to bitcoin,” so these theories still run rampant.\n\nIt’s Highly Improbable Bitcoin Will be a One World Currency or the Mark of the Beast\n\nBitcoin is indeed a strange phenomenon filled with curious characters like Satoshi Nakamoto. However it doesn’t mean bitcoin was created by the CIA, will be used for a one world currency or even the mark of the beast.\n\nWhat do you think about conspiracy theories tied to bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImages via Pixabay, Wiki Commons, and Bitcoin.com.']"
07/28/2017,"['When initial coin offerings emerged as a new way for startups to raise money a few months ago, there was much speculation—and some doubt—about whether the cryptocurrency crowdfunding method could disrupt or even replace the traditional venture capital industry.\n\nNow, the early numbers are in, and there is no question that ICOs, an unregulated form of fundraising by which companies can sell their own form of digital currency or tokens to investors, are winning this race, at least in the blockchain industry.\n\nICOs have now raised nearly four times as much money as bitcoin companies raised in venture capital dollars so far this year. That’s according to PitchBook in tandem with Smith & Crown, which tallied up the latest numbers: ICOs have raised almost $1.3 billion in 2017 so far, while only about $358 million in traditional VC money went to blockchain startups over the same period.\n\nAnd that’s at a time when venture capital is booming among blockchain companies. Last quarter was the best quarter for blockchain and bitcoin VC funding on record, more than doubling the amount raised in the first quarter and up 89% year over year, according to CBInsights.\n\nBut ICOs are growing much faster, having already raised almost six times as much this year as they raised in all of 2016.\n\nNow, a fundraising method that you likely had never heard of until a few months ago is on track this year to exceed all prior VC investment in blockchain, which has totaled a cumulative $1.7 billion over the past eight years, PitchBook says.\n\nTo underscore just what a whirlwind trend this has become, even entrepreneurs doing their own ICOs are astonished by the craze.\n\nAt a panel discussion hosted by BlockchainDriven Thursday night, Morgan Hill, an investor at Attis Capital, announced that he was launching a new cryptocurrency hedge fund called AxionV in August. But unlike the crypto hedge fund startup MetaStable, which recently received funding from Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Union Square Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners, AxionV has a different plan. It will do an ICO itself, targeting a $30 million fund, which it will then use to invest in other ICOs, Hill said.\n\nHe also told a story of another hedge fund manager in London who was planning to launch an ICO of a company that aims to put the entire Quran online, and use the new cryptocurrency to compensate people who contribute to the digitization of the religious text. Hill’s take: “The first thing I thought was, this is categorically insane.”\n\nHe later came around, he said, acknowledging “religion is a very important piece of information” and that the project “actually does provide a huge value.”', 'With only 3 days left before Bitcoin’s hardfork is implemented, there is still great uncertainty among BTC-USD markets (which inherently applies to all cryptocurrencies) and what their imminent fate will be. One would expect, with so much market uncertainty, that BTC-USD should be seeing dropping prices as people begin to sell their BTC in lieu of other fiat and crypto-assets. However, in a surprising turn of events, BTC-USD has managed to climb by over $300 within the past 24 hours. Because the speculations regarding the BTC hardfork vary wildly, this market analysis will look at the raw data presented on the markets and will not attempt to account for any of the hardforking ramifications.\n\n\n\nWant to learn how to keep your bitcoins safe? Read this.\n\nThe figure below shows two indications that the BTC-USD climb is due for a consolidation period and possibly some pullback in price:\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2HR Candles, Bitfinex, Momentum Loss\n\n\n\nThe first that stands out with the current $300 rise is the decreasing volume throughout the length of this little bull run. Decreasing volume indicates the decrease in market interest in these higher values and typically leads to either a consolidation period or a pullback in price to garner support from lower values.\n\nThe second indicator that stands out is the 2HR MACD divergence shown in pink. Typically, for a healthy bull run to sustain its upward momentum, we would like to see the MACD making new highs on the histogram to accompany the new highs in market value. Looking closely, you can see the most recent high of approximately $2800 did not correspond to a new high on the MACD histogram. Thus, another indicator of market momentum loss reveals the increased likelihood of market price consolidation.\n\nAs always, it is important to put the current market trend within the context of the grand picture:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, Bitfinex, Hidden Bearish Divergence\n\n\n\nLooking at the 6HR candles trend, there is a subtle hint of macro bearish divergence on the MACD. When the MACD signal line/moving average makes a new high, but the price trend does not make a new high, this can be an indication of bearish leaning momentum called “hidden bearish divergence.” In addition to the MACD hidden bearish divergence, we can see a severely decreased volume trend as we approach the highs made a couple weeks ago. In general, the upper $2000s seem to be a battleground that is starting fizzle out in a bearish fashion. This could be attributed to many factors, but ultimately I think the wild price swings can be easily explained by the great uncertainty in the market surrounding the August 1st hardfork.\n\nWith only 3 days left, speculators are getting situated in their positions. Until the hardfork is implemented, there is no telling what will happen to the BTC-USD markets or the cryptomarket as a whole. So, with all this uncertainty in the air, where can we expect to find levels of support in the event of a major crash on August 1st? The figure below shows the key support levels to look for on the macro scale:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 12HR Candles, Bitfinex, Key Support Levels\n\n\n\nOnce again, the key support levels for the macro trend are found along the Fibonacci Retracement values of the entire bull run. Immediately below our current values lies very solid, historic support at $2500 values. A test of this support value will ultimately dictate the immediate future of the BTC-USD market.\n\nOn the run up to $2900 a couple weeks ago, a lot of volume went into the market to develop firm support. A breakdown of this support level could prove to be quite destructive to the BTC-USD market in the short term. The $2500 support level is clearly shown in the massive influx of volume and proves to be a severe point of market interest. To date, that is one of the strongest support levels BTC-USD has established, as indicated by the rise in volume around those prices.\n\nSummary:\n\nOn the macro and micro levels, BTC-USD is showing indications of price consolidation in the near future. Key support levels are found along the Fibonacci Retracement values. In particular, $2500 has proven its historical significance in the market and should be closely watched in the event of a bear run post-hardfork on August 1st.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

But, as the mining community came to a consensus to activate SegWit via BIP 141, the original SegWit proposal, the probability of the activation of Bitcoin ABC or Bitcoin Cash, significantly decreased.\n\nStill, ViaBTC officially announced earlier this week that it plans on pursuing the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, to create a separate version of the original Bitcoin Blockchain. The abrupt announcement of ViaBTC came as a surprise to Bitmain as well, which led the company to release yet another announcement clarifying that Bitcoin ABC was merely a contingency plan against BIP 148.\n\nDespite the rejection of Bitcoin Cash by exchanges, mining pools and businesses, its creation and introduction to the market will mean a chain split. Prior to the finalization of SegWit activation, the market remained unstable due to the possibility of a hard fork execution and now, the market is more confident in Bitcoin than ever before.\n\nFor the most part, that is because Bitcoin has proven its ability to scale through the finalization of SegWit and the vast majority of the industry has announced that they don’t intend to acknowledge Bitcoin Cash as a legitimate fork of Bitcoin. Rather, leading businesses such as Coinbase and GDAX will consider Bitcoin Cash as an alternative cryptocurrency or altcoin.\n\nHence, due to the finalization of SegWit and the clarification of the Bitcoin industry on the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, the market and investors have regained confidence in Bitcoin. Additionally, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs and other leading financial institutions, Bitcoin’s upward momentum will likely be sustained.', ""Bitcoin's market capitalization relative to the rest of the cryptocurrency market has risen above 50% for the first time in two months, according to a popularly used metric.\n\nCoinMarketCap's Bitcoin Dominance Index has climbed as high as 51.62% today, the site reports.

At press time, the index is at 51%.\n\nMarket data suggests that the index shift is being spurred by a rise in the price of bitcoin and declines for some of the world's other major cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP.\n\nAt press time, the price of bitcoin is up more than 3% since the day's open, trading at about $2,791 after markets hit a high of $2,833.24, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

The victims were then asked to pay a ransom so that they can regain access to their files. The payments were usually made using anonymous digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThe criminals employ several methods in their attacks. One method is the use of ransomware-as-a-service, in which they rent out ransomware programs and support system needed to receive payment to other criminals. They then charge a certain percentage of the profits on the use of the programs as payment.\n\nThe other strategies include the use of time limits after which they delete the encrypted files, the use of the option in which victims are allowed to decrypt their files for free if they help in infecting other computers, and the use of a method in which the demanded ransoms increase the longer time the victims take to pay.\n\nCompanies wary of getting cyber attacked for Bitcoin\n\nAs previously reported, UK companies are wary of ransomware attacks and stocked up on some Bitcoin in order to prepare for possible ransomware threats. Whereas in the US, retailers are worried about accepting Bitcoin as 50 percent of them think they are vulnerable to hackers.', 'Developers, startups, miners ... all have played a role in bitcoin\'s technical debates. But if you\'ve been following, you may have noticed the attention being paid to whether miners are ""signaling"" for various proposals.\n\nBefore we dive into what that means, it helps to understand that the term ""miners"" actually relates to a diverse group of people.\n\nFirst, all miners develop, build or deploy the specialized computers designed to compete (or help others compete) for network rewards, and in the process, help move bitcoins from person to person. The role may sound mundane, but there are concerns that miners have, or may one day have, too much power over network decision-making.\n\nSince some argue that it was originally envisioned that every bitcoin user would help secure the network – as opposed to massive companies – miners have long been the subject of the less-than-trusting imaginations of the network\'s users and security-conscious developers.\n\nWith just about 20 mining pools out there, some controlling large chunks of the underlying computer power, there are long-held fears that they could potentially conspire to attack the network and, as a result, reduce confidence in bitcoin as a secure and stable online currency.\n\nComplicating matters is that, over time, miners have also developed a secondary role: helping bitcoin add new technical features. And, similarly, users have grown to worry that this position could be abused.\n\nIndeed, you could argue that the group contributed to recent uncertainty about bitcoin\'s future. With several competing proposals on the table, there were many different ways this summer\'s code changes could have unfolded, and miners were integral to each.\n\nAt points, it even felt like their approval of the change was the sole thing keeping bitcoin from splitting into two competing blockchains. (It\'s worth noting that some miners might even end up doing just that).\n\nThis game was on full display last week when mining pools began signaling support for an upgrade earlier than expected. One mining pool began embedding information in blocks indicating it would follow through on an action, then a flood of others joined. It wasn\'t long before all miners were on board.\n\nUsers cheered on social media while keeping track of the blocks left to upgrade by refreshing tracker pages – at least, until the page stopped loading due to overwhelming traffic.\n\nIt was a relief. It looked like a split had been all but avoided following a long period of uncertainty.\n\nExplaining upgrades\n\nLike all software, bitcoin needs to make upgrades to fix problems or to add new features. However, in bitcoin\'s case, the entire distributed network needs to stay in sync.\n\nOne way to upgrade the software is what\'s known as a ""soft fork,"" one way to change the rules that keep all the nodes in the network in agreement.\n\nSoft forks are backwards-compatible changes that don\'t require all nodes to upgrade. As such, users can ""opt-in"" to the new rules. Node versions from years ago can be used to send money to upgraded nodes, even though they don\'t follow these new rules.\n\nNow, nodes might not need to upgrade, but at least some mining pools do.\n\nThink of it this way: Mining pools are the ones who mine new blocks of transactions, so they need to accept and follow the new rules in order that the new types of blocks and transactions can actually be added to the blockchain.\n\nSupporting the change\n\nHere, there are a couple of points to keep in mind:\n\nFor the soft fork to avoid splitting bitcoin into two assets, at least 51 percent of bitcoin\'s mining hashrate needs to support the change. Otherwise it will be the ""shortest"" chain with less computing power and its blocks will be rejected by the rest of the mining pools.\n\nIt’s hard to know how many mining pools have upgraded to support the change, s ince it’s not information.\n\nThe more miners that support the soft fork, the better. This diminishes the likelihood of certain attacks and network disruption as mining pools shift to the new rules.\n\nIn some cases, such as the code change P2SH, this shift to the new soft fork rules occurred via a ""flag day,"" also known as a ""user-activated soft fork"" (UASF).\n\nA UASF works like this: Developers, nodes and businesses, set a ""day"" (actually a block number) that\'s, say, six months or a year into the future. At that time, upgraded nodes will enforce the new rules and reject blocks that don\'t support them.\n\nIn theory, mining pools will generally opt to upgrade for fear of losing the block rewards that come with enforcing the rules and adding blocks (worth about $33,000 today).\n\nHowever, this process hasn\'t been trouble-free. Some miners haven\'t been properly prepared in the past, and have lost block rewards in the process.\n\nBecause of this, developers developed a system that requires 95 percent of bitcoin\'s miners to ""signal"" that they are prepared for the change. (The second iteration of this idea, which allows for multiple soft forks to be deployed at once, is Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 9.)\n\nThat\'s why bitcoin mining pools have signaled for soft fork upgrades for the past several years.\n\nClash of code\n\nA few recent competing scaling proposals have involved mining pools.\n\nMost take the form of what\'s called a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), and there are many that have been in a state of flux of late. Some even rely on each other in order to bring about changes.\n\nBIP 141, created by developers for users and miners seeks to introduce Segregated Witness (SegWit), uses BIP 9. BIP 141\'s rules require 95 percent of mining pools to signal support for SegWit before activating the change.\n\nBut, unlike older changes, most mining pools didn’t signal support for BIP 141. It stalled at 30 percent of miner support for a while. Some mining pools indicated they did so to negotiate for a 2MB block size parameter increase. Others suggested that some mining pools had an incentive to ""block"" the change to make more money.\n\n(Interestingly, this ""veto power"" is a possibility that some developers raised much earlier.)\n\nSome in the community were not happy that SegWit stalled, believing that BIP 141 would improve bitcoin and that mining pools were overstepping their job description. So, in the hopes of pushing SegWit through, many users and developers rallied around the older ""flag day"" concept, since it doesn\'t require the ""approval"" of mining pools.\n\nThe proposal, BIP 148, is slated for August 1. A majority of mining pools would need to support the change, for the reasons described above.\n\nBIP 91 was ultimately perceived as a sort of compromise between those two changes, one that kept miners in the driver\'s seat.\n\nThe BIP 9 dilemma\n\nWhile BIP 9 is a recently-introduced mechanism for making upgrades to bitcoin, some developers already want to get rid of it.\n\nSome claim it was intended as a way of protecting miners – so they wouldn\'t lose their block rewards if a soft fork went through and their blocks were rejected by the rest of miners.\n\nLike some users, some developers don\'t like that mining pools used the signaling mechanism as a way to stop code changes that otherwise had broad agreement from bitcoin users.\n\nBlockstream developer Rusty Russell, a former Linux kernel developer and one of the creators of BIP 9, went as far as to publicly apologize for his role in creating this possibility.\n\n""I hadn\'t expected that this checkpoint would be used as a chokepoint to ransom the network,"" he added before advocating for a UASF.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nGiven this controversy, what role will miners play in upgrading bitcoin down the road?\n\nIt\'s unclear. BIP 9 had wide support from developers before it prompted political disagreements.\n\nSome developers still seem to favor so-called ""miner-activated soft forks"" as a less disruptive option, but now some developers, such as Russell, seem more inclined to advocate for UASFs.\n\nSo, perhaps both options will be on the table for future upgrades.\n\nWhatever the case, miners are important players who will continue to have some influence in future bitcoin code changes.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which acted as organizer for the SegWit2x proposal and has an ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nBitcoins on computer chips image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

On the other side, are miners who want to increase the size of blocks to make the network faster.\n\nIn order to find some middle ground, some business executives and miners came up with a proposal known as SegWit2x. And up until a couple days ago, it looked like nearly everyone was on board with SegWit2x.\n\nThat was until bitcoin cash, an alternative to both the original bitcoin and the SegWit2x version, entered from stage left.\n\n""Bitcoin cash basically came out of nowhere,"" Charlie Morris, the chief investment officer of NextBlock Global, an investment firm with digital assets, told Business Insider.""A group of miners who didn\'t like SegWit2x are going to opt for this new software that will increase the size of blocks from the current 1 megabyte to 8.""\n\nAs a result, a split in bitcoin on August 1, the deadline for Segwit2x implementation, appears to be very likely.\n\nThe majority of the 470 people who have placed bets on Bodog are convinced the price of bitcoin will fall after August 1, according to company spokesperson Ed Pownell.\n\n""310 people think the price will dip below $2,000 per coin,"" he said.""The rest think it will be over $2,500.""\n\nNo one placing bets on Bodog thinks the price will range from $2,000 and $2,500 after the August 1 deadline.\n\n""It\'s a bit like a soccer match, people hate backing the draw,"" Pownell said. ""The middle isn\'t where people want to be.""\n\nThe price of bitcoin has been on a tear as of late, up near $900 since mid-July.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>', 'Yesterday, July 27, the signaling stage about the Segregated Witness protocol, SegWit, BIP 141, was activated.\n\nThe protocol will be fixed, if at least 95% of the blocks - 1916 out of 2016 - signal at this stage in support of SegWit. In turn, this will provide the conditions for activating the scaling BIP 141 offer.\n\nThe lock-in period will end around August 8.\n\nPrice reaction\n\nAs you can see from the graph, 4H time frame, the price reacted positively to the news.\n\nCurrently, the average price is about $2810. The highest price is indicated on the Korean exchange - $2848 per 1 BTC, the second highest is on the Chinese exchange - $2837.\n\nAfter consolidation on a large volume near the support zone - $ 2,400, which supports the market and does not allow it to go below since June 17, Bitcoin price showed a sign of strength in the form of a long candle.\n\nThe main culmination will take place just near the current resistance level $2770.\n\nWith a further positive development of events about SegWit decisions, the price will form a hinge - an absorption of all sellers - in the area of the current resistance and will go up to the highs of the last month.\n\nOn July 23 the proposal of BIP 91 was activated. It is an important step towards the activation of the Segregated Witness solution. BIP 91 is aimed to optimize Bitcoin blocks and solve network scalability issues.', 'USDT\\BTC\n\nBitcoin price is adjusting to the downward movement from $2,926. The minimum correction goal has been completed. On July 26, analyzing the largest trading volume and pending orders, the most likely correction peak to the downward movement was identified. And as a result, Bitcoin price is stuck at the bottom of the most trading volume graph.\n\nRight now there is three possible course of events:\n\nForm a hidden reversal and continue to grow to at least $2,926. The price has to form a U-turn up at the peak of the current growth of $2,740.\n\nGenerate a full rollback to large volumes. In this case, the price should not fall below $2,570. Otherwise, it will mean there is no major buyer in an upward trend.\n\nForm a reversal wave down and continue falling.\n\nUSDT\\ETH\n\nEthereum is still traded at the peak of the $240 downward trend. The price did not form a pullback to this fall but moved as a flat. Since July 26, there has been no significant growth in demand. This way the correction target for the downward movement is getting closer to $208 flat. This key level confirms the large volume of orders for sale.\n\nFor the trend to continue, it needs to exit the flat that has been formed. The upper border is the likely turning point for growth to at least $230. Ethereum needs to turn up to $208. Otherwise, there will be a rebound and the price might form another flat wave down.\n\nUSDT\\XRP\n\nRipple price has also formed a flat at downward trend peak from $0.2080. The demand volume has not shown any significant growth. However, the supply volume indicates a sharp increase at the latest peak point, $0.1680. This means the fall will continue.\n\nFor a more accurate confirmation, Ripple needs to exit the $0.1660 to $0.1780 flat. A large number of orders both for purchase and sale are found on those borders. Therefore, to arrange short-term growth to $ 0.1980, XRP must form a turn up on the upper border of $0.1780 flat. This will show the buyers’ benefits.\n\nUSDT\\LTC\n\nLitecoin price is finishing its $47 pullback of the downward trend. There’s also been a sharp increase in demand, see the diagram. All the signs there’s a major buyer, purchasing at the peak.\n\nFor more confident growth, it is necessary to make a turn at $42.7, large orders for sale point. Then the chances are the price will grow to $ 46.5, at least $42.7\n\nUSDT\\ETC\n\nEthereum Classic price couldn’t form more significant pullback to the downtrend from $17.6. The volume diagram shows that the supply is bigger than the demand. It definitely means buyers find themselves in a weak position right now, but it doesn’t mean it will last long.\n\nThe downward trend will go on until there is a turning point. Right now, $14.9 point is the key level. The downtrend structure might break, in case the upward turn takes place and an increase to $16 is highly anticipated. If there’s no turn at $14.9, it will mean the sellers still hold the advantage.', ""In Brief 2017 has been a stellar year for cryptocurrencies as a whole, but Bitcoin is still the de facto leader in terms of popularity and market cap. However, several characteristics inherent to Litecoin could give it the ability to challenge Bitcoin's domination in the crypto market.\n\nWhile Bitcoin currently leads the cryptocurrency market in terms of adoption and market cap, some argue that other, newer cryptos are actually a better investment. Once proposed alternative is Litecoin. Sometimes referred to as the “silver Bitcoin,” this altcoin could prove superior based on four factors.\n\nFirst, Litecoin’s algorithm is far simpler than Bitcoin’s, which makes it easier to run on graphics processing units (GPUs). This results in a lower barrier to entry for Litecoin miners in comparison to Bitcoin.\n\nSecond, Litecoin has a faster block generation speed. Processing a Litecoin block takes two-and-a-half minutes as opposed to Bitcoin’s 10. This decreases transaction fees, making the Litecoin cryptocurrency more attractive to investors.\n\nThird, Litecoin is about to launch a “lightning network” that will improve its already superior ability to adapt to changes. This network will make it easier for Litecoin to scale as it gains more traction.\n\nFourth, Litecoin’s lifetime cap is higher than Bitcoin’s (84 million coins as opposed to 24 million). Once this cap is reached, miners will no longer be a part of the process, and this could decrease the security and stability of the blockchain supporting each currency.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies in general are increasing in popularity, the individual variants are constantly vying for market dominance. Perhaps Litecoin will come out on top, or perhaps it won’t — the primary characteristic shared by all cryptocurrencies right now is volatility, and only time will tell how the crypto market ultimately plays out.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets.

07/29/2017,"['Last week the bitcoin community and investors breathed a sigh of relief as BIP 91 locked in and activated, signalling what we thought was a great step forward in finally resolving the long standing Bitcoin scaling debate. Confidence soared and the price recovered from a previous tumble.\n\nAnd then came a twist.\n\nIn the last 72 hours, Bitcoin increasingly looks as though it is heading for a user activated hard fork (UAHF) called Bitcoin Cash. It is scheduled for the notorious date of 1 August 2017, previously earmarked as the proposed date for implementation of SegWit by way of a user activated soft fork (UASF).\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Cash is an alternative token that may come into existence as a result of a planned UAHF as mentioned above. Essentially this means that the Bitcoin blockchain may split into two competing chains.\n\nThe original plan for a UAHF came about from a contingency plan, proposed by Bitcoin mining company, Bitmain, who were opposed to the UASF for SegWit.\n\nAt the Future of Bitcoin Conference held in Arnhem, Netherlands from 29 June to 1 July this year, a software engineer named Amaury Sechet announced an alternative Bitcoin client (software) called Bitcoin Adjustable Blocksize Cap (Bitcoin ABC).\n\nIt has now been revealed that the token for this client is Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBitcoin Cash will differ from Bitcoin in terms of the following:\n\nSegWit: Bitcoin Cash will not implement SegWit\n\nBitcoin Cash will not implement SegWit Blocksize: Immediate increase from 1MB to 8MB\n\nImmediate increase from 1MB to 8MB Coexistence: Replay and wipe out protections ensures that should the two chains continue to compete, Bitcoin Cash aims to reduce user disruption and allows for the safe existence of two chains.\n\nHow Does This Impact Your BTC Holdings?\n\nIn short, it does not affect your BTC balance. Instead a chain split will result in you holding an equal number of coins on both the old and new chains, however, the value of those coins will be different and probably vary dramatically as they establish themselves as either the majority or minority chain.\n\nThe Community Reaction\n\nMiners\n\nStatements released thus far by a number of mining pools, including Bitmain, have said they will continue to support SegWit2x and the original Bitcoin chain, and do not rule out supporting the Bitcoin Cash chain as well. ViaBTC, an exchange as well as a Bitcoin mining pool (ViaPool) have listed Bitcoin Cash futures and have explicitly stated their mining support for the chain.\n\nExchanges\n\nExchanges seem to be more divided than the mining pools. Some major exchanges such as Coinbase, Coinfloor and Bitstamp are not signalling any strong support for Bitcoin Cash and have left the crediting of the forked coins to their discretion. On the other hand, Bitfinex and Kraken, two other major Bitcoin exchanges, have announced that they will be crediting the forked coins to client accounts and will list the coin for trading. This could be vital to the coins survival as without any trusted exchanges listing the coin, there would be no market for it.\n\nAs we quickly approach 1 August 2017, a day that will long be spoken about in the Bitcoin community, the Bitcoin price will likely be volatile and an influx of opinions will generate a degree of hysteria amongst unseasoned Bitcoin investors.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""This week, one of Bitcoin’s largest and most notorious coin exchanges was brought down by law enforcement — and police and prosecutors are now beginning to explain why. On Thursday, the Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against Alexander Vinnik — thought to be the operator, or one of the operators of Bitcoin exchange BTC-e — charging him with 21 counts of money laundering and other related financial crimes. The counts range from operating an unlicensed money transmittal business to a variety of money laundering charges, including laundering associated with ransomware payouts and a theft from the now-defunct Mt Gox exchange. More generally, the indictment paints BTC-e as a hub of criminal activity, laundering the proceeds of everything from drug trafficking to ransomware attacks.\n\nAs some suspected, Vinnik’s alleged crimes go beyond just operating the exchange. Feds believe he played a role in the theft of more 800,000 bitcoin — about $400 million at the time — from Mt. Gox, a staggering loss that ultimately shuttered the exchange. According to the indictment, 530,000 of those bitcoin ended up passing through wallets controlled by or associated with Vinnik, although his role in the larger scheme remains unclear.\n\nVinnik’s alleged crimes go beyond just operating a Bitcoin exchange\n\nVinnik himself is in custody, arrested while on vacation in Greece, but the Bitcoin world is still sorting through the larger implications of his arrest. BTC-e was one of the last major exchanges outside the reach of conventional finance, and now that it’s gone, it’s unclear what might replace it. There are many legitimate uses of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin transactions have also become essential for online crime — whether it’s ransomware or Silk-Road-style online marketplaces. There will continue to be demand for exchanges like BTC-e, and with feds directly targeting exchanges that don’t play by the book, the split between the two halves of Bitcoin is becoming starker and starker.\n\nBTC-e, founded in 2011, always stood out as an anomaly among the major Bitcoin exchanges. Even a cursory look at BTC-e flagged it as a little strange. “Their exchange prices always seemed weird and out of line with every other exchange, and I had wondered why,” Matthew Green, a professor at Johns Hopkins University told The Verge in an email.\n\nNicholas Weaver wrote at Lawfare that BTC-e was noted for its “sketchy ownership and control.” The exchange was supposedly located in Eastern Europe, but there were no clues as to who ran it — until now.\n\n300,000 bitcoin from Mt. Gox went to wallets tied to “BTC-e administrative accounts”\n\nBut the big surprise in the indictment is how closely tied BTC-e is to a massive theft at Mt. Gox, one that eventually bankrupted the exchange in 2014. Founded in 2010, Mt. Gox dominated the Bitcoin world for years, at one point processing 80 percent of all bitcoin-to-currency transactions. Mt. Gox first suffered a multimillion-dollar theft in June 2011. When the exchange collapsed in 2014, the equivalent of nearly half a billion dollars was unaccounted for.\n\nOn Wednesday, in the wake of the arrest of Vinnik, WizSec published a blogpost presenting the findings of an investigation into the Mt. Gox thefts that they have apparently been preparing for years. According to WizSec, the Mt. Gox hot wallet private keys were stolen sometime in 2011, and the hacker (or multiple hackers) continued to steal bitcoin through 2012 and 2013. The bitcoin were laundered through wallets controlled by Alexander Vinnik. The indictment claims that 300,000 bitcoin were stolen from Mt. Gox went directly to three connected BTC-e accounts “directly linked” to “BTC-e administrative accounts” that only BTC-e admins and operators could have had access to. At least one of the accounts — under the name “Vamnedam” — was controlled by Vinnik and “others known and unknown.” (The “others known” are either not named in the indictment or have been redacted from the published document.)\n\nMany of the charges allege more straightforward money laundering\n\nMore bitcoin from the theft were sent to other Mt. Gox wallets and wallets at a third exchange — the now-defunct Tradehill, which operated out of San Francisco, California. From there, they eventually ended up at BTC-e, in an account that was directly controlled by Vinnik.\n\nWizSec also claims that the wallets that laundered Mt. Gox coins also handled “coins stolen from Bitcoinica, Bitfloor and several other thefts from back in 2011 and 2012.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether Vinnik was directly involved in the Mt. Gox theft, or how close he is to any of those previous thefts, or even the CryptoWall ransomware hackers whose funds he is accused of laundering. But when it comes to Mt. Gox, at least, BTC-e’s proximity to the theft is fairly suspicious.\n\n“Anybody who thought about this for a second understood that law enforcement was working on a case against BTC-e”\n\nWhile the Mt. Gox allegations are the most eye-catching, many of the charges that brought down BTC-e allege more straightforward money laundering. The very first count listed in the indictment is for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business: a criminal charge based on failing to register with FinCEN, an intelligence network that’s mandatory for all financial companies dealing with US customers.\n\nParticipating in FinCEN comes with a range of requirements, from registration to internal anti-money laundering programs. Since 2013, it’s been clear that Bitcoin exchanges had to follow those same rules, and for the most part, exchanges have complied — and prosecutors haven’t been shy about filing charges against services that don’t. In recent years, BTC-e has been the largest Bitcoin exchange not registered with FinCEN, a distinction that made it an obvious target for law enforcement, even without Vinnik’s alleged Mt. Gox involvement.\n\n“Anybody who thought about this for a second understood that law enforcement was working on a case against BTC-e,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center. “The question was just whether the government would catch them.”\n\n“designed so that criminals could effect financial transactions under multiple layers of anonymity”\n\nWhere other counts in the indictment focus on money transfers linked to theft and ransomware, the first two — operation of an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiracy to commit money-laundering — focus on the technological capabilities of BTC-e itself, claiming that the exchange had a “criminal design.”\n\n“BTC-e’s system was designed so that criminals could accomplish financial transactions with anonymity and thereby avoid apprehension by law enforcement or seizure of funds,” the indictment says, pointing out that BTC-e only required “a username, password, and an email address,” unlike “legitimate payment processors or digital currency exchangers.” The indictment also points to suspicious usernames like “ISIS,” “CocaineCowboys,” “blackhathackers,” “dzkillerhacker,” and “hacker4hire” as additional support for the money-laundering allegations.\n\nThe language in the indictment about BTC-e’s “criminal design” mimics the indictment against Liberty Reserve — an anonymous currency service taken down by law enforcement in 2013 — which also accused the online exchange of having a “criminal design” and a system “designed so that criminals could effect financial transactions under multiple layers of anonymity.” (The Liberty Reserve indictment also took the time to point out that account names on the site included “Russia Hackers” and “Hacker Accounts.”)\n\nBTC-e’s website claimed that they required customers to provide proof of identity — namely, a scanned ID card and a scanned utility bill or bank statement — and forbid any US customers, letting them off the hook for FinCEN registration. But neither turned out to be true, according to the indictment.\n\n“Exchanges will go one of two ways. Either they’ll clean up their act... or they’ll go fully underground.”\n\nNow that BTC-e is down for good, it could have a profound impact on the criminal ecosystem more broadly. BTC-e handled about 5 percent of total Bitcoin transactions, but recent research found that as much as 95 percent of ransomware cashouts happened through the platform. With most comparably sized exchanges already registered under FinCEN, the takedown could make it both harder and riskier for criminals to cash out — something law enforcement seems to be counting on. In the same Lawfare piece, Weaver says he thinks taking down BTC-e “will probably prove more important than the AlphaBay and Hansa takedowns” in fighting online crime.\n\nFor Bitcoiners less invested in law enforcement’s war on dark web marketplaces, the lesson is a more ambiguous one. Cornell professor Emin Gun Sirer says the focus on FinCEN compliance could lead to a lasting split in Bitcoin markets, as exchanges face the choice of whether to comply with US government demands.\n\n“Exchanges will go one of two ways,” Sirer says. “Either they will clean their act, by first shopping for the most lenient jurisdictions and complying with relevant KYC/AML laws, or they'll go ‘fully underground,’ and operate with no rules, behind Tor and other anonymous communication technologies. The most colorful drama ahead will involve exchanges, such as Bitfinex, that operate in the gray zone, where they seem to neither comply with relevant laws nor go fully underground.”\n\nFor a technology with a surrounding community built on libertarian ideas, that may be a difficult pill to swallow. But as the past week has made clear, those that don’t will be taking a very serious risk."", 'Europian Union countries are exploring the idea of imposing an EU-wide account freeze measure to prevent potential bank runs. Could Bitcoin provide a viable alternative to secure depositors’ funds?\n\nPreventing the Chaos\n\nEuropean Union states have proposed a new measure which would effectively allow them to freeze bank accounts before a bank run takes place. The measure was planned earlier this year in order to prevent bank runs similar to that of Banco Popular last month. The proposal wants to prevent depositors from pushing over the edge banks that are already failing or will likely fail.\n\nAccording to EU rules, each depositor that has less than 100,000 euros deposited in a bank account is insured from a bank run. But under the new plan, a potential bank run could force the supervisors to freeze bank accounts of all depositors, and thus freeze withdraws from bank accounts.\n\nCharlie Bannister, of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), noted following:\n\nWe strongly believe that this would incentivize depositors to run from a bank at an early stage,\n\nCountries that already have a moratorium on bank payouts, like Germany, have strongly supported this new plan. According to a person familiar with German government’s thinking:\n\nThe desire is to prevent a bank run, so that when a bank is in a critical situation it is not pushed over the edge,\n\nThe Bitcoin Effect\n\nBack in 2013, Cyprus’ banking crisis was a hair’s breadth away from a total economic collapse. Cypriot banks were desperate for a bailout from the EU and IMF and many account holders feared that their deposits would vanish. This fear caused a classic bank run and people were rushing to banks and ATMs in order to withdraw as much money as they could.\n\nInevitably, cash became scarce and the ATMs stopped working. Many saw Bitcoin as the last option to secure their funds. The crazy demand from Cyprus for Bitcoin caused the digital currency’s value to rise from $47 to $88 – an increase of over 88 percent! With the EU’s new proposal, many believe that Bitcoin can once again be a safe way for depositors to secure their funds from a bank run.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this new proposal? Do you think that it will prevent bank runs? Will Bitcoin be able to save depositors again from a bank run? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nImage courtesy of Pexels', 'Sometimes when there’s a huge drop in bitcoin’s price traders called “bitcoin whales” are blamed for dumping on the market. Bitcoin whales are individuals or groups who hold vast quantities of bitcoins and can sometimes sway the market towards their preferential price. These market movers have been around since the early days – ‘shaking out weak hands’ many times over the years – but have also failed their missions at times as well.\n\nAlso read: Following Money Through the Bitcoin Laundry Is Not So Easy\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Whale?\n\nIf you trade bitcoins or altcoins, you’ve probably heard the term “whale” before as the name is used to describe big cryptocurrency holders. The term is used this way because whales are the biggest creatures in the ocean and they can overpower smaller fish with their large size. Bitcoin whales are looked at similarly because their extensive holdings can affect large schools of smaller traders with just a few successful trading methods. Additionally the smaller the market and less liquidity means whales can devastate smaller altcoin markets way more easily than bitcoin. We also assume that Satoshi Nakamoto may be the biggest whale of all as the creator allegedly owns 1 million bitcoins.\n\nRinse and Repeat\n\nThere are many trading maneuvers whales use to profit, like using a trading tactic commonly called the ’rinse and repeat cycle.’ The rinse trade is used in many types of markets and can be effective if timed correctly and very profitable if you are a bitcoin whale. The trader with a lot of holdings starts selling bitcoins lower than the market rate which at times can cause a panic sell off by small-time traders. The trick is the whale sold just below the current market value and just enough to watch panic ensue. Then the whale waits and watches the panic selling take place until the bitcoin price reaches a new low. At this point, the whales quickly scoop up way more bitcoins than they first started with and after the ‘rinse’ they usually ‘repeat’ this type of trade often. People speculate that there are many ways whales can throw their ‘BTC weight’ around to either push the price up or down to accumulate more bitcoins. Further, whales are not just individuals and can be an organization like a bitcoin investment fund as well.\n\nUtilizing Buy and Sell Walls\n\nWhales in a sense don’t even have to trade their bitcoins to affect the market as they can also bluff with buy and sell walls. In cryptocurrency markets, exchanges use an order book to facilitate trades where a buyer can set up an order to buy or sell at a specified price other than the spot price. For instance, if the market drops traders will usually buy at a lower bid and sell if the price reaches a higher level. In order to place an order in the exchange’s order book, you have to legitimately own enough funds to cover the order. This means a whale and even smaller traders in many ways can bluff and make it seem like a buy or sell walls exist. However, often times large buy and sell walls disappear just before the price gets close enough because a big player was just bluffing. Nevertheless many buy and sell walls are very real and can change the odds rather quickly if they manage to liquidate someone’s assets.\n\nOTC Markets and Dark Pools\n\nSometimes whales don’t purchase or sell on traditional exchanges because their holdings or orders could cause a stir in the market. For cryptocurrencies over the counter trading (OTC) or “dark pools” is where big buyers and institutional traders can purchase vast amounts of bitcoins without being seen by the public eye. Dark pools are similar to OTC trading as they are usually found on exchanges that enable ‘off the record’ trades which ensures a whale’s moves are more private. Typically OTC markets and dark pools only allow traders who purchase an abundant amount of bitcoin at one time and set minimums for entry.\n\nThe Infamous Bear Whale\n\nBack in October of 2014, there was an event where a massive bitcoin whale liquidated 30,000 bitcoins for $300 a piece. Many traders and speculators thought it would wreck the market at the time but instead, the order was ripped through by buyers and bitcoin’s price subsequently rose to $375. The event was remembered forever, and the trader will forever be known as the “bear whale.” The 30,000 BTC order was also recorded on video alongside many memes and graphics depicting the epic slaying of this gigantic whale. Many bitcoiners felt victorious that day in October because a whale of that size failed to sway the market.\n\nWhales Are Often Blamed for Big Market Shake Outs\n\nWhales have been discussed in the bitcoin space for quite some time, and they are usually blamed for unexplainable market phenomenon. Further, there are a lot of conversations across bitcoin forums asking the question — How many bitcoins does it take to be a whale? It seems the answer varies from 1,000 bitcoins to 10,000 bitcoins according to multiple threads on Bitcointalk.org and Reddit. Many people believe that whales can still affect the market due to bitcoin’s relatively small market capitalization where multi-million dollar orders can still shake things up. As bitcoin markets become stronger and gain more liquidity, speculators believe it now takes bigger bitcoin whales to shift the trading waters.\n\nWhat do you think about bitcoin whales?

What does the current growth actually mean? Where will the price go after Aug. 1?\n\nHow scaling influenced the price\n\nFor several months, the main topic of discussion has been the hard fork case. In early July, before SegWit2x implementation, Bitcoin price dropped significantly from $2,600 to $1,600. But less than a week before the transition, we see a price rise from $1,835, along with an increase in demand. The main bulk of purchases are concentrated at the $2,000 mark. Strong growth from the peak of long-term correction suggests that there is support for investors. The $2,300 level shows us the next confirmation for the uptrend and the price settles. If you evaluate the demand, you’ll see that its volume is much larger, compared to July 13, when Bitcoin was trading at the same levels. The large buyer holds its main positions at $2,000, $2,300 and $2,500, which is backed by the price rise before SegWit2x.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nTo determine what will happen with the uptrend from $1,835, we need to define the point where a large buyer can emerge from the trend or fix profits. Thus, if there is no support for the trend and a large player fixes profits, the fall is almost inevitable. The $2,500 point will be a turning one because this is the exact point where the largest volume of purchases from $1,835 is concentrated. You can also see a large amount of pending buy orders at this point. Therefore, if the current growth is supported, there will be no turn down at the $2,500 point. Then it is very likely the price will go up more than $3,000. At the same time, in the case of turn at $2,500, Bitcoin might break down to $2,000, or lower.\n\nMost likely scenarios\n\nThere is a possibility of a price correction to the $2,500 level before Aug. 1. In case this happens with no downtrend reversal, Bitcoin is likely to go over $3,000.', 'US District Judge Kenneth Marra has ordered Paul Vernon, the former CEO of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy, to pay $8.2 mln in damages to their customers.\n\nIn his July 27, 2017, default court order, Marra ruled that Vernon is guilty in the long-running class action case filed against him and the exchange.\n\nPart of Marra’s order reads:\n\n""The Court further declares that the 11,325.0961 [Bitcoin] which were stolen from Cryptsy customers on July 29, 2014, and which, as of the date of this final judgment ... are property of the Plaintiff Class and subject to and encompassed within this Final Judgment.""\n\nIn his comment on the order, Attorney David Silver, a representative of one of the two law offices involved in the lawsuit, stated that those who represented the claimants in the case were elated to have obtained a historic success.\n\n""This order is a big step in the path towards vindication and justice for our clients in the cryptocurrency world who were taken advantage of by an exchange operator they trusted with their hard-earned funds.""\n\nBackground\n\nIn early 2015, the then-struggling exchange Cryptsy has announced that it could file for bankruptcy as it is already insolvent due to a hacking incident that cost it around 13,000 Bitcoin and about 300,000 Litecoin. The exchange claimed that unless the funds are recovered or an investor can cover the losses, its site will be shuttered and it will declare bankruptcy.\n\nIn early 2016, the exchange has collapsed and its customers have filed a class action lawsuit with the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida shortly afterwards. In April 2016, the court has ultimately placed the exchange into receivership.\n\nMeanwhile, Vernon has failed to respond promptly to the allegations in court, which led to the default ruling. He is believed to be presently hiding in one of the countries in Asia.', 'World boxing champion Floyd Mayweather expects that he will make lots of money from the scheduled ICO by Stox.com.\n\nIn his recent Instagram post, the undefeated boxer said that he will greatly profit from the ICO.\n\nIn the post, the undefeated boxer mainly promoted his upcoming boxing match against UFC mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor on August 26. He was seen in front of a table filled with 25 stacks of hundred dollar bills in a place that looks to be inside a private jet in the post.\n\nPart of his post reads:\n\n“I’m gonna make a $hit t$n of money on August 26th. I’m gonna make a $hit t$n of money on August 2nd on the Stox.com ICO.”\n\nJust a promotional gimmick?\n\nStox.com (STX) is a Bancor-based open source prediction market platform that is built on the digital currency Ethereum. STX holders are expected to benefit from continuous liquidity, automatic price calculation and the direct conversion of STX to ETH without the need to depend on exchanges.\n\nIn the ICO, the company aims to raise $30 mln from investors. With the endorsement from the flamboyant Mayweather, the ICO is expected to attract thousands of first-time investors.\n\nDespite his promotion of the ICO, it is not yet sure if Mayweather will actually invest his money in the platform. However, if his action is just part of a deal to endorse the event, then, he is attracting the interest of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as these agencies are aggressively cracking down on unreported endorsements lately.\n\nIt is also interesting to see if Mayweather’s endorsement will lead to a resounding success of the ICO.\n\nOther celebrities publicly supporting Bitcoin\n\nMayweather is not the only celebrity who’s publicly involved in cryptocurrency investments. In fact, Bollywood celebrities such as Shilpa Shetty, Raj Kundra, Huma Qureshi, Neha Dhupia, Vir Das, Nargis Fakhri and Prachi Desai have also shared their interest in Bitcoin.\n\nAdding “Crypto Currency for Beginners” to my reading list! Thanks @amitbitcoin for enlightening me on Bitcoin investing #amitbhardwaj — SHILPA SHETTY KUNDRA (@TheShilpaShetty) July 7, 2017', 'Walk into the Amante coffee shop at 2850 Baseline Road in Boulder on any given morning and you’ll see what looks like an automated teller machine sitting along one wall.\n\nThroughout the day, a handful of people use it. One is a techie, another is a well-dressed, middle-aged couple. But this is not your grandmother’s ATM. It’s a Bitcoin teller machine, a portal into the brave new world of cryptocurrency.\n\nSome call this new kind of money the grandest experiment of our time. Others fear its rising power and the rest of us have no idea what the heck it is.\n\nBoulder’s Eric Weissmann was fascinated early on with the potential of digital currency. And when the opportunity arose to own and operate Bitcoin teller machines, or BTMs, he jumped in and founded Modern Tender. Weissmann thought the architecture of the code, the blockchain, had the potential to transform currency markets.\n\n“I was interested in Bitcoin and thought the blockchain technology was revolutionary, so I wanted a foothold in the space. We reached out to Amante because we wanted a location that was upscale, easily accessible, and attractive to early adopters and the tech demographic,” Weissmann said.\n\nBTMs are still rare. There are 13 statewide, including two in Boulder — Weissmann’s at Amante Coffee and a second machine in the Spark Boulder tech accelerator at 1310 College Ave.\n\nThe two BTMs in Boulder were installed in February of 2015. The Spark machine is owned by Aurora-based XBTeller. Officials there could not be reached for comment.\n\nOperating outside the traditional banking system with no regulatory oversight, BTMs have experienced a surge in use as more people turn to cryptocurrencies as a haven from political instability and distrust of government-backed currencies.\n\nTo read more of this story go to dailycamera.com', 'When it comes to regulation, what exactly is a cryptocurrency?\n\nIs it a currency? Is it a piece of software? Is it more like an equity? And if it is an equity, does that mean it should be regulated like any other security?\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently weighed in…\n\nHow regulators like the SEC define and treat cryptocurrencies is important because it affects both the value of cryptocurrencies, and how likely it is that blockchain technology will thrive in a particular jurisdiction.\n\nFor example, if a country’s regulatory body decides that cryptocurrencies should be banned, then this will drag down prices (depending on the size of the country) and blockchain technology companies will avoid setting up shop or investing there – they won’t feel welcome.\n\nThe SEC has been notably quiet on the subject of cryptocurrencies. Other regulatory bodies and governments, primarily in Asia, have been extremely proactive in outlining how they will treat and regulate bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as an asset class.\n\nIn May, I told you that the SEC would eventually step into this market. “Especially as the financial stakes increase.”\n\nNow, it looks like the SEC is on the ball.\n\nInvestigating the DAO\n\nEarlier this week, the SEC issued the results of an investigative report into the details surrounding a cryptocurrency initial coin offering (ICO) called the “DAO” in the first half of 2016.\n\nAn ICO is when a new cryptocurrency token is offered for sale to the public, similar to an initial public offering (IPO) in the stock market.\n\nThe DAO intended to be a fully decentralised cryptocurrency venture capital fund. It would raise money (in the form of a cryptocurrency called ether), issuing DAO tokens in return. It would then allocate those raised ether funds to various business ventures by way of voting amongst the DAO token holders.\n\nThe DAO raised US$150 million worth of ether from some 11,000 investors. But then disaster struck. Despite assertions that the DAO’s code had been analysed by “one of the world’s leading security audit companies” and that “no stone was left unturned during those five whole days of security analysis”, DAO was hacked. US$50 million of ether was stolen.\n\nThe SEC’s investigative report wasn’t about trying to identify the culprit behind the attack. Instead, it was focused on whether or not DAO tokens constituted a security (that is, a stock) and should therefore be regulated under existing securities laws.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies securities?\n\nThe straightforward answer is maybe. The fact is, every cryptocurrency token has its own attributes.\n\nAs the SEC report put it;\n\n“U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular [cryptocurrency] offer or sale.”\n\nIn other words, it just depends. But on what?\n\nTo answer that, we turn to the “Howey Test”, which was created by the Supreme Court as a means of determining whether certain transactions qualify as “investment contracts”.\n\n[The test refers to a precedent from a case the SEC levied against Florida companies W. J. Howey Co. and Howey-in-the-Hills Service, Inc. that sought to determine whether or not a particular land-related deal constituted an “investment contract” under the Securities Act of 1933.]\n\nIf certain transactions meet the criteria, then they are deemed “securities” and subject to a raft of regulatory requirements.\n\nWithout going through all the checks, I’ll just include some of the pertinent ones that the SEC included in its report.\n\nDAO investors invested money…\n\n“Money” doesn’t necessarily mean cash. Whilst investors used ether to buy DAO tokens, the ether itself constitutes an “exchange of value”. …with a reasonable expectation of profit…\n\nThe DAO was a for-profit entity that sought to fund projects, targeting a return on its investment. These positive returns constitute “profit” in that it would have increased the value of the DAO tokens. …derived from the managerial efforts of others.\n\nGiven the marketing and active engagement with the community from the DAO founders, investors in the DAO had a reasonable expectation that these individuals would provide management and oversight of the entity.\n\nSo, investing money (cryptocurrencies included) in a token with an expectation of profit (dividend or simple value increase) derived from the managerial efforts of other people points to a cryptocurrency being a security, and that it’s required to be regulated as such.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe report was a warning. The SEC stated that charges would not be brought against anybody involved with the DAO. But that the report serves to “caution the industry and market participants”.\n\nGiven that there are no charges to be brought against the DAO, it’s likely that existing cryptocurrencies are safe from securities regulation for now, although that won’t be the case for long. The primary focus of the SEC will be newcomers to the market, with the starting point being the “Howey Test” criteria, some of which are listed above.\n\nThere has been little to no impact on the broader cryptocurrency market from this report from the SEC. As someone who’s personally been involved in the cryptocurrency token distribution process, the “Howey Test” is already a key component of any legal diligence on a cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, some cryptocurrencies are flying a little too close to the sun, especially those that specify dividend-style payouts for token holders. The SEC is very clear that just because something is “virtual”, it doesn’t exempt it from being a security.\n\nAnd when cryptocurrencies inevitably start falling under SEC jurisdiction, investors (particularly U.S. investors) will need to ensure that whatever they are buying is compliant with U.S. securities laws.\n\nSo you shouldn’t invest in cyrptocurrencies on the assumption that they aren’t (or won’t ever) be deemed securities. And when you evaluate different blockchain companies that issue their own cryptocurrencies, check the characteristics against those “Howey Test” criteria.\n\nSEC regulation was always expected to occur sooner or later, and this SEC report didn’t contain anything out of the ordinary – it really just reiterated the criteria with which cyrptocurrencies will be measured with when it comes to regulation.\n\nBut I suspect we will start to see more global cryptocurrency offerings that specifically prohibit U.S. investors because nobody likes having to deal with U.S. regulations if they can avoid it.\n\nStill, I don’t envision this having any big impacts on general cryptocurrency prices in the immediate future.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\n\nRead the original article on Stansberry Churchouse Research.

07/30/2017,"['Bitcoin traders may soon be able to bet on their preferred version of the blockchain.\n\nAs if a years-long debate over the network\'s technical roadmap wasn\'t dramatic enough, Tuesday could see yet another twist in bitcoin\'s scaling debate. That\'s when a group of miners and developers say they will go as far as to create an alternative network to prove bigger blocks are the best solution for increasing network capacity.\n\nCalled Bitcoin Cash (BCC), the effort will effectively fork bitcoin\'s existing software and transaction history, and in the process, give every bitcoin user new cryptocurrency tokens on a new blockchain with different rules.\n\nShould users own 2 BTC, this means they\'ll now be able to claim 2 BCC on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, a move that could generate millions of dollars in new value for traders.\n\nNot without precedent, a similar event took place on ethereum last summer, when members of that community created a new cryptocurrency to protest a design decision by developers.\n\nYet if you were expecting that sort of uncertainty to be scaring away traders, according to Ripple gateway operator Rafael Olaio, the end result is anything but. Given the creation of the new network, Olaio and others expect traders to hold steady before claiming their new funds.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""People want to double their coins. Nobody is selling bitcoin.""\n\nOverall, analysts offered a variety of opinions on what could develop in the days and months ahead, commenting on what they believe could be the immediate and long-term impact of the creation of a new, widely traded cryptocurrency bearing resemblance to bitcoin.\n\nHowever, it\'s important to note that not all traders believe Bitcoin Cash will meet this definition.\n\nArthur Hayes, founder of crypto derivatives trading platform BitMEX, for example, noted that ""theoretically"" the launch of Bitcoin Cash should cause bitcoin\'s price to drop. Still, he questions whether this indeed will happen given that, historically, traders have not been kind to assets that have attempted to fork away from bitcoin.\n\n""There have been many similar distributions based on bitcoin ownership that caused no such drop in price, including bitcoin clams, byteball, etc. I think the Bitcoin Cash distribution will have minimal to no impact on the bitcoin price,"" he said.\n\nHayes continued:\n\n""I don\'t believe most holders expect longevity of this chain past the point at which they immediately dump their \'free money\' to purchase bitcoin.""\n\nConsumer confusion\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern among traders, however, was not how the two assets would compete given a level playing field, but what might happen if the market doesn\'t provide such equity.\n\nCharles Hayter, co-founder of crypto exchange service CryptoCompare, for example, noted that he believes consumers may be misled by the option to choose between two competing coins – and he wasn\'t alone.\n\n""In the long term, these two variants will cause confusion with their similar naming which no doubt will cause some problems,"" he said.\n\nMarc Van der Chijs, a Dutch serial entrepreneur and VC, noted that he believes bad actors may even maliciously seek to create confusion between the two assets as a way to profit.\n\n""I could imagine scammers selling people ‘bitcoin with a discount’ and then giving them BCC instead of BTC,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Those stories will make potential retail investors even more worried about buying their first coins.""\n\nBecause of issues like these, and others perhaps unforeseen, Van der Chijs said he expects the combined price of bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to fall below $2,700, the average recent price of bitcoin as observed on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\n""Because of uncertainty, people may move from BTC and BCC to ETH or other coins. So, I don’t think this is good for the price of bitcoin,"" he said.\n\nNo ETC\n\nStill, other market observers sought to stress that a bitcoin fork might be less competitive against the larger bitcoin cryptocurrency because of its entrenched network effect.\n\nUnlike ethereum classic, which split off of an ethereum network that was less than a year into its operation, the argument goes that the BTC price will remain more robust simply because it already benefits from a wider network of stakeholders and more developed infrastructure.\n\n""Bitcoin is more like currency, not like ethereum. A lot of infrastructure such as payment services are built and implemented in many places already,"" said Takao Asayama, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Zaif.\n\nKevin Zhou, operator of crypto hedge fund Galois Capital, responded similarly, arguing that he believes the fork will be ""lopsided"" in how it allocates the underlying network effect between the two competing technologies.\n\nStill, Zhou\'s comments suggest he sees this as a positive, potentially enabling existing bitcoin users to align more capital with their preferred technical specifications.\n\n""This kind of differentiation allows capital to selectively enter into either side without buying the combined package where it may not have entered,"" he said.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nAs for what could happen now, it seems it\'s anyone\'s guess.\n\nWhile miners and developers are claiming a desire to go through with the split, it\'s still possible that the code necessary to create the break won\'t be introduced at all. Others worry that if it does go through, it could usher in a period of high volatility that, while benefitting advanced traders, turns off more casual investors.\n\nInvestor Vinny Lingham, long known for his bitcoin price predictions, indicated that he\'d be keeping most of his capital out of the markets ahead of what he expects will be a ""turbulent few months"" for the protocol.\n\n""High risk equals high reward but also chance of portfolio damaging losses. I don\'t like what I\'m seeing so I\'m going to sit on the sidelines a bit longer,"" he said.\n\nAs for practical advice, Zhou, like others, stressed that traders who want to take part in any trading should withdraw their bitcoin from exchanges on the off-chance they aren\'t offering support for the new cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile he recommended this as the fastest way to ""dump BCC,"" the advice is still useful for bitcoin traders who want to speculate along partisan lines.\n\nZhou concluded:\n\n""I\'d recommend getting your BTC off exchanges.""\n\nTwo bitcoins image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It said the trades were executed at the ""abnormal rate"" of 10 bitcoin for one ethereum, about 125 times higher than the actual market price then because of a technical glitch.\n\nIt said the average market price that day was only about 0.03929075 bitcoin for one ethereum.\n\nThe glitch severely disrupted Quoine\'s ability to retrieve actual market prices for bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nIt said the glitch arose because it was reconfiguring passwords for its critical systems to fend off persistent attempts by hackers to break into its systems.\n\nGiven the ""stark difference between the abnormal rate and the actual market prices of bitcoin and ethereum on April 19"", B2C2, which Quoine called a ""sophisticated"" investor with experience trading virtual currencies, should have suspected the ""abnormal rate"" was a mistake.\n\nIt also noted B2C2 had done other bitcoin and ethereum-related trades on Quoine at prevailing market rates between April 15 and 18.\n\nPublic resources such as CoinDesk and WorldCoinIndex would have shown that the abnormal rate could not be an accurate reflection of the market prices of these two virtual currencies on April 19, Quoine said.', 'On my Forbes beat I cover many new, disruptive technologies – innovations with their fair share of frothy hyperbole. To balance such froth, I try to bring a measured dose of skepticism, not to be some kind of Debbie Downer, but rather to help people cut through the hype to gain a clearer understanding of the topic at hand.\n\nHowever, there is one topic – in fact, family of topics – for which I am unapologetically a skeptic through and through: Bitcoin and Blockchain.\n\nAs early as 2015, I wondered whether Bitcoin had a real purpose. I poked my stick at the radical Libertarians who hope Bitcoin will lead to the destruction of the global financial system.\n\nI’ve opined on whether Bitcoin’s ‘hard fork’ fix for scalability issues would be fatal to the cryptocurrency, or a the least, whether the fix would be illegal.\n\nI’ve compared Bitcoin to blood diamonds, pointing out that Bitcoin’s illegal uses are responsible for propping up its value.\n\nI’ve also questioned IBM ’s longshot bet on Blockchain, and more recently, I’ve listed several reasons to be skeptical about Blockchain.\n\nGiven this history of contrarian opinion, you might think I’m somehow prejudiced against Bitcoin and Blockchain.\n\nYou’d be wrong.\n\nSteve Rainwater\n\nWhy I’m a Bitcoin and Blockchain Skeptic\n\nIn fact, I’m a huge proponent of new, disruptive technologies and their applications – Blockchain and Bitcoin included.\n\nAs an industry analyst, however, my role is to provide insight into disruptive trends in the market. Given the peculiar characteristics of both Bitcoin and Blockchain, such insight must necessarily come from a skeptical position – not just by me, but from cooler heads generally.\n\nIn other words, we need more Bitcoin and Blockchain skeptics. Here are six reasons why.\n\nThe hype is out of control. In Bitcoin circles, fanatics tend to dominate discussions, drowning out more reasonable voices. Such voices, therefore, have largely packed up their bags and gone elsewhere.\n\nThe same thing is happening with Blockchain. There are so many ‘Blockchain is revolutionary’ or ‘Blockchain is changing the world’ articles that people get caught up in the fervor. “We worry about the hype,” say Marco Iansiti, and Karim R. Lakhani, professors at Harvard University. “It would be a mistake to rush headlong into blockchain innovation without understanding how it is likely to take hold.”\n\nSolutions looking for problems. The typical technology innovation pattern is for many people or companies to have a difficult problem. One or more vendors note the problem and come up with novel solutions for it. Deals are made, and lo and behold, a market is born.\n\nNot so with Blockchain. In this case, Blockchain aficionados looked at the technology, and started brainstorming possible use cases. Maybe there are business problems out there that Blockchain is best suited solve, and maybe not – but people are starting at the wrong end of the equation.\n\nComplications from the Bitcoin bubble. Bitcoin is certainly in a speculative bubble, and bubbles always pop eventually. But there’s something intrinsically different about the Bitcoin bubble when compared to all bubbles previous, from the tulip mania to the dot-com craze.\n\nThe difference: Bitcoin/Blockchain is both the investment as well as the medium of exchange. When the tulip bubble popped, the gold and silver economy of the day survived without a scratch. And the dot-com bust didn’t affect how we spent our money or invested in stocks.\n\nBut when the Bitcoin bubble bursts, it’s quite possible that the entire transactional framework around Bitcoin will itself collapse. It’s certainly true that I may be overstating this risk – but risk there is nevertheless.\n\nDecentralization of transactions will always be at odds with crime and compliance issues. Everybody realizes that it’s possible to steal Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and it’s also widely known that Bitcoin is the payment of choice for ransomware perpetrators, Dark Web participants, and other ne’er-do-wells. Furthermore, cryptocurrency thefts and illegal transactions are all too easy and all too untraceable.\n\nThe bigger picture here, however, is that these challenges – as well as the challenges of regulating Bitcoin or any other Blockchain-based transactional system – are due to the technologies’ inherent decentralization.\n\nIn other words, we’d have to give up the primary reason to use Bitcoin or Blockchain in order to fix these problems.\n\nThe ‘Selfish Interests’ or ‘51%’ problem. Because of its essentially distributed nature, any Blockchain-based transactional system depends upon the cooperation of most of its participants. If 51% of them decide to screw over the remaining 49%, therefore, there’s nothing the minority can do about it.\n\nSome people think this problem is even worse – perhaps allowing as few as one third of the participants to form a cabal of sorts that will eventually take control. “The [blockchain-based Bitcoin] protocol can be gamed by people with selfish interests,” explain Ittay Eyal, Post-doc at Cornell University and his professor at Cornell, Emin Gün Sirer. “And once the system veers away from the happy mode where everyone is honest, there is no force that opposes the growth of really large pools that command control of the currency.”\n\nElectricity. It’s a well-known but oft-ignored fact of Bitcoin that mining Bitcoins takes electricity – a lot of electricity. Furthermore, any Blockchain technology that depends upon the same kind of proof of work mechanism behind Bitcoin mining will consume vast quantities of power as well.\n\nWhile Bitcoin aficionados realize that electricity costs factor into the economics of mining, there is a bigger problem here. If even 10% of the nascent Blockchain business models out there clamoring for attention get off the ground, their electricity consumption will be enormous – and will continue to grow with no end in sight.\n\nIf Blockchain-based business models take hold, therefore, they will consume such vast quantities of power that the mere exhaust from their air conditioners will complete the melting of the ice caps.\n\nA word of final advice: treat both Bitcoin and Blockchain as disruptive innovations with both enormous potential and commensurate risk. We all want to focus on the potential, but doing so without a sober look at the underlying risk is a fool’s errand.\n\nIntellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

This could mean that the triangle support could be more likely to hold as a floor than to break or that an upside break past the resistance around 2750 might be underway.\n\nNote that the triangle formation spans 2200 to 2900 so the resulting breakout could last by the same amount. However, the moving averages might also be oscillating to signal that further consolidation is possible.\n\nStochastic is on its way down so bitcoin price might follow suit. RSI is also heading south to signal that sellers have the upper hand for now. But once both oscillators hit oversold levels and turn higher, buying pressure could return.\n\nAlso note that the triangle support is steeper compared to the resistance, which is also indicative of stronger buying pressure.\n\nMarket Factors\n\nTraders are playing it safe ahead of the August 1 upgrade to SegWit as this could signal whether or not hard fork issues could continue to stay in place. Over the weekend, a number of exchanges already issued warnings to their clients about holding bitcoin deposits and the potential incompatibilities that may arise.\n\nIf the industry is able to emerge from this test unscathed, bitcoin price could be on its way to break past its record highs. On the other hand, weak support for the new version of the software could mean more losses for the cryptocurrency.

Supposedly, SPV is very scalable due to the small amount of data it requires an SPV client to store, send and receive.\n\nLet\'s dig into this claim and examine it from multiple perspectives.\n\nHow SPV works\n\nSatoshi described the high-level design for SPV in the bitcoin white paper, though it wasn\'t implemented until two years later when Mike Hearn created BitcoinJ.\n\n\n\nEarly SPV implementations were quite naive – they downloaded the entire blockchain, which was no more efficient than a full node in terms of bandwidth.\n\nBy throwing away transactions that weren\'t relevant to the SPV client\'s wallet, it was able to gain substantial disk usage savings. It took another 18 months for BIP 37 to be published, providing a specification for Bloom filtering of transactions, thus relying upon the block header\'s Merkle root to prove inclusion of a transaction in a block as Satoshi had described. This provided greatly reduced bandwidth usage.\n\nWhen an SPV client syncs with the bitcoin network, it connects to one or more fully validating bitcoin nodes, determines the latest block at the tip of the chain, then requests all of the block headers with a ""getheaders"" command for blocks from the last block it synced up to the chain tip.\n\nIf the SPV client is only interested in specific transactions corresponding to a wallet, it will construct a Bloom filter based upon all of the addresses for which its wallet owns private keys and send a ""filterload"" command to the full node(s) so that they know to only return transactions matching the filter.\n\nAfter syncing block headers and possibly loading a Bloom filter, the SPV client sends a ""getdata"" command to request every single (possibly filtered) block they missed out on seeing since the last time they were last online, sequentially.\n\nOnce the client is in sync, if it remains connected to the full node peer(s) it will only receive ""inv"" inventory messages for transactions that match the loaded Bloom filter.\n\nSPV client scaling\n\nFrom a client\'s point of view, Bloom filtering is a very efficient means to find relevant transactions in the blockchain, while using minimal CPU resources, bandwidth and disk space.\n\nEvery bitcoin block header is a mere 80 bytes, so at time of writing it\'s only 38 megabytes of data for the entire eight-plus year history of the blockchain. Each year (roughly 52,560 blocks), only adds 4.2 megabytes, regardless of the size of blocks in the blockchain.\n\nThe Merkle tree that is used to prove inclusion of a transaction in a block also scales extremely well. Because each new ""layer"" that gets added to the tree doubles the total number of ""leaves"" it can represent, you don\'t need a very deep tree in order to compactly prove inclusion of a transaction, even amongst a block with millions of transactions.\n\nvia Mastering Bitcoin\n\nThe Merkle tree data structure is so efficient that it can represent 16 million transactions with a depth of only 24 – this is sufficient to represent an 8GB block. Yet, the Merkle tree proof for such a transaction remains under 1KB in size!\n\nvia Mastering Bitcoin\n\nIt\'s quite clear that from an SPV client perspective, the bitcoin network could be scaled to multi-gigabyte blocks and SPV clients would have little trouble processing the small amounts of data required – even on a mobile phone with a 3G connection.\n\nBut alas, scaling the bitcoin network is not nearly that simple.\n\nSPV server scaling\n\nWhile SPV is incredibly efficient for clients, the same does not hold true for the server – that is, the full node(s) to which SPV clients make requests. This method exhibits poor scalability for a number of reasons.\n\nNodes in the network have to process an extremely large amount of data to return the results for just a single peer, and they must repeat this work on every block for each peer that requests it. Disk I/O quickly becomes a bottleneck.\n\nEvery SPV client must sync the entire blockchain from the last time it had contact with the network, or, if it believes it missed transactions, it will need to rescan the entire blockchain since the wallet creation date. In the worst case, at time of writing, this is approximately 150GB. The full node must load every single block from disk, filter it to the client\'s specifications and return the result.\n\nSince blockchains are a form of append-only ledger, this amount will never stop growing. Without extensive protocol changes, blockchain pruning is incompatible with BIP 37 – it expects all blocks to be available at all full nodes that advertise NODE_BLOOM.\n\nBIP 37 SPV clients can be lied to by omission. To combat this, SPV clients connect to multiple nodes (usually four) though it\'s still not a guarantee – SPV clients can be partitioned off the main network by a Sybil attack. This increases the load on the network of full nodes by a factor of four.\n\nFor every connected SPV client that has been synchronized to the tip of the blockchain, each incoming block and transaction must be individually filtered. This involves a non-negligible amount of CPU time and must be done separately for every connected SPV client.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nAt time of writing there are approximately 8,300 full nodes running that accept incoming connections; around 8,000 of them advertise NODE_BLOOM and should thus be capable of serving requests from SPV clients. But, how many SPV clients can the current number of listening full nodes reasonably support?\n\nWhat would be required in order for the network to be comprised of full nodes that can support both a billion daily users and blocks large enough to accommodate their transactions?\n\nvia Bitnodes\n\nBitcoin Core defaults to a maximum of 117 incoming connections, which would create an upper bound of 936,000 available sockets on the network. However, the majority of these sockets are already consumed today.\n\nEach full node connects to eight other full nodes by default. Bitcoin Core developer Luke-Jr\'s (very rough) node count estimates 100,000 total nodes at time of writing; 92,000 of which don’t make sockets available for SPV clients. This eats up 800,000 available sockets just for full nodes, leaving only 136,000 sockets available for SPV clients.\n\nThis leads me to conclude that around 85 percent of available sockets are consumed by the network mesh of full nodes. (It\'s worth noting that Luke-Jr\'s estimation method can\'t determine how much time non-listening nodes spend online; surely at least some of them disconnect and reconnect periodically.)\n\nMy node that powers statoshi.info averages 100 full node (eight outgoing, 92 incoming) peers and 25 SPV clients. That\'s 80 percent of the available sockets being consumed by full nodes.\n\nIf we want even 1 billion SPV clients to be able to use such a system, there will need to be sufficient full node resources available to service them – network sockets, CPU cycles, disk I/O, and so on. Can we make the math work out?\n\nIn order to give the SPV scaling claims the benefit of the doubt, I\'ll use some conservative assumptions that each of the billion SPV users:\n\n– Send and receive one transaction per day.\n\n– Sync their wallet to the tip of the blockchain once per day.\n\n– Query four different nodes when syncing to decrease chances of being lied to by omission.\n\nA billion transactions per day, if evenly distributed (which they surely would not be) would result in about 7 million transactions per block. Due to the great scalability of Merkle trees, it would only require 23 hashes to prove inclusion of a transaction in such a block: 736 bytes of data plus an average 500 bytes for the transaction.\n\nAdd another 12KB worth of block headers per day and an SPV client would still only be using about 20KB worth of data per day.\n\nHowever, 1 billion transactions per day generates 500GB worth of blockchain data for full nodes to store and process. And each time an SPV client connects and asks to find any transactions for its wallet in the past day, four full nodes must read and filter 500GB of data each.\n\nRecall that there are currently around 136,000 sockets available for SPV clients on the network of 8,000 SPV-serving full nodes. If each SPV client uses four sockets, then only 34,000 clients can be syncing with the network at any given time. If there were more people online at once than that, other users trying to open their wallet would get connection errors when trying to sync to the tip of the blockchain.\n\nThus, in order for the current network to support 1 billion SPV users that sync once per day, while only 34,000 can be syncing at any given time, that\'s 29,400 ""groups"" of users that must connect, sync, and disconnect: each user would need to be able to sync the previous day of data in less than three seconds.\n\nThis poses a bit of a conundrum because it would require each full node to be able to read and filter 167GB of data per second per SPV client continuously. At 20 SPV clients per full node, that\'s 3,333GB per second. I\'m unaware of any storage devices capable of such throughput. It should be possible to create a huge RAID 0 array of high-end solid state disks that can achieve around 600MB/s each.\n\nYou\'d need 5,555 drives in order to achieve the target throughput. The linked example disk costs $400 at time of writing and has approximately 1TB of capacity – enough to store two days\'-worth of blocks in this theoretical network. Thus, you\'d need a new array of disks every two days, which would cost you over $2.2 million – this amounts to over $400 million to store a year\'s-worth of blocks while still meeting the required read throughput.\n\nOf course, we can play around with these assumptions and tweak various numbers. Can we produce a scenario in which the node cost is more reasonable?\n\nLet\'s try:\n\nWhat if we had 100,000 full nodes all running cheaper, high-capacity spinning disks and we somehow convinced them all to accept SPV client connections? What if we also managed to modify the full node software to support 1,000 connected SPV clients?\n\nThat would give us 100 million sockets available for SPV clients that could support 25 million simultaneous SPV clients on the network. Thus each SPV client would have 2,160 seconds per day to sync with the network. For a full node to keep up with demand it would need to maintain a consistent read speed of 231MB/s per SPV client, which would result in 231GB/s assuming 1,000 connected SPV clients.\n\nA 7,200 RPM hard drive can read about 220MB/s, so you could achieve this read throughput with a RAID 0 array of a bit more than 1,000 drives.\n\nAt time of writing you can purchase a 10TB drive for $400, thus a $400,000 RAID array of these drives would enable you to store 20 days\'-worth of blocks – this amounts to a much more manageable $7.2 million to store a year\'s-worth of blocks while still achieving the disk read throughput requirements.\n\nYou\'ll need to add at least 2 of these every day!\n\nIt\'s worth noting that no one in their right mind would run a RAID 0 array with this many drives because a single drive failure would corrupt the entire array of disks. Thus a RAID array with fault tolerance would be even more expensive and less performant. It also seems incredibly optimistic that 100,000 organizations would be willing to pony up millions of dollars per year to run a full node.\n\nAnother point to note is that these conservative estimates also assume that SPV clients would somehow coordinate to distribute their syncing times evenly throughout each day. In reality, there would be daily and weekly cyclical peaks and troughs of activity – the network would need to have a fair higher capacity than estimated above in order to accommodate peak demand.\n\nOtherwise, many SPV clients would fail to sync during peak usage hours.\n\nInterestingly, it turns out that changing the number of sockets per node doesn\'t impact the overall load on any given full node – it still ends up needing to process the same amount of data. What really matters in this equation is the ratio of full nodes to SPV clients. And, of course, the size of the blocks in the chain that the full nodes need to process.\n\nThe end result appears inescapable: the cost of operating a full node capable of servicing the SPV demand of a billion daily on-chain transactors would be astronomical.\n\nSeeking a middle ground\n\nBy this point, it\'s quite clear that a billion transactions per day puts the cost of operating a fully validating node outside the reach of all but the wealthiest entities.\n\nBut, what if we flip this calculation on its head and instead try to find a formula for determining the cost of adding load to the network by increasing on-chain transaction throughput?\n\nIn order for the bitcoin network to support a target number of transactions per second (adding capacity for 86,400 net new daily users), we can calculate the per-node disk throughput requirements as:\n\nThis gives us the minimum disk read throughput per second for a full node to service demand from SPV clients. With the existing characteristics of the network and available technology, we can extrapolate an estimated cost of node operation by using disk throughput as the assumed bottleneck. Note that there are surely other resource constraints that would come into play, thus increasing the cost of full node operation.\n\nFor the following calculations, I used these assumptions:\n\n– Average transaction size in bytes = 500 bytes based upon statoshi.info.\n\n– Total number of SPV users = one per transaction per day.\n\n– Sockets consumed by an SPV client = standard of four.\n\n– Number of sockets available for SPV clients on each full node = prior calculated number of 20.\n\n– Total network sockets available for SPV clients = prior calculated number of 136,000.\n\n– Cost of hard drive throughput and space = $400 10TB 7,200 RPM drives in RAID 0 configuration.\n\nWe can see that in terms of disk throughput it stays fairly reasonable until we surpass 100 transactions per second. At that point you start having to buy multiple disks and stripe them in a RAID array in order to achieve the performance requirements.\n\nUnfortunately, the disk throughput requirements and thus cost to operate a full node increase quadratically in relation to the number of transactions per second. The costs quickly become untenable for most entities.\n\nFor reference, recall that Visa processes about 2,000 transactions per second. On bitcoin this would require nearly $200,000-worth of disks just to keep up with SPV demand. One point worth noting is that these charts keep the number of full nodes constant at 8,000 – in reality, they would likely decrease as the cost went up, thus raising the throughput requirements and cost of operating the remaining nodes to increase even faster.\n\nThis appears to be a compounding force of node centralization.\n\nAs I concluded in ""How to Save Bitcoin\'s Node Network From Centralization"", one of the root issues of contention around increasing the block size is the cost of node operation. The above calculations give us a glimpse of the complexities of calculating the cost of node operation because there are so many variables involved – these calculations were keeping most of the variables constant and only focusing on disk I/O cost.\n\nThe (unscientific) polls I ran a year earlier showed that 98% of node operators would not pay more than $100 per month to run a node, even if they were highly invested in bitcoin. I\'d be willing to bet that increasing bitcoin\'s on-chain transactions by an order of magnitude would result in the loss of a majority of full nodes, while an increase of two orders of magnitude would result in a loss of 90% or more nodes.\n\nI believe it\'s safe to assume that very few entities would be willing to go to the trouble of building RAID arrays in order to run a full node. If this is the case, it\'s untenable to claim that such increases would be fine for the average user, because there wouldn\'t be nearly enough full node disk throughput or sockets available to service SPV demand.\n\nOther SPV weaknesses\n\nSPV is great for end users who don\'t require the security or privacy of a fully validating node. However, there are plenty of reasons that could be considered showstoppers for a mostly-SPV bitcoin network, regardless of its scalability.\n\nSPV makes major assumptions that result in it having weaker security and privacy than a fully validating node:\n\nSPV clients trust miners to correctly validate and enforce the rules of bitcoin; they assume that the blockchain with the greatest cumulative proof-of-work is also a valid chain. You can learn about the difference between SPV and full node security models in this article. SPV clients assume that full nodes will not lie to them by omission. A full node can\'t lie and say that a transaction existed in a block when it didn\'t actually exist, but it can lie by saying that a transaction that does exist in a block did not happen. Because SPV clients strive for efficiency, they only request data for transactions belonging to them. This results in a massive loss of privacy.\n\nInterestingly, the co-author of BIP 37, Matt Corallo, regrets creating it:\n\n""A big issue today for privacy of users in the system is BIP37 SPV bloom filters. I\'m sorry, I wrote that.""\n\nBIP 37 Bloom-filtered SPV clients have basically no privacy, even when using unreasonably high false-positive rates. Jonas Nick [a security engineer at Blockstream] found that given a single public key, he could then determine 70% of the other addresses belonging to a given wallet.\n\nYou could work around SPV\'s poor privacy by splitting Bloom filters among many peers, though this would make the scalability of SPV even worse by placing more load on more full nodes.\n\nBIP 37 is also vulnerable to trivial denial-of-service attacks. Demonstration code is available here that is able to cripple full nodes by making many fast inventory requests through specially constructed filters that cause continuous disk seek and high CPU usage.\n\nThe author of the attack\'s proof-of-concept, Core Developer Peter Todd, explains:\n\n""The fundamental issue is that you can consume a disproportionate amount of disk I/O bandwidth with very little network bandwidth.""\n\nEven to this day, the fraud alerts that Satoshi described in the white paper have not been implemented. In fact, research efforts in this area have shown it may not even be possible to implement lightweight fraud alerts.\n\nFor example, a fraud alert only works if you can actually get the data required to prove fraud – if a miner does not provide that data, the fraud alert can\'t be created. As such, SPV clients don\'t have the level of security that Satoshi envisioned they would have.\n\nFrom a very high-level perspective, a world consisting mostly of SPV nodes makes consensus changes such as the total coin cap or even editing of the ledger much easier. Fewer fully validating nodes means more centralized enforcement of consensus rules and thus less resistance to changing consensus rules. Some people may consider that a feature; most surely consider it a flaw.\n\nPotential improvements\n\nSPV security & scalability could potentially be improved in a number of ways via fraud proofs, fraud hints, input proofs, spentness proofs, and so on. But as far as I\'m aware none of these are past the concept phase, much less ready for production deployment.\n\nBloom filter commitments could improve privacy, but there\'s a tradeoff for usefulness between the size of the filter and its false positive rate: too coarse means peers download far too many false-positive blocks, too fine means the filters will be absolutely gigantic and impractical for anybody to download with an SPV client.\n\nIt would reduce the load on full-node disk throughput, but the trade-off would be increased bandwidth by both SPV clients and full nodes because entire blocks would have to be transferred across the network.\n\nThis recently proposed compact client-side filtering eliminates privacy issues, but it does require full blocks to be downloaded if there is a match against the filter (though not necessarily via the p2p network!).\n\nUTXO commitments could enable SPV clients to sync their current UTXO set and thus wallet balance without requiring the full node to scan the entire blockchain. Rather, it would provide a proof of the UTXOs existing.\n\nIt may be possible to guard against Bloom filter DoS attacks by requiring SPV clients to either submit proof-of-work (untenable on a battery-powered device like a phone) or channel-based micropayments (impossible to bootstrap if a client hasn\'t received money yet), but neither offers a straightforward solution.\n\nThe disk read requirements for full nodes could likely be reduced in a number of ways via improved indexing of data and batched processing of requests from SPV clients.\n\nRyan X Charles pointed out in the comments below that using BIP70\'s payment protocol to directly tell someone the UTXO id of the payment you\'re sending them would remove the need for them to use bloom filters at all since they could request the data directly from full nodes. This is incredibly efficient if you\'re willing to accept the privacy trade-off.\n\nSuffice to say, there is plenty of room for improvement - many challenges will need to be overcome in order to improve on-chain scalability.\n\nSuitable scaling solutions\n\nIf we ignore the multitude of miscellaneous other issues with scaling to larger block sizes such as block propagation latency, UTXO set scaling, initial blockchain syncing times and security and privacy trade-offs, it may be technically possible to scale bitcoin to a billion daily on-chain users if there are entities willing to invest significant resources to develop software improvements and to operate the required infrastructure.\n\nIt seems highly unlikely that bitcoin would evolve organically in that fashion, however, because there are much more efficient ways to scale the system. The most efficient is a form of scaling already being used: consolidation around centralized API providers. There tend to be huge trust and privacy trade-offs when employing these methods, but many such interactions involve contractual agreements that mitigate some of the dangers.\n\nIn terms of scaling in a trustless manner, Layer 2 protocols such as Lightning offer much more efficient scaling because the high volumes of data being transferred are only being sent amongst the small number of parties directly involved in a given off-chain transaction. You can think of it as the difference between a broadcast-to-all ethernet communication layer versus a routed IP layer – the internet couldn\'t scale without routing and neither can the Internet of Money.\n\nWhile this approach to scaling is much more technically complex than traditional centralized scaling and will require overcoming some unique challenges, the up-front investment of resources for research and development of these routing protocols will pay huge dividends over the long term, as they reduce the load that needs to be borne by the entire network by orders of magnitude.\n\nThere are also plenty of options in between that can be explored:\n\n– Centralized custodial schemes with perfect privacy that use Chaum tokens such as HashCash.\n\n– Centralized non-custodial zero knowledge proof systems such as TumbleBit.\n\n– Federated (semi-trusted multisignature) sidechains.\n\n– Miner-secured (semi-trusted) drivechains.\n\nI\'m still convinced that in the long term, bitcoin will need much larger blocks.\n\nBut let\'s be patient and tactful by trying to scale the system as efficiently as possible while maintaining its security and privacy properties.\n\nAn auditable, slightly decentralized PayPal would surely have utility if it was functional from the standpoint of the average user, but it would not offer the level of financial sovereignty that bitcoiners enjoy today.\n\nThanks to Matt Corallo, Mark Erhardt and Peter Todd for reviewing and providing feedback for this article\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which an has ownership stake in Blockstream.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Authorities, with the aid of private investigators, tracked the stolen funds to some of the BTC-e owner\'s Bitcoin wallets, even if those funds had been funneled through Bitcoin mixers.\n\nBitMixer anticipates that Bitcoin mixing will become illegal\n\nBitMixer was founded in 2011, and it shut down three days after US and European authorities had announced they infiltrated and shut down the Dark Web\'s two largest illegal marketplaces — AlphaBay and Hansa.\n\nBitMixer\'s owners are well aware that criminals used their service. They said so in their final statement, citing the influence of Dark Web marketplaces on their decision to shut down their service.\n\n""Blockchain is a great open book. I believe that Bitcoin will have a great future without dark market transactions. You may use Dash or Zerocoin if you want to buy some weed. Not Bitcoin,"" the BitMixer team wrote.\n\n""I hope our decision will help to make Bitcoin ecosystem more clean and transparent. I hope our competitors will hear our message and will close their services too. Very soon this kind of activity will be considered as illegal in most of countries,"" the team also wrote, issuing a warning for fellow Bitcoin mixers.\n\nThe beginning of the end for Bitcoin mixers\n\nBitMixer\'s announcement doesn\'t surprise anyone except casual Bitcoin users. Cryptocurrency aficionados are well aware of the fact that Bitcoin is not anonymous. That\'s why some created newer cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash.\n\nBitMixer\'s announcement and subsequent shut down will be a cornerstone in Bitcoin\'s history, being the first mixer service that shuts down realizing its own uselessness and futility. As authorities extend their administrative powers over Bitcoin\'s domains, its prediction that mixer services will become illegal may soon become a reality.\n\nThere is no void in the Bitcoin mixing market after BitMixer\'s shutdown, as there are plenty of alternative services users can choose from, although, a large number of these are scams, as some just take the user\'s money without forwarding it to the final destination.', 'Bitcoin and blockchain have the potential to change the way Papua New Guineans gain access to funds and credit.\n\nLike most Papua New Guineans, Veronica Kapu relies on cash. The mother of four, who works as a cleaner and nanny, has a bank account, but cannot recall the last time she used it. As for taking out a loan or having a credit card, Kapu just laughs.\n\n“Maybe if we had hundreds to put away I would use a bank more,” Kapu says, and explains that most of what her family earns is spent at the market.\n\nLike her, the vast majority of Papua New Guineans have little, if anything, to do with the banking system.\n\nA study by the Bank of Papua New Guinea, the nation’s central bank, found that in 2013 less than 15 per cent of adults had a bank account, and just 7 per cent had a loan from a regulated financial institution. The International Monetary Fund says there were fewer than three bank branches for every 100,000 people living in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 2015, compared with a global average of 12.7.\n\nIn PNG’s highlands, where almost half of the nation’s seven million people live, the situation is worse. There, barely 8 per cent have a bank account.\n\n“For us, we want to help our family, so when they call to ask for money ... we can just send it ...” Veronica Kapu\n\nAs Bank of Papua New Guinea governor Loi Bakani observes, poor access to financial services is a major hurdle for people trying to escape poverty.\n\n“Their only option is cash, and cash is a bit of a trap,” Bakani wrote in the foreword of the bank’s National Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy Strategy in 2013.\n\n“It can be stolen, you can’t submit yourself to discipline policies, you don’t get interest on it, you don’t have insurance or credit and so, in lots of ways, it is the most limiting way to hold assets.”\n\nA different line of credit\n\nLocal entrepreneur Shane Ninai thinks he knows how to change all that. He spent more than a year in a Silicon Valley entrepreneurship program founded by venture capitalist Tim Draper, and believes technology could give Papua New Guinea access to systems of accounting and credit that bypass the formal banking system.\n\nNow a partner in Draper’s venture capital firm Day One Investments, Ninai sees the virtual currency bitcoin and the blockchain method of accountancy as the way ahead for countries like PNG, where the formal banking sector is out of reach for most.\n\n“Informal and alternative economies and governance systems are deeply ingrained in our culture and are still alive and well, and blockchain allows us, for the first time, to capture this activity,” he says.\n\nProfessional Development: CPA Q&A. Access a handpicked selection of resources each month and complete a short monthly assessment to earn CPD hours. Exclusively available to CPA Australia members.\n\nAs he points out, in many PNG communities, exchanges of value involve pigs, shell necklaces and other objects, rather than money.\n\nFor most, such transactions only take place within relatively tight communities, because people only trust those they know.\n\nIn the northern Oro province, for example, small groups of workers club together in what is commonly referred to as the Sunday-to-Sunday system. They pool their savings, which can then be drawn on for making payments and obtaining credit. While this is fine for very small transactions, Ninai says blockchain and bitcoin have the potential to give such people access to funds and credit on a much more substantial scale.\n\nTechnology leapfrog\n\nBitcoin uses a software program to record and pay for transactions without the involvement of a third party such as a bank, while blockchain is a method of bookkeeping that binds entries together, so that they are very difficult to falsify. Proponents such as Peter Gersak, chief technology officer of IBM South East Europe, says such technology provides a permanent, reliable record of transactions.\n\nNinai thinks the relatively high penetration of mobile phones in PNG – almost half of adults were estimated by Oxford Business Group in 2016 to have a mobile – provides a ready-made means for people to bypass a traditional banking system. They could access blockchain and bitcoin technologies on their mobile phones to facilitate transactions and access credit.\n\nThough Kapu has never heard of bitcoin or blockchain, she is well acquainted with using mobiles to transmit credit to her relatives living in her home village.\n\n“It’s easy to do. For us, we want to help our family, so when they call to ask for money ... we can just send it, because it is not easy in the village to get to money like that,” she says.\n\nNinai thinks the best ideas on how to use bitcoin and blockchain are likely to come from those communities that already operate outside the formal banking system. In that case, PNG could be a bitcoin laboratory.\n\n“The central bank is very open to the idea and very excited about its potential ..."" Shane Ninai, Day One Investments\n\nHe admits, however, it will take years to win acceptance and embed such systems in the local economy.\n\nThe Bank of Papua New Guinea will play a crucial role if digital currencies and transactions are to win broad acceptance, Ninai says.\n\n“The central bank is very open to the idea and very excited about its potential but, as the principal financial regulator, it needs to give it the tick of approval if people are to trust it,” he explains.\n\nIt won’t happen overnight, but Ninai is optimistic that in the next five years or so, blockchain technology will open the financial door to millions, not just in PNG, but around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead next: 9 technology trends you need to know about']"
07/31/2017,"['Bitcoin is headed toward a fork tomorrow.\n\nWhether that happens for sure remains to be seen, but if it does, and you hold bitcoin, there are a few things you will want to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, starting August 1 at about 12:20 UTC, mining pool ViaBTC will give miners who are a part of its pool the option to direct their computing power to a new, controversial software client known as Bitcoin ABC.\n\nShould enough miners take up that option, the result will be a permanent divergence in the bitcoin blockchain and the creation of a new cryptocurrency known as bitcoin cash.\n\nProposed by developer Amaury Séchet, Bitcoin ABC is an alternative protocol that will boost bitcoin\'s transaction capacity. The client increases bitcoin\'s block size parameter to 8 MB and removes the long-debated code optimization Segregated Witness, which is due to activate on the main bitcoin blockchain later in August.\n\nOf the more than 20 bitcoin mining pools, ViaBTC is the only pool to publicly support Bitcoin ABC, so far.\n\nAlthough most bitcoin developers, entrepreneurs and users seem uninterested in moving over to Bitcoin ABC, the new protocol is not without eager supporters, which makes it hard to tell how things will play out.\n\nWe don\'t know, for instance, how much mining power will go to the new blockchain, whether the fork will result in something long lasting or if the new cryptocurrency will fall to the wayside due to lack of support.\n\nBefore those questions are answered, here are a few essentials to keep keep in mind.\n\nWhat is a fork?\n\nA hard fork is a permanent divergence in the blockchain.\n\nEssentially, a new software client is presented, in this case, Bitcoin ABC. Some nodes will upgrade to the new client, but others will not. Because bitcoin is decentralized, it will be up to each individual user to decide on their own which software to run.\n\nOnce the first block with the new rules is mined, other miners may decide to move their computing power over to the new chain and build on that initial block. If enough miners begin to move over, this is where a possible ""split"" could happen.\n\nAlthough, the original bitcoin chain will likely have the majority hash power and grow at a faster rate than the new chain, the overall result will be two blockchains. Both chains will share the same origin and history up to the point where they diverge. And from there on, two separate networks will exist.\n\nDepending on the amount of computing power behind it, Bitcoin ABC could become a serious contender in the cryptocurrency space. Or, if the miners supporting it switch back to the dominant chain, Bitcoin ABC may become nothing more than a distant memory in the ongoing saga of bitcoin.\n\nBecause the networks are separate, though, it will make no difference how much mining power gets diverted to the smaller chain. Bitcoin ABC will continue to co-exist, even if it has only a fraction of the computing power of the larger bitcoin chain.\n\nTwo sets of coins\n\nWhen the bitcoin blockchain splits, the result will be two sets of tokens: bitcoin (BTC) on the original bitcoin blockchain, and bitcoin cash (BCC or BCH) on the new blockchain.\n\nAnyone who holds bitcoins before the split will effectively hold coins on both chains after the split. In this case, anyone holding bitcoin tokens (BTC) on the original chain will end up with the same amount of bitcoin cash (BCC or BCH) on the other.\n\nYour bitcoin will be safe, but if you want to make sure you have access to your bitcoin cash, you should check with your exchange to see what their policy is. The safest plan is to have control of your private keys before the split.\n\nWhether it\'s worth it to do so will be up to each user. But if you think bitcoin cash will have no value, think again. Bitcoin cash futures are currently trading at $275 on ViaBTC\'s exchange.\n\nAs long as you have control of your private keys before August 1, 12:20 UTC, you will most likely have access to the bitcoin cash you are entitled to after the split. If you leave your bitcoin in an online exchange, however, that exchange will be in control of your bitcoin.\n\nTo control your keys, one option is to move your coins to hardware wallet, such as Trezor or Ledger, that keeps your keys on a secure USB device. Or you can download a mobile wallet software, such Airbitz or Mycelium.\n\nBut be careful. Some mobile wallets, including Electrum and GreenAddress, have said they will not support bitcoin cash.\n\nMonitoring the fork\n\nBut how will you be able to tell if bitcoin has forked, or not?\n\nBtcforkmonitor.info is one site tracking potential bitcoin forks. If it detects a fork, a red notification promises to pop up at the top of the website.\n\nDevelopers of the site are running both Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Core nodes, so they can compare the two clients and see how many blocks are on one chain versus the other.\n\nStill, since btcforkmonitor is an independent website, the information it presents may or may not be accurate. So, unless you want to run your own 150 GB Bitcoin ABC full node, it might be a good idea to check with other sources, such as other people running full nodes, and follow their updates on social media.\n\nTwo bitcoins via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'On the eve of a major change in bitcoin, a threat of a split in the digital currency has been avoided — for now.\n\nA move by users to force a change in the computer code by Monday has worked. A majority of “miners” — the core bitcoin users who verify bitcoin transactions around the world — has signaled support. Though the change is designed to improve capacity on the increasingly clogged network, some miners had objected because it could reduce transaction fees they collect.\n\nThe show of support has helped reverse a slide in the value of bitcoin from around $1,900 two weeks ago to roughly $2,800 on Monday.\n\nHowever, some uncertainty still remains. A May agreement between large bitcoin companies effectively pushes the threat of a split off until November. And one proposal to launch an alternative currency, Bitcoin Cash, is sowing confusion and fears of scam trades.\n\nHere’s a look at the current dispute.\n\n___\n\nWHAT IS BITCOIN, AGAIN?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that’s not tied to any bank or government . Like cash, it lets users spend or receive money anonymously, or mostly so; like other online payment services, it also lets them do so over the internet.\n\nThe coins are created by miners, who operate computer farms that verify other users’ transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles. These miners receive bitcoin in exchange. It’s also possible to exchange bitcoin for U.S. dollars and other currencies.\n\nBitcoin has been touted as a currency of the future, but so far it hasn’t proven very popular as a way to pay for goods or services.\n\n___\n\nWHAT’S BEHIND THE FUSS?\n\nIn a word, speed.\n\nThe bitcoin network is limited in how quickly it can shuffle around digital money. As bitcoin has grown, payment delays have become more common and worrisome.\n\nSome software developers came up with a way to speed things up by reengineering bitcoin’s universal ledger, a file called the blockchain. Supporters of the new method include Microsoft, the bitcoin exchange Coinbase and a variety of other bitcoin proponents who would like to see the currency used more widely in commerce.\n\nReformers had threatened to stop recognizing transactions confirmed by miners who hadn’t adopted the upgrade.\n\n___\n\nWHAT WOULD A SPLIT MEAN?\n\nGenerally speaking, chaos — though mostly limited to those who use or squirrel away bitcoin. People who use bitcoin couldn’t be sure which version they held, or what might happen if they spent it or accepted bitcoin as payment.\n\nTaking bitcoin, for instance, could leave you with currency you couldn’t spend freely — and that might disappear entirely if it ended up being the “wrong” kind.\n\nThat’s one reason the community-supported website Bitcoin.org had warned users not to accept any bitcoin up to two days prior to Monday’s deadline and to wait for confirmation the situation had been resolved before trading again.\n\nBut the change now has the support needed to proceed, so a disruption isn’t likely this week.\n\n___\n\nWHAT ARE THE REMAINING ISSUES?\n\nA separate group of developers sought to solve the speed issue by proposing a new currency called Bitcoin Cash. It effectively rewards every owner of bitcoin with an equal amount of the new currency using a system that can handle much higher volumes of trades.\n\nBut some digital currency exchange operators— including Coinbase and Bitstamp — have said they won’t support Bitcoin Cash. And Cornell computer science professor Emin Gun Sirer says savvy traders can game the system to create free money for themselves.\n\nBitcoin Cash was slated to launch Tuesday. As of Monday the price of Bitcoin Cash futures was about one-tenth of bitcoin itself.\n\nTone Vays, a bitcoin analyst and consultant, says he thinks Bitcoin Cash is destined to become one of many alternative digital currencies known as “alt-coins.” He says the concept is similar to Clams , digital coins that were also awarded to bitcoin holders in 2014 but now trade at about one-thousandth of bitcoin’s price.\n\nOnce Bitcoin Cash goes live Tuesday, people “will immediately sell it for bitcoin,” he said Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, major companies that came together on the May agreement committed to a second change by November that could still result in a split of bitcoin into two incompatible currencies if a significant number of miners don’t agree.\n\n“The big drama has thus been postponed,” Sirer said in an email Monday.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Technology Writer Ryan Nakashima at https://twitter.com/rnakashi\n\nCopyright © 2017 The Associated Press.

If you lose a few bucks, at least you took a shot,"" he said. ""In life, you miss every shot that you do not take. It will probably be more upsetting to watch it (from the sidelines) go up another 1,000%.""\n\nMoas gave bitcoin a $5,000 price target for 2018, reflecting nearly 80 percent upside from Monday\'s price of about $2,800. He also expects rival digital currency ethereum to more than double in value from just under $200 to reach $400 in the next year, and another digital currency, litecoin, to double from about $40 to $80.\n\nThe U.S. dollar continues to be battered by yet more dysfunction in the White House, with the world\'s reserve currency notching up its fifth consecutive month of losses in July. CNBChas the details:\n\nThe dollar index just closed its fifth straight month of losses, its longest monthly losing streak since 2011. One portfolio manager said in an interview Monday that, despite this weakness, he wouldn\'t be surprised to see some relief for the greenback ahead.\n\n""When I look to the next twelve months, I wouldn\'t be surprised to see the Federal Reserve raise interest rates two to three times, as well as start to slowly reduce their balance sheet. That should bring some more life, or breathe some more air, into the U.S. dollar,"" Chad Morganlander of Washington Crossing Advisors, said Monday on CNBC\'s ""Trading Nation.""\n\nChina\'s made a big impression over the weekend with its massive military parade in Inner Mongolia to mark the 90th anniversary of the People\'s Liberation Army. As tensions grow in the region, Beijing is talking up the readiness of its armed forces. Reutershas the details:\n\nChina\'s military is ""confident, capable and fully prepared"" to protect the country\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the state-run China Daily on Tuesday quoted Defence Minister Chang Wanquan as saying in reference to Taiwan.\n\nDespite decades of growing trade across the Taiwan Strait, China has never renounced the use of force, if needed, to gain control of Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province.\n\nDemocratic, self-governed Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by Communist-ruled China.', '', 'The end of the Bitcoin war is fast approaching and the winners are not yet clear.\n\nBitcoin has been embroiled in a dramatic civil war for the last several years. The bitcoin platform has not kept up with its user and transaction volume growth as its price has skyrocketed. This has led to what is being called a ""civil war"" between bitcoin developers and miners.\n\nThere are several potential solutions for speeding up the platform. Until last week, the solution known as Segwit2x was heavily favored to win the war and become the standard after the August 1 deadline. Then, bitcoin cash came along. The new solution is a fork of the bitcoin system, basically, a new platform that has all the history of the old platform but plays by new rules. Because it\'s built on bitcoin\'s history, users would automatically receive tokens on the bitcoin cash platform if they had tokens on bitcoin\'s platform.\n\nThere is a lot of volatility and uncertainty in cryptocurrencies right now, and Nvidia and AMD have been the only sure bets. Both companies produce graphics processing units that are used by cryptocurrency miners to speed up their machines\' processing payments on the platforms. Faster processing speeds mean a bigger share of the payouts from the platform, so miners have been buying lots of the cards recently.\n\nThe graphics cards are in such high demand that they are often sold out, and miners are even renting entire jumbo jets in order to deliver their GPUs faster.\n\nThe demand for these graphics cards is not a steady driver of growth for Nvidia or AMD though. Both companies are receiving a short-term boost from increased demand, but the price of these cryptocurrencies are volatile and demand, which picked up rapidly, could be just as unpredictable.\n\nNvidia on YouTube\n\nOn AMD\'s earnings call, CEO Lisa Su said that cryptocurrencies are not a ""long term growth driver"" for her company.\n\n""Relative to cryptocurrency, we have seen some elevated demand,"" Su said on the earnings call. ""But it\'s important to say we didn\'t have cryptocurrency in our forecast, and we\'re not looking at it as a long-term growth driver. But we\'ll certainly continue to watch the developments around the blockchain technologies as they go forward.""\n\nNvidia is a bit more bullish on cryptocurrencies, according to a product page for unreleased GPUs, the company is working on graphics cards that are specifically designed for the demands of cryptocurrency mining. But according to Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC, miners won\'t provide a long-term benefit to Nvidia either.\n\n""As of July 30, we think demand for GPUs related to Ethereum mining will normalize and we won\'t see a large snap up in the network rate,"" Steves wrote in a note to clients. ""To put it all together, our official estimate is ($500M of GPUs) with revenue of $175M for AMD and $75M for Nvidia (last 4 months), while the exact number is difficult to calculate.""\n\nNvidia is betting on other areas like data center and artificial intelligence to be its main drivers of growth.\n\nThe winner of the civil war will be declared on August 1 at 8:20 am EST.\n\nNvidia reports earnings on August 10.\n\nMarkets Insider\n\nNOW WATCH: Stocks have shrugged off Trump headlines to hit new highs this week', 'Cryptocurrencies are still more investments than way to pay, but their mainstream acceptability continues to grow, proper regulation will follow\n\nCryptocurrencies are under the microscope as never before. Financial regulators in the US are concerned about the emergence of bitcoin and its digital cousins as speculative investments and have hinted that much tougher regulation is in the pipeline.\n\nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates the New York financial markets, issued an alert, saying it was “cautioning market participants that offers and sales of digital assets by ‘virtual’ organisations are subject to the requirements of the federal securities laws”.\n\nThe message was that selling coins issued by a digital currency provider and selling shares on the stock exchange amount to pretty much the same level of risk. This sent tremors through the digital currency industry.\n\nThe Bank of England, the UK’s main financial regulator, reckons that digital currencies remain very different from standard currencies such as sterling and the dollar because they “act as money only to a limited extent and only for relatively few people”. A spokeswoman for the Bank said it was monitoring developments.\n\nAt the same time, the consumer watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, is considering the impact of digital currencies, and plans to report on its findings later this year.\n\nThe nub of the problems the authorities are considering is that digital currencies are behaving more like an investment than simply a way to pay. Supercharged increases in the value of bitcoin and ethereum, the two largest digital currencies, have recently driven the total value of cryptocurrencies to more than $100bn.\n\nCertainly, they are becoming more acceptable as money: consumers can buy a Dell computer with bitcoin and gift card businesses in the US accept bitcoin, which can then be used at big retailers such as Walmart, Amazon and Nike.\n\nIn the UK, Theatre Tickets Direct has recently started accepting bitcoin to buy tickets for London West End shows, along with the online craft beer supermarket Honest Brew.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies about to go mainstream? Read more\n\nPeach Aviation, a low-cost Japanese airline, last month became Japan’s first airline to allow customers to pay directly for tickets using bitcoin.\n\nWhile some people are now being paid in bitcoin, others buy them from exchanges or directly via websites like eBay, from people who have “mined” the coins.\n\nBitcoin was invented in 2009 when an anonymous software developer issued the first of a limited number of coins based on the novel concept of a digital ledger or blockchain in which transactions made are recorded chronologically and publicly. Buyers and sellers remain anonymous, but the transactions are transparent and transferred at virtually no cost, unlike the transactions processed by stockbrokers and banks, which levy large fees.\n\nThe cryptocurrency quickly became popular among among tech businesses that needed to transfer large amounts of funds overseas, who saw the benefit of a cheap alternative to the major banks. Unsurprisingly, it also found ready users in the criminal class, for the purposes of buying and selling drugs online and money laundering.\n\nBut this year, bitcoin and ethereum have been behaving less like currencies and more like popular stocks that rise and fall according to market sentiment. Bitcoin’s value has trebled in a year and doubled in the past six months, to $2,648 last week, despite a 20% crash in its value in May and a slump from a peak of almost $2,900 to below $2,000 in the last two weeks.\n\nSome analysts have speculated that the currency’s value could reach $6,000 before the end of the year, making it behave more like a get-rich-quick speculative bubble, more akin to the “tulipmania” that scarred 17th-century Holland.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday the blockchain supporting bitcoin is splitting in two, as members of the bitcoin community unhappy with the digital currency’s direction set up an alternative called Bitcoin Cash. However, Bitcoin Cash will likely only be worth a fraction of bitcoin. The original digital currency is trading at around $2,778.39, but future values for Bitcoin Cash are just $288.35, or 0.103 of a bitcoin.\n\nLast week the Russian national Alexander Vinnik, who allegedly defrauded early adopters of millions of pounds’ worth of bitcoins, including funds obtained from the hack of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, was arrested in Greece.\n\nVinnik was described by the US Department of Justice as the operator of BTC-e, an exchange used to trade bitcoin since 2011, which was allegedly used to launder more than $4bn for people involved in crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking. Greek police claimed that the 38-year-old was an “an internationally sought ‘mastermind’ of a crime organisation”.\n\nUS authorities also linked him to the failure of Mt Gox, the Japan-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014 after being hacked. Vinnik “obtained” funds from the hack and laundered them through BTC-e and Tradehill, another San Francisco-based exchange he owned, according to court documents. Vinnik has copycats, who, it is widely speculated, also operate in Russia.\n\nThe Russian authorities have become increasingly concerned about the potential for digital currencies to be used for illicit means, but remain undecided about whether it is a currency or a financial asset. Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Russian central bank, has said it should be regulated as a digital asset. “We don’t consider that bitcoin can be considered as a virtual currency,” she told CNBC.\n\nBut the country’s deputy finance minister, Alexey Moiseev, recently said the authorities hoped to recognise bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a legal financial instrument next year in an attempt to tackle Vinnik-style money laundering.\n\nThe SEC is also under pressure from speculators to recognise bitcoin as a mainstream investment vehicle. The speculators lobbying for change include the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who won a $65m payout after they accused Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their social media idea as the basis for Facebook.\n\nThe brothers have since become involved in several cryptocurrency businesses and lobbied the SEC for clearance to launch a fund built to track the digital currency. Bitcoin, they reckon, is “better than gold”. Their lobbying effort has lasted three years so far, but in March was rejected again, triggering another tumble in the volatile price of the currency. But they haven’t given up, and it might not be long before clearance is achieved. A welter of regulation is likely to follow in its wake.', 'Bitcoin traders are on edge as they await the outcome of the civil war that will decide the fate of the crytpocurrency. Bitcoin is trading up 0.52% at near $2,773 a coin.\n\nOn Tuesday, core developers and miners will decide whether bitcoin remains as is or whether there will be a hard fork that splinters the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin developers want to keep the blocks that make up bitcoin\'s network limited in their size to 1 megabyte per block, while miners want to make the blocks bigger to improve the network\'s speed.\n\nUntil recently, it looked as if everyone was on board with SegWit2x, a proposal that, according to bitcoin evangelist Paul McNeal, moves the threshold for implementation down to 80% and also allows for a small increase in the size of blocks on the chain to 2 MBs. That was until bitcoin cash, an alternative to both bitcoin and the SegWit2x version, entered the picture.\n\n""Bitcoin cash basically came out of nowhere,"" Charlie Morris, the chief investment officer of NextBlock Global, an investment firm with digital assets, told Business Insider. ""A group of miners who didn\'t like SegWit2x are going to opt for this new software that will increase the size of blocks from the current 1 megabyte to 8.""\n\nFor what it\'s worth, the majority of bets placed in the gambling markets aren\'t predicting a good outcome for bitcoin. Accroding to Ed Pownall, a company spokesman at Bodog, of the 470 people who have wagered on the event, ""310 people think the price will dip below $2,000 per coin.""\n\nBitcoin is up 186% in 2017.', ""Those holding on to their Bitcoins - or hodlers as they are known in crypto parlance - despite the uncertainty that seems to hover over the Aug. 1 deadline for a network split, may now seem to have a firm reason to justify their stance.\n\nWith barely a day more, Bitcoin price has not tanked as it was earlier suggested in some quarters.\n\nJust as Bitcoin price has seen some turbulence this month following the campaign by the BCH camp to push BTC to the edge, there have been reports of a likely crash of BTC’s price to below the $2,000 range as the supposed split day nears.\n\nHowever, that does not seem to be happening.\n\nAs at the time of this writing, BTC price has touched the $2,742 point - a feat it has only achieved in June and July this year - and maintained its spot on or around this range with no major sign of budging lower anytime soon.\n\nTaking a chance? No point\n\nAside from standing by the principle behind the BTC ideology, hardcore “hodlers” are of the view that there is no point taking a chance if they are sure which side will win.\n\nOthers don't believe there is any chance for BCH to maintain its value in the long term hence its market will eventually be added to BTC’s.\n\nLitecoin shaky\n\nThe likely losers in the squabble would include coins that have had a swell in their market cap in the last couple of months. One of such is Litecoin. Aside from that, there isn’t much incentive to use Litecoin if all goes well with the SegWit activation on the Bitcoin network, nothing new is happening to the digital currency that has been dubbed the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.\n\nIn the last few days, Litecoin has dropped from the $55 point it reached earlier this month due to the momentum it gathered at the news of its being the main alternative to Bitcoin in the event of a split and non-activation of the SegWit.\n\nLitecoin has since been bleeding slowly to the price of $40. Its fall in price, however, could still be indeterminate considering that Aug. 1 is not here yet. If the market support for the BTC is sustained throughout the period and the SegWit activation gets through, Litecoin’s price will likely drop further.\n\nBetween May and July, the Litecoin market cap has almost tripled from about $800,000. Though not established, a large portion of its over $2 bln market may trickle back into Bitcoin in the coming days."", 'Image: Shutterstock\n\nA New York City Department of Education employee has been punished for mining bitcoin at work.\n\nMining bitcoin—or the process of validating blockchain transactions and releasing new coins—takes a serious amount of computing power. A single bitcoin transaction now requires more energy than an entire American household uses in a day. In 2017, it\'s extremely difficult to mine the world\'s most popular cryptocurrency without investing in expensive and space-hogging hardware.\n\nIn order to get around these limitations, one entrepreneurial man decided he would simply mine bitcoin at NYC\'s Department of Education, where he\'s worked as a computer systems manager for over a decade. Unfortunately for Vladimir Ilyayev, he was caught and fined four vacation days (worth an estimated $611) by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board (COIB), according to a recently published disposition.\n\nAccording to the document—which bears his signature—Ilyayev installed a bitcoin mining program that ran at night that he could monitor from his home. Ilyayev admitted to ""mining software on my DOE computer from 6:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. every night from March 19, 2014, until April 17, 2014, when my bitcoin mining software was shut down by the DOE\'s Division of Instructional and Information Technology.""\n\nThe disposition also makes it clear how determined Ilyayev was to get in on the cryptocurrency gold rush. It indicates that he made ""five or six"" initial attempts to install bitcoin mining tech, and each time was ""thwarted by the DOE security software."" Eventually though, Ilyayev was able to bypass his employer\'s security protocols, at least for a short while. The disposition does not explain how he accomplished this.\n\n\n\nThe DOE fined Ilyayev not just for misusing the DOE\'s computers, but also because he was making money, or engaging in a ""profit-making activity"" during work, which violates city regulations.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time a government employee has been caught mining bitcoin while on the job. In 2014, Rishard Chapoteau, who also worked at NYC\'s Department of Education, was caught attempting to mine bitcoin via a ""Raspberry Pi computing device"" that he stashed in a network closet.\n\nIn fact, according to his disposition, Chapoteau tried to install bitcoin mining software at the exact same time Ilyayev was running his. Unlike Ilyayev however, there is no evidence Chapoteau ""successfully obtained bitcoin,"" according to his statement, therefore he wasn\'t fined.\n\nLast year, a former Federal Reserve employee was also reprimanded for installing bitcoin software on his work computer. In January, he was convicted of a misdemeanor, fined $5,000, and sentenced to 12 months probation.', 'The new Bitcoin ATM installed recently.\n\nThe Malta Financial Services Authority has warned that virtual currencies (also known as cryptocurrency) such as Bitcoin are unregulated digital instruments which are not issued or guaranteed by a Central Bank or by any other authority.\n\nThe MFSA was reacting to recent articles in the media referring to virtual currency ATMs and the installation of a first such ATM in Malta.\n\n""Unlike traditional money, acceptance of payment in virtual currency depends entirely on the voluntary consent of the recipient. Furthermore providers of services in relation to virtual currencies are currently neither regulated by law nor authorised by the MFSA,"" it said.\n\n‘Bitcoin’ is probably the most well known virtual currency, however there are a number of other virtual currencies. Virtual currencies are becoming increasingly popular and it is now possible to use virtual currencies as a means to pay for goods and services. However there are a number of possible risks when buying, holding or trading such virtual currencies, including the risk of losing your money.\n\nThe European Banking Authority had issued a warning about virtual currencies and the MFSA said the public should be aware of the following risks:\n\n- Money may be lost on the exchange platform\n\nVirtual currencies may be obtained from someone who owns them or through an exchange platform. Currently exchange platforms are not normally regulated and in some cases they have failed or gone out of business with the consequence of consumers losing significant amounts of money. Exchange platforms are not banks and if an exchange platform loses any money or fails, there is no specific legal protection, such as through a deposit guarantee scheme.\n\n- Money may be stolen from your digital wallet\n\nVirtual currency is stored in a ‘digital wallet’ on a computer. Although digital wallets have public and private keys or passwords they are still vulnerable to hackers. Virtual money may therefore be stolen from your wallet. Consumers losing virtual money have little prospect of having it returned. Furthermore if you lose the key or password to your digital wallet, your virtual money may be lost forever.\n\n- You are not protected when using virtual currencies as a means of payment\n\nWhen using virtual currencies as a means of payment you are not protected by any refund rights under EU law. Unauthorised or incorrect debits from digital wallet can therefore not usually be reversed.\n\n- The value of virtual currency can change quickly, and could even drop to zero\n\nDifferent virtual currencies have different values. Furthermore the value of virtual currencies can easily go down as well as up. Unlike the value of traditional currencies, there is no guarantee that the value of virtual currency funds remains stable.\n\n- Transactions in virtual currency may be misused for criminal activities\n\nTransactions in virtual currencies are largely untraceable and provide a high degree of anonymity. This makes virtual currencies vulnerable to misuse for criminal activities such as money laundering. Law enforcement authorities may therefore decide to take action against or close exchange platforms and prevent you from accessing or using any digital funds that the platforms may be holding for you.\n\nThe MFSA also urged the public to exercise the same caution with a digital wallet as with a conventional wallet.\n\n""You should not keep large amounts of money in it and ensure you keep it safe and secure. You should also familiarise yourself with the ownership, reputability, transparency and public perception of the exchange platforms that you are considering using,"" it said.']"
