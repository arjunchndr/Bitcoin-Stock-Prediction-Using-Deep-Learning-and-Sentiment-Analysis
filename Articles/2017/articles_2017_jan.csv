01/01/2017,"['The price of bitcoin inched upward over the course of trading today, passing $1,000 for the first time on CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index since early January 2014.\n\nThough the price (at press time) was still shy of a three-year high of $1,023 set in January of that year, the milestone nonetheless marks a bright beginning to 2017 for the digital currency. (Bitcoin appreciated by more than 100% in 2016).\n\nThe price had reached as high as $999 earlier in the day only to fall back to the $960s, a pattern that was similarly observed over the last week of trading as bitcoin failed to build momentum toward $1,000.\n\nThe increase notably took place during what was a day of lower-than-average trading volume, 7-day exchange data from Bitcoinity reveals.\n\nAs asserted by analysts, 2017 is expected to be a banner year, one that could finally lead the price to pass its all-time high of $1,216.7 set in 2013.\n\nFor more on how markets analysts view 2017, find our latest feature here.\n\nFireworks image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'As the new year approaches, many aspiring entrepreneurs may consider taking a leap into the world of Bitcoin, blockchains and distributed ledger technologies. Allow this to serve as a note of caution and advice.\n\nMost important: This technology is growing up. (Not-so)-crazy ideas have become tangible proof-of-concepts with major institutions across a variety of industries. Some of these have shaped into live trials and, at the very end of the spectrum, are becoming full-blown product offerings. An example of this evolution was recently demonstrated by Visa and Chain’s B2B Connect keynote announcement at Money20/20 in November.\n\nAs a consequence of such developments in this nascent industry, entrepreneurs seeking to be taken seriously and raise money are now being held to a much higher standard than they were, say, two or three years ago, when the venture capital investment cycle began in earnest. There is a much greater comprehension of businesses that work and those that don’t. As a general rule of thumb, attempting to build wallet software or a digital currency exchange would be misguided. First, wallets, of which there are already many, generally don’t make money. And, while exchanges may be a lucrative business, it is important not to underestimate the power of incumbency.\n\nAlthough the history of financed distributed ledger–related companies is only a few years old, anyone who has been around that long will agree that four years in “blockchain time” is the equivalent of decades in many other industries. Entrepreneurs who believe they can usurp Coinbase or Blockchain.info due to having “better technology” will be forced to confront the reality of this business faster than they can say “disintermediation” (whether or not their tech is, in fact, superior).\n\nTo create a viable startup in this fast-moving, exhilarating industry, differentiation is key. Blockchain technology has moved far beyond the initial hype of bitcoin, payments and financial infrastructure. New enterprises abound in sectors ranging from real estate to healthcare, to entertainment and energy. As more large institutions, think tanks and consultancies contemplate the ramifications of distributed ledgers, smart contracts and beyond, use cases will continue to emerge out of the woodwork. Decentralization, however, has its limitations. The first wave of entrepreneurs in the Bitcoin space shouting “decentralize all the things” came to recognize this quite quickly. Decentralization should always be a means to an end, not the end itself.\n\nBut even for the most viable, brilliant business ideas, the standard for investment is a high threshold to meet. Today, the teams receiving investments have pedigrees eons beyond what many early entrepreneurs in the ecosystem could ever have boasted of, for better or for worse. With Wall Street veterans piling into the industry’s top financial firms (see Digital Asset Holdings or Ripple), creating viable competition can be near impossible. Elsewhere, most new startups are led by experienced executives in the respective fields they seek to disrupt (see Stem, Wave, or Abra). While that is not to say scrappy young entrepreneurs and hackers can’t build viable enterprises — it’s just all the harder to do so. Teaming up with expert co-founders, advisors and investors becomes increasingly more essential as this industry matures. Finding a strong niche and testing business hypotheses with such knowledgeable individuals are key to successful financings and businesses.\n\nAt the moment, macroeconomic factors, both in this industry and the global economy at large, bode well for entrepreneurs. However, winds can shift at a moment’s notice, and general venture capital sentiment is far from its bullish peak in 2015 (regarding any industry, save for maybe artificial intelligence). Those who successfully raise a seed round will indubitably experience the Series A crunch that will be both corrective for misaligned startups in the industry and extraordinarily painful for many. Beyond the first couple of stages of financing, it appears companies such as Ripple, Gem or Coinbase, as examples, are faring quite well and finding their mojo. But only time will determine their fates. It is important to note that there has yet to be a single venture-backed exit with meaningful (i.e., more than 1.5x) returns in this industry.\n\nHopefully, this does not discourage aspiring entrepreneurs from diving deep into blockchain tech. Rather, it should serve as a stern note of caution to those seeking to build a company around or upon this exciting new technological marvel. “Blockchain” may be a sexy buzzword, but it is a fundamentally unsexy technology — it is merely a distributed database. Keep that in mind before throwing it into a pitch deck, as investors are wary of the hype cycle.\n\nAnd, to those who turn to token sales, or the cringe-inducing “ICO,” as a means to raise capital: such financing methods are nothing short of regulatory Russian Roulette. Just because regulatory action has not yet been taken doesn’t mean it won’t be. Be diligent and follow best practices. This financing method shouldn’t be forsaken, but it should be approached with the utmost caution (that I will dive into in a later op-ed). Notably, all advice and warnings laid out above still apply to ICOs.\n\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Jeremy Gardner. The views expressed are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Bitcoin Magazine.', 'Bitcoin price seems unstoppable in its climb as it kicked off 2017 on a strong bullish note with these candlestick formations.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price was off to a good start for the year, as three long green candles are forming on the weekly time frame.\n\nThis reflects strong bullish pressure onto the first trading week of January, perhaps an omen of how price action could turn out for the rest of the month.\n\nPrice has taken out the long-term resistance at the $1000 mark and is setting its sights on the next ceiling at $1100.\n\nBitcoin price seems unstoppable in its climb as it kicked off 2017 on a strong bullish note with these candlestick formations.\n\nTechnical Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is still above the longer-term 200 SMA on this time frame, signaling that the long-term path of least resistance is to the upside. Also, the gap between the moving averages seems to be widening again to indicate a pickup in bullish pressure.\n\nStochastic is still hovering around the overbought region, though, so bulls might need to take a break sooner or later. If sellers take this opportunity to ramp up their bearish activity, a brief pullback could be seen on short-term charts. RSI is still on the move up, which means that there’s still enough room to go higher. The next long-term resistance is located close to the $1100 major psychological level at which some buyers could book profits.\n\nMarket Events\n\nMost of bitcoin price gains recently can be attributed to reports from China, indicating that foreign investment continued to pick up towards the end of 2016 even as the government moved to curb this activity. Investors have been looking for higher returns elsewhere while monetary authorities attempted to devalue the local currency.\n\nTo top it off, a bit of anti-dollar sentiment has allowed bitcoin price to sustain its climb. Investors are starting to feel the jitters for the Trump administration. Breaking past the $1100-1200 highs could open the door for further upside in the cryptocurrency for the rest of the month or even throughout the quarter, as geopolitical uncertainties are dampening investor sentiment so far.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Remitano is different from other centralized exchange platforms currently in the market, which are heavily dependent on the banks to receive deposits and facilitate withdrawals for customers.\n\nBanks have a history of harassing centralized exchange platforms. The recent example of accounts belonging to some of the well-known Malaysian centralized exchanges being shut down by the banks caused a great trouble to customers trying to cash out or make deposits. Such situations have led to increased attention towards P2P exchange platforms that can nullify the ability of banks to shut down or dictate terms to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe Remitano P2P Exchange deals only with Bitcoin and leaves all banking related activities to the users so that the operation is not hindered by banks’ temper. Even though Remitano is a latecomer to the party, it stands apart from other existing exchange platforms because of its simple UI and friendly customer support. In the case of any issue, Remitano customers can jump on a live chat and get their questions answered and issues solved quickly. In addition, the 0.5% fee charged by the platform is lower than the other major platforms in the market.\n\nThe platform is a product of Seychelles based Babylon Solution Limited operating in many countries including the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Nigeria, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, India, Tanzania and Ghana. According to traffic metrics, it is the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Vietnam. Other leading sources of traffic on Remitano are Nigeria and Malaysia. Soon, the platform aims to establish itself as the largest Bitcoin exchange platform in other Asian and African countries. With the introduction of its service in the United States and Australia, Remitano platform is on an expansion spree, which it will pursue aggressively to build a global presence.\n\nAbout Remitano\n\nRemitano is a product of Babylon Solutions Limited – incorporated in Seychelles. It provides escrowed P2P Bitcoin marketplace where people buy and sell Bitcoin easily and safely.\n\nLearn more about Remitano at – https://remitano.com\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: Phuong Nguyen\n\nContact Email: press@remitano.com\n\nContact Phone: +84943217821\n\nLocation: Seychelles\n\nRemitano is the source of this content.

It no longer wants data about Jeffrey Berns, a lawyer who also happens to be fighting the IRS’s “John Doe” request in court.\n\nBerns originally filed a motion on December 13th asking the U.S. District Court for Northern California to stop the IRS’ subpoena of Coinbase records. The IRS believes that its request, filed in November, is justified because Bitcoin owners “may fail, or may have failed, to comply with one or more provisions of the internal revenue laws.”\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nBerns is represented by his own law firm, Berns Weiss, whose motion argues that the IRS data search is “an abuse of process” and “overbroad.” Berns has said his motion is intended to defend not only himself, but all targeted users.\n\nBut according to a December 28th court filing by the IRS, Berns is no longer a target of its records request because he identified himself in his own filing, and the request is only for unidentified users. Therefore, the IRS argues, Berns is not a party to proceedings and his request to block the data grab should be thrown out of court.\n\nIn response, Berns Weiss had its own spin, telling Coindesk that “The IRS’s willingness to withdraw the summons as to Mr. Berns only because it is now aware of his identity,” and without the additional information they’re seeking about many other Coinbase users, “Makes it clear that the IRS does not have a legitimate purpose in seeking substantial personal and financial information concerning approximately 3 million Americans.”\n\nCoinbase has said it is ready to mount its own legal challenge when subpoenaed, citing concern over customers’ privacy rights.\n\nBitcoin Price Could Triple Under Donald Trump in 2017\n\nThe IRS’s sweeping request for Coinbase user information may seem overreaching, particularly in the post-Snowden era when government intrusion is a bugaboo for many. But experts are divided as to whether resistance to the motion is justified. Clay Littlefield, a financial technology specialist at the law firm Alston & Bird, told Fortune that the request is comparable to those previously used effectively in the 2009 IRS crackdown on Swiss tax shelters including UBS.\n\n“When it comes to taxes,” said Littlefield, “You’re not entitled to that level of privacy.”\n\nNotably, UBS faced a hefty fine in that case, suggesting Coinbase could face liability for its customers’ failure to properly pay taxes.\n\nFor more on Bitcoin, watch our video.\n\nLittlefield also identified the deeper issue at stake. “The [IRS] request challenges a fundamental expectation” of “complete anonymity and privacy” by bitcoin users.\n\nMore bitcoin advocates and experts are acknowledging the reality that “regulatory arbitrage” is a key value proposition of the technology, and that tighter oversight is a risk to its appeal. For Coinbase and other exchanges, one key regulatory advantage is that they’ve so far avoided being required to file 1099-B financial reports to the IRS on behalf of their customers, as do many exchanges trading other kinds of assets.\n\nBut the taxman, however slow, eventually comes for us all.\n\nA hearing on the dueling motions from Berns and the IRS is currently set for January 19th.', 'The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have proposed amending a directive on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing that will require cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets to identify suspicious activity, a directive that would include identifying bitcoin users.\n\nThe directive constitutes the main legal instrument to prevent the EU financial system from being used for money laundering and terrorist financing. The directive, to be transposed by June 26, 2017, establishes a framework to require member states to identify and mitigate risks related to money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nTechnology has created alternatives for financing that are beyond the scope of EU legislation that should no longer be justified, the proposal [PDF] noted. To keep pace with evolving trends, new measures to improve the existing preventive framework are needed.\n\nCryptocurrencies Addressed\n\nAs of May 2015, the directive made no mention of cryptocurrencies. If and when cryptocurrencies are included among AMLD directives, anonymity during transaction exchanges between crypto and fiat currencies will be obsolete.\n\nThe European Parliament in May approved a proposal for a task force to investigate the role of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nThe vote to establish this task force came soon after the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) recommended that the EU Commission consider revising EU payment laws, on the basis of its assessment of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nParis Attacks Called For Change\n\nThe push for the amendments came amid increased regulatory debate about cryptocurrencies following the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Much of the debate focused on the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency exchanges and prepaid cards.\n\nThe proposal for the amendment came within a week of Europe’s central law enforcement authority, Europol, published a report explicitly stating that there is no evidence of ISIS using bitcoin as a means to finance its activities.\n\nExchange services between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers are not presently required to identify suspicious activity, the new proposal stated.\n\nTerrorists Can Conceal Transactions\n\nTerrorist groups can benefit from the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency platforms and can transfer money into the EU’s financial system, the proposal noted. Hence, it is essential to extend the scope of EU Directive 2015/849 to require exchange services between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies as well as custodian wallet providers.\n\nFor anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, authorities should be able to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies, the proposal stated. It would safeguard technical advances and the high degree of transparency attained in alternative finance and social entrepreneurship.\n\nThe anonymity of cryptocurrencies enables their misuse for criminal purposes. Requiring exchange services between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers will not fully address the issue of anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions since the virtual currency environment will largely remain anonymous since users can also transact without these providers.\n\nAlso read: European Commission seeks to end anonymity of bitcoin transfers\n\nProposal Seeks Oversight Of Cryptocurrency Users\n\nTo combat risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units should be able to associate cryptocurrency addresses to the identity of the owner of such currencies. The possibility of allowing users to self-declare to authorities on a voluntary basis should also be considered.\n\nThe proposal defines “virtual currencies” as a digital representation of value that can be digitally transferred, stored or traded and accepted by natural or legal persons as a medium of exchange, but does not have legal tender status.\n\nIt defines “custodian wallet provider” as an entity providing services to safeguard cryptographic keys on behalf of customers, to holding, storing and transferring virtual currencies.\n\nUnder the new proposal, member states are required to ensure that exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies, and custodian wallet providers, are registered.\n\nThe proposal also addresses anonymous prepaid cards, which are easy to use in financing terrorist attacks and logistics. Hence, it is essential to deny terrorists this means of financing their operations by further reducing the limits and maximum amounts under which obliged entities aren’t required to apply certain customer due diligence measures provided by Directive (EU) 2015/849.\n\nIt is important to lower the thresholds for anonymous prepaid cards and to identify the customer in the case of remote payment transactions exceeding 50 Euros, the proposal noted.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin has been held back by the same arc of resistance now for the past 4 days. Readers of my last column will recall that 2 days ago I posted a chart which demonstrated that the 2 arc of the 5th pair was resisting. Though I have hypothesized that an eventual close above the arc is likely in the cards, that arc has not been defeated by the bulls yet.\n\nHere is a close-up of this 8-hour chart, so you can more easily see how the 2nd arc has been the key resistance for 4 days now:\n\nSo, will we see higher highs in the days to come? I continue to believe so, but we still don’t have a buy signal on the 8-hour chart. A re-test of the 920 low might well be in the cards. At this point, a 920 test will probably hit the 1×1 Gann angle (blue line), which would likely energize pricetime to begin it’s advance anew.\n\nHere is a daily chart with a long-term Andrews’ pitchfork:\n\nThe “1 line” has been broken to the upside, but is being tested as these words are written. See a close-up of the “1 line” below:\n\nAccording to pitchfork theory, a serious advance is predicted, all the way to the zero line (not shown). However, before we mortgage the house to leverage ourselves long, we need to be reminded of this shorter-term setup on the daily chart:\n\nWhile I continue to believe 2017 will be an even better year for Bitcoin than 2016 was, there could well be a significant trading opportunity (on the short side) in a week or two, in the $1025 area…\n\nHappy trading!\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgement.

(Reuters)\n\nBitcoin has become the barometer of outflow from China. Over the past 24 months, wealthy Chinese have been moving money out of China, and now the flu has caught middle China too. Chinese authorities’ attempts to postpone the day of reckoning by continuing with their debt fuelled reflationary policies have made Chinese economy dangerously lopsided and financial sector crises prone. We have been bearish on Yuan since early 2015, citing that a weak currency is an inevitable fallout of their economic path and divergent monetary policy path of Fed and others. Since then, Yuan has weakened by 15% against US Dollar. We continue to see further depreciation in coming days.\n\nBitcoin has been on an upward trend, primarily driven by demand from Chinese, looking to hedge against a weak Yuan and low domestic deposit rates. With outflows running at over half a trillion dollars this year, if it had not been for relentless intervention from the Chinese central bank, Yuan would have depreciated far more than 6.96/97 levels, it is currently trading at against the US Dollar. However, selling dollars and buy Yuan to prop up the value is not without cost. As the Chinese central banks intervenes it tightens the supply of Yuan flow into the economy, thereby tightening monetary policy. They have been able to offset that by keeping rates capped and stimulating the economy using fiscal levers. However, the relentless stimulus flow since 2009 has increased leverage in the system to astronomical levels, which is now well over 350% of GDP as per some private estimates. Productivity of debt has collapsed, as it takes nearly 4 dollars of debt to create a dollar GDP, a level which if continued can trigger a financial crises down the road. China needs to rebalance its economic engine, away from production and investment to consumption and also needs to bring down leverage. Both these steps would have to done over long period of time and would weaken growth for a long time.\n\nIn the pecking order of currencies in the emerging market basket, Rupee has moved places in 2016. In Between January to October of this year, Rupee was one of the underperformers. It had weakened against 18 of the 23 major EM currencies. INR underperformed inspite of a sizable portfolio inflows. However, post demonetisation, there was a sea change in performance. The local unit gained against 20 out of 23 key emerging market currencies. This kind of a performance is truly spectacular considering that Indian capital markets, both bonds and equity, suffered the worst outflow in Asia. This perplexing behavior of Rupee was made possible by intervention from the central bank.\n\nBetween end of 2015 and end of October 2016, FPIs had bought USD 7 billion (net) of stocks and bonds from Indian capital markets. However, that was dwarfed by the USD 16/18 billion of dollar purchases by RBI from the open market to build its reserves. As a result, Indian Rupee not only depreciated against the US Dollar, but it also underperformed against its peers in the emerging market. Things changed when RBI reversed its role from being a buyer to a seller post demonetisation. Post November 8th, RBI’s FX reserve is down nearly USD 11 billion, primarily due to sales of USD in the spot market. Anecdotally we can say that RBI was also active in the forwards and futures market too, selling USD and preventing it from appreciating against US Dollar. During that same period, FPIs sold between USD 11/12 billion in local stocks and debt market. Therefore, it can be said that RBI more than compensated for the purchases of dollars by FPIs. End result was Rupee clocking a significant improvement in performance post November 8th.\n\nIn 2017, there are two variables to consider when deciding upon what the Rupee might do in 2017. One, the broader trend of US Dollar and finally, what will RBI do in the market. Our expectation is that the broad trend of US Dollar would be upward, primarily due to US first policy of Trump administration as well as divergent monetary policy path between US and rest of the world. As far as RBI goes, they would look to shore up the reserves in the first quarter of 2017, after a near USD 11 billion depletion in Q4 CY16. Therefore, it can be concluded that in first quarter of 2017 or at most during first half of 2017, Rupee may weaken past 70 mark against USD.\n\nApart from RBI, we need to keep an eye on the following major events which would also have an effect on Rupee, stocks and bonds. They are:\n\n1) Demonetisation is a part of a larger plan to formalize the economy and GST is a step towards a needed tax reform. However, post require a cost that the economy must pay during the transition phase, by way of demand and jobs. We believe it is a medium term pain for the long term gain of the nation.\n\n2) Oil and commodity prices are not at levels where it can threaten either inflation or current account. Hence they are not a major driving factor for Rupee as of now. We expect non-agri commodities, including oil to remain in a range for 2017 and hence should not post much of a threat to Rupee.\n\n3) The theme for 2017 will be Mr. Trump and how he shapes the policies of US government, both, domestic as well as foreign. Certain policies are being talked about are:\n\nBorder tax proposal: Under which they would look to tax imports and make export earnings tax free. If such a plan is enacted it can throw a spanner into the wheels of global trade. Such a step can adversely impact economies in EM, esp of China.\n\nYou May Also Want To Watch:\n\nTax amnesty scheme: Under this US corporates would incentivized to repatriate trillions of dollars of profits from offshore destination at a very low tax rate.\n\nFiscal stimulus plan: This can raise public deficit and push US bond yields upward\n\nProtectionist policies and anti-offshoring policies: These can adversely impact China and other EMs. India can get affected, if the anti-offshoring policies focused on ITES and Pharma.\n\nThe new bonhomie with Russia will reshape global geo-politics, at the expense of Middle East and Europe.\n\n4) Apart from Trump, the next big player in 2017 would be Europe. People in Europe will head for polls in major countries from France, Hungary, Italy and Germany. Markets will react negatively if Euro skeptic parties win in any of these countries.\n\nTechnically, the pair has spent almost a year consolidating. After a rapid rise during 2015, consolidation was warranted. Unless, the dynamic changes for USD vs EM currencies in 2017, there is real possibility of a resumption in the uptrend in USD/INR in 2017. Demand zone, defined by annual average and trend line is placed between 66.50/67.00 regions. However, USD bulls need to eclipse the supply closer to 69.00 handle. Incase of a clear break above 69.00, can bring about 70.50/71.00 in focus.', 'The Western African nation of Senegal to soon introduce a digital currency in the region to function alongside existing CFA. Read more...\n\nThe African continent has emerged as a leader in digital currency and blockchain technology adoption. The West African nation of Senegal may soon contribute to the digital currency revolution by launching eCFA.\n\nThe proposed eCFA is the digital version of CFA francs being currently used by either independent states in West Africa. Expected to be launched sometime in 2017, eCFA will be rolled out by the Banque Régionale de Marché – regional bank of Senegal.\n\nAccording to reports, the new eCFA is expected to promote financial inclusion in the region by offering easy access to money and financial services to the unbanked and underbanked population. The eCFA will be designed to work with existing financial platforms like M-Pesa to ensure a wider reach. There are speculations about eCFA being a blockchain-based cryptocurrency which will operate alongside existing CFA. However, no solid information is available yet.\n\nIf and when eCFA becomes a reality, people in Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, and Togo will be able to use it for regular transactions. With only 20 percent of the African population having access to basic banking services, it may prove to be a game-changer, influencing other African nations to follow suit.\n\nThe development and implementation of eCFA will rest upon Banque Régionale de Marché and its partner in the initiative — eCurrency Mint Limited. It will be in compliance with the e-money regulations introduced by Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (the central bank of West African Economic and Monetary Union).\n\nThe use of electronic currency in Africa can be traced back to the success of M-Pesa — the mobile based e-currency. M-Pesa has a huge customer base in Kenya and its neighboring countries. Now there are other Bitcoin-based financial services platforms offering a range of services in the region.\n\nBitpesa is one such platform that recently introduced B2B payment services for businesses in Nigeria and surrounding nations. It allows businesses in the region to make cash transfers to banks in China through its Bitcoin-backed service.

01/02/2017,"['LONDON (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin kicked off the new year by jumping above $1,000 for the first time in three years late on Sunday, having outperformed all central-bank-issued currencies with a 125 percent climb in 2016.\n\nBitcoin - a web-based “cryptocurrency” that has no central authority, relying instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new bitcoins to the system - jumped 2.5 percent to $1,022 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, its highest since December 2013.\n\nThough the digital currency has historically been highly volatile - a tenfold increase in its value in two months in late 2013 took it to above $1,100, before a hack on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange saw it plunge to under $400 in the following weeks - it has in the past two years been more stable.\n\nIts biggest daily moves in 2016 were around 10 percent, still very volatile compared with fiat currencies, but markedly lower than the trading of 2013, which saw daily price swings of as much as 40 percent.\n\nBitcoin may have been boosted in the past year by increased demand in China on the back of a 7 percent annual fall in the value of the yuan in 2016, the Chinese currency’s weakest showing in over 20 years. Data shows most bitcoin trading is done in China.\n\nBitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and does not fall under the purview of any authority, making it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China‘s.\n\nIt is also may appeal to those worried about a lack of supply of cash, such as in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed high-denomination bank notes from circulation in November.\n\n“The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high risk, alternative,” said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association and co-founder of Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for institutional investors to access digital currency exchanges.\n\nThough bitcoin is still some way off the all-time high of $1,163 that it reached on the Bitstamp exchange in late 2013, there are now more bitcoins in circulation - 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes. Its total worth is at a record-high above $16 billion, putting its value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.', 'New Year has indeed turned out to be great for the Bitcoin community. The cryptocurrency has broken through the $1000 barrier for the first time since 2014, exhibiting its potential as the mainstream currency of the future.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to enjoy the unprecedented growth, the same can’t be said about other leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, upon gaining popularity led to the rise of other alternative cryptocurrencies which are now categorized as altcoins. Some of the leading altcoins at the moment are Ether, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, Ethereum Classic and Dash.\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency platform in terms of market capitalization. Overall, 2016 has been good for Ether too as its value went up from less than a dollar to $7.93 by the year end. The value to ether crossed $20 in between, only to lose steam later on. Unlike bitcoin, ether’s price chart shows a downward movement in the last two months (the time when Bitcoin price picked up).\n\nLitecoin, whose second largest cryptocurrency tag was lately taken by Ethereum, had a sober year. The altcoin, trading at about $3.5 in January 2016 ended the year with a modest increase of $1.2. It reached a maximum of $5.6 sometime in mid-2016.\n\nRipple, the fourth largest cryptocurrency has been showing a downward movement inverse to the bitcoin price. Currently at $0.0063 per unit, Ripple started at $0.0060 per unit in January. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Monero — the Cryptonite based digital currency has exhibited an increase in its price in the past few months. Monero is stated to be one of the leading anonymous cryptocurrencies at the moment. Thanks to its adoption by few darknet marketplaces, its adoption has considerably increased. Monero started trading earlier this year and the price has picked up from $0 to $14.40 in less than 12 months.\n\nSimilarly, the seventh largest cryptocurrency Dash has been having a good run. the cryptocurrency has had a relatively less volatility throughout the year. Bitcoin’s rally has affected most of the altcoins, except for Dash. The reason for weak performance among other altcoins in the past few months can be attributed to the shift in interest among cryptocurrency traders. Many traders seem to have switched to Bitcoin trading to cash upon the climbing prices. Once bitcoin’s price stabilizes and hits a plateau, altcoin trading is expected to resume, leading to better performance in the market.\n\nRef: Coinmarketcap | Image: Shutterstock', 'What sets Remitano Bitcoin P2P exchange apart from its counterparts is that its service in multiple countries operates without the need of a banking partner, completely shielding the service from their whims and fancies.\n\nRemitano provides escrowed P2P Bitcoin marketplace where people buy and sell Bitcoin easily and safely. The platform is a product of Seychelles-based Babylon Solution Limited operating in many countries including the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Nigeria, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, India, Tanzania and Ghana.\n\nWhile other centralized exchange platforms currently in the market are heavily dependent on the banks to receive deposits and facilitate withdrawals for customers, Remitano is completely independent from traditional banking partners.\n\nBanks are known to harass centralized exchange platforms. Recently banks caused a great trouble to customers trying to cash out or make deposits at some well known Malaysian centralized exchanges by shutting them down.\n\nPeople are increasingly moving towards P2P exchange platforms due to such situations. They are looking for platforms that can nullify the ability of banks to shut down or dictate terms to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe Remitano P2P Exchange deals only with Bitcoin and leaves all banking related activities to the users so that the operation is not hindered by banks’ temper.\n\nRemitano’s UI and friendly customer support is what further sets it apart from other existing exchange platforms. To ease the customer experience, Remitano also provides a live chat option to its users in case of any issue. In addition to that, the 0.5% fee charged by the platform is lower than the other major platforms in the market.\n\nRemitano, according to traffic metrics, is the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Vietnam. Other leading sources of traffic on Remitano are Nigeria and Malaysia. The platform is aiming to establish itself as the largest Bitcoin exchange platform in other Asian and African countries. With the introduction of its service in the United States and Australia, Remitano platform is on an expansion spree, which it will pursue aggressively to build a global presence.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of NewsBTC or any of its team members. NewsBTC is not responsible for the accuracy of any of the information supplied in Sponsored Stories/Press Releases such as this one.', ""George Harrap is the CEO of Bitspark, a Hong Kong-based cash-in, cash-out remittance service leveraging bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Harrap gives a deep dive into his takeaways from nearly three years of running a bitcoin-based remittance startup. His conclusion? Bitcoin is still a game changer.\n\nAs of the end of 2016, we are now about seven years into the bitcoin experiment. In that time, remittances have gone from one of the most buzzed-about use cases for bitcoin to one that's billed as one of its biggest challenges.\n\nSo, can bitcoin make an impact as an intermediary for exotic currencies not often traded? Can it help deliver cash on the ground quicker and cheaper?\n\nWell, it turns out there's a lot of ways to approach remittances – from private blockchains, consortiums, apps, FX dealers to decentralized cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet's explore some of them below.\n\nWhat doesn't work\n\nTraditional FX integrations\n\nOnly a tiny minority of currencies are freely floated and exchangeable outside their country of origin (generally, it's the top eight currency pairs: USD, EUR, AUD, GBP, CAD, JPY, SGD, HKD).\n\nPrices are as good as they get here and spreads are tiny, but these are the currencies of rich countries, not of the recipient nations of remittances globally.\n\nThere are of course other currencies that are freely traded. But, if we are to solve the issue of remittances globally, we would need close to 180 currencies to be able to be transacted easily and cost effectively, and this is not currently possible.\n\nSo, FX providers and websites providing FX services are great for B2B payments between the above currencies, and there is an immense market for that.\n\nBut, this is not the use case we are discussing, the use case we are interested in is that of cash distribution on the ground to individuals in currencies and countries that are often not well connected to the financial system.\n\nFX providers work fine, however, more is involved to deliver cash to the street corner where its needed by the recipient.\n\nP2P netting of payments\n\nAs startups, TransferWise and CurrencyFair popularized this model, but banks have been doing it for decades.\n\nEssentially transactions going from A to B and B to A can be ‘matched’, and instead of actually transferring the money via the SWIFT network, you can keep currency A and B in-country. The ownership of those balances will then change to be withdrawn domestically via lower cost domestic withdrawal methods.\n\nIt's a neat idea, but it works only for the most frequently traded and transacted currency pairs where there is an equal amount going each way to 'match'.\n\nFor the big remittance recipient countries, there are always more transactions going in than is coming out, so matching an equal number of transactions to and from is mathematically impossible.\n\nAt the end of the day you will need to send money to the destination and how will you do that?\n\nLikely a bank-to-bank transfer, which for exotic currencies are always expensive. So you are not solving any problems here and will be subject to those higher exchange rates at the end of the day and will need to use traditional forms of settlement.\n\nP2P apps\n\nThis model is still trying to establish itself via mobile apps, but fundamentally, it actually is based on an ancient system that has been in operation for thousands of years called ‘hawala’.\n\nMobile apps try to make this more efficient by digitizing the connections between people that power the system.\n\nHowever, people need to trust the places they are putting in and receiving money. The usual workflow is deposit money with someone on the app, then the person at the other end will withdraw it from someone else at the recipient end.\n\nP2P apps generally want to try to connect you to people who can act as links in the chain nearby. However, some guy on the side of a street you track down via a dot on GPS doesn't exactly illicit trust.\n\nSo, the logical conclusion is that you onboard trusted entities who deal in cash: the money transfer operators (MTOs, or physical cash money transfer shops), and MTOs are not about to ditch their complicated compliance and remittance system for a mobile app.\n\nEven if you assume the most optimistic scenario (where let's say people trust the guy by the side of the road), how will it be scalable for that person to handle hundreds or thousands of transactions via an app that will eventually attract the attention of government agencies?\n\nGetting money into and out of the app is the hard part. Hawala has been working for centuries, but it will just take time for people to adjust to applying it with new technologies.\n\nIn our experience, we have found many foreign workers sending money home often have long established trust with the shop they send money home with or the guy on the motorbike who collects their cash at a construction site.\n\nSwitching to something new is daunting, and it is also why bitcoin ATM-powered remittances haven't taken off. Nobody trusts new things.\n\nPrivate blockchains\n\nIf you are a bank, a private blockchain may offer a few benefits to you in settling payments between your intermediaries or other banks.\n\nHowever, when other currencies are involved, the lines get blurred, and there is no way to avoid the global FX markets.\n\nIf you have a tokenless blockchain (that is, a unit of account that does not have a floating open market price), there is no 'value' to transact across borders, it is merely a database entry on either your system or your connected intermediaries' – and this is possible without a blockchain.\n\nIf you have a blockchain with an underlying value token, you need buy-in from entities in your private blockchain system other than yourself to act as counterparties and, regardless of how you structure it, it will never be as liquid as the global FX markets.\n\nThere may be a case to be made for exotic currencies (which are not currently traded or adequately connected to global FX markets), but settling payments across currency pairs requires liquidity.\n\nA private blockchain requires buy-in from entities other than yourself, so the solution may be to setup a consortium to debit and credit balance between consortium members using a blockchain as an asset-tracking database.\n\nConsortiums in this space that might be set up to debit and credit payments between each other are an efficient way of settling payments, but it requires everyone to be on the same page (or ledger).\n\nWhat Does Work\n\nCentral bank blockchains\n\nI have previously theorized that the use of a blockchain-type system is inevitable for central banks – it offers them the control and oversight they require, while also removing inefficiencies in the existing monetary system.\n\nAll private banks dealing in a national currency would also be participants in the blockchain and be running the same ledger – any transactional payment metadata can be associated with the blockchain transaction is built into the currency itself.\n\nThis provides the benefits of a consortium described above (all on the same ledger debiting and crediting balances on the ledger) and also effectively handles end-of-day clearing.\n\nCentral banks are not innovators (to say the least), so it will be slow for this to catch on. But I would argue such a move will be inevitable, as it aligns with their goals: more control over monetary policy and better oversight of their licensees.\n\nVarious central banks have been talking about blockchain pilots and, as competition between jurisdictions in this space heats up (we are already seeing this with various 'FinTech rankings' of regulators), more are likely to follow.\n\nUsing a token of value\n\nPhysical money transfer shops have customers because they are trusted entities dealing with physical cash.\n\nToday, there are a few bitcoin-and-cash startups around the place, but we believe there is space for 10x more of them, in every country, in every currency.\n\nBut, these brokers need to have access to local forms of payments. Maybe people in one country predominantly get their cash and pay bills, whereas other countries people pay with prepaid RFID cards.\n\nWhatever the payment method, it's important to have companies on the ground who understand this and can offer their services using the local mechanisms, while accepting bitcoin in exchange for these localized payments.\n\nThe problem bitcoin solves here is reducing capital requirements.\n\nWith bitcoin you don't need to take a $10m position to batch a small payment. You can transfer each individual $200 transaction individually for close to no cost internationally. Game changer!\n\nWhat if I want 5,000 Liberian dollars right now, how can I make that trade? Normally it requires various antiquated in-country mechanisms, bank contacts, accounts, shaking the right peoples hands and ultimately settlement through the US dollar – a very time-consuming and costly process.\n\nHowever, bitcoin is traded 24/7 around the world at the touch of a button.\n\nThe ‘last mile’ is an essential part of this, and in our case, we connect all the existing last-mile providers and act as the bridge between them.\n\nWe don't seek to disrupt their business, but to offer them new efficiencies.\n\nPegged cryptocurrencies\n\nOne of my favorites for a while now has been pegged cryptos, particularly the decentralized kind, like Nubits. (While the Nubits project has had some hiccups of late, I think the idea is intriguing.)\n\nEssentially these pegged cryptos are a token of value that adjusts automatically to market conditions to maintain a peg to a chosen fiat currency or commodity.\n\nHowever, it only works if its decentralized. If I have to trust any company or single entity along the way for a pegged crypto it becomes uninteresting and subject to all the common problems associated with holding customer funds.\n\nBut, having 180 parallel FX assets can't be understated, this will be huge.\n\nIf it costs me nothing to trade into and out of a token of value for exotic currencies, this will be a massive boon to the remittance industry.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, there you have it. The truth about bitcoin remittances is that the digital currency can and already does bring value to the remittance industry.\n\nIt's providing a solution for trading into and out of exotic currencies.\n\nAs a token of value it is reducing barriers to entry, simplifying back-office work for new companies in the space, and at the end of the day, providing superior pricing to end users – even when taking into account the last mile.\n\nAs more people realize this, we believe we're in for exciting years ahead.\n\nPaper boats image via CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

The short-term moving average coincides with the bottom of the channel at the $1000 psychological level, adding to its strength as a near-term floor in the event of a correction. The 200 SMA is close by so a spike lower could still bounce off this region.\n\nStochastic is still hovering around the overbought levels, which suggests that buying pressure could fade as bulls might want to book profits off their recent long positions. RSI is starting to turn lower to reflect a return in selling momentum, offering a chance for a quick countertrend play at the channel resistance around $1075-1100.\n\nMarket Events\n\nMost global exchanges are set to reopen today, opening the door for more bitcoin price moves in either direction. So far, fundamentals are supportive of more gains as investors appear to be positioning for the macro themes expected to come into play for the year, including euro zone elections, Brexit, and Trump’s administration.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that Caixin just reported a surprise gain in China’s manufacturing PMI from 50.9 to 51.9 to indicate a stronger pace of industry expansion. This could draw investors back to mainland assets instead of hunting for higher returns in offshore investments and away from the yuan. Still, recent reports highlighting the outflow of funds from China could further encourage traders to ditch local market holdings in favor of better yields.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

In the beginning of 2016, the Dow opened at around 17,150 points. Throughout the year the Dow continued to increase but in the final months, it stumbled, failing to cross the 20,000 mark.\n\nThe Dow declined further as the new year approached, dropping by another 57 points over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin in comparison has maintained its upward trend, rising dramatically as the new year approached.

It was also the first mainstream media outlet to cover Bitcoin’s price rally earlier this month, as CNBC’s Brian Kelly appeared on national TV to outline the reasons for the rise of Bitcoin.\n\nOn Dec. 29, as mainstream investors and Wall Street traders anticipated the Dow to hit 20,000 points, CNBC sent a message to investors and traders globally. CNBC’s Jeff Cox stated: “Forget about Dow 20K: Bitcoin\'s about to hit $1,000.”\n\nNick Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, also said in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin is rapidly gaining momentum amid global economic instability as people are desperately searching for alternatives to store and protect their wealth.\n\nColas emphasized that Bitcoin is one of the only currencies or stores of value that has the ability to guarantee investors and traders a safe haven asset like protection. Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, Colas stated that the price of Bitcoin will continue to climb and reach $1,000 shortly before the Dow hits 20,000.\n\n""It is one tool that many people around the world use to try to preserve wealth. Bitcoin has gone from being just a nerd\'s version of gold years ago to now being another thing people do to try to hold onto their wealth,” said Colas.\n\nHe also noted that the price of Bitcoin, when the currency gains real mainstream market dominance and adoption, will truly be colossal in a period wherein mainstream users can simply walk into a coffee shop to purchase coffee solely with Bitcoin.\n\n""It will be mainstream when you can walk into a bank and order a Bitcoin account. We\'re not close to that yet,” Colas added.', ""download (Illustration by Lauren Loftus - KJZZ)\n\nThe cryptocurrency Bitcoin has catapulted into the limelight in recent years. But bitcoin has some problems and other cryptocurrencies have been vying for market share.\n\nOne that’s been gaining notoriety is based here in Phoenix.\n\n\n\nThe Dash coin currently has the seventh largest market cap of all cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\n\n\nRyan Taylor, the Director of Finance for Dash, said their coin is based on the bitcoin software but with some increased functionality.\n\n\n\nFor example, one of Bitcoin’s main selling points is that in theory, users collectively make a decision about how they want to change the Bitcoin software. And then in order to implement the updates, users have to actually install the new updated software.\n\n\n\nBut in reality, necessary updates have stalled for long periods as key users haven’t agreed about what to do.\n\n\n\n“A much better system is to actually have people vote through the network itself based on their holdings,” Taylor said. And to do that, they've built a voting mechanism directly into the coin.\n\n\n\nTaylor explained that’s just one of the ways they’ve made a better digital currency. But they are also attempting to address Bitcoin's other drawbacks, including speed of transaction and privacy concerns.\n\n\n\nWhich cryptocurrency will ultimately reign supreme is unclear, but with cryptocurrency advocate Mick Mulvaney joining the Trump administration as Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the future of digital currency in the U.S., including for Dash, might be about to change."", 'If you’re hoarding cryptocurrency, now might be a good time to cash in: Bitcoin’s value has jumped to $1,023, a figure it hasn’t come close to since December 2013.\n\nReuters reports that the currency climbed by 125 percent last year, with the largest daily moves amounting to a maximum of 10 percent through 2016.\n\nThat’s in spite of major incidents that could’ve upset the fate of the currency, including Australian cryptographer Craig Wright’s claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, and the theft of $65 million worth of the currency from an exchange platform called Bitfinex last August.\n\nIt’s possible that Bitcoin’s value rose because of an increase in demand for the cryptocurrency in China, which is believed to see more Bitcoin trading than anywhere else in the world and which saw a 7 percent slump in the value of its national currency, the yuan.\n\nThe highest value Bitcoin has ever reached is about $1,163, which it hit towards the end of 2013. Prior to that, the community backing it was stunned by the baffling theft of $460 million worth of Bitcoin from Mt. Gox, another Bitcoin exchange that once handled roughly 70 percent of all BTC transactions.\n\nThe firm has since filed for bankruptcy and its CEO stepped down from the Bitcoin Foundation. However, there are now more bitcoins in circulation than ever before, with roughly 12.5 BTC being added to the system every 10 minutes.\n\nRead next: Windows 10 Creators Update will reportedly arrive in April', 'We met with Elizabeth Stark in Helsinki where over 17 thousand people gathered for the major two-day Northern European startup event. The Slush conference, aptly named after the weather conditions that couldn’t prevent startup enthusiasts and investors from coming, was held in the biggest exhibition space in the Finnish capital city but at some panels you didn’t even have any elbow room. Bitcoin evangelists and Blockchain practitioners drew out record-breaking crowds, with Elizabeth Stark, a recognized leader on the future of technology, always in great demand.\n\nElizabeth Stark is a friendly person but also a fiery speaker who has lived all around the world, from Singapore to Berlin to Rio. She also is an entrepreneur, co-founder and CEO of Lightning.\n\nNext big thing\n\nI caught up with Elizabeth in the relative quiet of the backstage behind a water wall and asked her what next year’s big disruption will be.\n\n“I’m really excited about the potential for smart contracts, said Stark. “First came Bitcoin, then Blockchain, then distributed ledger technology, and for the next I don’t know what the name is going to be, but I see so much potential for smart contracts. For example, most people don’t realize this but Lightning even itself is a smart contracting system. It uses the Blockchain as its arbiter. We can debate the merits of a complex smart contracting language but I do think 2017 will be much more the year of smart contracts and the narrative will be around all the possibilities that are present there.”\n\nBut can’t it be that smart contracts will turn out to be just another buzzword with too much media hype around it? Early this year, banks moved in droves toward exploring “Blockchain,” but it seems they cooled off somehow lately, with some banks dropping out of the R3 Consortia…\n\nFaster payments\n\nStark thinks it doesn’t mean the end of the banks’ Blockchain experiments:\n\n“R3 is one example of a consortium in the space, but there are other venues. To me, having been involved in Bitcoin from fairly early on, there was a point at which banks wouldn’t have even thought of going into Blockchain. The fact that so many did realize it is a big deal, and they got involved, which is encouraging. I don’t have any insider information but it seems some of them are going their own way, building their own versions of their own technology so won’t need to be a part of R3 or any preferred consortium.”\n\nThe cold and dark December Helsinki was obviously ready for Lightning, a decentralized network that uses smart contract functionality in the Blockchain to enable instant payments.\n\n“A group of us started working on Lightning last year,” says Stark, “and one of the things I’m really excited with Lightning is its ability to connect different Blockchains. Lightning can work to scale Bitcoin, but it also can work to scale or connect chains. You could have two different assets, and they can be swapped in a decentralized fashion. I could foresee a world in which there can be different assets, equity, issued by various financial institutions and banks, and they could go clear through Bitcoin’s Blockchain, the public decentralized chain. Because there can be liquidity between those two assets and Bitcoin, and you could have decentralized atomic swaps between those chains.”\n\nBut how would you put assets on the Blockchain? Will it involve legal entities anyhow?\n\n“Let’s say I’m a bank and I start issuing USD. I’ll have to be a custodian. The consumer will have to go back to me in the end if they want a physical currency. There’s an amount of trust involved. Some corporations can issue shares on a chain, and then you still have to trust corporations will give you the shares that they’ve said you had. But you could also have a legal framework to have it enforced.”\n\nWar on cash\n\nThe crisis of 2008 gave us not only the Blockchain, but also stricter banking laws and KYC legislation. Now when trust in fiat currencies is melting, central banks are waging cash wars. What is the significance of it?\n\n“From country to country, banks are trying to get cash out of circulation,” explains Stark. “In the early days of Bitcoin – and I was really into Bitcoin, but I wasn’t in the community yet – many were concerned that governments would clamp down and declare Bitcoin illegal. Now Bitcoin still has different statuses, in some countries it’s illegal, but by and large it’s legal. It’s not that there’s legislation in the US that declares Bitcoin illegal, no one can run it, no. And how do you stop people mining? I was not happy with the legacy of the BitLicense. I think New York got it wrong, and they had to suffer the consequences when lots of companies either blocked New York or moved away. We still don’t know the full legal landscape. This is familiar to me because of a lot of work I’ve done previously on copyright and Internet law. It’s going to take time for the law to catch up, but my hope is we’ll craft policy that enables the expansion of this technology, and no one gets to stop it.”\n\n“There were good examples in the history of the internet. In the US, early internet policy by and large got it right – for example, enabling people to create the Googles of the world. Had they created a different law, it might not have been possible.”\n\nBut back in 1997, everyone thought everything on the Internet should be free. The major problem was how to earn money with the Internet. And now we have Google and Facebook that have larger market caps than British Petroleum. Can’t we end up with some big corporate totalitarian Blockchain?\n\n“I disagree,” says Stark. “First we had smaller proprietary networks, then things turned more towards the world wide web, and anybody could build on top of that whereas no one could build on top of proprietary networks. It was the web that won out.”\n\n“There were times before when AOL didn’t even have a web browser, and they added it. Then in the 2000s it was more about recentralization, the cloud, Facebook …things recentralized and I really do see Bitcoin and broadly, its protocol Blockchain as an opportunity to re-decentralize. I still see the Internet as a decentralized network, it really is, if you look at its map, it’s not centralized.”\n\nCorporate control\n\n“About control of Bitcoin from corporations like Google - it’s not built that way. We can debate which Blockchain will be the biggest in 10-20 years, but I think Bitcoin has so much potential still. We are still in the early days. People want us to be in 2010, but we’re still in 1994-95. Back then, the Internet was a totally different place. We hadn’t seen a huge amount of the applications that were built on top of it. The fact is that in an open decentralized network anyone can build on top of it whereas if you have a corporation that controls it you may have access, but they are going to decide what is permissible, and they can change it in a heartbeat.”\n\n“I’ve done a lot of work on the issue of copyright policy, and how it intersects with Internet freedom, and with Lightning one of the most exciting things is that you can have small value payments on the internet that you were never possible before. So with Lightning you could pay a couple of cents every time you read an article or watch video, and you have new means for remunerating people who are creating on the internet. This model can take us away from advertising model that inevitably wants to track people because they want to target people to make the most money out of that ad. To me, Bitcoin provides a lot of opportunities for different kinds of models on the internet where we don’t have to be reliant on advertising.”\n\nRole of governments\n\nNow governments are trying to reign over Bitcoin, but could it be the way around? How could Bitcoin change the government?\n\n“What Bitcoin does is it provides us with a protocol that is decentralized and the means of exchange of value that we don’t rely on one single entity, a government or a financial institution. In the wake of a lot of potential instability I think Bitcoin is only going to rise in importance. It’s global, it relies on cryptography and math. Will it change the government? If anything, it’ll provide a means of not having to rely on government. We don’t know what’s going to happen next in the US, it’s anyone’s guess at this point, because so much is changing, but what I see it doing is it shifts the balance of power. And it distributes it decentralized in a way that is going to be extremely valuable.”\n\nDecentralization of the internet\n\nWhat drives Elizabeth who as in Lightning is on one side of the world today and on the other tomorrow?\n\n“I have a background at the intersection of science and technology and a lot of the work I did was related to open source and decentralized tech. I was into the decentralization of the internet, way Bitcoin was around so when I first heard about it I was teaching at Yale and Stanford University about the future of the internet. In 2010, I read an article about ‘open source money.’ I heard about it and thought it was cool but didn’t think it was going to work! Many of us weren’t sure. And as I started hearing more about it, and learning more about it, I then got excited about Bitcoin as a protocol. You just read everything, and you get addicted. And here I am today.”', 'Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, believes bitcoin is more likely than Ethereum to have an intentional split in 2017, according to a tweet he posted in response to a tweet about the United Arab Emirates choosing Ethereum over bitcoin for a real estate pilot program. Ragnar Lifthrasir, chairman of the International Blockchain Real Estate Association, had tweeted the UAE is being irresponsible by using Ethereum because it is too unproven, too mutable and unstable compared to bitcoin to be used as a real estate database.\n\n@Ragnarly Past performance not indicative of future results; I actually think BTC is more likely than ETH to split in 2 in 2017 — Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2016\n\nLifthrasir’s comments touched on the proof-of-stake versus proof-of-work debate.\n\nLifthrasir, in criticizing the UAE’s decision, pointed to the exploit of the DAO, caused by a vulnerability in its smart contract programming language that allowed the removal of $145 million worth of Ether. Ethereum developers created a new network with new rules. Miners adopting the new version executed a hard fork on July 20, 2016. Such events showed a small group of individuals can make significant changes to Ethereum for investment-boosting or political reasons, Lifthrasir said.\n\nLifthrasir Cites Ethereum Issues\n\nThe hard fork created another problem because not all Ethereum miners accepted the changes and continued to mine the older chain called Ethereum Classic, causing the two chains to compete, Lifthrasir further noted. This created two databases. Hence, a real estate title application built on the earlier database could have two competing title claims, which Lifthrasir cited as a fatal flaw.\n\nEthereum has been hard forked intentionally three times between August and December of 2016 to address technical issues, he added. It experienced an unintentional hard fork on November 24, 2016, when Parity and Geth clients fell out of sync, temporarily creating two blockchain versions.\n\nEthereum developers considered switching to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work, posing a risk to its functionality, stability and security.\n\nBitcoin has nearly 400,000 times the hashing power of Ethereum and its market capitalization is 23 times greater, Lifthrasir said, two data points that indicate the level of network hacking difficulty.\n\nButerin Clarifies\n\nButerin later clarified that he was referring to an intentional, ETC/ETH style fork, not an accidental consensus split.\n\n@Ragnarly To clarify I\'m referring to an ETC/ETH style fork, not accidental consensus splits — Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2016\n\nButerin also tweeted that “the notion that blockchains are ‘all about’ one-X-to-rule-them-all is silly maximalism.”\n\nLifthrasir responded that if the UAE government has a two-step in when a blockchain fails and splits into a pair of competing chains, they have selected the wrong blockchain.\n\nButerin replied that the UAE can also simply “choose the chain that makes sense.”\n\n@Ragnarly @macwind Competition = free market. The notion that blockchains are ""all about"" one-X-to-rule-them-all is silly maximalisn. — Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2016\n\n(The Dubai Museum of the Future Foundation has established the Global Blockchain Council to explore transactions through the blockchain platform, CCN reported earlier this year. The council will examine the blockchain’s impact on future business and finance, and its role in facilitating transactions within both the financial and non-financial sectors as ways to improve efficiency and reliability levels.)\n\nAlso read: Ethereum successfully hardforks to address vulnerable vectors\n\nButerin Expands On Proof Of Stake\n\nButerin continues to expand on proof-of-stake. He recently explained his position in Medium. He observed that a blockchain protected only by social consensus would be too slow and inefficient to address disagreements; economic consensus thereby services an important role in protecting safety properties in the short term.\n\nWhere proof-of-work operates on a logic of massive power incentivized by massive rewards, proof-of-stake relies not on rewards for security, but on penalties.\n\nThe best protocols are those that work well under various models and assumptions, Buterin noted – “economic rationality with coordinated choice, economic rationality with individual choice, simple fault tolerance, Byzantine fault tolerance…”\n\nConsensus protocols that work as quickly as possible carry risks and must be approached very carefully if they should be approached at all, he noted.\n\nImage from Flickr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
01/03/2017,"['Image copyright Getty Images\n\nDigital currency Bitcoin has seen its value top $1,000 (£815) for the first time in three years after it ended as the best-performing currency of 2016.\n\nIt traded as high as $1,029 on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nAnalysts are attributing its jump to increased demand from China, which is where most Bitcoin trading takes place.\n\nBitcoin relies on web-based transactions handled across thousands of computers and is used as an anonymous way to move money globally.\n\nAs a result, some speculate that people in China are using it to circumnavigate strict government rules aimed at preventing money from leaving the country.\n\nThe value of China\'s currency, the renminbi, fell by about 7% last year.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin\'s value rose by 125% in 2016, making it the world\'s best-performing currency when compared with its central bank-issued peers.\n\n""The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making Bitcoin look like a viable, if high-risk, alternative,"" said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association.\n\nDavid Moskowitz, the founder of Coin Republic, a Singapore-based Bitcoin brokerage, believes some investors now see the currency as a haven asset.\n\n""The run-up since November could be due to Indian demonitisation followed by Venezuela capital controls and rumours of similar actions in more countries,"" he told the BBC.\n\nHow Bitcoin works\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.\n\nBut it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.\n\nHowever, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.\n\nTo process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.\n\nFor each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins.\n\nImage copyright Eyewire Image caption Verifying bitcoin transactions takes a lot of computer power\n\nThis provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems.\n\nTo compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.\n\nThere are currently about 15 million Bitcoins in existence.\n\nTo receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent.\n\nSince there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.\n\nThese addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings.\n\nThey operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned.\n\n\'Resilience\'\n\nThe value of Bitcoin has been volatile since it was first launched in 2009, and many experts have questioned whether the crypto-currency will last.\n\nThe last time Bitcoin was trading above $1000 was in late 2013.\n\nBut later that year the currency experienced daily price swings of as much as 40% after the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange was hacked and saw the currency plunge to under $400.\n\nHowever, some experts expect Bitcoin to continue its recent strong run.\n\n""As asserted by analysts, 2017 is expected to be a banner year, one that could finally lead the price to pass its all-time high of $1,216.7 set in 2013,"" CoinDesk said.\n\nMr Moskowitz said: ""At some point there will be a correction but my outlook is still very positive as Bitcoin has shown its resilience.\n\n""It\'s been declared dead 115 times and is still the best way to send value directly from person to person without anyone being able to prevent that transfer.""\n\nThere are also more Bitcoins in circulation than ever before and it is estimated 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes.\n\nIt is estimated the crypto-currency\'s total worth is now above $16bn.', 'Facebook users in Australia are being tricked into handing over money as scammers use the social media site to demand bitcoin or iTunes gift cards as payment.\n\nAccording to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), thieves are hiding behind familiar organizations that the general public are likely to trust such as utilities and telecommunication agencies.\n\nIn a report from SBS, a regional news site, Australians had lost over AU$70 million to scams by October’s end.\n\nHowever, according to Delia Rickard, ACCC deputy chair, this figure doesn’t represent the overall number of scams that target Australians. Not only that, but nowadays, scammers are changing the tactics that they use when targeting their victims.\n\nPayment in Bitcoin\n\nWith the introduction of bitcoin cyber criminals are now demanding this as a form of payment from their victims instead of the traditional wire transfer. Scammers seem to particularly prefer payment in bitcoin when they deploy ransomware as computers need to be unlocked. In many cases this can cost victims hundreds and thousands of dollars to retrieve the keys from the thieves.\n\nLast August, research from Check Point discovered that the sophisticated organization of Cerber, a Ransom-as-a-Service (RaaS), was reported to have had a total estimated profit of $195,000 in July alone from ransom payments from victims.\n\nAt the time of reporting researchers stated that the average ransom payment was one bitcoin, which at the time was worth around $590 to decrypt files locked by the Cerber ransomware. If the deadline was not met, then the ransom was doubled to two bitcoins.\n\nIn June, an improved version of CryptXXX ransomware raked in 70 bitcoins, worth more than $45,000 in three weeks at the time, after fixing a crypto flaw that allowed victims to recover their data for free.\n\nWhile a Canadian university was ordered to pay a bitcoin ransom totaling around CAD$20,000 to obtain the decryption keys to restore its data.\n\nBitcoin and Scams\n\nWith the introduction of the digital currency, bitcoin, it seems that thieves are focusing more attention on how to get their victims to hand over the currency.\n\nWith its worth now over $1,000 for one bitcoin, the digital currency is proving quite profitable to those who want to get their hands on it in unscrupulous ways.\n\nWhile bitcoin is making headway as an alternative form of currency for those who want to break away from traditional banking methods, it seems that scammers will also continue to demand payments in the digital currency until better forms of protection can be offered to potential victims.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'As the year kicks off with an all-time high market cap for Bitcoin on its eighth birthday, 2017 promises to be an exciting year for Bitcoin, digital currency and blockchain technology in general.\n\nIn this first week of the new year, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to a variety of thought leaders and stakeholders in the industry, to offer a look ahead.\n\nRoger Ver, Bitcoin Evangelist and Investor\n\n“2017 is likely to be the best year yet for Bitcoin. We are already seeing all-time new highs in terms of market cap. All-time new highs in terms of price per bitcoin are likely just around the corner as well. Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come, and clearly the separation of money and state is happening right before our eyes. And with the former CEO of Barclays bank being appointed to the board of Blockchain.info, I think 2017 will be the year we see traditional banks becoming deeply involved in Bitcoin, too.”\n\nEric Lombrozo, Bitcoin Core Developer and Co-CEO of Ciphrex\n\n“2017 will continue to see further modularization and layering of network architectures. We will also see tremendous breakthroughs in privacy-enhancing crypto, practical demonstrations of trustless — or minimal trust — off-chain protocols with the promise of economically viable instant microtransactions, and general improvements to bootstrapping mechanisms for extending blockchain networks with less social friction.”\n\nKathleen Breitman, CEO of Tezos\n\n“I think one of the most remarkable things about the space to date is how receptive regulators have been to learning about use cases for both private and public blockchains. With respect to public blockchains, I think we will see regulators continue their ‘wait and see’ approach, putting emphasis on financial control at the exchanges but keeping a light touch on the technology itself.”\n\nAlejandro De La Torre, Business Development at BTC.com\n\n“If the demonetization as we’ve seen in countries like India and Venezuela continues, I expect to see a blossoming of Bitcoin interest. Another trend I see emerging is Bitcoin security. Many users are realizing that their bitcoins are not safe in exchanges and are switching to wallets that have beefier security or using cold storage.”\n\nStephen Pair, Co-Founder, President and CEO of BitPay\n\n“I believe we\'ll see a renewed focus on the Bitcoin blockchain. We\'ll see a few new applications of the Bitcoin blockchain that do surprisingly simple, yet very powerful, things. People will begin to see Bitcoin in an entirely new light.”\n\nAaron Voisine, Co-Founder and CEO of Breadwallet\n\n“I predict that 2017 will see bitcoin become recognized as a legitimate ‘uncorrelated asset’ for a large number of money managers and financial advisors. Holding a diversified portfolio of assets is of course what any prudent financial advisor will recommend. This however doesn’t do you much good if those assets’ value all move in the same direction at the same time. In order to achieve diversification, you need to hold some assets that increase in value when the others go down. Bitcoin is a perfect example of an asset that has shown to increase in value in times of fear and economic turmoil, and one that I think many money managers will begin to see as a prudent addition to their portfolios.”\n\nAnthony Di Iorio, CEO and Founder of Decentral and Jaxx\n\n""I\'m predicting new well-led projects emerging that provide improvements and enhancements on Bitcoin and Ethereum infrastructures. Two projects I have my eye on in 2017 are Rootstock out of Argentina and Qtum out of China. I\'m also quite optimistic about Zcash, Monero, and Dash.""\n\nManfred Karrer, Developer and Founder of Bitsquare\n\n“I expect three things. One, regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges will come. Two, the war on cash, gold and cryptocurrencies will accelerate. And three, privacy-protecting technologies like Monero and Zcash will elevate in importance.”\n\nSusanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Founder of BitNation\n\n“I find smart contracts applied in the dispute-resolution realm most exciting, because it holds the promise to decentralize some of the most important parts of society: Governance, Law and Security. In an era when only 3% of Americans feel that they can always trust their elected officials, according to a Pew Research Centre report, this development is timely. Several initiatives are already emerging, including DAMN, Decentralized Court, Crowdjury and, of course, BitNation’s Pangea platform.”\n\nMax Kordek, CEO of Lisk\n\n“I believe that VCs will discover the value of cryptocurrencies or so-called ‘App Coins,’ and will begin to massively invest in this area of the industry. Secondly, projects like Lisk and Ethereum will be ready to let developers dive into blockchain development, which will become a ‘trend’ just as iOS development became a trend and a vast industry. Lastly, user experience will become a much more important focus point for blockchain projects. Their respective leaders will realize that creating elegant user experience is a necessity to gather mainstream adoption.”\n\nTrace Mayer, Host of the Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast\n\n“Bitcoin’s network effects will get further entrenched during 2017. One trend I think we’ll see will be in scalability via Segregated Witness, which will lay the foundation for millions of daily users. Also, many current and new use cases and financialization will appear with ETFs, which I believe will pave the way for massive amounts of investment capital to come into the industry.”\n\nJoey Krug, Co-Founder of Augur\n\n“I think the biggest trend in 2017 will be the first wave of decentralized applications going live on Ethereum. Bitcoin allows us to send money around trustlessly, but Ethereum allows us to do things with the money trustlessly, like controlling when and when it cannot be sent programmatically, to a finer degree than Bitcoin’s script allows for. This is a big deal because it means we’ll finally start seeing some fun and practical consumer-focused applications of Blockchain tech. Think decentralized prediction markets, decentralized poker and more.”\n\nAlex Tapscott, Co-Author of the Book “Blockchain Revolution”\n\n“One, a major central bank will live test a digital fiat currency and it will work very well, leading to broader adoption. Additionally, large banks will begin shifting large amounts of OTC [over-the-counter] transactions to real-time settlement on private distributed ledgers. Look for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Santander to lead the charge. And companies large and small and in every industry will begin developing a blockchain strategy, hiring key IT talent and launching pilots. I’m talking insurers, healthcare providers, music labels, defense contractors, you name it. And finally, bitcoin will hit $2000!”', 'Microsoft Excel, the most widely used spreadsheet program in the world will enable bitcoin support in 2017. The confirmation comes ten months after the feature was revealed to be in its development state – which it continues to be at the time of publishing – within the Microsoft Office software suite roadmap.\n\nFirst revealed in March 2016, the feature was among 84 other updates (at the time) that were in development.\n\nPinning bitcoin as a currency, a description for the feature, at the time, read:\n\nBitcoin Currency Format Support\n\nNow use Excel to track, calculate and analyze Bitcoin data using native Bitcoin number formatting options. Feature is first being rolled out to Excel 2016 for Windows, Excel Online, Excel Mobile for Windows and Excel Mobile for Android.\n\nAlthough the feature continues to be in development presently, support for the world’s most widely-known and used cryptocurrency is pinned among the most anticipated new Office 365, according to one Microsoft executive.\n\n“In 2017, Excel will be able to recognize, format, calculate and analyze numbers expressed in Bitcoin currency,” wrote Martin Butler, the account executive for all General Electric (GE) engagements from Microsoft.\n\nA quick look at the Office 365 roadmap reveals currency format support for bitcoin, in development, across multiple platforms. This hints at currently ongoing development to include bitcoin support, across every platform with Excel implementation, individually.\n\nAs speculated earlier, enabling native bitcoin support could include recognition of bitcoin as BTC within Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, the surging value of bitcoin could see BTC denominations up to 8 decimal counts, compared to the standard of two for fiat currencies.\n\nMicrosoft, the maker of several of the world’s most widely-used software is notable for its bitcoin-friendly stance from as early as 2014. In a significant endorsement of the cryptocurrency, Microsoft began accepting bitcoin, via payment processor BitPay, as payment for digital products including games and apps in its Windows and Xbox stores.

That it continued through New Year is unusual in itself – we normally see an end of year correction in the more traditional financial assets as investors take profits off the table before the new year sets in. Bitcoin, it seems, is a little delayed in these traditional asset patterns, and it’s correction has taken few days longer than we might have expected. No big deal, juts something we’ve got to respond to now, instead of last week.\n\nAction overnight was pretty volatile. We saw price run up to fresh highs in the 1075 arena, before dropping to where we currently trade, somewhere in the region of 1045-1050. It’s this area that’s going to define the early stages of today’s trading, giving us a pretty solid region to focus on as things get kicked off.\n\nSo, with this in mind, and as we shift into the European morning session today, here’s a look at what we are targeting, and where we are looking to get in and out of the markets on our intraday strategy. As ever, take a quick look at the chart below to get an idea what’s on. It’s an intraday chart with five minute candlesticks, and it’s got our range overlaid in green.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range for today’s session is defined by in term support to the downside at 1044, and in term resistance to the upside at 1057. It’s a pretty wide range, but we’re going to stick with breakout for now, as this looks like the most likely action given recent volatility.\n\nSpecifically, a close above resistance will put us in long towards an upside target of 1068. Conversely, a close below support signals short towards 1034.\n\nLet’s see how things play out.\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Further devaluing the Yuan seems the only plausible scenario, although it is impossible to predict the outcome.\n\nThe recent Bitcoin price surge is mostly driven by Chinese traders. Increasing fear of capital outflows and the ongoing Yuan devaluation make Bitcoin a viable alternative investment opportunity. It is evident the Chinese government is running out of ideas to stabilize the economy. In fact, it appears the Yuan will continue to slide down a slippery slope.\n\nTo be more precise, it seems the increasing Bitcoin demand hints at a further Yuan devaluation. Even though the Chinese currency has consistently lost value throughout 2016, the problems are far from over. Another reason for the Bitcoin demand is fear of future capital controls.\n\nWhat Does 2017 Hold For The Yuan?\n\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult for Chinese residents to make strategic investments. Converting Yuan to foreign currency is limited to US$50,000 per year. Additionally, the PBOC will require a reason when people ask to exchange large sums of money to foreign currency. This indicates the fear of stricter capital controls is more than justified at this stage.\n\nOther options to exit the devaluing Yuan are not easy to come by either. Foreign investments are curbed and scrutinized a lot more than a few years ago. Sending money abroad is not a great solution either, due to limitations and high fees. It appears Bitcoin is the only viable way to circumvent these capital controls in the country right now.\n\nBut there are even bigger concerns regarding the future of the Yuan that need to be taken into account. The effect of monetary policy continues to diminish over time. Reduced interest rates have not stabilized the value by any means. With the money supply rate outpacing economic growth, there is too much social capital to go around. Plus, the lack of investment opportunities almost forces residents to look for alternative financial opportunities.\n\nRectifying this situation will not be an easy feat either. Further devaluing the Yuan seems the only plausible scenario, although it is impossible to predict the outcome. All of this can be seen as positive news for the future Bitcoin price. However, it is always difficult to accurately predict how the markets will respond to this news. It is evident the Yuan will continue to struggle in 2017, and other currencies will benefit from this situation.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk\'s product team.\n\nThe following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.\n\nThis past week saw yet another move in the ongoing scuffle between the IRS and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.\n\nIf you haven\'t been following the story, here’s a summary:\n\nIn November, the IRS presented Coinbase with a summons requiring the company to disclose client transactions between 2013 and 2015. Coinbase has hinted that they\'d rather not.\n\nShortly thereafter, a Coinbase customer presented a motion against the IRS, alleging the subpoena was too broad.\n\nThis week, the IRS responded, saying what effectively amounted to ""go away"". It claims that since this client has identified himself as a Coinbase user, he is now excluded from the original summons, and his motion is irrelevant (which would make sense if all they wanted was the clients’ names, but the summons asks for much more than that).\n\nThis case has the bitcoin community understandably concerned. Aside from the violation of privacy, there is the strong impression that this is prosecutorial.\n\nSimply through association with Coinbase, clients appear to be under IRS suspicion.\n\nDeeper issues\n\nThe IRS is probably only after high-net-worth individuals, but the damage is done. If the request is successful, bitcoin users and businesses are likely to feel vulnerable, even when they\'ve done nothing wrong.\n\nBut, the potential harm in terms of sentiment is not the most pressing concern. A deeper issue is insufficient regulation.\n\nAccording to a November report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IRS does not have a coherent virtual currency strategy.\n\nWhen policy isn\'t being put to practice, this leads to confusion and unpredictability, neither of which create a good environment for development.\n\nUsually, businesses and individuals are willing to comply with reasonable rules. Not knowing what those rules are leads to unnecessary expenditure and reluctance to engage.\n\nYet even that isn’t the main problem. A bigger concern is that we don’t know how to regulate cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin is eight years old, and lawmakers still don\'t have a clear idea of what to do about it.\n\nSlow progress\n\nThat\'s not to say progress isn\'t being made.\n\nSeveral institutions and governments are studying the problem, establishing working groups and publishing papers. A few seem to be moving down a path that the respective local ecosystems appear happy with.\n\nTo be fair, virtual currencies are still a minuscule part of the world economy, so they understandably haven\'t been a priority. Their presence is growing, however, and the disruptive threat is becoming more obvious.\n\nAlso, we are facing completely new circumstances. History is not lending us a hand here. Never before have we had such interpersonal connectivity, and the fallout from lack of control over information is not limited to the field of finance.\n\nAdd to the mix the slippery concept of bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, and the confusion becomes even more understandable.\n\nThey don\'t belong to any specific jurisdiction, no-one controls them, and no official organization can influence where they go.\n\nHard ceiling\n\nWhich brings us to the question: Is it possible to regulate this new technology?\n\nIt helps to consider what type of regulation we want, and what it is we\'re trying to control. Consumer protection rules already exist in many jurisdictions. Anti-money laundering disclosure requirements are already part of the financial landscape. Neither are technology-specific.\n\nTax evasion isn’t, either. Cryptocurrencies may provide a vehicle, but the tech is not the problem here. The IRS move against Coinbase isn\'t about bitcoin – it’s about lack of information.\n\nThe implied threat and the accompanying publicity of the legal action will push some transactions elsewhere, perhaps to less cooperative environments. In the process, it threatens to damage a young network with significant potential to contribute to economic development.\n\nClear guidelines on disclosure requirements for individuals and businesses will help avoid the collateral damage from shortsighted summonses, but a sharper focus on what really matters will help clarify what rules are needed.\n\nJust as this new technology is making us rethink the concept of value, so we need to re-evaluate what regulation is for, and what is needed to enforce it.\n\nThe issue is not cryptocurrencies or even their uses. The issue is information: what is necessary, and who provides it.\n\nBoxing gloves image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

While bitcoin breached the all-time high in USD market cap, several new digital currencies claimed a place in the spotlights as well, while the blockchain buzz arguably peaked it all.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin Magazine kept up with all of it. Looking back on 2016, we compiled three top 6 lists, with our best-read topics in technology, business and news.\n\nThese were 2016’s six top news stories, by popularity.\n\n6. IRS Orders Coinbase to Hand Over Customer Data\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) took the Bitcoin community by surprise late November.\n\nThe US tax agency ordered major exchange and defacto wallet service Coinbase to hand over customer data for all users that bought bitcoin between 2013 and 2015. An extraordinary request, as the targets of the investigation are not specified, but instead referred to as a group of “John Does”. The request may also be a sign that the IRS is taking a more pro-active stance toward digital currency users and businesses in the U.S.\n\nShortly after the request was issued, Coinbase denounced the IRS' move, announcing it plans to challenge the order in court. About two weeks ago, a Los Angeles attorney also asked a federal judge to halt the IRS probe. And only yesterday, the IRS asked the court to dismiss the motions.\n\nIndeed, the story is still developing; but it already secured a #6 spot in our top news stories for 2016.\n\n5: The Rise and Fall of The DAO\n\nThe DAO made headlines in 2016. As a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), The DAO was a code-based investment company built on top of Ethereum, in which shareholders were the decision makers of the project. By May of this year, The DAO had collected more than $150 million worth of ether, shattering previous crowdfunding records.\n\nAnd then it got gutted.\n\nDue to a bug in the code (or as the perpetrator may argue: a feature), someone was able to withdraw millions of dollars worth of ether from The DAO in June. Even before the “company” had made any investment, the project was drained for about a third of all its funds.\n\nWhat followed was a cat-and-mouse game between the developers behind The DAO and Ethereum, and the hacker; an engaging saga for Bitcoin Magazine readers, securing a fifth spot in our top 6 news stories for 2016.\n\n4: Bitcoin Cloud Services Uncovered as Cloud Mining Ponzi Scheme\n\nWith an exclusive story published in June, Bitcoin Magazine uncovered the supposed cloud mining service “Bitcoin Cloud Services” (BCS) as what appeared to be a blunt Ponzi scheme.\n\nPictures as well as videos of the hardware facility turned out to be photoshopped, fooling and defrauding an estimated 4,300 customers. Rather than paying out profits from mining, the company most likely paid old users in money invested by newer users, while keeping some of it. Indeed, a straightforward scam.\n\nUnsurprisingly, BCS is no longer active; it seems its operators ran off with an estimated loot of up to 2,500 bitcoins, worth well over $500,000 at the time.\n\n3: Craig Wright’s “Satoshi Nakamoto” Saga\n\nAnother year, another Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIn May, Australian computer scientist and businessman Craig Wright “revealed himself” to be the man behind the moniker of Satoshi Nakamoto, inventor of Bitcoin. Major media outlets including the BBC and the Economist reported on the news, while the claim was also backed by several prominent figures in the Bitcoin community. Most notably former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen — but also New Liberty Dollar issuer Joseph VaughnPerling and others.\n\nWhen it came to providing cryptographic proof of his claimed second identity, however, Wright failed. While Wright did publish a signature made with a private key only Satoshi Nakamoto should control, it turned out to be a publicly available signature, found in Bitcoin’s blockchain.\n\nWright followed up with an odd apology, claiming he could not prove he was who he said he was. And while some still hold on to their belief that Wright really is the inventor of the pioneering digital currency, most have dismissed the possibility by now.\n\n2: The Halvening\n\nWhen Bitcoin first launched, miners earned 50 bitcoins for each block they mined. But this number is halved every four years, or more specifically: every 210,000 blocks. This ensures that Bitcoin’s block reward eventually decreases to zero, limiting the total amount of bitcoins that will ever be in circulation to 21 million.\n\n2016 marked the year of the second block reward halving. Dubbed “the halvening,” July 9 was the day that Bitcoin’s block reward decreased from 25 new bitcoins to 12.5 — not counting fees. It represented a key moment in Bitcoin’s history, reflected in the popularity of the topic on Bitcoin Magazine, and secured a second-place spot in our top 6 news stories for 2016.\n\n1: “The” Ethereum Hard Fork and the Birth of Ethereum Classic\n\nThe rise and fall of The DAO was one of the biggest news stories of 2016. But its aftermath was even more significant.\n\nTo reimburse investors of The DAO, the Ethereum Foundation eventually opted to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain. It was a controversial decision, as it questioned both the “code is law” mantra and claims of “amorality” long perpetuated by creators of The DAO as well as developers behind the Ethereum project itself. Furthermore, not all users agreed with the hard fork. While polls and other data suggested that a majority within the Ethereum community supported the radical solution, a sizable minority did not.\n\nSome of these users objected to the Ethereum Foundation’s decision so strongly, that they refused to make the switch to the new version of Ethereum when the hard fork happened in July, and continued to use the “original” Ethereum blockchain. As a consequence, the Ethereum’s network and currency split in two. Rather than one Ethereum, there were multiple: “Ethereum” and “Ethereum Classic.”\n\nBoth Ethereum and Ethereum Classic continue to chug along to this day. And while the combined market cap of the two has fallen sharply since Ethereum’s heights, both digital currencies claim a top-ten spot by market cap.\n\nAnd, a number-one spot in our top 6 news stories for 2016."", 'The ongoing dispute over an attempt by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue a ""John Doe"" summons on Coinbase, a company which facilitates transactions of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, continues to play out in court. Today, Coinbase customer and attorney Jeffrey K. Berns, the Managing Partner of Berns Weiss LLP, filed an answer to the IRS\' response to his motion to intervene and quash a ""John Doe"" summons served by the IRS on Coinbase to identify Bitcoin users.\n\nThe case began in November of 2016 with a request filed on behalf of the IRS to serve a ""John Doe"" summons on all United States Coinbase customers who transferred Bitcoin, a convertible virtual currency, from 2013 to 2015. A ""John Doe"" summons is an order that does not specifically identify the person but rather identifies a person or ascertainable group or class by their activities.\n\nThe initial request was granted by Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. In response, Berns filed a motion to set aside the ruling and prevent the summons from being issued. He did so as an ""intervenor"" meaning that he was asking the court to allow him to participate in the legal process even though he had not been specifically named in the original summons, arguing that the summons was overbroad and would expose private customer data to hackers. Berns was also concerned about the ""chilling effect"" the summons could have on the entire blockchain technology industry.\n\nOn December 27, 2016, the IRS filed a motion in court to allow the tax agency to proceed with the ""John Doe"" summons. The IRS argued, in part, that since Berns had ""outed"" himself as a Coinbase customer, he was no longer subject to the summons. That means, argued that IRS, that the matter as it affects Berns was resolved, making the motion moot and clearing the way for IRS to begin to identify Coinbase customers.\n\nHowever, in the latest round of legal maneuvering, Berns has filed a reply to the IRS response, countering the IRS\' argument. Berns argues that the IRS is attempting to ""artificially moot the motion"" because it does not want the Court to scrutinize its actions in pursuing a summons he characterizes as ""improper."" Berns also argues that the ""John Doe"" summons statute does not allow the government to shield itself from inquiries into whether it has acted in good faith. Finally, Berns contends that the Court should reconsider its decision to allow IRS to issue the summons when questions remain about the IRS\' motives for seeking the information; specifically, Berns disputes that there is any basis for the IRS ""or anyone to conclude that it is likely that Coinbase’s customers are engaging in any tax avoidance conduct merely because they opted to transact with virtual currency.""\n\nBerns points to the fact that IRS has withdrawn its summons as it applies to him; the IRS says that because Berns identified himself as a Coinbase customer, it does not need any further information about him from Coinbase. Berns says this is proof that the summons was issued in bad faith, stating that if IRS does not need any specific transaction or related information for Berns, it similarly should not need that information for any other Coinbase customer. Berns says that the withdrawal of the summons as it applies to him is merely a ""transparent attempt by the IRS to avoid judicial review.""\n\nIn Berns\' most recent motion, he notes that he is prepared to withdraw his initial motion if the Court reconsiders its initial ruling. His goal, he says, is to protect the rights of Coinbase’s customers ""from the clear bad faith conduct of the Government in obtaining the right to serve the IRS summons."" Additional inquiry into the Government\'s motives, he says, is necessary.\n\nWithout further legal action, the motion is scheduled to be heard on January 19, 2017.', 'Update (3rd January, 20:00 BST): Ripio has clarified that it has closed $1.9m in funding, but intends to raise $2.3m.\n\nArgentinian bitcoin startup Ripio has announced what may be the first funding round of the new year, raising $1.9m in new capital amid a rebranding.\n\nThe company plans to raise an additional $400,000 in funding over the next 90 days via AngelList, bringing its total funding to $2.3m.\n\nThe Series A round was led by Huiyin Blockchain Venture, a China-based VC fund launched late last year by multi-billion-dollar investment firm Huiyin Group. Other participants in the round included Boost VC, Digital Currency Group and Draper VC – investors that also took part in the startup\'s $600k funding round in 2014.\n\nLaunched in mid-2014 as the startup\'s bitcoin brokerage (an adjunct at the time to its processor BitPagos), Ripio now becomes the company\'s flagship brand.\n\nAccording to representatives, the decision comes as the startup\'s mission has shifted more toward consumer-facing services.\n\nRipio representative Juan Mendez told CoinDesk:\n\n""BitPagos is a brand that was too linked to merchants and B2B payment processing. Over the last year and a half, we\'ve shifted most of our efforts towards users [and] consumers and we needed a brand that suits our mission best.""\n\nExpansion bid\n\nThe round also caps a busy 2016 for the startup, as Ripio began offering bitcoin lending services earlier this year to customers based in Argentina.\n\nAccording to Mendez, immediate plans for the new capital include growing its business development team and using those new resources to push further into South American markets. (There, the company says it serves more than 60,000 customers).\n\nIn late 2015, BitPagos acquired bitcoin exchange Unisend Argentina as part of its expansion plans, a move that coincided with a broader pattern of startup consolidations in the region.\n\nThe company is also looking to create growth in markets outside of the region, with a planned launch of its bitcoin brokerage and payment services in Mexico.\n\n""Our main objective for Q1 is to increase our user base in Argentina and Brazil, and (at the same time) expand to Mexico,"" said Mendez.\n\nHBV\'s pattern\n\nThe funding is also notable as it was backed by HBV, a relatively newcomer to the investment scene that launched with $20m in committed capital in November.\n\nBacking Ripio, however, is mostly in line with its previously announced moves.\n\nSo far, the firm has invested only in bitcoin startups, including India-based exchange Unocoin and content monetization project Yours.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripio.\n\nBuenos Aires street via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/04/2017,"['Bitcoin hit an all-time high Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data, thanks to continued adoption in China and other parts of the world where traditional currencies are tightly controlled.\n\nThe digital currency, which just turned eight years old, reached $1,140.64, which was higher than the $1,137 it hit in November of 2013. In December, bitcoin also surpassed its previous all-time high in total market capitalization, which now exceeds $16.1 billion.\n\nThe latest increase was driven by capital or currency restrictions in countries ranging from China to India and Venezuela, where people purchased bitcoin to protect their savings, as well as increased adoption by investors. The digital currency beat every other currency, stock index and commodity contract as an investment last year.\n\n“Unlike the exponential adoption that propelled the price of Bitcoin in 2013, the current ascent was driven by a more gradual adoption over the last three years, mostly in China and other countries that have capital or currency restrictions,” Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in an e-mail.\n\nGlobal restrictions on sovereign currencies are playing a major role in driving increased bitcoin demand. The Chinese government, for example, made it more difficult for people to move the nation’s currency and spend it overseas, leading to trapped liquidity. That’s made bitcoin, which isn’t controlled by any government or central bank, more attractive.\n\nIndia and Venezuela banned their largest-circulating bank bills in a bid to make it harder to pay bribes and buy contraband in cash. Governments all over the world are boosting reporting rules for assets abroad and allocating more resources to figuring out how and where illegal cash moves around. It’s part of efforts to combat terrorism financing and corruption following graft scandals from Europe to Brazil. That’s boosting demand from people who want to receive and send cash without all the oversight.\n\nIsolationist Policies\n\nAnd isolationist policies by some governments to restrict remittances are pushing consumers into bitcoin as well. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said during his campaign that he’d limit or halt remittances to Mexico until the Latin American nation agrees to pay for a border wall between the two countries.\n\nFinally, the explosion of bitcoin supply growth is slowing, with so-called miners getting fewer electronic coins in exchange for letting the network use their computing power. The payment to owners of the computers that verify bitcoin transactions and record them in a public ledger known as the blockchain fell by half in the middle of last year.\n\n“It shows that more and more people are confident in the currency,” Marco\n\nStreng, chief executive officer of Genesis Mining, a bitcoin mining company, said in an e-mail. “They see the benefit of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This will inevitably accelerate the growth of the whole economy.”', 'If you’re excited about the idea of investing in a bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded fund, you’ll have to wait a bit longer to learn if you can—again.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday designated March 11 as the date by which it would either approve or disapprove the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, which would be the first to exclusively track the digital currency.\n\nA decision would represent the end of a multiyear campaign to bring a bitcoin ETF to market. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who run Winklevoss Capital, first announced plans for one in 2013; the pair also run both WinkDex, a bitcoin price index, and Gemini, a bitcoin custodian and exchange.\n\nWinklevoss Capital didn’t immediately return requests for a comment.\n\nThe SEC has delayed issuing a ruling on the proposed ETF multiple times. In October, it declined to rule, saying it was instead seeking additional public feedback on the proposal. In a filing published on Wednesday, the SEC said it had subsequently received 30 comments.\n\nRead: Here’s one easy way to get exposure to bitcoin ahead of the Winklevoss ETF\n\nThe proposed fund, which would trade on the Bats exchange, was first published for public comment on July 14 of last year. The SEC could have ruled on it on Jan. 10—180 days after that date—but it is instead waiting until March 11, which is 240 days since July 14.\n\n“The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider this proposed rule change,” the SEC wrote in a statement.\n\nBecause March 11 is a Saturday, the ruling could actually be announced on Friday, March 10, the final business day before the deadline.\n\nWhile investors can put their money into bitcoin directly, those waiting on an ETF to get bitcoin exposure have missed out on some massive gains. The price of a single coin more than doubled in 2016, due to increasing adoption of bitcoin among professional investors, improving market fundamentals and a perception that the world’s largest economies are growing increasingly unstable.\n\nSee also: Bitcoin rally boosts rival digital currencies', 'Ferdinando Ametrano teaches Bitcoin and Blockchain Technologies at Politecnico di Milano and Milano Bicocca University. He was chairman of Scaling Bitcoin 2016 and is also former Head of Blockchain and Virtual Currencies at Intesa Sanpaolo bank.\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Ametrano argues that, despite the hype around enterprise blockchain technologies, achievements in the bitcoin community have been greater.\n\n""When the wise man points at the bitcoin, the idiot looks at the blockchain"" – (Quasi-)Confucius.\n\nAnother year goes by, another intense chapter in the history of the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThere has been no shortage of folklore and drama: 2016 started with the ""whiny ragequit"" of Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn, who shortly after joining banking consortium R3CEV declared bitcoin a failure and sold all his coins.\n\nIt\'s worth noting the price of bitcoin has now ended 2016 near a three-year high.\n\nElsewhere, the con artist Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, providing laughable cryptographic proofs to bamboozle and discredit reputable people. The unmissable yearly exchange heist this time hit Bitfinex, its $66m theft becoming notable also for the lengths it went to to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nMajor consortia competed for the membership of financial institutions and technological players, with Hyperledger beating R3 100 to 70 – numbers implausible for any kind of sensible action plan but representative of the overblown blockchain hype and the widespread fear of missing out.\n\nPeople have been advocating blockchain as a magic wand to solve many global problems (like securing nuclear weapons and managing the power grid); I have been compelled to humbly add that its potential at scrambling eggs should not be underestimated.\n\nIn with DLT\n\nActually, as knowledgeable people are fully aware, blockchain has not been really cool in 2016. The 2014 champion, bitcoin was dethroned by blockchain in 2015, but this year the debate has crowned distributed ledger technology (DLT) as the relevant topic.\n\nInstead of pondering why blockchain without bitcoin (or another native token) made no sense (and admitting that blockchain was just abused as a snake-oil marketing buzzword), many of the projects originally touted to ""bring blockchain to finance"" flippantly shifted to DLT.\n\nNobody has really figured out what this DLT chimera is about or which problem it should solve. (Yet, we have been told it could reduce banks\' infrastructural costs by $20bn). Even the European Securities Market Authorities (ESMA) wonders about its applicability.\n\nThe ESMA consultation paper issued in June posed many sensible specific questions: unfortunately most of the answers received were generic rhetoric exercises. Adding insult to injury, even when it comes to derivatives trading and clearing (where ESMA is confident DLT cannot be applied), unfunded claims about interest rate swaps as smart contracts on DLT obfuscate the debate.\n\nLast but not least, no DLT proposal has really delved into how to implement cash-on-the-ledger for effective delivery vs payment or, even more crucially, how to reach decentralized consensus.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain is more a cultural paradigm shift than just a technology. It is all about decentralization, so the attempt of intermediaries to repurpose it appears quite ludicrous.\n\nAs pointed out by Mainelli and Milne:\n\n""Current interest in mutual distributed ledgers has established significant momentum, but there is a danger of building unrealistic expectations [...] Understanding of the technology lags well behind the hype [...] ‘Blockchain’ technology seems to promise major change for capital markets and other financial services, but few can say exactly how or why.""\n\nGiven that bitcoin and blockchain is at the crossroads of game theory, cryptography, data networking, and monetary theory, a proper understanding of the subject is in fact quite rare.\n\nOne can consider the blockchain as the auditable immutable log of database updates: it can be used to reach the current database consensus state starting from an empty state (the UTXO database in the bitcoin case).\n\nBut how to make this log at least tamper-evident in a distributed network has often been neglected, and sometimes stultified, as with the proposal to make the blockchain rewritable. Decentralized consensus seems so far very hard to reach without the economic incentives provided by a blockchain native digital asset like bitcoin.\n\nPartial solutions have been proposed in some special configurations of DLT – eg: by Digital Asset for the Australian Stock Exchange post-trade system.\n\nHere a shared ledger registering the log of (the hash values of) all trades is generated, updated and cryptographically signed by a central counterparty in a distributed, but by no means decentralized, environment. The notary service of the central counterparty can hardly be generalized to a decentralized framework, unless ironically resorting to the bitcoin blockchain (the most secure one, since the effort and cost for its manipulation is prohibitive) as notary.\n\nAll hail notarization\n\nWe are back now to the most notable application of blockchain beyond bitcoin: timestamping, anchoring and notarization.\n\nA generic data set (a file, a database, the status of a transaction network) can be hashed to produce a short unique identifier. Such a digital fingerprint can be associated to a bitcoin transaction and hence registered on the blockchain. The blockchain immutability then provides robust non-repudiable timestamping that can always prove, without doubt, the existence of that data set in that specific status at that precise moment in time.\n\nThis generic process is even undergoing some standardization to achieve third-party auditable verification. This is what could be called databases on crypto-steroids: in the disruptive bitcoin nuclear explosion, applied cryptography will be the radioactive fallout driving database evolution. Or even better ""what jewelry is for gold, timestamping and notarization could be for bitcoin: not essential, but effective at leveraging its beauty"".\n\nWe are touching the crucial point here: How can so many miss the point about the importance of bitcoin as digital gold?\n\nFor the first time, we have a scarce digital asset which can be transmitted, but not duplicated (ie: spent, not double-spent): this is the groundbreaking achievement by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin could prove to be digital gold: as relevant as physical gold has been in human history and in the development of trade, money and finance.\n\nIt has already realized a resilient permissionless transaction network and has appreciated more than 900x in less than six years.\n\nHow can people possibly care more for the sub-par append-only sequential data structure known as blockchain instead?\n\nTo the rescue\n\nThis year, central bankers at least have been better at recognizing bitcoin\'s relevance.\n\nMario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), wrote to the EU Parliament:\n\n""The reliance of economic actors on virtual currency units could in principle affect the central banks\' control the supply of money with potential risks to price stability [...] Thus [... EU legislative bodies....] should not seek to promote a wider use of virtual currencies.""\n\nSheng Songcheng, member of the National People\'s Congress and Director of the Investigation and Statistics Department of the People’s Bank of China, recently issued similar remarks.\n\nSongcheng said:\n\n""With the expansion of the use of private digital money, sovereign money use will gradually decline, which will reduce the monetary authority of the sovereign currency control. At the same time, the influence of monetary policy control on the supply and circulation of fiat money will also decline and become unstable, which will weaken the effectiveness of monetary policy and distort the transmission mechanism.""\n\nIt seems like they are scared by the likelihood of the scenario where private money competes with fiat money; the dream illustrated by Nobel laureate Friedrich von Hayek in ""Denationalisation of Money"" finally becomes true, breaking the millenary government monopoly of money.\n\nThrough market competition, better money will eventually prevail, but the Emperor is mad at the idea of money without his stamp of approval.\n\nBitcoin\'s brilliance\n\nIn 2016, private cryptocurrencies have been vying for the top spot, with ethereum establishing itself as the most plausible bitcoin alternative.\n\nThis Hayekian scenario is to be loved, and indeed a lot has been learned by this fierce competition. Yet, I believe the only conclusion is that bitcoin has come out on top.\n\nThe frequent ethereum network outages (provoked by DDoS attacks) have proved how brilliant the bitcoin development team has been in managing its network for eight years without similar problems.\n\nFurther, the disagreement between alternative ethereum implementations has forked the ethereum blockchain, proving how essential it is for a cryptocurrency to have just one reference implementation. The DAO hack proved how Turing completeness is excessive hubris and how wise it was for bitcoin to be conservative when it comes to its scripting language.\n\nIn my view, the subsequent split between ethereum (ETH) and ethereum classic (ETC) weakened ETH and proved how dangerous it is to have a contentious hard fork, and how healthy it is for bitcoin development not to be driven by any “benevolent dictator”.\n\nThe ethereum failures have contributed in some fashion to lessen the bitcoin debate about a hard fork for bigger block size.\n\nWhile still supported by a significant vocal minority, the issue is not as rampant as it was at the end of 2015. Especially now that Segregated Witness (SegWit, the soft-fork aimed at fixing the malleability problem and providing many other improvements) could be activated, allowing also for an effective block size increase.\n\nSegWit is crucial for many possible future developments and its adoption would mark a turning point in the bitcoin history.\n\nNonetheless, even if the bigger-block minority will stop it, some celebration should be in order because bitcoin is proving once again how resilient it is to manipulation attempts, even one advocated by a core development team with a brilliant track record.\n\nBut... fungibility\n\nThat\'s not to say bitcoin doesn\'t have big issues ahead.\n\nAs noted during the 2016 developer conference in Milan, this year has been mostly about two issues: the off-chain scaling approach proposed by Lightning Network and the fungibility and privacy issue.\n\nLightning Network avoids the extreme security of having all nodes validating all transactions: it secures off-chain transactions with a cryptographic smart contract that relies on the main blockchain for dispute resolution.\n\nFungibility is the requirement for all bitcoin to be equal: an atom of physical gold is indistinguishable from any other gold atom, whatever its history. Unfortunately this is not really true for bitcoin, allowing for bitcoin of different value and legitimacy depending on their pedigree.\n\nWhile often underappreciated, this is probably the most relevant limit in the current bitcoin implementation, but it can be mitigated through mixing techniques (in my view Joinmarket and TumbleBit are promising approaches that might lead to effective improvement).\n\nIt is evident here that the obfuscation needed for transaction privacy would ensure fungibility and vice versa.\n\nIt is again the Hayekian scenario of competing currencies, this time the rise of Monero and ZCash (and of the MimbleWimble idea), that has proven how relevant the demand for fungibility and privacy is. Indeed, how crucial the privacy debate has been represented by the FBI and Apple\'s encryption dispute, the Yahoo mass surveillance incident, the UK Investigatory Powers Act, the IRS\'s Coinbase data request, etc.\n\nThis mass surveillance approach is really despicable: on one hand, it is ineffective because criminals will be able to patch cryptographic backdoors adopting a second-layer robust encryption; on the other hand, it will put at risks everybody’s privacy, allowing criminals to use the backdoor to spy on the honest people.\n\nBitcoin will now have to prove its ability to grant financial privacy.\n\nLast straw\n\nYet, all in all, 2017 might be the final year in the pump-and-dump scheme of blockchain-without-bitcoin , the last-ditch effort to prove the marginal utility of databases on crypto-steroids.\n\nProbably some smart contract hype will clutter the debate, thanks to the smartest ones among the fools trying to outsmart even the smart contract inventor.\n\nBut most of this fuss will finally leave center stage, allowing for the 2018 return of (a hopefully more fungible) bitcoin.\n\nDigital gold effective in the defence of privacy and at freeing money from state and central banks monopoly, bitcoin might bootstrap new monetary systems: it might be surpassed by more advanced forms of money, as happened to physical gold, without becoming obsolete. And it will ignite new economic and trade systems: for the first time really global, borderless, and inclusive.\n\nIn the meantime, please fasten your seatbelt for another rollercoaster of a year.

They charged into markets several times in 2016 and bought everything from iron ore to cotton, driving up prices and stoking fears of a bubble.\n\nAnd charge in they did — particularly in May and again in the latter parts of the year — leading regulators to step in to quell the feverish frenzy.\n\nThese periods coincided with some jaw-dropping price gains in the likes of iron ore and coking coal, raising questions among many analysts about the fundamentals underpinning the moves.\n\nSome, like Goldman Sachs’ commodities research team of Hui Shan, Amber Cai and Christian Lelong, suggested that weakness in the yuan, and a lack of alternate US dollar denominated assets, contributed to the surge in speculative trading activity.\n\nLooking specifically at iron ore markets, the Goldman team suggested about 60% of the price rally in October last year was explained by renewed weakness in the Chinese yuan, which was driven by rising expectations of higher US interest rates.\n\n“With ample onshore money supply chasing a limited menu of accessible dollar-linked assets, continued CNY depreciation means that iron ore prices may stay above what the fundamental demand and supply suggest in coming months,” they wrote in early November – not a bad call as the benchmark spot price for 62% fines rocketed above $US80 a tonne for the first time since 2014.\n\nIt was a similar story for other commodity futures, with fundamental factors that started the rally in prices earlier in the year replaced by swirling levels of speculation as investors chased prices higher.\n\nAnd, despite the best efforts of policymakers to quash rampant speculation, it’s clear that it’s still prevalent in both commodity and other asset classes.\n\nAccording to analysis from the Commonwealth Bank, the average hold time for positions in rebar and iron ore futures contracts traded on the Shanghai and Dalian exchanges was less than 24 hours at the end of 2016, significantly lower than the levels seen earlier in the year when prices were falling rather than rising.\n\nTo Vivek Dhar, a mining and energy commodities analyst at the Commonwealth Bank, the elevated levels of speculation will add to upside price risks and increased volatility in the year ahead should they be allowed to persist.\n\n“Without intervention, speculative trading will likely be another risk to higher prices in 2017, particularly if China deploys further stimulus,” he said in late December.\n\n“Price volatility would likely continue next year if speculative trading is left unchecked – both to the upside and downside depending on prevailing sentiment.”\n\nMirroring the frenzy seen in commodity futures, there’s now evidence that Chinese speculators have now moved into the Bitcoin market, once again fuelled by concern over the potential for further yuan weakness.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rose by as much as 6.9% on Wednesday to $1094.69 per coin, bringing its gain to a massive 15% so far this year.\n\nAnd that was fallowing a mammoth 123% gain in 2016.\n\nMuch of the buying interest has come from China.\n\nAccording to a recent Business Insider Intelligence briefing, citing data from Cryptocompare, in the first 24 hours of the new year, over 5 million bitcoins were bought in Chinese yuan, equating to $US3.8 billion.\n\nIn comparison, just 53,000 bitcoins were bought in US dollars.\n\nIt’s clear that Chinese investors are concerned about the outlook for the Chinese yuan given the speculative-driven moves seen in recent months.\n\nAt this point, however, that concern has yet to impact more developed financial markets.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if that lasts, particularly given the events that occurred at the start of 2016.\n\nYou can read more here.', 'Bitcoin’s price has gone crazy, but the price of mining with the leading company has stayed flat. Sort of.\n\nThe last time I wrote about bitcoin, when Charlie Shrem spoke about his new venture, the price for one bitcoin was about $740. That was up a little bit from a month before, the morning after the presidential election, when the price sat at about $721. That’s up a fair amount from this summer, the last time I wrote about Genesis Mining, the world’s leading bitcoin mining operation. At that time, digital currency was selling for about $667, which is way below where it was this time last year, around $440.\n\nRight now, one bitcoin costs $1137, beating its all time high from November 2013. The digital asset has been going steadily up since May, but its price hit a hockey stick just before Christmas. What hasn’t increased? The price to virtually mine cryptocurrency with Genesis Mining, the world’s biggest mining operation, based in Iceland.\n\nThe company’s CEO, Marco Streng, said that demand for hashing power inside the company’s farm of mining servers has doubled since the price spike began, yet the company has kept its prices flat. “We made a promise,” Streng said, “We are not pricing our hardware based on opportunity.”\n\nRight now, a person can buy two gigahertz-per-second (GH/s) of mining power for $30. It will run as long as its profitable to run, and Genesis will carve out a maintenance fee from your crypto income as it goes. While the price of bitcoin may be all over the place, the company’s input costs to mine it are pretty fixed, made up of equipment, staff and electricity. Since it gets its electricity from Iceland’s natural resources (hydro and geothermal), those prices don’t really oscillate. Users that spend a lot more get more GH/s for their dollar.\n\nStreng said his team is working overtime to make sure there is enough equipment online for people to buy into.\n\nQuick refresher: mining is just a metaphor. The bitcoin system encrypts blocks as they get made and bitcoin gets released to miners that crack the code. It’s a way to fairly control the creation of bitcoin. You pay for code-cracking power.\n\nSo, on its face, it might seem like mining is a neat trick. You can get in on bitcoin at the same price now as you could back in May, when it was much cheaper.\n\nNot so fast, though: every additional machine added to the system reduces the total share of the pie. That pie does not change, at 1800 new bitcoin every day. As more machines come on the system, the hashing difficulty increases. So you get in at the same price, but January’s GH/s don’t go as far as May’s did.\n\nSee what I mean? It’s the same price. Mostly. It’s like the price of gas didn’t change, but all the roads got longer.\n\nThe Merkle did a nice break down on the pro’s and con’s of mining. If you do it, you might get some bitcoin. If you just buy bitcoin, you definitely get bitcoin.\n\nThe question is whether or not now is the right time to get in.\n\nStreng gave this explanation for the currency’s exploding price, saying “I think the major reason is people seeing a growing confidence in blockchain and bitcoin especially.” We see that, for example, in the growing interest of state regulators in addressing cryptocurrency.\n\nWe recently reported on legendary VC Fred Wilson’s take on bitcoin. That investor believes that bitcoin represents the idea the internet had been waiting on: digital native money. Yet he also said last year that it was the dumb money chasing blockchain.\n\nThe New York Times did a story connecting bitcoin’s rise to global trends, such as Venezuela’s tanking currency and paper currency woes in India. In particular, it argues that much of the activity is in China and looks speculative. What we aren’t seeing are actual applications of bitcoin, like what Ripple is doing using XRP to settle accounts.\n\nIn fact, in the middle of all this bitcoin mania, Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong came out with a surprisingly sedate post on Medium, where he emphasizes his company’s growing attention to other cryptocurrencies. One would think the founder of one of the most widely used coin wallet’s would take advantage of this moment to tell everyone that his service is the easiest one to use if they want to get in on the crypto spike.\n\nInstead, he writes:\n\nWhat [bitcoin] has not become is a scalable payment network (with lower fees, faster confirmation times, and higher throughput). I’m skeptical that it will be able to make this leap (even with new developments in the pipeline). Federated protocols seem to evolve slowly. This initially saddened me because I think an open payment network is where the greatest potential lies for digital currency to improve the world (hence our mission at Coinbase: to create an open financial system for the world). But I’ve come to accept that Bitcoin may not fill this role, and that is ok.\n\nOoph. Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto actually is, he felt that. Even Streng acknowledged that there is not a lot of bitcoin available on the sell side. If it’s only getting bought, then it’s not getting used. So what happens after everyone who wants to buy some bitcoin has bought it?\n\nThis is the question for every investment. When an asset’s price goes up, it could be the new normal or the holders could just be the waiting for the last fool. We’ll only know in hindsight. At this point, it’s a fair bet that Satoshi’s inventions are here to stay, but there are a lot of ways to bet on them and the question is whether or not mining—or even bitcoin itself—is the right one.', ""Bitcoin does not sleep, nor do its markets. Most exchanges run 24/7, day and night, even on weekends and holidays.\n\nThis is one reason some day traders — the people who trade on the price swings per hour or even per minute — use trading bots. These software programs can be plugged directly into exchanges, to apply trading strategies even when their operators are away from their computer, or busy doing something else.\n\nIndeed, if there is such a thing as “money making machines,” trading bots are it.\n\nOr are they?\n\nStrategies\n\nBots that are available on the market include Haasbot, Tradewave and Cryptotrader, the latter of which is cloud-based.\n\nEach of these trading bots react to market behavior on a specific exchange (or on several exchanges), and place buy and sell offers accordingly.\n\nThe offers they place are nothing out of the ordinary, and could be placed manually as well. However, by programming a sequence of orders, which is called “pre-ordering,” traders can apply a trading strategy without needing to monitor the markets continuously.\n\nStephan de Haas is Founder of Haas Online and creator of Haasbot. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he outlined a basic example of a pre-ordering strategy:\n\n“Let’s say I bought 10 bitcoins, and I want to sell them if the price reaches $1200. This can be done at exchanges already, of course. But using the bot, I can set it up to sell at $1200, buy back at $1000 and sell it all again at $1100. So I am building up a sequence of ordering events that must take place, and I define the exact target prices on it.”\n\nDe Haas is a solid believer that these trading bots can make money consistently. By utilizing Technical Analysis (TA) tools provided by the bot, users should be able to gain an edge on other traders, especially those that don't use trading bots.\n\nAdditionally, bots typically offer “insurance” options. Perhaps most importantly, these include “stop loss” orders that sell bitcoins if a predetermined low point is reached — for example, $950. This way, traders are sure they won’t lose more than, say, five percent of their holdings, if the market crashes while they are away.\n\nMoney Making Machines? Not Guaranteed\n\nSome are more more skeptical about the value of trading bots, however.\n\nJacob Eliosoff runs a small digital currency investment firm whose strategies include algorithmic market making. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Eliosoff agreed that bots can help traders — but noted that traders still make the decisions.\n\n“It can be handy to have a bot that adjusts your orders based on market conditions,” said Eliosoff. “However, where a bot would guarantee a return on investment, the traditional question is: Why are the creators of these bots selling it to you rather than running it themselves? If the bot doesn't decide which trades to do, but just helps you execute your own strategy better — fair enough. Keep in mind there are no free lunches.”\n\nIndeed, these kinds of trading bots serve as a tool, not as solutions themselves. And whether these tools are useful also depends on the individual trader: Some full-time traders are profitable without using any bots at all.\n\nThe person known as “Kazonomics,” who runs a trading group from his website kazonomics.com, is not a fan of bots. Asked by Bitcoin Magazine, he did agree bots can be helpful for some people — but also doesn’t believe any golden formula would guarantee an income.\n\n“Having the right formula to do what you want, and be profitable in the market is not the same thing,” he noted. “And TA in itself will not guarantee you profits either. There is no TA that would have, one year ago, called the correct low of oil, for example.”\n\nInefficiencies\n\nAside from pre-ordering, bots can also be used to take advantage of market inefficiencies.\n\nTwo well-known strategies to benefit from market inefficiencies include arbitrage trading and market making. The former takes advantage of the price difference between different exchanges, for example to buy bitcoins for $1020 on Bitstamp and sell them for $1030 on Kraken. The latter places orders on otherwise low-volume exchanges, at slightly increased prices when compared to other exchanges, again to apply arbitrage.\n\nTypically, trading strategies benefit from market inefficiencies. Perhaps this is where trading bots can be particularly useful, Eliosoff noted. “Bots can do well if they allow for more efficient — cheaper or faster — execution of large orders, or electronic market making,” he said.De Haas, too, thinks bots can take advantage of market inefficiencies.\n\n“The flashcrash bot is one of our best bots,” he said. “A flashcrash is when prices on an exchange change very rapidly, and the bot exploits this by buying up cheap coins and selling when the price returns to normal levels. This bot can do between 5 and 15 percent a day, on average. Exchanges love this bot, too: It makes their order books more liquid.”\n\nKazonomics agreed that profiting from inefficiencies is probably the biggest advantage a trading bot can offer. “Models built around arbitrage and other mean reverting strategies, if done right, can work by exploiting market inefficiencies,” he said. Though, noting: “But I don't know anyone with a working model who will sell it.”\n\nThe problem with these strategies, Eliosoff said, is that they are, frankly, too easy to apply. If anyone can make money by simply turning on a machine that benefits from inefficiencies, many will; as a result, the inefficiencies will disappear over time. A trader profiting from inefficiencies will either need to keep finding new inefficiencies, or simply compete with everyone else.\n\nThis is also why Eliosoff’s trading fund primarily engages in algorithmic market making, a more complex strategy that smooths out large orders on a single exchange. “I specifically avoided cross-exchange arbitrage because I see it as too easy and thus too prone to competition,” he said.\n\nSo while Eliosoff believes profit can be made from inefficiencies, he concurred that it's not necessarily easy.\n\n“Saying there are lots of ways to profit from arbitrage, market making and these types of strategies, is far from saying profits are guaranteed. Bots are like startups: obviously some succeed; also obviously, most don't. All in all, it's hard, and gets harder. The easier the strategy, the faster others are to jump in too,” Eliosoff said.\n\nMagic\n\nA surefire strategy that will make you money forever seems unlikely, therefore. And while some will argue otherwise, it’s virtually impossible to do so with a publicly available strategy. These will just be copied into oblivion.\n\n“Value requires scarcity plus utility...so nothing of value is widely available,” Kazonomics explained. “That includes trading bots. Once these are disbursed widely into the market, they become unprofitable pretty quickly.”\n\nAnd as day traders are playing the markets — or perhaps more accurately, playing each other — only the best and most dedicated will have a shot at making money long-term. Even if bots are a useful tool for some, “the most dangerous fallacy about bots is the idea that there's some off-the-shelf magic gizmo you can buy that will produce a little stream of free money,” Eliosoff said. “To make steady money, you need to build something yourself.”\n\nDe Haas, however, remains optimistic his bot can help traders: “100 percent sure.”"", 'In the quest for privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin, two researchers (from Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany and Indiana’s Purdue University) presented a promising privacy enhancement proposal last week. ValueShuffle, as the protocol is called, describes a method to mix bitcoins and at the same time hide the amounts involved in the mixing process.\n\nIt’s a potent combination, as Tim Ruffing, one of the researchers, explained:\n\n“The combination of these two privacy-enhancing technologies, while not requiring any trusted third party, is what makes ValueShuffle unique.”\n\nCoinJoin and CoinShuffle\n\nRuffing wrote the ValueShuffle draft white paper with Pedro Moreno-Sanchez; these are the same two researchers who previously proposed the CoinShuffle protocols, along with their PhD advisor, Aniket Kate, then at Saarland University.\n\nLeveraging CoinJoin, first proposed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer, Gregory Maxwell, CoinShuffle is a method to merge several transactions into one, with no need for a trusted party. As such, a single Bitcoin transaction can send bitcoins from many people to many people. This potentially obfuscates the trail of coins, as it’s no longer clear exactly who paid whom.\n\nThe obfuscation is only potential, however, because the amount of coins involved in a transaction can be a giveaway. If one transaction sends five bitcoins from address to address, and another transaction sends seven bitcoins from address to address, merging these into one transaction would not obfuscate much. Simply matching the amounts reveals who sent bitcoins to whom.\n\n“With our initial CoinShuffle proposals, this can be solved if everyone uses the same amounts,” Ruffing explained. “If everyone involved in the mix sends exactly one bitcoin, the sending and receiving addresses can no longer be matched. But this is also quite a limiting factor. Any remaining coins must go to some change address without being anonymized, which is cumbersome, and may even break privacy if not used properly. And for technical reasons it also means you cannot use CoinShuffle to make a payment directly; you can only send bitcoins back to yourself.”\n\nConfidential Transactions\n\nWith ValueShuffle, the problem of matching amounts is solved by hiding the amounts involved in a transaction.\n\nThis is accomplished using another proposal designed to increase privacy in Bitcoin: Confidential Transactions. Developed by Blockstream, Confidential Transactions is currently implemented in Blockstream’s Elements Alpha sidechain, which is active on Bitcoin’s testnet.\n\nUsing clever cryptography, Confidential Transactions ensures that no one can see how many bitcoins are involved in a transaction, nor how many were sent from which address to which address. Nodes can, however, verify that the total number of bitcoins sent matches the total number of bitcoins received. As such, they can be sure no bitcoins were created out of thin air.\n\nThe combination of CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions has long been considered a powerful solution. As CoinJoin obfuscates which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses, Confidential Transactions obfuscates the amounts, to break all links. With ValueShuffle, all this can be done without requiring a trusted party to merge the different transactions into one.\n\n“Plus, it allows users to make payments directly through ValueShuffle, rather than having to send themselves mixed bitcoins first,” Ruffing said.\n\nSegregated Witness\n\nThus far, however, the Confidential Transactions building block is not part of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\n“But it may be in the future,” Ruffing said. “It can be rolled out with a backward compatible soft fork, which would be even easier if Segregated Witness is activated first. On top of that, ValueShuffle could benefit from Segregated Witness in other ways. Since Confidential Transactions are relatively expensive compared to normal transactions, the witness “discount” will help. And if Schnorr signature aggregation is deployed through Segregated Witness as well, that would be another boon for efficiency.”\n\nIf Confidential Transactions does become part of the Bitcoin protocol — either through Segregated Witness or as an independent soft or hard fork — not much stands in the way of ValueShuffle. The solution would not require additional protocol changes; it would just require wallets to implement the solution. And, ideally, a server to host the mixing protocol.\n\n“Technically, it can be done without a central server, but it wouldn’t be very practical. And keep in mind that a central server wouldn’t need to be trusted with users’ private keys or privacy, and they’re easily replaced if something goes wrong.” Ruffing said. “As for wallets, Mycelium has already implemented a version of CoinShuffle. And ValueShuffle is even easier to implement, because it’s based on the simpler and more efficient CoinShuffle++ protocol.”', 'Bitcoin\'s eighth birthday was marked by a new software update.\n\nThough all eyes may have been on the escalating price, Tuesday\'s software upgrade (to version 0.13.2) is the latest of many ""minor version releases"" published by the volunteer developer group known popularly as Bitcoin Core.\n\nIt might not be as big of a release as say, 0.13.0, but it rounds up a number of bug and performance fixes, including an upgrade that will allow the built-in wallet to react to memory pool (mempool) changes more appropriately. Other improvements include increased block relay speed on the network and changes that aim to make it easier for miners to adopt SegWit, the scaling solution that\'s been particularly contentious lately.\n\nMajor releases add additional features, while minor releases generally polish on those releases by way of bug and performance fixes making the software more robust (although consensus rules are also sometimes added in minor releases).\n\nIn total, 28 contributors made 55 changes merged into the release.\n\nSimilar releases often need a few rounds of testing (which each manifest in a new ""release candidate""), but since no problems were reported since the first release candidate, the developer group packaged up and distributed it.\n\nTo make the upgrade (which developers suggest doing for a performance boost), users need to turn off their full node, install the latest version, then restart it. Not everyone upgrades to the latest software, but roughly 53% of nodes are now running version 0.13.0 or newer.\n\nSegWit stalling\n\nMeanwhile, the situation for the last release is arguably not ideal.\n\nWhile an upgrade featuring the SegWit activation code was released in late October, only about 25% of miners have signaled support for the change, far from the 95% that will trigger the update.\n\nYet, despite this slow progress, this release indicates that developers are continuing to update the code.\n\nAlong those lines, Bitcoin Core is continuing work on the next major version, 0.14.0, which could be released as early as March 2017.\n\nGenerally, protocol developers appear to be focused on privacy and scalability improvements in the coming year.\n\nWatchmaker image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/05/2017,"[""Bitcoin is off the lowest levels of its plunge on Thursday, which was the worst in two years.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is down 13% to $985.68 per coin as of 11:10 a.m. ET on Thursday. It earlier fell by about 20%.\n\nEarlier this week, on its first trading day of the new year, bitcoin crossed above the $1,000 mark for the first time since 2013, but it has now tumbled below that level.\n\nFrom the end of September through Wednesday — just before the plunge — bitcoin gained nearly 100%. It was supported by renewed interest from China, where money rushed out of the country as its currency, the yuan, continued to weaken.\n\nBut on Thursday the yuan witnessed its biggest two-day rise since record keeping began in 2010. This happened amid the government's efforts to stop outflows from the country and after overnight borrowing costs in Hong Kong surged to a record as high as 100%. That squeezed investors who had bet that the currency would fall.\n\nThe yuan's rise is also pressuring the US dollar, which fell against other major currencies."", 'For Felix Yang, nothing beat bitcoin.\n\nAfter he bought several million yuan worth of the cryptocurrency in June, the 34-year-old finance worker watched as prices skyrocketed 43 percent in the second half of 2016 before reaching an all-time high of $1,162 this week.\n\nYang is now looking to his nation’s policy makers with trepidation. The last time prices reached a record in 2013, China tightened rules on bitcoin transactions, spurring a rout that caused him losses. Jitters among buyers increased after the asset plunged as much as 23 percent on Thursday before rebounding back above $900.\n\n“The Chinese government’s policy is an important factor,"" said Yang, who owns about $2 million of bitcoins and lives in Suzhou, Jiangsu. “There may be room for further gains in price, but there’ll be a big pullback soon. It’s hard to sustain such a rapid rise for a long time.”\n\nBitcoin has rallied since early 2015 as Chinese buyers, who make up the majority of trading, turned to alternative assets to hedge against the weakening yuan and take cash out of the nation. But with officials tightening capital controls, there’s increased speculation that the digital asset will be the next target -- even though the total value of bitcoins of around $16 billion is minuscule compared with most mainstream asset classes in the nation.\n\nEven after Thursday’s slump, the cryptocurrency has climbed 2 percent in the new year, extending a rally in 2016 that beat every major currency, stock index and commodity contract. Outside China, India and Venezuela’s ban on some bank bills and uncertainty over political shocks such as Donald Trump’s election and Brexit also boosted demand for eight-year-old bitcoin, the supply of which is also curbed by its program.\n\nChina Domination\n\nThe yuan accounted for 98 percent of bitcoin trading in the past six months, data from bitcoinity.org show -- though this is inflated by the fact that Chinese exchanges, unlike most others, do not charge a transaction fee, said Bobby Lee, chief executive officer of BTCC, the most active exchange in the past month. China is also home to about two-thirds of the world’s bitcoin mining power.\n\nBy buying bitcoin onshore, selling it offshore for another currency and then moving the money to a bank account, Chinese individuals can take cash out of the country. The government has been stepping up requirements for citizens converting their yuan, which is already subject to a quota, and people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News authorities are preparing contingency plans to curb outflows.\n\n“Under regulations on cross-border flows, the appeal of using bitcoin to obtain foreign exchange and take capital out of the country will increase, especially for funds that may have been used in illegal operations such as money laundering,” said Qiu Difan, a Shanghai-based economist at SWS Research Co., a unit of Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. “Regulators have always been passive about bitcoin. Tighter regulation is inevitable going forward.”\n\nNo Currency\n\nThe government may work with bitcoin exchanges to prevent money laundering and possibly even directly limit trading, Qiu said.\n\nChinese regulators have shown concern over the cryptocurrency’s role before. In November, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News officials were studying measures to limit outflows via bitcoin and impose quotas on the amount that can be sent abroad. In 2013, the People’s Bank of China barred financial institutions from handling bitcoin transactions and said it isn’t a currency with “real meaning,” sparking a slide in price.\n\nTo BTCC’s Lee, the move was a “knee-jerk reaction” to the price gains then -- and one authorities are unlikely to repeat. Policy makers would probably prefer to have licensed exchanges that give the PBOC information, especially since bitcoin’s nature makes it hard for authorities to eradicate anyway, Lee said.\n\n“What they can do is crack down on bitcoin exchanges, but they can’t crack on bitcoin itself,” Shanghai-based Lee said. “If you actually shut down the bitcoin exchanges in China, the desire will just go underground, and when the desire goes underground, it’s out of control.”\n\nEncryption Appeal\n\nThe cryptocurrency’s immunity to changes in regulatory or monetary policies is precisely its appeal. Its supply isn’t determined by any central bank. A network of volunteers validate transactions via their computers, which require encrypted electronic signatures, and in return earn fees based on market prices.\n\nBitcoin tumbled from its record high on Thursday as the offshore yuan posted its biggest two-day rally on record amid speculation Chinese authorities engineered a liquidity crunch to discourage sales of the currency. Bitcoin gained 0.8 percent on Friday, paring Thursday’s plunge.\n\n“There is speculation that the Chinese authorities may try and hamper the use of bitcoin as a way of getting around Chinese capital outflow restrictions,” Steven Englander, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in an e-mail. “At the best of times it is pretty illiquid, so even a small imbalance can have a big impact on price.”\n\nThe digital asset traded at 6,969.6 yuan ($1,008) on BTCChina.com as of 2:27 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong, a 3 percent premium over the dollar price indicated by Bloomberg data based on spot rates. The yuan posted its biggest annual decline since 1994 last year, when bonds and shares also fell. Government measures to cool the housing market is fueling concern home prices are headed for a correction.\n\nLackluster equity performance, a potential real-estate bubble, yuan weakness and capital controls are all driving Chinese demand for bitcoin, said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Gatecoin Ltd. in Hong Kong.\n\n“Bitcoin is one of the few remaining investment opportunities that has so far received very little direct government scrutiny,” he added. “So for now, investors feel safe that the government will keep its hands off their digital funds.”\n\n— With assistance by Justina Lee, Tian Chen, and Olga Kharif', 'LONDON (Reuters) - A dramatic rally in digital currency bitcoin came to a spectacular end on Thursday with a plunge of up to 20 percent as China’s yuan rose sharply - further evidence of an intriguing inverse relationship between the pair.\n\nBitcoin had gained more than 40 percent in two weeks to hit a three-year high of $1,139.89 on Wednesday, just shy of its all-time record of $1,163 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP. But it dived as low as $885.41 on Thursday as the yuan jumped by over 1 percent in offshore trading and headed for its strongest two-day performance on record. CNH=D3 [CNY/]\n\nChinese exchanges have reported high volumes of trading of the web-based “cryptocurrency” over the past year, during which time the yuan has shed almost 7 percent, its worst annual performance since 1994, while bitcoin has surged 125 percent, outperforming all other currencies for a second year in a row.\n\nBitcoin can used for moving money across the globe quickly and anonymously, and operates outside the control of any central authority. That makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as in China, and also to investors who are worried about a devaluation in their currency.\n\n“Given that the yuan’s weakness over recent months seemed to correlate with bitcoin’s strength more than any other currency, it’s no surprise that bitcoin traders have reacted the way they have to the yuan’s sudden strength today,” said Paul Gordon, co-founder of London-based Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for investors to access digital currency exchanges.\n\nExchanges in China say they account for more than 90 percent of global bitcoin trading, which would help explain why a shift in Chinese demand would sharply affect the price.\n\nBut many bitcoin experts say Chinese exchanges overstate their volumes in the digital currency, and attribute sharp moves to speculation by, for example, U.S.-based hedge funds.\n\nSome said bitcoin’s fall was a natural reaction to the speed of its previous rise. It is still up more than 50 percent on three months ago, when it was trading at around $600,\n\n“If something goes up very rapidly...people make a lot of money, and at some point they’re going to want to sell, in order to realize their gains,” said Marco Streng, CEO of bitcoin mining and trading firm Genesis Mining.\n\nBy 1645 GMT (11:45 a.m. ET), bitcoin had recovered some of its earlier losses to trade down almost 15 percent on the day at around $950, still leaving it on course for its worst performance in a year.\n\nOn some digital currency exchanges - of which there are dozens - bitcoin did reach record highs late on Wednesday.\n\n“Once we broke through the nominal all-time high, liquidity dried up - no shorts, no sellers, which means a volatile little bubble formed quickly,” said Peter Smith, CEO of London-based Blockchain, the biggest bitcoin wallet-provider globally.\n\n“We are seeing the effects of that now as it breaks. It’s still fairly thin trading volume though, so who really knows where it goes next.”\n\nFor a graphic on the bitcoin economy, click here%20ECONOMY%20T.jpg\n\nFor a graphic on bitcoin exchange rates, click here', 'After falling sharply to a near two-week low today, bitcoin prices are on the rebound.\n\nAt the close of CoinDesk\'s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) for 5th January, the price of bitcoin was $1,005.82, a figure that was up more than $100 from earlier in the day.\n\nAt roughly 14:00 UTC, bitcoin suffered a sudden and sharp selloff, plunging close to $200 in a movement that sparked headlines around the globe. The decline was all the more shocking to many, as it came just after hours of trading within $20 of the all-time high set in 2013.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchange Whaleclub, emphasized the severity of the decline, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""Today\'s selloff was one of the most aggressive I\'ve seen in years.""\n\nYet, following these extreme price movements, the digital currency has been far more calm, comparatively, fluctuating largely between roughly $930 and $990.\n\nAt close of day, bitcoin prices were again trading above $1,000, though they were about 11% lower than the opening price of $1,129.87.\n\nEven after this sharp decline, however, bitcoin prices may have more further to go, according to cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff.\n\n""Bitcoin is still way up over the last month, and could certainly slide more,"" he told CoinDesk. ""A robust price rise needs to be built on a base of long-term users (or at least holders), and I\'ve seen no evidence of such a constituency behind the last month\'s rise.""\n\nEliosoff is not alone in his assessment either, as commentators are beginning to suggest that the digital currency may be overbought.\n\nCalm in storm image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'This article was co-authored with Alex Tapscott.\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Don and his son Alex chart a broad overview of blockchain in 2016, with an eye to what is to come in the year ahead. Notably, they argue that 2016 was the most important year for the tech since the debut of Satoshi Nakamoto\'s bitcoin white paper.\n\n2016 was a critical year, the most important since Satoshi Nakamoto published ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" in 2008.\n\nWhen we wrote ""Blockchain Revolution"", many were speculating on what this technology could achieve. We did our best to capture those possibilities - for the economy, government, and society -and have been surprised by the breadth of innovation underway.\n\nFor example, central banks have emerged as powerful forces in the future of cryptocurrencies and are gaining momentum. The Bank of England and others are already exploring blockchain-enabled fiat currencies to reduce friction, cost, and risk, increase transparency and accountability, and improve oversight of the financial system.\n\nHealthcare has emerged, in earnest, as one of the most exciting areas. Companies are working to unclog bottlenecks in the system, from clinical trial data to personal health records.\n\nFinancial services\n\n2016 was the year that many bank CEOs woke up to both the threat and the opportunity of the blockchain. At a meeting of 50 CEOs of the 50 largest banks back in January, most were skeptical. Now most are investigating how this technology might transform their companies and industry services.\n\nWe wrote about the blockchain as the big enabler for reimagining every aspect of the industry - from payments to investment banking, insurance and accounting. Some observers have been surprised to see banks opening to blockchain when they\'ve not typically been hotbeds of technology innovation.\n\nWhat\'s driving this growing interest is the blockchain\'s once-in-a-generation potential for fixing problems, improving efficiencies and reducing risk - and disintermediating incumbents in the process.\n\nThe departure of several large financial institutions from the R3 blockchain consortium is not surprising. We would expect such a large group of institutions to face some collaborative challenges: many of them are competitors, each at different levels of development in different areas of the business.\n\nConsortia will be critical to reinventing financial services and other industries. To effect change, they need well defined goals with tangible objectives. If anything, the shake-up is a sign of a maturing industry.\n\nInvestment\n\nWhen it comes to blockchain investment, the money keeps flowing! 2016 was a major year for investment, with $387m being directed into blockchain startups.\n\nBut the nature of these investments has shifted. From 2012 to 2014, primarily venture capitalists were funding business-to-consumer bitcoin-enabled solutions for common banking problems such as cross-border money transfer or retail payments. In 2015 and 2016, we saw money flowing into private blockchain opportunities addressing corporate issues, from asset tracking, to wholesale banking, insurance, accounting, risk management and more.\n\nThat investment will continue in 2017, but the pendulum will swing back somewhat to the public blockchain space. If the bitcoin community can get its act together and solve some basic governance issues, investors will again see it as an attractive play - and with good reason. Bitcoin is still the biggest, most secure, most liquid blockchain to date. Ethereum has similar governance issues, which limit its credibility for big corporate investors, but we think Ethereum will get through those too.\n\nSolving the prosperity paradox\n\nProsperity - rather, the lack thereof - was behind the anger that led to the \'Brexit\' vote, the Trump election, and extreme populism in countries almost everywhere. The paradox is that there is wealth creation but declining prosperity, the gutting of the middle class and, in the USA, the end of the American dream.\n\nPresidential runner up Hillary Clinton proposed to tax the rich, a plan to redistribute wealth. US President-elect Trump proposed to cut social services, lower taxes for business, restrict trade and resurrect industries like coal mining from the first industrial revolution - a plan to restore prosperity to those who had it in the early 1800s.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, we saw how such blockchain startups like Abra and the not-for-profit Stellar created mobile applications that ended the remittance rip-off, enabled entrepreneurs to pool their resources, and onboarded the unbanked to the global financial system.\n\nInspired by these social entrepreneurs, we had an idea for a third plan, one that pre-distributed wealth, where the billions of people who currently operate outside the formal economy would own their own data and could begin monetizing it at birth.\n\nIn 2017, we expect to see not only applications for establishing individual identity and protecting property rights through immutable records, but platforms for creating a true sharing economy and a government by the people for the people - all on blockchain technology.\n\nTo be sure, blockchain innovators face barriers: legacy culture, bureaucracy, regulations and more than a few entrenched and deep-pocketed incumbents unable or unwilling to change. These barriers will slow progress down, but only to a degree. Satoshi has unleashed the genie from the bottle, and no one can stuff her back in.\n\n2017: The year of blockchain stewardship\n\nAs noted, there are many impediments to the blockchain and cryptocurrency revolution. None is more important than the immaturity of the ecosystem.\n\nBlockchain technology has emerged globally as the second generation of the Internet. However, its nascent ecosystem lacks the frameworks, language, and processes required for effective stewardship of this critical resource. For example, the bitcoin community has been unable to increase block size, and the ethereum community debated for a long while about how to handle the impending removal of tens of millions of dollars from the ethereum distributed autonomous organization (The DAO).\n\nThis lack of governance is in stark contrast to the first era, the Internet of Information, which had - and still has - a vast multi-stakeholder network of networks to govern the resource. This bottom-up leadership ensures that states, corporations and state-based institutions like the United Nations cannot control this new global resource.\n\nInstead, the Internet is a self-organizing set of communities.\n\nSeveral years ago, we studied the Internet governance network and identified 10 types of networks that keep it working. One of the most extraordinary outcomes of the digital revolution, the rise of the global civil society, and the emergence of business as a pillar of society, is that multi-stakeholder networks can help solve global problems and even govern global resources.\n\nWe launched the Global Solution Networks (GSNs) Program five years ago to explore this gap in knowledge and to study the definition, differentiation, and impact of these emerging multi-stakeholder networks for solving global problems. These non-government, Internet-enabled collaborations of companies, states, non-government organizations and social stakeholders are using the Web for good, and demonstrating the power of networks to solve problems too intractable for traditional institutions.\n\nGSNs are global experts and network leaders who developed a taxonomy of 10 essential network types and studied the technologies, stakeholders, and governance of hundreds of these networks and the orchestrators driving them. The program documented new models of governance and problem solving that were impacting global challenges including climate change, pandemics, depleted natural resources, violence, and income inequality - problems that transcend national boundaries. We conducted 40 projects overall.\n\nThese networks continue to govern the first generation of the Internet. Global standards networks such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) help to maintain integrity in the system. ICAAN is an operational and delivery network that conveys domain names. There are policy networks like the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and advocacy networks like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). There are networked institutions like the World Economic Forum (WEF) that are working hard to keep the Internet open, robust and viable.\n\nWe need an ecosystem like this to steward the blockchain as a resource. Although blockchain technology emerged from the open source community, it quickly attracted many stakeholders, each with different backgrounds, interests and motives. Developers, industry players, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, governments, NGOs and other civil societies have their own perspectives, and each has a role to play. There are early signs that many of the core stakeholders see the need for leadership and are taking steps to address it.\n\nUntil now, industry players have focused largely on building their own companies. Context has become critical.\n\nMany factors can slow, impede and derail this revolution: governments can mess it up; we may fail to come up with sensible standards; we may fail to do the research needed to ensure deep penetration of this technology into various industries; repressive regimes may ban the technology altogether.\n\nIn 2017, we need to get our act together.\n\nIn 2017, we need to get our act together. Decentralization is critical to this technology and to the future of civilization. But decentralization does not mean disorganization. So we resolve to focus on governance in the new year. We achieved this for the Internet\'s first era. Now is the time to steward the second era effectively. Nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come (again)!\n\nThe year ahead\n\nNotwithstanding our admonitions in ""Blockchain Revolution"" that ""the future is not something to be predicted but something to be achieved,"" here is what we think will happen in blockchain in 2017:\n\n- A major central bank will live test a digital fiat currency and it will work, very well, leading to broader adoption.\n\n- Large banks will begin shifting large amounts of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions to real-time settlement on private distributed ledgers. Look for JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Santander to lead the charge.\n\n- Incumbent companies in every industry will begin developing a blockchain strategy, hiring key IT talent and launching pilots - for sure, insurers, healthcare providers, music labels, defense contractors and others. Deloitte and IBM are good examples of this.\n\n- Bitcoin will hit $2,000 (that\'s right: one bitcoin will be worth $2,000). Ethereum will not collapse, post-DAO, but will become a dominant platform for new apps and new business models. There will be other distributed autonomous enterprises, and they will work as designed.\n\n- A new round of startups will enter this space in virtually every industry, particularly a new class of platform and middleware companies. From what we\'ve seen, the innovation may well be stunning.\n\n- The crisis of legitimacy of democracy (as evidence by the recent US election) will accelerate the development and sandboxing of new e-voting systems and new platforms for accountable democracy emphasizing the use of smart contracts.\n\n- Blockchain Revolution will continue to be a global best-seller, in multiple languages, and make the New York Times non-fiction list.\n\nWhat are we doing in 2017?\n\nWe\'ll close with our resolutions:\n\nIn January, we are launching what we hope will be the definitive research study on the impact of blockchain on business. We are staffing up our team with the world\'s leading thinkers and tackling seven verticals: financial services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, telecommunications and media, technology, and government. We are also looking horizontally at the functions of the enterprise, from supply chain management and human resources, to marketing and information technology. Look for more announcements soon.\n\nAlso in January, Alex\'s company, Northwest Passage Ventures, is launching its first blockchain fund.\n\nWe both continue to do our part to move this ecosystem forward.\n\nIn 2016, we launched the Muskoka Group with the mission of promoting ecosystem health and empowering the nascent governance ecosystem.\n\nWe both continue to do our part to move this ecosystem forward.\n\nWe are currently conducting a project to outline some sensible steps forward. We are inventorying the players, categorizing them according to the GSN Hub (see graphic), and identifying deficiencies in the ecosystem.\n\nIn March, we will be releasing our findings and making recommendations to all stakeholders about how to overcome these deficiencies and build an effective ecosystem. Also in March, we will launch an online Blockchain Ecosystem Hub sponsored by some of the most important international organizations. The hub will provide important governance know-how for the Internet\'s second era.\n\nIn addition, Alex will continue to contribute as a member of the World Economic Forum\'s Global Future Council on Blockchain.\n\nAnd of course, we will both be on the road in 2017 launching into new exciting markets such as Korea, Thailand, Japan and several new European and Latin American countries.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Coindesk as part of their ""2016 Year in Review.""\n\nDon Tapscott is the author of 15 books, Chancellor of Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, and CEO of the Tapscott Group in Toronto. Thinkers 50 ranks him as the No. 4 most important living business thinker.\n\nAlex Tapscott is founder and CEO of Northwest Passage Ventures, an advisory firm in Toronto helping fund and accelerate new companies in the blockchain space.\n\nThey are the authors of ""Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World"" (Portfolio, 2016).', 'A year and a half ago, the idea of buying the virtual currency bitcoin was laughable. After a rapid rise in value in 2013, the cryptocurrency\'s value more than halved by mid-2015. At its lowest point, one bitcoin was equal to about $230. These days, bitcoin has made a comeback — it recently rallied to over $1,000 before fluctuating wildly. But given the currency\'s covert nature, the average person still may not understand how buying and selling actually works. Using the app Coinbase, which lets anyone trade bitcoins for a small fee, we decided to find out. A brief warning: If you\'re going to do this, tell your bank you\'re about to buy bitcoin. More on that later. View As: One Page Slides\n\nThis is what the Coinbase app looks like on an iPhone.\n\nWhen you first open the app, you\'re presented with the latest price of bitcoin and its change within a certain period. You can see in the chart below how wild the latest moves have been.\n\nI happen to be one of the many who have never traded bitcoin before. There\'s a certain level of wariness in buying into the cryptocurrency world.\n\nHowever, Coinbase\'s interface makes it simple to enter the basic personal information it needs to create your account.\n\nUser-friendliness quickly hit a snag. When I put in my address, the app didn\'t recognize I had already selected it from the autofill menu. I couldn\'t proceed unless I switched to the desktop app.\n\nSo switch I did. From the desktop portal I could easily enter more identifying info.\n\nThe final step before entering my financial information was two-step verification for security, which Coinbase quickly sent to my phone.\n\nI decided to give the app another try and opted to use my debit card to buy the bitcoin.\n\nEntering all my information was just as straightforward as everything else. The problem was that I couldn\'t exit this screen. Neither the ""buy"" nor ""not now"" option registered. I had to press the X and start all over.\n\nUltimately, and frustratingly, it was back to the desktop. So far, the actual process of buying bitcoin was simple — the app itself was my only nemesis. My $50 ended up buying 0.0524 of one bitcoin.\n\nNo looking back! (Until I sell, of course.)\n\nOh. It appeared the price was falling pretty fast the morning I decided to buy. I went back to try again, doing my best to outrun the falling price.\n\nI own bitcoin! Well, a small fraction of a bitcoin. But now this means I could sit on my hypothetical tiny pile of cryptocurrency and hope it amasses value.\n\nInstead, I decide to sell off immediately. (But not before shedding a single tear for the 12 cents I\'ve already had to part with.)\n\nTo sell the bitcoin, Coinbase only allows users to pair their bank account with the app; a credit or debit card won\'t suffice.\n\nSo I scrolled through the options to pick my bank.\n\nAnd we\'re back to the desktop. When I tried to sell the bitcoin, the app told me either the amount was invalid or I couldn\'t pay with the given method. I didn\'t understand what that meant and didn\'t want to enter a wrong number.\n\nLuckily, the online experience is much smoother. My bank account showed up right where it should have, and I sold the bitcoin just like I bought it.\n\nSince Coinbase wasn\'t linked to my bank account, the transaction needs a few days to process before the money is transferred.\n\nA small hiccup: When I went to sell the bitcoin, I had to estimate the amount. The numbers were inconsistent in certain places depending on the bitcoin value or the dollar value. I ended up with one penny left over.', 'In the brightly lit kitchen of the Crypto Castle, a three-story home in San Francisco\'s Potrero Hill neighborhood, young tech workers drink from Solo Cups and wax poetic about bitcoin. ""I don\'t think you can be in this house for two hours without being evangelized,"" said Jeremy Gardner, a resident and seasoned entrepreneur working on bitcoin technologies. His roommate, Viviane Ford, perks up. With eyes wide, she said she bought bitcoins within a week of moving in, calling it ""the best investment I\'ve ever made."" Bitcoin is a new kind of payment system in which people use digital currency, also called bitcoin, to buy things and send money. There are no banks. Transactions are recorded on a digital ledger called a blockchain, which allows users to stay anonymous. Some folks buy bitcoins in the hopes that they\'ll go up in value. On January 2, Bitcoin reached a three-year high after its value passed $1,000, up about 140% from the beginning of 2016. Still, the currency has yet to catch on widely. The software is complicated, the risk of being hacked is great, and it\'s not popular enough to be practical. But as I learned on a recent visit to the Crypto Castle, where roughly a dozen cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have called home since its founding in 2015, it\'s hard not to get excited about bitcoin when you\'re among its biggest fans. Here\'s what it\'s like to eat, sleep, drink, and work at the Crypto Castle. View As: One Page Slides\n\n2016 was a pretty great year for the tenants of the Crypto Castle. As the value of bitcoin rose, they got richer, Gardner said as he swirled a glass of liquor with his finger.\n\nNot everyone who lives here works in the bitcoin space, though anyone could pitch you on its merits. Some entrepreneurs moved in simply because they needed a place to crash.\n\nFord, head of operations at Comma, a self-driving-car technology startup, said she ""lived in a legitimate closet for two weeks"" before discovering the Crypto Castle.\n\nIt offers prices that can\'t be beat in the nation\'s most expensive rental market. Tenants split the monthly rent of $8,100. Gardner guesses the home is worth $3 million.\n\nIn 2015, Gardner, then the director of operations at Augur, a market forecasting tool that runs on blockchain, surveyed the city to find a house-slash-office for his startup.\n\nWhen he found a three-bedroom home in an upscale neighborhood — a half-hour drive from Silicon Valley — he forked over the $20,000 deposit. The Crypto Castle was born.\n\nThe house has since become a ""landing pad for anyone doing cool stuff for the industry,"" Gardner said. Most residents and guests, who sleep in bunks, are in their early 20s.\n\nGardner turns 25 this month, but said he likes looking young. He thinks it will attract investors. ""Everyone wants to invest in the next Mark Zuckerberg, the next big thing.""\n\nOne roommate, Alex Voto, runs a research lab at the Palo Alto-based Institute for the Future, which forecasts how bitcoin might affect social, economic, and political spheres.\n\nAs you move through the house, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary residence.\n\nAnyone who wishes to become a full-time resident must take a copy of Gardner\'s favorite reading material, ""Bitcoin: Introducing the Future of Money."" A stack sits at the front door.\n\nThe fridge wears bitcoin-startup stickers like badges of honor.\n\nThe kitchen comes stocked with two beverages: Soylent (a chalky-tasting meal-replacement beverage backed by venture capital) and booze. Lots of booze.\n\nA few tenants said living among so many motivated tech workers can be tiring. Ford remembers coming back from a run one Saturday and being bombarded by her coworkers.\n\nUntil recently, her company ran operations out of the basement. Comma founder George Hotz, a Silicon Valley wunderkind, built his first self-driving car in the garage.\n\nHotz also lived in this closet. ""The work-life balance just didn\'t exist,"" Ford said.\n\nAaron Power-Bearden, an equities trader and a bitcoin enthusiast, says he enjoys the late-night talks in the living room. ""Mostly it\'s about finance,"" he said. In the Crypto Castle, no one needs to travel far to find smart, like-minded people.\n\nPower-Bearden also likes ordering hot wings, a weekly ritual for the gang.\n\nOne house guest told me that the last time he was at the house, a random guy grilled him a hot dog. ""Two weeks later, I found out it was the cofounder of Oculus,"" he said.\n\nNot all the residents of the house, which Gardner calls a ""hangout place"" for bitcoin evangelists, actually work at bitcoin-related companies.\n\nBut they\'re bonded by a belief that bitcoin is the future. In 2016, they made bets on the value of the virtual currency by the end of the year, Ford said.', 'The Securities and Exchange Commission said this week it will decide whether to approve the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (COIN) on March 11.\n\nThe decision comes roughly eight months after regulators first asked for public comment on the fund, and some three years since Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss first put the ETF in registration. It would also most likely be made by Walter ""Jay"" Clayton, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for SEC chair. Clayton is a partner in the New York office of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\n\nThe approval process has been plagued with delays some say center on the fact that bitcoin is still too new, too unregulated and too risky—there is often news of fraud and losses associated with bitcoin platforms—for an easy decision. Bitcoin is both a cryptocurrency and a payment system where transactions happen person-to-person, without intermediaries.\n\nIn the past two months or so, the SEC said it has received some 30 letters of comment, according to the note published Wednesday.\n\nSplit Support\n\nSupporters have generally argued that the ETF wrapper would make access to bitcoin safer, easier and more transparent. Others, however, have raised concerns about risks of such an investment. Some want more audits, more “proof of assets,” more checks and balances in place to vet those holding the bitcoins, and to regularly report on the movement of bitcoins every time one is bought or sold.\n\nIn a recent interview, Spencer Bogart, a bitcoin researcher at Needham & Company and a former analyst at ETF.com, says that while individual investors can already access bitcoins directly, a bitcoin ETF could appeal to institutional investors who often are only able to invest in registered investment securities.\n\nToday ETF investors can only access bitcoins through a small allocation in the ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW), which obtains its exposure through publicly traded shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX: GBTC).\n\nIf launched, COIN would list on Bats, which owns ETF.com.\n\nContact Cinthia Murphy at [email protected]', 'The price of Bitcoin hit $1000 on New Year’s day bringing to reality the various predictions of experts. Despite the fact that it has slowed down a bit in the previous two days it managed to hit the 1000 mark to raise questions whether it can surpass now the next mark - the price of gold.\n\nThat was when the price of gold was hovering around $1,153.60. Some community members were of the view that Bitcoin would pass that sooner.\n\nGold down, Bitcoin up\n\nFor the last six months, gold has depreciated by 14 percent while Bitcoin rose almost 100 percent for the same period. It will interest you to note that in the month of December alone Bitcoin appreciated as much as 33 percent.\n\nBarely three days after the New Year, Bitcoin has lived to that expectation without any blemish. At 23:00 GMT on Wednesday, CoinMarketCap listed the first ever cryptocurrency for $1181.91 while Gold was listed by APMEX at $1178 bringing the prediction to light.\n\nA great feat\n\nIt is a fabulous 8th Anniversary birthday gift from Bitcoin to its community. It should be stated that the aforementioned is a novel in the history of the world. Bitcoin is the only currency that has transcended the price of gold.\n\nIt is explicit Bitcoin will continue to make inroads and soon be in the mainstream. It keeps proving skeptics wrong on all fronts.\n\nOn New Year\'s Eve, Cointelegraph asked Trace Mayer, a leading monetary and Blockchain expert on Bitcoin and gold, whether the Bitcoin Price will overtake an ounce of gold. He responded in the affirmative:\n\n""I\'ve been talking about this fourth great bull run for over a year.""\n\nHe then referred to an article he posted on Run to Gold in December 2015, titled, The Rise of the Fourth Great Bitcoin Bubble.\n\nTrace Mayer explained that investors over the years including himself had invested profoundly in the Bitcoin ecosystem. These were supporting infrastructure including merchant processor, wallets, exchanges and other support services.\n\nAccording to him over $1 bln were invested in the Bitcoin industry some of which were not made public. It is his believe these are the foundation that will propel Bitcoin price and lead to a firm and inextinguishable industry.', 'In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, CoinDesk contributor Corin Faife recaps developments in bitcoin\'s biggest technology debate.\n\nIn bitcoin\'s early days, discussion of the protocol was almost the only thing that mattered – and 2016, it could be said, has brought this discussion back to center stage.\n\nThe reason has been the continued focus on network scalability, more specifically whether modifying bitcoin\'s block size is the right way to increase the number of transactions the network can process.\n\nIt\'s important to note that to some, the continued ""debate"" isn\'t really a debate at all.\n\nAs evidenced at the technology\'s annual developer summit, there remains a strong (if not overwhelming) consensus that a proposal called Segregated Witness is the best solution – if it is approved, it will nearly double bitcoin\'s capacity.\n\nYet, a vocal minority continues to remain opposed (partly over disagreement about ""Satoshi\'s vision"" and partly due to trust issues with Bitcoin Core, its primary volunteer developer team). As such, the argument over the pros and cons of this proposal has still not been conclusively resolved.\n\nWhile bitcoin\'s price has once again returned to its 2013 highs, it could be said that only one number matters in 2017, the percentage of miners that agree to upgrade to a version of the protocol featuring the SegWit upgrade.\n\nThe progress of developments (like the much-hyped Lightning Network), as well as the business models of many startups, arguably depend on SegWit\'s implementation.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, 2017 is likely to prove a pivotal year.\n\nFor now, let\'s look at how the debate unfolded in 2016, along with the related projects and personalities that fed into it.\n\n1. Two camps form\n\nThe debate over block size and scalability was already contentious in 2015, but the main difference was that a range of proposed solutions were on the table and the partisan lines were less clear.\n\nThen, in December 2015, Blockstream co-founder and developer Pieter Wuille introduced a proposal called Segregated Witness, which would increase network throughput without modifying block size by changing the way that transactions were stored in order to use less space.\n\nAlso beneficial, developers argued, was that it could be introduced via a mechanism called a soft fork (meaning that miners who adopted it could co-exist on the network with those that did not).\n\nAs evidenced by ethereum this year, a hard fork could risk splitting the economic network into two incompatible versions. (Opponents claim that a hard fork is more democratic, as it allows voting and the possibility of two outcomes).\n\nFollowing the release of the Segregated Witness white paper, proposed solutions to the scalability problem were effectively flattened into two groups: those who wanted an increase in block size (with a further debate over what the ideal size was), and those who wanted to maintain block size while improving efficiency in other areas.\n\nSo, 2015 rolled into 2016 with a far more polarized version of the debate than had previously been seen.\n\nThis initially left Bitcoin Core developers who supported the Segregated Witness solution scrambling to do a better job of clarifying their position, with the launch of a website, Twitter feed, and Slack channel to bridge perceived communication gaps.\n\nMeanwhile, support for the alternative path gathered steam with the release of Bitcoin Classic in February, a repackaging of the Bitcoin Core software which would double the maximum block size from 1MB to 2MB.\n\nYet at almost exactly the same time, another power bloc emerged in the form of a consortium of miners and exchanges who declared that they would not back any proposal resulting in a hard fork of the network, throwing doubts over the viability of getting Bitcoin Classic off the ground.\n\n2. Bitcoin Core progresses\n\nToward the mid-point of the year, a group of about 20 contributors to the Bitcoin Core code met in Zurich to review the Segregated Witness code.\n\nHeld in late May, the meeting brought the distributed group of developers together to discuss the code itself, and broader issues of strategy and communication for the roll-out of the code.\n\nNot long afterwards, the Bitcoin Core developers merged the Segregated Witness code into the master branch of the bitcoin codebase, allowing for a new round of testing of the code on the bitcoin testnet.\n\nWith momentum firmly behind them at this stage, and after a few more months of testing the Core, developers announced that version 0.13.0 of the Bitcoin Core software would include SegWit code, albeit in a pre-activation state that could be triggered with a subsequent update. The version also included faster block relays on the network, among other technical updates.\n\nMeanwhile, in July, an upgrade to the bitcoin network\'s block relay structure was also announced.\n\nThe project was an improvement to the Bitcoin Relay Network, a system developed to boost the speed at which block data was propagated amongst bitcoin miners and thereby reduce the incidence of orphan blocks.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin Relay Network began to ‘show its age’, bitcoin developer and Blockstream co-founder Matt Corallo redesigned its successor – the Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine – using the UDP protocol instead of TCP, allowing for even faster data transmission between nodes.\n\n3. Hurdles left to jump\n\nEven after the strides of progress seen by the Bitcoin Core team, the last months of the year were to prove that consensus is still proving to be hard fought.\n\nOne of these hurdles came in the form of ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com owner Roger Ver, two influential opponents to the Bitcoin Core roadmap, both of whom have a stake in the protocol\'s mining network.\n\nIn late October, ViaBTC switched from using Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival software client backed by Ver that does not include support for Segregated Witness. Instead, it tackles the problem of scaling by introducing a configurable maximum block size which can be defined by individual miners.\n\n(For an easily digestible explanation of how this works, see Peter Rizun\'s post on how a Bitcoin Unlimited node deals with large blocks).\n\nGiven that Segregated Witness needs to be backed by 95% of the hashing power of the network in order to be adopted, any mining pool commanding 5% of the hashing power or more can effectively block the process, leaving progress towards scalability at an impasse.\n\nThis is more or less where the end of the year leaves us: with a widespread support for Segregated Witness, but a small and vocal minority of opponents holding out against it.\n\nAt the time of writing, over 50% of bitcoin nodes are running the SegWit-compatible 0.13.0 or 0.13.1 software according to Bitnodes, yet over 7% of nodes are running some version of Bitcoin Unlimited – a large enough share of mining power that the network might not be able to switch.\n\nHowever, even with the scales so heavily weighted toward Bitcoin Core, the story is far from over.\n\nIf and when the network adopts Segregated Witness, the 1.8x increase in transaction volume may buy only a finite amount of time before familiar limitations start to resurface. Though it could be argued that keeping an artificial cap could force innovation in other areas, most (if not all) developers believe the block size will one day need to rise.\n\nWith this in mind, in 2017 and beyond, it seems certain that the \'block size debate\' will continue.\n\nOrange pipes image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/06/2017,"['The end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017 was a cause for celebration for Bitcoin users. In January the price went as far as $1,161 surpassing the highs seen in 2013. The euphoria in the Bitcoin community is obvious. However, does this level of $1000 matter?\n\nDoes the price of Bitcoin itself have any relevance in the grand scheme of things? Is the rising value of Bitcoin something that can be assigned labels of good or bad?\n\nRecently Jamie Condliffe published an article titled “Why Bitcoin’s $1000 Value Doesn’t Matter?” in the MIT Technology Review. Well, frankly it is time we asked some questions of our own.\n\nDoes having a choice matter?\n\nJamie quotes the Financial Times in his article:\n\n“For context, the Central Intelligence Agency put the planet’s stock of broad money—notes, coins, and various forms of bank account—at $82tn as of the end of 2014. On the CIA figures, the value of Bitcoins hashed into existence is similar to the broad money total for Uzbekistani soms. With apologies to Tashkent, the value of soms and Bitcoins, and the number of people for whom they are relevant pieces of information in the world of modern finance, both round to zero.”\n\nWhether you choose to use Tashkent’s money, Bitcoin or the Saudi Riyal, the fact that Bitcoin even exists is amazing in itself. Bitcoin is an independent currency that has thrived when many had written it off. It has its own following albeit a small number of people who believe in this form of money as fiercely as most people do in any national coin.\n\nBitcoin offers hope for an alternative economic future in which a new kind of monetary system can exist. So yes, it is a relevant piece of information in the world of modern finance even though Jamie may not think of it as having any relevance above zero.\n\nIs Chinese mining a problem?\n\nSure Bitcoin mining is controlled largely by the Chinese and Mr. Condliffe puts it:\n\n“But such centralization is unwelcome for many users of the currency outside of China. The structure of Bitcoin means that if a single user mines the majority of the currency, then it is able to rewrite the Blockchain if it sees fit and even vetoes changes to the underlying technology.”\n\nOkay let us assume Jamie is right here. However, the Chinese did put their trust in Bitcoin, invested in setting up massive mining operations and as luck would have it had access to cheaper hardware and a good source of hydroelectric power in Tibet. They worked hard at getting this foothold in Bitcoin and what is wrong if they gain a controlling stake? Would Jamie be happier if instead of the Chinese, this leadership role was with the Americans instead?\n\nThe New York Times ran an article last summer that discussed this China bogeyman issue and as Bobby Lee, the Chief Executive of BTCC, a Bitcoin Company told the newspaper there was no Chinese united front on issues of Bitcoin network expansion or software changes.\n\nBobby said in that interview:\n\n“It was almost like imperialistic Westerners coming to China and telling us what to do here has been a history on this. The Chinese people have long memories.”\n\nIs the $1000 mark of significance?\n\nYes, if you look at it from the point of view of the value that Bitcoin has created for its believers. I wrote an article not so long ago describing how Bitcoin millionaires are created. From the angle of the novice Bitcoin user that just started using the currency about a year ago, his wealth has doubled.\n\nHas the dollar, euro, yen or any other of the $82 tln worth of currencies that Jamie mentioned done that for its users? I think the answer is sort of obvious. No. If you chose to hold your money in Bitcoin, the risk is volatility. If you choose to do so in Dollar, you have inflation, political risk, vagaries of global trade and countless other issues.\n\nAt the end of the day, use any currency or even gold, the value is bound to fluctuate. Bitcoin may go up or down more than most other currencies but that is a risk that many Bitcoin users are okay with.\n\nWill the rising value of Bitcoin lead to more control by the Chinese central government? We have not yet seen anything of that kind happen but it is not an undeniable possibility. The good thing is that even if that were to happen, Bitcoin will emerge and miners will just move elsewhere.\n\nAs for Chinese Capital controls, Bitcoin may not be the only possible means to move money out of the country. In fact, illegal money transfers are possibly the thing that the government would be more concerned about.\n\nAs Bitquant’s Joseph Wang wrote on Quora:\n\n“There are about a dozen different ways of getting money out of China that work a lot better than Bitcoin, and no one uses Bitcoin to get around currency controls. The best rate we could get is 5 percent transaction fees, and it turns out that you can do things at 0.1 percent with using the hot money brokers.”\n\nSorry Jamie but I think that you are off the mark on Bitcoin, China and money overall. Bitcoin may be small but it is to borrow from Arundhati Roy, the God of small things and its value whether $1000 or $1 matters as it represents hope. Hope as we know is priceless.', 'Bitcoin neared its all-time high today, with the surging digital currency tipped to become a new safe haven asset as the world grapples with growing economic uncertainty.\n\n\n\nThe unit broke the USD 1,100 barrier on the Bitcoin Price Index, an average of major exchanges, to continue a dizzying rise that made it the best performing currency of 2016.\n\n\n\nIt has fluctuated wildly since it was created in 2009 and lost three quarters of its value when it plummeted from its previous BPI high of USD 1,165.89 in 2013.\n\n\n\nAnd news of a major bitcoin theft by hackers in August sent its price plunging by more than 20 percent.\n\n\n\nBut analysts say its volatility will ease as volumes grow and point to a strengthening US dollar and tightening currency and capital controls, as well as the rise of the digital economy, as major factors behind its appreciation.\n\n\n\nIn particular, the chaotic withdrawal of high value bills in India and restrictions on buying foreign currency in China as the yuan slides against the dollar have stoked demand, analysts say.\n\n\n\nExacerbating the rocketing demand is a tightening supply of fresh bitcoins.\n\n\n\nThe currency was always meant to be finite, and more than three quarters of the planned 21 million bitcoins have already been \'mined\'.\n\n\n\nEncrypted digital coins are created by supercomputers and then traded online or exchanged for goods and services.\n\n\n\nVinny Lingham, a bitcoin expert and CEO of US digital identity protection startup Civic, told AFP the dwindling supply of new bitcoins, and regular currencies sliding against the US dollar as the Federal Reserve ratchets up interest rates, were pushing up the unit\'s value.\n\n\n\n""There are fewer bitcoins coming out and people are seeing bitcoin as a good hedge against currency devaluation in their countries, and instead of buying the US dollar, people are buying bitcoins,"" he said.\n\n\n\nLingham highlighted the impact of wider geopolitical uncertainty, such as US President-elect Donald Trump\'s potential threat to emerging markets. He has predicted bitcoin will be worth about USD 3,000 by the end of 2017.\n\n\n\n""Bitcoin is reacting as a safe haven,"" he said.\n\n\n\n""Millennials do not believe in gold as their parents did. Bitcoin is becoming the go-to asset if you live in a foreign market and are concerned about your government.""\n\n\n\nThe price of bitcoins in many emerging market currencies has risen even more steeply than in dollars, Lingham said.\n\n\n\nIn China, the yuan is at its lowest level in eight years against the dollar and Beijing\'s tightening controls on individuals\' foreign currency purchases to curb massive capital flight is cited as driving bitcoin demand.\n\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s shock decision to withdraw high-denomination 500 (USD 7.50) and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation is also thought to have boosted the currency.\n\n\n\n""It\'s not only China, it\'s a global phenomenon,"" Bobby Lee, founder and CEO of Chinese bitcoin exchange BTC China, told AFP.\n\n\n\n""There are a lot of demonetising examples. In India they (are) cancelling some rupee notes, in Argentina they cancelled some notes as well ... It makes bitcoin more attractive, it is a real new asset class"".""\n\n\n\nLee said there would be more regulation of digital assets worldwide in future.""There is already a limit on foreign exchange\n\n\n\nconversion... But so far, capital outflows restrictions don\'t hit the bitcoin,"" Lee said\n\n\n\nDickie Wong, Hong Kong-based research director for Kingston Securities, added it was likely Chinese investors were moving money into bitcoin as the yuan sinks to circumvent the USD 50,000 annual limit on foreign currency purchases.\n\n\n\n""The devaluation of the RMB (yuan) is the main problem,"" he said.\n\n\n\nBitcoin now has a total market capitalisation of more than USD 18 billion -- far more than rival so-called ""crypto-currencies"", although a fraction of the value of other globally traded currencies.\n\n\n\nAjay Sunder, vice president of digital transformation for Asia Pacific at consultants Frost & Sullivan in Singapore, said wider trends such as the rise in digital payments would strengthen the currency.\n\n\n\n""Generally people are much more comfortable now using digital payment, digital transactions,"" he said.', 'The future of cryptocurrency largely depends on the range of options available for spending crypto savings, and the positive trend here is that we see a large amount of legitimate businesses opening up to the digital currency.\n\nSlowly, but rather persistently, Bitcoin is getting accepted in Russia as well. Having started from uncertainty about the legal status of cryptocurrency, it appears now that the skies are getting clear.\n\nHerman Gref, CEO of the biggest Russian bank, Sberbank, says:\n\n“Cryptocurrencies represent a very interesting international experiment which breaks the paradigm of currency emission. We definitely should not restrict the use of it, but we should try to understand how it works, explore it, and find ways to regulate it.”\n\nAt the moment state officials consider Bitcoin as a new financial instrument, not fully studied, but demonstrating a significant economic potential. A special working group at the Russian parliament has been developing a framework for cryptocurrencies legislation.\n\nHere are just some examples of services you can purchase in Russia with your Bitcoins.\n\nBuy a drink\n\nA chain of discount bars KillFish has integrated cryptocurrency payments into their system back in 2013 becoming the first Russian company that dived into the world of digital finance.\n\nGo to gym\n\nOne can also purchase a membership card at NanoFitness, a chain of fitness studios, paying in Bitcoin. Dmitri Karpenko, the general manager at NanoFitness says:\n\n“We have always aspired to keep pace with innovations, therefore we kept an eye on the situation around cryptocurrencies globally, and particularly in Russia. We were interested in the integration of the latest FinTech advancements, therefore striving to take on a leader’s position in this process, we decided to seize the moment and offer our customers a new service. We are proud to offer this innovative and trendy payment instrument meeting the spirit of the times and our company philosophy.”\n\nGo to the lawyer\n\nIn a number of countries, legal services are sometimes paid in Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency ensures anonymity. There is at least one legal firm in Russia accepting Bitcoins as a form of payment for their services. Legal Prime GS Consulting integrated Bitcoin payments in 2014. A company spokesperson says:\n\n“Bitcoin allows sending money directly to anyone with no middlemen and with the lower service fee. Transactions are irreversible, and all participants have equal rights and equal access to the information about the chain of transactions. You can transact with anyone who has an Internet access, from any part of the world.”\n\nCoworking space\n\nKL10CH not only WAS TESTING accepting payments in Bitcoins but also hosted gatherings which initially was running a coworking space in Saint Petersburg not only accepted payments in Bitcoins but also hosted gatherings of the local Bitcoin community, lectures and workshops on topics around IT, game tournaments and Geek Speed Dating. Recently, KL10CH has moved to Moscow and expanded adding a few new locations expanded adding a few new locations. By the end of 2017 KL10CH is planning to fully support Bitcoin payments.\n\nGetting around\n\nWheely Business taxi service started accepting Bitcoins in 2014. Passenger willing to make a payment using digital currency could simply top up the balance in the personal account at the company website beforehand. Payments made through Wheely’s system are not anonymized, as every customer links his personal account with a credit card.\n\nSo far no Airline company in Russia accepts payments for services in Bitcoin, however, a Latvian AirBaltic which operates flights from Moscow and Saint Petersburg is pioneering in this area. In 2014 AirBaltic embraced the Bitcoin revolution and started accepting payments in Bitcoins through Bitpay system using a special desktop application, the Web or mobile wallet. It is possible to pay for Basic tickets without any extra service fee.\n\nGiveaway for charity\n\nThose who feel like giving Bitcoins away to a good cause should take a note that Red Cross Russia, as well as a number of Internet projects such as Wikipedia or RuBlackList, accept donations in Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin is a revolutionary payment tool allowing transactions without middlemen, restrictions and extra service fees.\n\nActive cooperation of state officials and industry experts in defining a legal status of cryptocurrency will certainly create a basis for further innovation, facilitating a wider acceptance of Bitcoin in Russia.', 'Back in 2014, Vox reporter Timothy B. Lee wrote a story for the site titled “Why I’m investing in bitcoins” in which he laid out the case for the cryptocurrency’s long-term viability and explained why he thought he would make a profit by owning some.\n\nThe backlash was swift. Vox had more than 20 million readers a month in 2014, according to its year-end update, while it was estimated that all the world’s bitcoins were owned by just 1.2 million people, so it’s not unrealistic to assume that Lee’s glowing article could have increased the value of his investment. There is no way to know if the article had any real impact, short or long term, but bitcoin was in the middle of a prolonged price fall when Lee wrote the story, and it did see a small bump the day after the article was published.\n\nTraditionally, journalists aren’t allowed to invest in companies they cover. Lee’s boss Ezra Klein quickly reversed course, forcing Lee to sell his bitcoins and donate the proceeds to charity. “While I don’t think it’s impossible to fairly cover Bitcoin while also holding some Bitcoins, the reason to make these rules blunt and general, rather than nuanced and specific, is to ensure there’s no question about the motivations of the underlying coverage,” Klein wrote in an apology post.\n\nMacallan Rare Cask\n\nShould reporters writing about bitcoin be allowed to own any? Opinion is split. Traditional media outlets forbid it. “We have a policy about financial reporters and their holdings, including bitcoin,” Tracy Grant, deputy managing editor at The Washington Post, said in an email. “Business reporters must disclose financial interests and cannot hold investments in companies or entities they might write about. So we would not allow a reporter who owns bitcoins to write about them.”\n\nMeanwhile, the bitcoin and cryptocurrency trade media — which produce much of the best reporting on the topic — seem to consider it completely kosher, and even desirable, for reporters to have a stake in what they’re writing about. Of the major bitcoin-focused news outlets, only CoinDesk had a publicly available editorial policy about this issue. (CoinDesk, and other bitcoin outlets including CoinTelegraph, BTC Media, NewsBTC, and CryptoCoinsNews, did not respond by deadline when asked about it by email.)\n\nConflicts of interest from owners, advertisers, investors, and sources are also rolled up in the unsupervised world of bitcoin reporting.\n\nCoinDesk’s policy is pretty thorough. The site does not endorse any cryptocurrency (this may sound obvious, but consider that NewsBTC’s ethics statement says, “We write about bitcoin news because we love bitcoin. Simple as that.”), and its writers are required to disclose holdings worth more than $500 in their site bios. They are also required to disclose when money was made in the course of reporting on a cryptocurrency, and additional disclosures are required in the context of its parent company’s holdings.\n\nOther outlets aren’t that fastidious, however. Many independent outlets actually pay their writers in bitcoin. Coin Journal requires its writers to disclose any digital currency investments worth more than $1,000, except for bitcoin. (It also paid at least one of its writers, Ian DeMartino, in bitcoin, as he writes in his book, The Bitcoin Guidebook.)\n\nMeanwhile, CryptoCoinsNews, also known as CCN, said in a letter to readers that “there is a longstanding policy requiring writers to declare their interests” and that editors have “refused stories based on conflicts of interest.” However, there is no stated policy on the site and no mention of this in its solicitation for writers. (The site does have the amazing disclosure that “Advertised sites are not endorsed by us. They may be unsafe, untrustworthy, or illegal in your jurisdiction.”)\n\nI posed the question to r/bitcoin: Do you care if reporters are invested in a currency they are covering? The answer was basically no: Users felt that owning bitcoin was more likely to result in better coverage.\n\nHowever, the bitcoin media has been at the center of controversy over conflicts of interest in the past. CoinTelegraph, another prominent bitcoin publication that takes a generally boostery tone, came under fire about a year ago when it came out that it had supposedly been funded by a proprietary cryptocurrency called ByteCoin. CoinTelegraph has no publicly stated policy on whether its writers can own bitcoin, and public statements by its writers suggest at least some of them were paid in bitcoin. A job listing doesn’t say anything about owning or not owning bitcoin. Coin Idol, which was started by CoinTelegraph alums, said in an email that its writers are “mostly Blockchain enthusiasts” so “of course, they use cryptocurrencies.”\n\nWhether or not reporters own or disclose owning bitcoin may not be the biggest issue. Conflicts of interest from owners, advertisers, investors, and sources are also rolled up in the unsupervised world of bitcoin reporting, and almost everyone has the same incentive. If bitcoin gets bigger, everyone in this mini-industry profits. Writers from these outlets are also frequently pulled in as experts in the mainstream media; the Nasdaq blog even syndicates Bitcoin Magazine, a publication of BTC Media.\n\nYou could make the same criticisms about the business press, but more traditional outlets typically have stricter rules and their markets are less susceptible to media influence.\n\nThis week, bitcoin turned 8 years old. It also hit an all-time high in value: $1,149.92, according to CoinDesk. Then it abruptly plummeted below $1,000.\n\nBitcoin’s volatility after all these years is indicative of the tension between its use as an actual currency, which is rare, and its use as an investment vehicle by amateurs and professionals who collectively are extremely sensitive to world events. All this, plus the lack of a regulatory authority and persistent confusion about what bitcoin is and how it works, means that the currency’s perceived value is still heavily dependent on the media. Whether bitcoin media are any more corrupt and unreliable than for any other industry is debatable, but the question is more pressing as the currency continues to grow in influence (or at least not die).', 'Bitcoin Indonesia, a prominent online Bitcoin marketplace for Indonesian traders and investors, revealed a rapid development in its user base after adding over 170,000 members within 12 months.\n\nAt the beginning of 2016, Bitcoin Indonesia served 80,000 active users on its marketplace. Tens of thousands of members purchased and sold Bitcoin through Bitcoin Indonesia through simplistic deposit and withdrawal methods such as bank over-the-counter cash settlement and online transfer.\n\nOver the past year, Bitcoin Indonesia’s user base grew from 80,000 to more than 250,000 active members. In January of 2015, Bitcoin Indonesia operated a platform with less than 50,000 members, thus, in essence, throughout the entire year of 2015 the platform only added 30,000 consumers.\n\nIn comparison, this year’s growth is equivalent to nearly 6x of the average user base growth of last year, which can be considered to be an optimistic sign for the long-term development of Bitcoin Indonesia and the Indonesian Bitcoin market in general.\n\nMassive increase in daily trading volume\n\nBitcoin Indonesia revealed a massive increase in its daily transaction volume, which currently stands at $1.48 mln. While the platform’s trading volume is only a fraction of other major Bitcoin exchanges, it is substantially larger than other markets such as the Philippines and Thailand.\n\nSuasti Atmastuti Astaman, the business development manager at Bitcoin Indonesia, attributed the growth of the platform’s user base and trading volume to the legalization of Bitcoin in various countries including China, the US and Russia.\n\nThe clear regulatory framework and policies on Bitcoin are allowing local Indonesian users to better understand the benefits and advantages of using Bitcoin instead of fiat or other banking services.\n\nAstaman said in an interview with a local publication:\n\n“Bitcoin’s value completely depends on supply and demand in the market. At present, as more and more countries have relaxed their stances on the digital currency, including the United States, China and Russia, more and more people are putting their trust in it. That’s why Bitcoin’s value has been rapidly surging.”\n\nHowever, the operators of Bitcoin Indonesia and other startups in the region must attempt to educate users on the basic concepts of Bitcoin to prepare for the inevitable legal conflicts that will arise in the future.\n\nIf certain governments such as China attempt to ban Bitcoin and the entire motivation of using Bitcoin relies on the current regulatory frameworks, it may significantly affect the long-term survivability of the company.', 'Emma Haslett\n\nWhat a difference a day makes. This time yesterday, bitcoin was on course to hit a three-year high. Today, it\'s hovering well below $1,000.\n\nYesterday the cryptocurrency peaked at $1,151.03 before promptly falling almost 20 per cent, wiping $180-odd off its value.\n\nToday it extended those losses, falling 11 per cent to $895.19. Yikes.\n\nRead more: Buyer, beware: Bitcoin collecting could dig a hole in your pockets\n\nThe rally came days after bitcoin was named the world\'s best-performing currency for the second year in a row, after it rose 126 per cent in a single year – compared with just 22 per cent for the Brazilian Real, the second-best performer.\n\nThat said, in 2014 it was the worst performer, losing 56 per cent of its value – which gives an indication of the kind of volatility bitcoin investors can expect.\n\n""Long-term investors in bitcoin will be used to a degree of instability, with instability and illiquidity two of the major drawbacks of trading the digital currency,"" said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG.\n\nHe added that speculation over activity in China may have given rise to the sudden surge in interest.\n\n""Amid speculation that the Chinese are using bitcoins to navigate restrictions on foreign currency purchases, investors will hope this isn’t a precursor to Beijing implementing new controls on the purchase of cryptocurrencies.""', 'After skyrocketing 43.7 percent in the final two weeks of 2016, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC) has made a sharp reversal in the past two days. On Thursday, the ETF plummeted 11.6 percent. In early Friday trading, the GBTC is down another 7.7 percent.\n\nAccording to Dennis Gartman, author of The Gartman Letter, a Bitcoin selloff was inevitable. Gartman says the recent runup in Bitcoin came from Indian and Chinese citizens rushing into the currency to avoid weakness in their native denominations.\n\n“These sorts of things always…ALWAYS…end badly and they ended yesterday amidst early buying panic and then even greater panic selling,” Gartman writes.\n\nGartman adds that he hasn’t ever seen anything like the trading action in Bitcoin in the past 48 hours. He predicts that the panic-selling is not yet over and Bitcoin investors could be staring at significantly more downside in coming days.\n\nHe also hints that the complexity of Bitcoin’s technology may be scaring off potential investors.\n\n“Bitcoin may be the currency of the future but quite honestly we find it quite nearly incomprehensible at this point,” Gartman concluded.\n\nThe GBTC ETF was up roughly 90 percent in 2016. A new big-board-listed Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF could be launched sometime in 2017.', 'The value of bitcoin surged past $1,000 this week, the first time it has reached such heights since late 2013. But don\'t let that big number fool you: this strange and controversial technology is no closer to becoming a mainstream currency. Even Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee at Coinbase, the country\'s most important bitcoin company, will tell you that bitcoin will never be a substitute for the dollar.\n\n""It was a big mistake that any of this was ever compared to currency,"" Carlson-Wee says.\n\nThis seemingly pessimistic sentiment is what you hear more and more often, not only from people on the fringes on the bitcoin community but those at the heart of it. Bitcoin is not something the average person will ever use to buy and sell stuff, they say, particularly in the US and other Western countries. The world just doesn\'t need a dedicated digital currency. It\'s already pretty darn easy to pay for stuff with dollars, thanks to debit cards and the internet and any number of smartphone services. And even if the need was there, too many legal, regulatory, and cultural hurdles stand in bitcoin\'s path to mainstream adoption. Right now, bitcoin is useful mainly as digital gold—as an investment. Precious metal-style speculation is why bitcoin\'s value is on the rise: The price is going up because people think the price will keep going up—particularly people in China, which now dominates the bitcoin landscape.\n\nBitcoin is also a useful way of moving money across international borders, and that will likely be its main application over the next several years. But for Carlson-Wee, bitcoin is most valuable as something else entirely—not as a new currency, not as a new gold, not as a new Western Union, not even as a new stock, but as something that enables financial phenomena that have never existed before, what Carlson-Wee calls ""programmatic finance."" Through the idea of a blockchain, Carlson-Wee believes, it will power businesses that essentially own and run themselves—a role more important than any one currency.\n\nBitcoin is not something that will improve what the world has. It\'s something that will give the world stuff it\'s never had.\n\nHe believes this so strongly, in fact, that he left Coinbase this past summer to start Polychain Capital, a new kind of hedge fund designed to back this new breed of business. Backed by $10 million in venture capital from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, Polychain only invests in bitcoin and other digital ""tokens"" that live on a blockchain, the distributed online ledger that makes bitcoin possible. That may sound like Polychain merely invests in online currencies, but the idea is more ambitious than that. Thanks to Ethereum and other alternatives to the bitcoin network, such tokens are increasingly prevalent online, and they\'re intended to function as digital versions of anything that holds value—not just money. Ethereum, for example, runs ""smart contracts""—software programs that can potentially drive entire businesses.\n\n""For the first time, we\'re seeing software automate business itself—the business entity,"" says Carlson-Wee, who bought his first bitcoin in 2011, when it was $2 a coin, and penned his undergraduate thesis on the technology that same year. With Polychain, he is betting on this new kind of business—and only this new kind of business.\n\nOn Their Own\n\nCarlson-Wee declined to discuss the company\'s specific investments. But one example of the kind of investment he has his eye on is The Golem Project, an effort to create a new incarnation of the world wide web that\'s completely decentralized. Right now, the web may be distributed across many servers, but it\'s still run by central authorities such as ICANN, and it still has central points of failure. Golem is creating an alternative system that\'s completely distributed. No one person or company or government owns it. No one individual or group can decide how it operates or when to shut it down. It operates according to the will of the many.\n\nThere\'s also Filecoin, an Amazon-cloud-like data storage service that operates without Amazon or any other central authority. And perhaps most famously, at least in bitoin circles, there\'s the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, better known as the DAO. Also built atop the Ethereum blockchain, the DAO operated as a new kind of venture capital fund, one controlled not by someone like Marc Andreessen or Peter Thiel but by thousands of people spread across the internet. It\'s a key example, because it shows the weakness in smart contracts: it was hacked last year to the tune of $50 million. The kind of blockchain businesses that interest Carlson-Wee are still a long way from maturity, and as online entities, these creations will never be completely safe from online attack, as Carslon-Wee admits.\n\nBut he also believes there are safer ways of building systems like the DAO. They should be built in a modular way, he says, much like any secure software. And he believes that ultimately, decentralized operations like Golem or the DAO will be the norm. One day, he says, the world will use a decentralized Facebook, not Facebook itself, a decentralized Uber, a decentralized Etsy, and on and on into every sector of the economy. ""We\'re going to see whole industries plowed over by software contracts living in these blockchains,"" he says. Carlson-Wee is not the first person to propose such a future, and he acknowledges that if it arrives at all, it\'s still a long way off. But his fund is betting that it will.\n\nIn may respects, this is a new way of investing (though Polychain isn\'t its only practitioner). If Polychain buys the digital tokens that underpin the Golem Project, it is quite literally buying a piece of the operation. And this is the only way of buying into the operation. The Golem Project isn\'t really a company. The project has no shares, only blockchain tokens. If Polychain buys these tokens, it isn\'t quite a VC investment. And it\'s not really a stock purchase. It\'s a third thing that doesn\'t really have a name yet. ""There is no company. There is no stock,"" says Richard Craib, CEO of another crytocurrency-driven hedge fund, Numerai, who has also invested in Polychain. ""But this feels like a stock.""\n\nThese radically new financial concepts offer the best context for thinking about bitcoin. It\'s not something that will improve what the world has, such as money or stock. It\'s something that will give the world stuff it has never had. Maybe.', ""Bitcoin is set for a bullish market, Ethereum is here to stay, traditional investment vehicles and cryptocurrencies will marry and Blockchain awareness shall grow globally, according to an expert.\n\nThe year 2016 saw an influx of Blockchain startups, with Ethereum showing a lot of promise before the DAO breach. As 2017 begins, Bitcoin has broken the $1000 mark and will achieve a new level of market capitalization.\n\nJason Cassidy, a Blockchain expert and president at CryptoConsultant.com, tells Cointelegraph his expectations within the crypto environment over the course of the year.\n\nThe end of the Bitcoin bear market\n\nSince the climatic downfall of Mt.Gox back in late 2013, Bitcoin has been in a bear market, says Cassidy.\n\nHe explains:\n\n“The bear has been in slumber for some time now and 2017 is the year that Bitcoin finally breaks free and enters into a new bull market. And while I do not anticipate spectacular gains in 2017, this year should set the floor for a monumental price run coming in the near future.”\n\nEthereum vs. Ethereum Classic, round 2\n\nCassidy notes that the fight between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is far from over and will continue for some time. While refusing to reveal who he believes will win the battle, in the end, Cassidy expects to see some major news coming out of both camps this year, which will get global attention. “Ethereum, whether it be the original chain or a forked version, is here to stay,” he says.\n\nTraditional investment vehicles + crypto = harmony\n\nAnother observation made by Cassidy is the estimation that the current financial system holds several quadrillion dollars worth of wealth, particularly in the unregulated sectors of the derivatives market.\n\nHe says that be it due to organic adoption or through a disaster in the current financial system, capital will be flowing into the cryptocurrencies and Blockchain assets:\n\n“Consider how much money exists in the current system and how few traditional investment vehicles exists today as on-ramps for that money to enter into our industry? 2017 is the year that traditional financial vehicles meet Bitcoin.”\n\nCassidy also expects mutual funds, hedge funds and ETF's to all make big splashes. “Expect institutional players to use these on-ramps to gain exposure to these new markets,” he says.\n\nGlobal Blockchain awareness\n\nCassidy says that there are too many good things happening in the Blockchain space to not permeate into the collective unconscious of society. Everything from identification to talent recruitment is being positively disrupted.\n\n“Bitcoin is doing to money what I expect other Blockchain technologies will do for key areas of life outside of finance,” he concludes."", 'The volatility of Bitcoin is forecasted to reach a similar level as other current fiat currencies by 2019, says a new study by Chappuis Halder & Co. It looked into whether the digital currency’s price can be forecasted like any other asset.\n\nMeant to create a model that is able to predict Bitcoin’s price behavior or be able to identify its future values within a confidence interval - as it exists today for other assets - the paper aimed at understanding the behavior of Bitcoin’s price. It gave an overview of its mechanics and that of the Blockchain technology before explaining internal and external factors that seem to influence the asset’s price.\n\nThe future looks bright\n\nThe report says:\n\n“Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are likely to have a bright future in the next few years. The real challenge is, therefore, to succeed in analyzing and modeling them whereas their youth and attractiveness make them very volatile and subject to speculation.”\n\nBitcoin’s volatility has been a topical issue for quite some time. According to btcvol.info, as a measure of how much the price of a financial asset varies over time, monitoring the volatility level will help one understand when an asset is risky to hold.\n\nThe site which tracks the volatility of Bitcoin prices in US dollars puts the latest 30-day estimate of Bitcoin volatility index level at 2.41 percent, as at the time of this writing, while the volatility of gold averages around 1.2 percent and other major currencies average between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent.\n\nIt also notes that if Bitcoin volatility decreases, the cost of converting into and out of the digital currency will decrease as well.\n\nA safe-haven investment\n\nIn the paper by Chappuis Halder & Co, Bitcoin’s comparison with other assets for possible similarities or divergences showed that it is a real new asset class that could be used as a currency and as a safe-haven investment.\n\nHowever, the authors were not able to propose a pricing model for Bitcoin as the Time Series model performed on its price demonstrates its limits with such volatile series.\n\nThey believe, though, that a macroeconomic understanding of Bitcoin behavior combined with a stabilization of its price will allow its accurate pricing once the market is more familiar with it as an asset. They also noted that a loss of confidence in the market or a mining shutdown would make cryptocurrencies disappear.\n\nNonetheless, other factors, like the number of unique addresses, can be predicted more easily and could, therefore, be used to have insights on price conduct. From a macroeconomic point of view, the paper showed how reactive Bitcoin was to monetary policies changes or security glitches.\n\nIn the meantime, the safety and transparency of transactions and the evolution of mining profitability are keys to cryptocurrencies survival.']"
01/07/2017,"['It’s been a year since I argued that bitcoin was too big to fail, but it has only got stronger. And yet, you don’t have to look far to find a new death knell for the digital currency.\n\nThese prognostications may be loud and frequent but each is more wrong than the last. For instance, December found many asking whether bitcoin was dead only to be faced with a rally that saw the digital currency cross the $1,000 mark. We saw similar rallies following the Brexit vote and U.S. election when bitcoin became a safe haven in the face of geopolitical risk that brought the security of our most trusted fiat currencies into question.\n\nOver the course of 2016, bitcoin’s value grew by over 122 percent. Closer to home, we saw our most impressive quarter to date in Q4 2016, with our number of wallets crossing the 10 million mark and transaction volume doubling. Now is a perfect time to reflect on why that’s the case.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nSome pretty strong language has been used to describe the past 12 months, including “roller coaster,” “catastrophic,” “dangerous,” and “volatile.” Amazingly, these words do not apply to bitcoin, but rather to the implosion of global currency markets.\n\nIt started in June, when traders were caught off guard by the U.K.’s decision to leave the Eurozone. Since the referendum, the GBP has dropped by more than 17 percent in a colossal collapse of confidence. In a country that imports 78 percent of its goods, everything has become a lot more expensive and some economists speculate it will get worse.\n\nCoinmarketcap\n\nBritain’s experience was not an outlier. In Africa, the Egyptian pound dropped 59 percent and the Nigerian naira fell 37 percent. In South America, the Argentine peso plummeted over 17 percent and the Venezuelan bolivar tumbled so far off a cliff it’s difficult to measure—even bricks of cash are worthless for everyday purchases there.\n\nPerhaps most dramatically of all, India, the world’s second most populated country, introduced a stunning policy of demonetization declaring banknotes illegal overnight. This drove hundreds of millions of people to scramble for alternative stores of value. The price of gold instantly traded at a premium, as did digital currency.\n\nDuring this time period, and partially in response to it, the price of bitcoin surged. This phenomenon is known as antifragility, a property of systems that increase in capability and resilience as a result of stressors, shocks, attacks, and faults. Bitcoin was again declared the world’s best performing currency in 2016 by Bloomberg. In fact, it’s held that title every year since 2010, with the notable exception of 2014, when it was the worst. Still, five out of the past six years is a powerful signal. When the New England Patriots do that well we call it a dynasty.\n\nBitcoin also trounced the stock market from a performance perspective. Brand names like McDonald’s, Home Depot and Disney grew at a paltry 1.6 percent or less; bitcoin outpaced them by over 70 times.\n\nExponential technologies have incredible impacts on our society. They reimagine the world in ways that inspire and surprise us. Every year, from transaction growth, to new users coming online, the bitcoin network and the block chain have been doubling in size.\n\nI’ve found that people have a difficult time understand exponentials, which makes sense because we don’t really run into them that often. An old French parable explains it well. Imagine a small lily pond with a single lily pad in it. The next day, there are two. Then four the day after, etc. If the pond is full on the 30th day, which day will the pond be half full? The answer may surprise you, but it’s the 29th day.\n\nSo while bitcoin quietly doubles in size year-on-year, it’s covering more and more territory, surprising more and more pundits, and being adopted by more and more people. 2017 looks very promising, indeed.\n\nNicolas Cary is the co-founder and president of Blockchain, the world’s leading software platform for digital assets.', 'Indonesia is a developing region, which spells a bright future for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Over the past few years, it has become apparent the country is home to a growing number of Bitcoin enthusiasts. Not entirely surprising, considering four in five residents have limited or no access to banking services.\n\nBitcoin Can Change Indonesia’s Economy For Good\n\nIt is evident currencies such as Bitcoin can offer something no government or financial institution can guarantee. Financial inclusion is a very fancy word thrown around a lot by policy makers and financial experts. Unfortunately, financial inclusion is not a top priority of banks and consorts, even though they will often claim it is.\n\nOne of the country’s local Bitcoin exchanges, called Bitcoin.co.id, has seen its fair share of success in recent years. With the user base growing with over 3,000 members every month, it is a clear Bitcoin demand in Indonesia is growing. Moreover, the increase in users also means a higher transaction volume every single day.\n\nAs one would come to expect from a developing region, the demand for Bitcoin stems forth from speculators, rather than users. One could argue all interest in Bitcoin is a positive trend, but unless people actively use it as a currency, it will not live up to its full potential. People who frequently trade Bitcoin are not necessarily harming the ecosystem, although they directly influence the perceived value and market cap of Bitcoin while doing so.\n\nThat does not mean Bitcoin has no use cases in Indonesia, though. The number of Bitcoin use cases remains small, as is to be expected. Merchants see the benefit of accepting cryptocurrency payments, alongside more traditional options. Some even use Bitcoin to pay utility bills, top up mobile credit, and even arranging travel accommodations.\n\nIndonesia’s main problem is the lack of financial access for the average user. With nearly 80% of the population unbanked right now, digital solutions, such as Bitcoin, are destined to make a big impact on the market over the coming years. One of the more obvious use cases for Bitcoin in this part of the world is creating a cheaper way to send money back home.\n\nFor the time being, there is no official Bitcoin regulation in Indonesia This puts off some people who look to use cryptocurrency for goods and services, as they are unsure if BTC’s legal status will ever change. It also creates opportunities for day traders, who will take advantage of any event that may hint at a chance in Bitcoin policy. Despite the lack of official regulation, exchanges perform KYC and AML procedures, just like they would in any other country.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Eric Lombrozo is a Bitcoin Core developer and CEO of Ciphrex, a software company developing tools and application development platforms for cryptographic transaction processing.\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Lombrozo recaps a fraught year in bitcoin\'s development history, one that he believes should serve as a reminder of how the community should come together and recognize its common goals.\n\nWhen I first started working to develop bitcoin applications in 2011, I assumed it was a fairly stable protocol that would be unlikely to change in drastic ways – the rules were well-defined and the network was open to participation by anyone who adhered to these rules.\n\nDespite noting plenty of ways the system\'s design could have been made better in hindsight, it was clear that getting everyone on the network to adopt changes to these rules would be a difficult task.\n\nIt was feasible to have multiple implementations as long as they all followed the same rules. But even relatively small differences in behavior could introduce systemic incompatibilities that would break the network.\n\nIn general, it would be much easier to just try creating a new network from scratch, and in fact, a number of people did just that.\n\nI was involved in the early phases of two of such projects, Ripple and ethereum.\n\nNew challenges for consensus networks\n\nExtending or modifying decentralized consensus protocols turns out to be an extremely challenging problem.\n\nAs opposed to more conventional deployment models in the software industry, providing a migration path for users involves not just requiring backward compatibility with older protocols and data formats – it also requires ensuring that the economic incentive structures that provide the security as well as the eventual consistency of the entire network remain intact.\n\nIn particular, when dealing with a distributed financial ledger, it is important that everyone come to agree on its state, and that nobody be able to game it unfairly or violate existing contracts at any stage of an update. I think it\'s fair to say that the subtle challenges posed by these requirements tend to be often highly underestimated.\n\nBitcoin encountered its first major protocol upgrade challenge in 2015.\n\nPrior to this, the bitcoin software had been undergoing frequent updates and releases. There had even been a few additions to the protocol itself. But up until 2015, none of these updates had deliberately involved any changes that could potentially severely disrupt incentives or fork the ledger.\n\nThere had been minor incidents such as the March 2013 fork that resulted from an undocumented behavior in the database engine. (This caused some nodes to reject a particular block that others had accepted).\n\nBut while this particular incident required manual intervention to resolve, the incentives were still sufficiently well-aligned to allow for a coordinated cooperative effort that restored the network\'s functionality quickly and without significant widespread losses.\n\nTechnical changes become political challenges\n\n2015 marked an important turning point.\n\nIt was the first time a change was proposed that predictably would alter incentives and would be certain to break compatibility in ways that would not only require extensive logistical coordination but would also lead to controversies that would make the kind of cooperation required for smooth transition extremely difficult.\n\nTo the untrained eye, it seemed to be like a very innocuous and simple change, one involving a single parameter that capped transaction blocks at a maximum size of 1 MB.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of system engineers, what was being proposed was not just a technical change, it was a political powder keg.\n\nIn a more conventional network setting, especially one where a small number of players could control the execution environment (such as is the case with deployment of new servers within an organization), such a parameter change would seem like an almost trivial change.\n\nEngineers would have to weigh the tradeoffs in terms of system behavior and costs. Processing bigger blocks would require bigger, more powerful hardware, but the extra costs can be calculated and the organization can decide whether the greater transaction throughput justifies these costs.\n\nHowever, in a decentralized deployment setting, especially one where participation is voluntary, the entire network is held together by economic incentives in a tight balance, and all network participants must agree to the same rules governing how a financial ledger can be modified.\n\nIn this way, even such a seemingly trivial change can become a monumental task fraught with tremendous risks.\n\nPolitical challenges become social challenges\n\nI had already been working on Bitcoin Core for a few years by this time, and I was already very familiar with many of the difficulties that arise in free, open-source software development. But for the first time, I felt the entire bitcoin network (with a market capitalization in the billions of US dollars) was potentially threatened by rising community tensions.\n\nI, myself, had no particularly strong preferences for a given maximum block size. But I would have liked to see a good long-term solution emerge where block size could increase dynamically as better technology emerges.\n\nThis seems to be a common view among many bitcoin developers, but a good solution continues to elude us and will require more work.\n\nWhat was clear was that attempts to just alter this parameter or remove it were highly controversial, and that the economic incentives keeping the network healthy were at risk.\n\nThe fact that it was controversial meant that without overwhelming stakeholder support that could keep the differing incentives in balance, coordinating a smooth transition would be nearly impossible – there was a very real risk of the network splitting in two or more fragments, all of which would be incompatible with one another.\n\nI should point out that no one is to be faulted for this – it is the nature of a system that is designed to be immutable. And had it not been this particular issue, some other controversial issue would have arisen sooner or later.\n\nThe problems mentioned above had been discussed to considerable length in public discussions, which continued throughout 2015 and well into 2016. Perhaps what was most surreal was seeing the community splinter and fragment as inaccurate information flooded outwards.\n\nCamps formed, largely based on events occurring on social forums and a few stories pushed by mainstream media that many engineers viewed as tangential to the essence of the problem. Perhaps ironically, the response to these ended up resembling quite closely the kinds of scenarios that some had anticipated might result from controversial protocol change proposals.\n\nIt became clear then that despite the issue having arisen due to a technical challenge – namely, how to scale transaction throughput while keeping fees low and the network decentralized – the biggest challenge bitcoin was facing at this time was not technical but political and social.\n\nA campaign attempting to circumvent the technical review process had been unleashed, and the existing technical review process at the time was ill-equipped to handle this kind of scenario.\n\nMoving beyond politics\n\nWith this, 2016 was the year that the term ""hard fork"" entered the popular lexicon – it was the year the world would see the first highly publicized occurrence of a contentious hard fork on a consensus network with significant capitalization.\n\nThis occurred, of course, on the ethereum network after a major project – The DAO – was hacked, which caused the ethereum network to split into two different networks.\n\nFor those who are new to the term, a hard fork is any change to consensus rules in a decentralized consensus network that would cause nodes that adopt the changes to fork off to a separate network from nodes that do not adopt the changes.\n\nIf the changes in question are universally supported by all network participants, then the problem of deployment reduces to one of logistics. These sorts of logistical issues are still quite intricate and carry risks – but they can be tackled via technical means – and it is within the scope of engineering to find workable solutions.\n\nHowever, if the changes are controversial, the problem ceases to be within the realm of engineering and becomes political.\n\nEmphatically, bitcoin and proof-of-work blockchains generally do not offer solutions to the basic political problems that have plagued humanity since prehistoric times. Thousands of years of history have demonstrated that the resolution of political disputes is a very hard problem fraught with social unrest, and at times resulting in war and bloodshed.\n\nWhat bitcoin offers is a form of money that is defined by algorithmic rules, enforced not by some external party but by the natural economic and social incentives of the participants within the system, in a decentralized manner.\n\nParticipation in networks like bitcoin is voluntary.\n\nIn the event of an incompatible ledger change that is controversial, unless the different parties are able to arrive at some resolution, either one party must coerce the others into adhering; or the parties must all go their separate ways.\n\nCoercing people to change their software takes us outside the realm of computer code. Even if a reasonably fair democratic process existed and were to be used (and that\'s a huge if), it significantly degrades the voluntary nature of participation.\n\nAnd if the parties go their separate ways, the network fragments, reducing its utility and destroying people’s confidence in the underlying financial assets.\n\nFor bitcoin to have value, we need a robust, global network that can withstand determined, well-funded attacks. It must retain its security and stability even in times of turmoil.\n\nAs we begin 2017, I encourage people to look to ways we can continue to build upon this technology while avoiding divisive scenarios that could threaten to destabilize or fragment the network.\n\nEarth image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Can BTC/USD overcome the $980 resistance again?\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price dived against the US Dollar before ending the week and closed below $1000.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair is now back trading higher, but facing a major confluence resistance near $960-980 on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX).\n\nThe price is also below the 100 simple moving average on the same chart, which may act as a resistance near $975.\n\nBitcoin price after a major downside move towards $820 against the US Dollar started recovering. Can BTC/USD overcome the $980 resistance again?\n\nBitcoin Price Resistance\n\nWe saw this past week how Bitcoin price made a new all-time high against the US Dollar to trade above the $1150 mark. Later, there was a solid downside move, taking the price lower by more than 20%. The price fell below the $1000 level and traded as low as $823 (data feed from SimpleFX). The price started moving higher once again, and moved above the 23.6% fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1302 high to $823 low.\n\nHowever, the price is now approaching a monster resistance area of $960-980. The same area was a resistance earlier, and may now once again attempt to stop the upside move. Moreover, the 100 simple moving average is also around the same confluence resistance area near $975. Lastly, the 38.2% fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1302 high to $823 low is also waiting to act as a resistance on the upside.\n\nSo, if the BTC buyers have to take control once again, they need to push the price back above the $980 resistance at least. However, a daily close above $1000 is needed for more gains in the near term. Else, there is a chance of a downside reaction one more time.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is back in the bearish zone\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently attempting to break the 50 level towards the upside, which is a positive sign.\n\nMajor Support Level – $900\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $980\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

From his outlook no technology elsewhere will enable another cryptocurrency to get bigger than Bitcoin any time soon.\n\nWhen Cointelegraph asked him why he has that opinion, Vinny attributed it to Metcalf Law. This hypothesis affirms that the importance of a network is equal to the number of connected users in the network. ""Bitcoin has an enormous network effect, similar to Facebook,"" he wrote.\n\nSatoshi’s notion misleading\n\nAccording to him, Satoshi whitepaper definition of Bitcoin as “Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System” misled many people. However, he acknowledges it is a great long-term vision that must develop through phases.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2016 Bitcoin believers have gone through experimental stages of the digital currency grappling with volatility, skepticism, subjugation from authorities to near acceptance. The past eight years saw Vinny Lingham always insisting Bitcoin has not yet matured as a currency:\n\n""I think it’s a commodity that can be traded for goods and services. It may become a currency in time, but it just isn’t one right now. It’s a scarce, digital commodity — and the trading that takes place on exchanges really reflects the market sentiment around the value of this digital commodity.""\n\nVinny added in the blog that ""a commodity is a basic good in an economy which, though it may exist in different grades, A, B, C, etc, is essentially homogenous and easily tradeable. Gold, silver, and other precious metals are good examples of commodities, but then again so are wheat, corn, pork bellies, etc.""\n\nMake Bitcoin boring again\n\nNo doubt stability is essential to the ecosystem and the key to making the first digital asset a store of value. The Civic.com chief admits volatility at this stage of Bitcoin\'s evolution is detrimental to making Bitcoin a store of value:\n\nVinny told Cointelegraph:\n\n""Yes, that\'s the focus of my last post \'Making Bitcoin Boring again”. Pare down the enthusiasm. The current price levels need to consolidate for a while and let\'s hope for slow and steady growth. If it moves up too fast, it will become volatile again.""\n\nBitcoin Bubble\n\nEven though adoption has been encouraging but it is still slow especially in the developing world where Bitcoin has a huge potential to offer Economic Freedom. Vinny revealed that the more people are comfortable to store Bitcoin, the more merchants will accept Bitcoin for payment of goods and services.\n\nThe recent bull run of Bitcoin has also attracted the talk of an imminent bubble. When asked whether we are heading into a bubble if things remain same; This was his prediction:\n\n""I think that if we go above $4,000 this year, we will be in a bubble. it should be slow and steady growth to $3,000. The best we can hope for is that it stays below $2,000 for the next three months at least.""\n\nGold Vs Bitcoin\n\nTwo days ago, before Bitcoin’s gradual decline it surpassed the price of an ounce of Gold to make history as the first currency to do that. Vinny Lingham contemplates that that is not scary since gold is overpriced:', 'Disparate collections of people around the world may find an unlikely common cause in 2017. They include Indians struggling with the effects of demonetization; Chinese currency speculators; Swedish pensioners; and desperate Venezuelans.\n\nThese groups are all enemy combatants in the war on cash being waged by governments around the world. Cash has the advantages of being accessible, inclusive, and largely surveillance-free. It also has a tendency to leak into unexpected places, which makes governments uncomfortable. They say killing off cash plugs the leaks, and besides, it’s technological progress.\n\nBut that means outsourcing the mechanics of money to banks, payments companies, and the growing coterie of fintech firms. And killing cash hurts not only black-marketeers but also ordinary people whose livelihoods depend on its flexibility and simplicity. If simple cashless alternatives, such as Kenya’s M-Pesa mobile money, were more widely available, those people would probably embrace them. But they aren’t.\n\nHence these groups of unlikely allies may also share an interest in an unlikely solution: cryptocurrencies, which enable secure, anonymous payments uncontrolled by any government or bank. Bitcoin, the oldest and most widely used cryptocurrency, has been rising steadily in value (even if it’s not entirely clear why). This week it almost hit an all-time high, only to suddenly crash; but overall its bull run looks way more solid than in past years.\n\nYes, the total value of bitcoins is still miniscule compared to a country’s money supply, and its wild volatility and arcane mechanics have led naysayers to predict its death many times over. But whether they’re Indian smugglers or Swedish pensioners, the people on the sharp end of the war on cash might be starting to find the idea of a stateless cryptocurrency controlled by no-one a little more attractive.\n\nThis was published in the weekend edition of the Quartz Daily Brief, our roundup of the world’s most important news and ideas.

Those who follow this column regularly will notice that the 8-day chart looks different today. I noticed last night that if the bull setup is expanded to begin at the end of the bear market in Jan 2015 and sized to the downturn in July of that year, the last green bar closed EXACTLY at the 5th arc. I wish I had been using this setup all along, but hindsight is 20/20 of course…\n\nIn any case, at the very end of the last column I suggested I was done with the bull trade for now. Like everyone else, I wanted to ride the wave all the way to the top, but the risk of a significant downturn was too great to justify staying long. As it turned out, that was almost the exact high at 1150. Better to be lucky than good, they say.\n\nSo, what’s next?\n\nLong term, this is still the place to be. I will demonstrate that investing in Bitcoin is likely to be a huge win in the next few years. $5,000 per coin by 2020 is likely, in my humble opinion. This chart has a bull setup at the start of the 2013 rally. There is really only 1 way to draw this setup, and it is huge. The 1×1 angle stopped the advance in June, but price closed above the 1×1 in the recent swing high. This is significant. Also, we have a close on the sunny side of the 1st arc. As these words are being typed, price has come back to test suppport at the sweet spot of the intersection of the 1×1 and the 1st arc. My guess is that the support will hold, on a closing basis. Intra-bar, price may break below support briefly.\n\nHaving seen this setup up close, let’s zoom out so we can see where the 5th arc pair is found: This is as small as tradingview.com will allow, and we can’t see the top of the chart. The number is in the $5,000 range…\n\nIn closing, this correction will not likely be over in a matter of hours. It will take days, weeks perhaps. But when it is over, fortunes will be made – hopefully by many people in the audience.\n\nHappy trading!\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgement.

01/08/2017,"['Bitcoin extended Friday’s tumble amid concern China will tighten rules on the digital currency to curb capital outflows.\n\nThe cryptocurrency slid 1.4 percent to $888 at 5:43 p.m. in Hong Kong, after falling as much as 10 percent on Friday. The People’s Bank of China’s Shanghai branch said in a statement late Friday that its officials, along with the city’s financial office, asked bitcoin trading platform BTCChina.com to conduct self-checks and rectify any problems. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange has scrutinized some major bitcoin exchanges, possibly to investigate the use of the digital asset to evade capital controls, QQ.com reported.\n\nBitcoin rallied since early 2015 as Chinese buyers turned to alternative assets to hedge against the weakening yuan and take cash out of the nation. By buying bitcoin onshore and selling it offshore for another currency, investors can evade the tightening scrutiny on fund outflows. Other than a ban on financial institutions’ involvement, Chinese regulators had largely taken a hands-off approach on the cryptocurrency.\n\n“Bitcoin is one of the rocks they haven’t turned yet in terms of controlling the flows,” said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia. “It’s inevitable that there’s going to be something but the question is what the regulations will be when it happens.”\n\nThis is not the first time China’s government has sent bitcoin tumbling. In 2013, it banned financial institutions from handling bitcoin transactions, sparking a slide in price. The PBOC reiterated that stance in Friday’s statement, saying that bitcoin is a virtual commodity without the legal status of a currency. It characterized recent bitcoin moves as “unusual.”\n\nBitcoin has become increasingly volatile since rallying to a record-high $1,162 on Thursday, slumping 11 percent that day after the yuan jumped. In December it surged 28 percent.\n\nFor a Gadfly Take on Bitcoin, Click Here\n\nPolicy makers are likely to require more reporting from bitcoin exchanges and incorporate their flows into the monitoring of the $50,000 quota Chinese citizens are given to convert yuan to foreign exchange -- though it will be more challenging to do so with the decentralized cryptocurrency, said Kapron.\n\nBTCC -- which runs BTCChina.com, one of the most active Chinese exchanges -- said in a statement on its website that it works closely with the PBOC to ensure that it’s operating in accordance with Chinese laws.\n\nHuobi, another major Chinese platform, will also conduct strict self-checks as required by regulators and it plans to work with other bitcoin firms to establish industry standards, chief operating officer Zhu Jiawei said in a message. The industry can benefit from balanced, risk-based regulation, Star Xu, chief executive officer of OkCoin Co., said in an e-mail. The PBOC’s Beijing and Shanghai branches met with representatives of major bitcoin exchanges, including OkCoin, on Friday to discuss their operations, he said.\n\n“The policy risks of bitcoin trading in China are higher” because the nation has capital controls, said Dong Dengxin, director of Finance and Securities Research Institution at Wuhan University of Science and Technology. “If bitcoin trading disturbs China’s financial order, there’s a possibility it will be deemed illegal or banned.”\n\nBitcoin surged 120 percent in 2016 as the yuan dropped the most since 1994 and Chinese bonds and equities declined, though its total value of around $15 billion still pales in comparison with most mainstream asset classes in the nation.\n\nThe digital asset traded at 6,188 yuan ($892) on Chinese firm OKCoin Co.’s platform, around parity to the dollar price based on spot rates. As recently as Friday morning, bitcoin’s yuan price had traded at a premium to its dollar price.\n\n“Until there’s more clarity over what the PBOC is planning or what exactly they mean, I think it will be difficult for bitcoin price to retrace the rally,” said Kapron.', 'Recently, the Chinese government and the People’s Bank of China offered reasonable suggestions to Bitcoin exchanges and users, discouraging fake volumes and offline scam-like promotions while asking users to maintain responsibility for their independent actions.\n\nBut some media outlets, mostly western-based, used the events to spread panic among Chinese investors, leading the price of Bitcoin down to $830.\n\nNo Bitcoin ban\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin quickly recovered, as major Chinese exchanges including BTCC published statements pertaining to the discussion they had with the Chinese central bank. Both exchanges and Chinese local publications reassured investors that the country did not issue a ban on Bitcoin.\n\nCaixin, a leading Beijing-based business and financial publication, stated:\n\n“For example, the two [Bitcoin] trading platforms in Beijing were required to comply with the central bank requirements and were told that the promotion should not mention the depreciation of the yuan-related content and conduct offline promotion.”\n\nBTCC, China’s largest and longest-running Bitcoin exchange, also said in a statement:\n\n“The press release put forth from the PBOC... outlines that there is significant volatility in Bitcoin trading, and also quoted from a notice released in 2013 saying that Bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn’t have legal tender status. All of our users should be aware of the current policies on virtual goods as well as the risks involved in trading in volatile markets.”\n\nAll in all, a statement which Chinese Bitcoin exchanges and the government anticipated to be a simple warning of responsibility to users was completely miscomprehended and then misleadingly distributed to the general public by the media.\n\nSpreading panic and propaganda\n\nThere were some media outlets, such as Zero Hedge, that further pushed the ""China banned Bitcoin” narrative over the past week. While local publications including Caixin accurately informed the Chinese population about the government’s statement, western media outlets published various narratives that can possibly be misunderstood as an imposition of a ban on Bitcoin.', ""Bitcoin price is still under significant downside pressure at the moment, thanks to the Chinese government's warnings to bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is having trouble recovering from its recent tumble, as investors are wary of Chinese government action.\n\nPrice is still trending higher on the longer-term time frames and is safely above the support region on the daily chart.\n\nTechnical indicators are also hinting that the uptrend could resume at some point.\n\nBitcoin price is still under significant downside pressure at the moment, thanks to the Chinese government’s warnings to bitcoin exchanges.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA on the daily time frame of bitcoin price, so the path of least resistance is still to the upside. In addition, the 100 SMA is close to the rising trend line connecting the lows since August last year, adding to its strength as a potential floor.\n\nStochastic is heading south but appears to be making an upward crossover, possibly allowing bullish momentum to return. RSI is moving lower, though, so bitcoin price could follow suit and go for a test of support around $800. A break below this region could mark the start of a downtrend, especially if bitcoin price trades below the 200 SMA around $700.\n\nMarket Events\n\nMuch of the recent slide in bitcoin price can be attributed to fresh action from Chinese authorities who have been seeking to curb offshore investments and revive domestic demand. The PBOC has already intervened in the currency market to punish those who are betting that the yuan would continue to tumble.\n\nMore recently, the Chinese government issued a warning to major bitcoin exchanges, citing their need to comply with relevant laws and regulations. In the statement, the government reiterated that bitcoin is not currency and that there are risks in making this investment. The central bank moved to restrict how exchanges can acquire new customers so investors in the mainland are wary about how this can affect their current holdings, leading some to liquidate their long positions recently.\n\nIn particular, bitcoin exchanges are being forced to comply with AML and KYC requirements so some firms have backed out of marketing activities that focus on the advantages of cryptocurrencies over traditional assets.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Blockchain technology is quickly expanding beyond bitcoin. While many proponents of bitcoin see the blockchain as no more than competition for existing payment methods or gold, I believe blockchain technology is the harbinger of things the world has never before seen.\n\nIn a world with many blockchains and hundreds of tradable tokens built on top of them, entire industries are automated through software, venture capital and stock markets are circumvented, entrepreneurship is streamlined and networks gain sovereignty through their own digital currency. This is the next phase of the internet.\n\nTo date, bitcoin companies have received more than $1 billion in venture funding — the entire industry was built on the shoulders of VCs. Yet Ethereum, a blockchain protocol that allows arbitrarily complex financial transactions to be encoded by anyone and executed in a provably accurate manner by a distributed network, has seen a de minimis amount of VC investment. Rather, open participation crowdsales run through financial contracts built on Ethereum have raised more than $250 million from backers all around the world.\n\nSo why is less VC money flowing into Ethereum? Perhaps it is more risky, and perhaps investments in failed bitcoin companies has lowered interest. Perhaps. But importantly, entrepreneurs now have an alternate route for funding their projects. We are seeing entrepreneurs issuing their own blockchain-based tokens to raise money for their networks, sidestepping the traditional, exclusive world of venture capital altogether. The importance of this cannot be overstated — in this new world there are no companies, just protocols.\n\nUsing this new model, entrepreneurs create blockchain-based tokens that represent ownership in the network they are building, and also act as fuel for their network. For an investor, there are not shares of a company available, only the blockchain-based token. As the blockchain space expands, disproportionate returns will go to holders of the actual tokens, not traditional venture investors betting on a shares of a company. These tokens are application specific — they are not meant to be general-purpose units of value like bitcoin. For example, tokens built on Ethereum like REP and GNT power a decentralized prediction market and a peer-to-peer market for renting computation, respectively.\n\nImagine being able to actually make money when you contribute on social media.\n\nThese application-specific tokens, or app-tokens, are built on top of existing general-purpose blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the first time, open-source project creators can directly monetize their open-source network. Historically, successful open-source projects like the torrent protocol or the Tor network were not directly monetized at the protocol level. Now, the founder of a decentralized file storage network can issue blockchain-based tokens that represent ownership in the network.\n\nHowever, these tokens are not like stock certificates, which represent ownership but have no real use. App-tokens are actually used in the network to participate. In the file-storage market example, they are used to prove file ownership and buy and sell storage space. The founder of the network keeps roughly 10 percent of the tokens for themselves and their founding team, and if their network becomes popular, the demand for tokens rises, and because the supply of the token is fixed, the price increases. This means that founders can monetize their networks directly by simply holding their tokens and making the network useful. If they need liquidity to continue funding the project, they can simply sell the tokens on the open market.\n\nIn addition to rewarding founders, these app-tokens allow participants in networks to actually own a piece of the network. This network equity ownership is unprecedented. Consider how many networks the modern western internet user is a part of — Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, eBay, Etsy, Tumblr — the list goes on. In each of these cases, the network’s value is created by the users, but the value each individual user generates goes to the owners of the network. In this new blockchain-based model, that value is actually given back to the users of the network, proportional to their contribution.\n\nWhat this means is that what ultimately disrupts many of the major web services created in the last decade could be peer-to-peer protocols, not companies. This would be similar to the effect that the torrent protocol had on media companies, but on a much larger scale. The result would be twitter the protocol without Twitter the company, facebook without Facebook, uber without Uber.\n\nAnd as an investor, for the first time, it is possible to buy a portion of these networks, which will power the future infrastructure of the internet. Investing directly in TCP/IP (packets), SMTP (email), HTTPS (encryption) or another low-level internet protocol in the early 1990s would be extremely valuable today.\n\nIf this sounds complicated, it’s because it is. To be sure, the blockchain space is still mostly in a phase of experimentation, but the first breakout apps will be explosive because they financially incentivize users to participate in the network. Imagine being able to actually make money when you contribute on social media.\n\nBitcoin’s market share has slowly dropped over the last several years, and while I believe that bitcoin will continue to grow, rapid growth in other parts of the blockchain ecosystem is imminent.\n\nThe entire market capitalization of blockchain-based assets is $13 billion today, a rounding error when compared to the current value of the systems which blockchain technology could potentially unseat. When decentralized blockchain protocols start displacing the centralized web services that dominate the current internet, we’ll start to see real internet-based sovereignty. The future internet will be decentralized.', 'Remember when we talked about Ujo Music a few weeks back? Or maybe earlier last year when Imogen Heap filled us in on Mycelia? Well, let\'s apply these services and get some feedback from an audience that could benefit from it. Our guest is a proud University of Texas graduate, a proud creative leader in the city of Austin, and obviously, a proud hip-hop artist who is striving to break into the industry. Chris\' demeanor is passive yet perceptive, and when he speaks, he sounds like he does performing: as if you are a microphone to woo.\n\nIn 2015, Chris Omenihu founded Human Influence in order to create a platform on which to speak, sing and spread his message about cultural inclusivity. Since its inception, this ""taste-making, creative community"" has evolved to be a culmination of Chris\'s interests, shaped by his experiences in Austin. So if anyone can appreciate what we do, and take time out to listen to new technologies, it is him.\n\nIn addition, we are joined on this episode with our Merch director Dillon!\n\nThis one’s for the all the young, up and coming, solo artist, out there looking to make a living producing content, without giving up 20%… if not more! We’re talking about Ujo, Mycelia and music on the blockchain, with an actual artist.\n\nStraight outta Cedar Hill, Austin, Texas! Christopher [Oh-Many-Who] Omenihu takes the stage to talk firsthand about the music industry and how hard it is making a living as a solo artist.\n\nChristopher Omenihu is the owner and operator of Human Influence as well as a TTU graduate and a starving artist, which makes him a prime candidate for using the content platforms that have also taken stage here on The Bitcoin Podcast, like Ujo and Mycelia. Chris is a very smart, tech savvy MC, who’s just looking for a way to make a meal doing what he enjoys, making music. Since being so tech savvy and a small business owner as well as a content creator it basically goes without saying how obvious it would be for him to own and market his own content. Luckily for him, we’re here to help!\n\n“Hip-Hop inherently isn’t something that rappers own.” - Christopher Omenihu\n\nChris passionately speaks about just how hard it is for a starving artist to survive in a market that’s dealing with a massive money allocation problem. Corey explains the benefits of using blockchain platforms to protect and market his content, for little to no fee, peanuts. Cello reminds Chris how he doesn’t want to end up like other artist who went platinum, just to take to the internet for hand outs to make rent. We are also accompanied by our wheeling and dealing Chief Merchandise Hustler Dillon, so look forward to shameless plugs and advertizing of our fly hats.\n\nBuy our stuff and junk. We accept bitcoin…\n\n“We are selling happiness.” - Christopher Omenihu\n\nIt’s stories like Chris’ that remind us all why we got into bitcoin and blockchain technology. We’re all seeking a form of freedom. Whether that freedom be financial or intellectual, bitcoin’s blockchain is a new tool solving old problems.\n\nChris Omenihu is a guru entrepreneur destined for greatness and we were luck enough to have him on the show before he blows up. Hopefully we helped him find what he was looking for, financial empowerment if the form of intellectual freedom. It’s the people who adopt bitcoin and its blockchain technology that give bitcoin value. Bitcoin only has value if it provides a use, fill a need, so to speak. There are many needs bitcoin could fill, the problem is those inside the box can’t see life any other way. Our passion for bitcoin technology encourages us to educate and liberate those in situations like Chris’, where the established corporations have manipulated the market.\n\nIf you find blockchain technology empowering and yourself enthusiastic about what bitcoin can do for the modern world, this is the episode for you. If you have an entertainer entrepreneur family member or friend, do them a solid and send them a link to this interview. Companies like Ujo and Mycelia are putting the power back in the hands of the creators and we’re just trying to help bridge the gap between the creators and these platforms.\n\nYou can reach Chris via Twitter and support him via his company website http://www.influencehumans.com/.\n\nCan you explain bitcoin in ten words or less?', 'Bitcoin has been making news since the Christmas period. The price started rallying upwards to reach a high of US$1,129.87 on 4 January. Two days later, it fell by 20%.\n\nNobody knows the reason for the recent plummet. It could be due to the strengthening of the Chinese yen, or that investors wanted to reap the benefits of the rally.\n\nThe graph shows the recent drop:\n\nSource: Australian Financial Review\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Bitcoin, it’s both a payment system and a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is a currency that exists only online — just like most currencies in the world now.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto released it in 2008 as an open source program — transparent software that anybody can change — in response to the bank collapse that year. Nakamoto is a pseudonym; nobody knows the true identity of the creator or creators.\n\nThere are a couple of thing that make Bitcoin different.\n\nThe first is that it’s a peer to peer system. That is, there is no centralised authority controlling the currency or the network. Bitcoin achieves this through blockchain technology. The blockchain is basically a shared public ledger, a database that every member of the network can see and contribute to.\n\nThe second is that, like gold, it is scarce. Bitcoin’s algorithm mimics the way gold is mined. There is only a limited amount of bitcoin available, and the supply is not expected to exceed 21 million.\n\nLet’s take a look at Bitcoin’s price chart again, but this time, from its humble beginnings.\n\nSource: coinbase\n\nBitcoin’s price has plummeted 20% in the last few days. Yet according to The Australian Financial Review, it was the best performing currency in the world for 2016. For the second year in a row.\n\nBitcoin has had an impressive rise since it started four years ago with a value price of 0. It is purely digital. Nobody knows who has created it, and it is not backed by a centralised system. Yet it has outperformed every single currency in the world.\n\nSince its beginning, Bitcoin has died 119 times, and counting. Yes, there is a website that keeps track of how many times someone has declared Bitcoin dead.\n\nYet Bitcoin is very much alive. And its price keeps rising.\n\nThe thing is, Bitcoin has gained popularity because it is used as a hedge against negative interest rates in developed countries, and a hedge against devaluating currencies in developing countries. It is gaining popularity in countries with high inflation like Venezuela, where the government has not published the inflation rate since 2015. Also in India, where demonetisation has taken a toll.\n\nThe big thing about bitcoin is that it has been able to replicate the way cash works. You see, Bitcoin has anonymity and does not need an intermediary.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, Bitcoin is in no way a safe investment. It is a gamble. It has high volatility, as recent events have shown. It is an unprecedented social experiment, which will keep working while there is confidence in its system.\n\nYet it’s also an investment that is surprising everyone, and challenging the current financial system.\n\nCheers,\n\nSelva Freigedo,\n\nContributing Editor, Money Morning\n\nFrom the Port Phillip Publishing Library\n\nSpecial Report: The Lazarus Project, your best chance to double every dollar you invest this year.

The currency continues to lose ground against Bitcoin, and fiat currency markets continue to show less of a demand for XMR as well. Despite these negative trends, the USD value per XMR is clawing its way back up again.\n\nA Mixed Bag of Trends For Monero\n\nCryptocurrency markets are notorious for their volatility, and it appears Monero sees its fair share of unpredictability as of late. With both the USD and BTC volume on the decline, one would expect the price to plummet, but that is not necessarily the case. Or to be more precise, the value in US Dollar value is not declining, but the currency is losing ground in the Bitcoin market.\n\nThe dwindling XMR value against Bitcoin is rather surprising, considering the XMR/BTC trade volume has been on the rise over the past two days. With the Bitcoin market, representing 94.4% of all trades once again, it remains the primary indicator of how one should perceive the value of Monero.\n\nAs of right now, one XMR is trading at a value of 0.01475 Bitcoin, which is down from its 0.0167 point over 24 hours ago. Such a sharp retrace is not unusual for the altcoin market and can be explained by looking at Bitcoin’s recent price gains. After all, Bitcoin has been regaining some of its lost value over the past 36 hours, which always impacts the altcoin prices\n\nIn the USD Market, things are faring slightly better for Monero. Its market cap has risen to US$187. 84m once again, and each MR is currently valued at US$13.70. That is a 4.42% increase over the past 24 hours, which is a positive development for Monero. It is expected the price will remain somewhat flat over the coming days, though, albeit a climb to US$14 is not impossible to achieve.\n\nPoloniex remains the dominant Monero market, both for Bitcoin and US Dollar trading volumes. Kraken remains in the last spot, even though it has a higher fiat currency value per XMR compared to other exchanges. Things are looking quite positive for this altcoin, as it is one of the few currencies able to maintain a somewhat stable value in recent weeks.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'A newly released study on the relationship between bitcoin and global uncertainty finds that bitcoin acts positively to uncertainty. Analyzing a lengthy period from the 17th of March, 2011, to the 7th of October, 2016 by using the VIX index, a widely used key market risk indicator that reflects market sentiment and investor expectation of 14 countries, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US, the study concludes:\n\n“Bitcoin is shown to serve as a hedge against uncertainty at the extreme ends of the Bitcoin market and global uncertainty, but at shorter investment horizons. Therefore, short-horizon investment in Bitcoin can help investors hedge global equity market uncertainty, especially when the market is functioning in bear and bull regimes and also when uncertainty is either low or high.”\n\nBy using a quantile regression framework as well as a well-known method of wavelets to decompose Bitcoin returns into its various investment horizons, the study was able to provide a more nuanced view in analyzing the effect of different levels of uncertainty as well as different time frames. The study [PDF] finds that:\n\n“[T]he ability of Bitcoin to act as a hedge against uncertainty is conditional on not only whether the market is in bear or bull regime but also whether global uncertainty is high or low. Specifically speaking, at shorter investment horizons, Bitcoin returns seem to hedge against the global uncertainty at extreme ends of both Bitcoin returns and uncertainty.”\n\nBitcoin’s role as a hedge against uncertainty has widely been speculated recently, especially following the digital currency’s surpassing of gold parity in its most popular and liquid exchanges. Its accelerated bull run since summer coincided with a number of monetary miscalculations by authorities in as diverse countries as China, India, Brazil, Venezuela, Nigeria and others, leading to an increased interest in bitcoin according to internet searches, sending the price higher and higher.\n\nThe study’s confirmation of this role may increase serious interest in bitcoin as an asset class sui generis which acts as a hedge when uncertainty is both very high and very low, potentially leading to its inclusion in more established trading houses to minimize risks while trying to maximize gains.\n\nIt’s increased market cap to surpass that of Twitter may further aid towards such aim, with the currency significantly maturing since its amateurish early days in 2011 and even 2013, leading to a marked decrease in volatility by comparison, and thus a decrease in risk, so far in any event.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'India has been in the news quite often these days after the government decided overnight to demonetize existing high-denomination banknotes. The move, widely publicized as a step towards combating the country’s black economy was successful in causing widespread distress amid a shortage of valid currency.\n\nThe loss of confidence in the Indian Rupee among a significant portion of the population drove them towards Bitcoin as a store of value. The increased demand for Bitcoin in the country drove the price by upwards of $200 in comparison to global markets. However, thanks to the coverage by cryptocurrency news outlets, the mainstream media houses in the country decided to offer their own versions of the story, but with a twist. They labeled Bitcoin as a safe haven for people to dodge the demonetization move.\n\nSince then, various media outlets have been spinning half-baked stories about how Bitcoin is being used in India to launder money, avoid taxes and so on. None of the outlets seem to have paused to find out the ground reality of Bitcoin adoption in the country.\n\nIn the current Bitcoin ecosystem, it is virtually impossible for anyone to convert their old, worthless banknotes to Bitcoin for safe keeping. For starters, those who want to buy Bitcoin in India have to do so on any one of the “Big Four” exchange platforms. All these platforms have strict KYC frameworks in place, similar to the ones followed by mainstream banks. Also, in order to buy Bitcoin, the user will have to first deposit the funds into his/her account on these exchanges through internet banking channel.\n\nEven if somebody did decide to find a way to deposit cash, they were required to provide their KYC and PAN credentials to the banks. Anyone with half a brain will think twice before doing that (if their intention is to keep the funds untraceable). Given the shortage of currency and the crowded banks, they would have had a limited window to attempt a futile exercise. Even if someone did manage to purchase Bitcoin with worthless pieces of paper, there are limited ways one can spend it in the country due to poor adoption among merchants. This leaves Bitcoin holders with only one option — to sell and withdraw INR into their Indian bank accounts which is accountable for taxes. Instead of going through all the trouble, they could have rather deposited money directly to their bank accounts when they still had a chance.\n\nThe government, through this exercise and constantly changing rules, has conveniently branded everyone as a potential tax evader and a criminal unless they prove otherwise. It has gone so far to even make it illegal (a punishable offense) for people to have old currency notes in possession. Fueled by mainstream media coverage of Bitcoin, it won’t be a surprise if someone in the position of power who has no clue about Bitcoin decides to implement cryptocurrency regulations overnight.\n\nRef: Business Today | DeepDotWeb | Image: NewsBTC Disclaimer: The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of NewsBTC']"
01/09/2017,"['A recent bull run for bitcoin has turned dramatically, with the price of the digital currency registering double-digit percentage drops on several days already in 2017.\n\nThe comedown traces back to recent comments from the People’s Bank of China, which met with representatives of major bitcoin exchanges in China prior to issuing a pair of notices. The notices set off a swirl of fresh rumors that Beijing is planning further regulatory action regarding mainland bitcoin exchanges, which account for the majority of global bitcoin trading volume.\n\nWhat happened, exactly?\n\nOn Jan. 5, the People’s Bank issued two notices, one from its Beijing headquarters (link in Mandarin), and another from its Shanghai branch (Mandarin). In essence, the notices said the same thing: that bitcoin is a commodity, not a currency, and organizations and individuals trading are responsible for the risks associated with the investment.\n\nThe bank said it called meetings with the exchanges because of bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations, and urged “self-examination” on the part of the exchanges to ensure everything was onside with regulations, and that risk was being managed. The bank issued a similar statement in 2013, when bitcoin’s price spiked dramatically and Chinese investors first began to take notice of the currency.\n\nLater that day it emerged that China’s foreign exchange regulator, SAFE, was looking at whether bitcoin was being used to avoid the country’s capital controls. Evasion of capital controls has long been cited as a major reason for bitcoin’s popularity on the mainland. The detail was first reported by Tencent Finance, citing an anonymous source close to the regulator.\n\nMore information from the central bank’s meeting with regulators was published in a report from financial news service Caixin. It said the government wanted to bar exchanges from mentioning the yuan’s depreciation in marketing bitcoin as an asset class.\n\nSo what’s the upshot for bitcoin exchanges in China?\n\nBeijing is now reportedly looking at making exchanges use escrow services, according to a report from the China Securities Journal (link in Mandarin). The article, based on an anonymous source, says the central bank will convene experts to discuss how to manage bitcoin services, or to set up an escrow platform for the exchanges. Plans for some sort of regulated escrow service would represent a significant increase in government oversight for Chinese exchanges.\n\n(Update: OKCoin CEO Star Xu told us he was the source of the discussion of an escrow service during the Jan. 6 meeting with the central bank. He brought up the idea of bitcoin exchanges using a “third-party custodian-like platform” to enhance customer protection, similar to those used by stock brokerages, for instance. Xu says this was “simply an idea” suggested for further discussion.)\n\nHowever, exchange operators are painting the central bank’s engagement as a routine matter. “BTCC regularly meets with the People’s Bank of China and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China,” said Samson Mow, BTCC’s chief operating officer.\n\nIt’s worth noting that although bitcoin is significantly down on news of Beijing’s intervention, it’s still up more than double compared to a year earlier.\n\nIncreased engagement from Beijing with bitcoin exchanges is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it legitimizes the cryptocurrency as an asset class worth regulating. On the other hand, it increases the compliance burden for these startup exchanges. What is clear from this latest episode is that bitcoin’s price, at least in the short term, is at the mercy of officials in Beijing.\n\nThis story was updated with details of discussion around a proposed custodian platform.\n\nRead this next: Bitcoin’s bull run faces one gigantic question mark heading into 2017', 'The former operator of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Coin.mx has pleaded guilty in federal court.\n\nThe move comes after Anthony Murgio had previously plead not guilty to money transmitting charges, first filed last year.

The currency has now fallen to $887 as at last Friday, with China tightening rules to curb capital outflows.\n\nPrior to the freeze of MMM, participants were allowed to provide help in bitcoin, but they were paid back in naira.\n\nHowever, MMM new plan allows participants to receive payment in bitcoin, and watch their monies grow in bitcoin.\n\nIn a statement to participants, MMM said “due to the recent sharp price fluctuations of Bitcoin, MAVRO-BTC is being introduced in the system.\n\n“So far, we have only had Mavro-Naira in the system. Even though you provided help via Bitcoin, your Bitcoins, anyway, were recalculated into the Naira at the exchange rate at the moment of providing help, and you were credited with Mavro-Naira in your PO.\n\n“It was the naira amount that grew. In other words, you received 30 percent a month specifically in naira (not in Bitcoins, although you originally provided help using Bitcoins).\n\n“Now, you have a chance to have 30 percent growth of the Bitcoin amount, not the naira amount. So, acquire MAVRO-BTC which will be credited in your PO and will grow at a 30 percent monthly growth rate.\n\n“In a month not only 30 percent will be added to your initial amount, but, it can increase itself due to Bitcoin price growth.\n\n“And, what if Bitcoin price is going to fall? In case Bitcoin price might go down, you will be able to return to naira at any time — instantly convert your MAVRO-BTC into Mavro-Naira (and vice versa, if Bitcoin price might increase again).\n\n“This option is available in PO. You can convert both confirmed and unconfirmed Mavro.\n\n“We hope that with implementing MAVRO-BTC, your participation in MMM will become more comfortable!”', 'Indonesian authorities say they have evidence that Islamic State (IS) militants are using online money services such as PayPal and bitcoin to send money to domestic operatives.\n\nOfficials with Pusat Pelaporan dan Analisis Transaksi Keuangan (PPATK), an independent agency established in 2002 that enforces the country\'s anti-money laundering (AML) laws, gave the remarks at a public hearing today centered on the agency\'s performance in 2016.\n\nThere, Ivan Yustiavandana, director for examination and research at PPATK, said he believes the use of bitcoin is linked to the preference these groups have shown for technologically sophisticated payment methods.\n\nAs quoted by Singapore-based newspaper, The Straits Times, he said:\n\n""Today we are talking about PayPal, bitcoins. Two to three years from now, we may talk about other means, new ways. The more sophisticated we are at getting them, the more they will try to look for new ways.""\n\nPPATK chairman Kiagus Ahmad Badaruddin added that the agency believes terrorists are using the tools because it makes it ""harder"" for authorities to track the transaction.\n\nNotably, the agency also reported that IS operative Bahrun Naim had been using these means of sending money to IS colleagues. Naim is the man the authorities believe is behind recent attacks in Jakarta in which two civilians were killed and 24 were wounded, according to figures from CNN.\n\nAt press time, the statements have also been given additional attention via reporting by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTerror links\n\nWhile no data was provided by the agency, the statements are likely to continue the narrative that bitcoin and other blockchain-based digital currencies are becoming an attractive tool for terrorist funding.\n\nFollowing the November 2015 Paris attacks, for example, the European Union sought to take measures that would enhance the supervision of exchange startups that enable bitcoin to be traded for government-issued money.\n\nHowever, there is evidence that such claims may be overblown.\n\nThe US Treasury Department noted in a risk assessment in 2015 that while the technology may be vulnerable to abuse, it remains unclear how widespread this illicit use of bitcoin has become.\n\nAdding to the perceived prominence of the digital currency, is that bitcoin has emerged as a way for the media to bring added attention to government actions against a broad selection of payment tools given its strong online community and following.\n\nTerrorism image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Wyre CEO Michael Dunworth has stated that he believes Bitcoin “will replace gold” and the USD as the global reserve currency within 20 years.\n\nThe chief of the Silicon Valley transfer provider made the comments as part of an interview with InvestorDaily.\n\nAmong other surprises, Dunworth said that Bitcoin had “superior value” to gold and lacked only market penetration at the current time.\n\nBetter store of value\n\n“[Bitcoin] will replace gold, and internationally it will replace the USD as the global reserve currency – 20 years or so from now that is,” he told the publication.\n\n“Bitcoin has a superior value to gold in its store of value and usability. However, it has received nowhere near the same penetration.”\n\nDunfield is just the latest cryptocurrency industry figure to champion Bitcoin’s inherent use case as a store of value rather than a currency.\n\nAmid last week’s price surge, fellow entrepreneur Vinny Lingham stated that Bitcoin as a currency was in the final stage of a long process, one that is not the most important in 2017.\n\nHe tweeted that its major importance is first as a commodity and subsequently as a store of value.\n\nPhase 1 of Bitcoin (2008-2016) = Creating a Digital Commodity. Phase 2 = Proving it as a Store of Value. Phase 3 = Adopting it as a Currency — Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) January 4, 2017\n\nDespite bouncing down below $1000, Lingham said that price fluctuations did not necessarily represent a bubble and therefore instability as an asset.\n\n“I think that if we go above $4,000 this year, we will be in a bubble. It should be slow and steady growth to $3,000. The best we can hope for is that it stays below $2,000 for the next three months at least,"" he commented last week.\n\nBuying shares in ‘Internet of money’\n\nDunfield, meanwhile, admitted that short-term volatility of any kind acts as a deterrent to some more wary investors. Nonetheless, the classic comparison between Bitcoin and the early Internet is still valid in his eyes:', 'In 2014, the University of Cumbria announced that it was accepting the digital currency, bitcoin, from its students as a form of payment, enabling students to pay for two degrees on complementary currencies through alternative means.\n\nAt the time, the cost of one bitcoin was around $960 and at the start of 2017 the price of one unit of the cryptocurrency had surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time in three years.\n\nAccording to professor Jem Bendell, founder of the Institute for Leadership and Sustainability (IFLAS) at the University of Cumbria, the reason the price of bitcoin has been increasing is because hedge funds are utilizing the cryptocurrency to expand their assets and as a way of sending money abroad cheaply.\n\nSpeaking to the News and Star, he said:\n\nThe main lesson of this price is wider than bitcoin. It shows that private currencies are here to stay.\n\nBitcoin Accepted Here\n\nSince bitcoin first entered the scene it has steadily risen in popularity for several uses cases such as money transfers, banking, and food and drink.\n\nBeing used as an alternative form of payment for university fees is another area that the currency is gaining traction in.\n\nIn 2014, the University of Nicosia became the world’s first by offering a Master of Science (MSc) in Digital Currency.\n\nIn Australia, Flinders University became the first educational establishment in the country to accept the cryptocurrency from its students in a pilot project.\n\nOver the last two years, more educational institutions have also jumped on board by allowing students who hold bitcoin to pay for their courses.\n\nLate last year, ESMT Berlin, a state-accredited German private business university, became the first to accept the digital currency as a form of payment for everything including tuition. As a currency that enables fast money transfers worldwide, the school hailed the currency as ‘the most well-developed blockchain application.’\n\nAlso last year, CEVRO, a Czech institute based in Prague announced that it was accepting bitcoin as payment for tuition fees for three of its Masters programs in philosophy, politics and economics. Such a move demonstrates the impact and progress that the currency is continuing to make as more universities accept it.\n\nBitcoin Here to Stay\n\nEight years ago bitcoin made its debut to the world. Since then there have been many ups and downs with the digital currency, but one thing is obvious: it’s still here.\n\nAs the benefits of the currency become obvious, Bendell seems to be correct in saying that private currencies are here to stay.\n\nImages from Facebook/University of Cumbria and IFLAS.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Despite unprecedented intervention by Chinese authorities last Thursday by, according to speculation, ordering its banks to limit liquidity of CNY in offshore markets, sending the borrowing rate for shorting higher than 100%, causing the biggest one-day move in years and crashing bitcoin’s rally, the market appears to be unimpressed.\n\nAs expected, Yuan’s value kept falling today, deprecating by 0.25% against the dollar, with the currency seemingly continuing to eye the significant psychological threshold of 7 CNY.\n\nInterestingly, bitcoin has failed to respond, indicating the mood has somewhat dampened following China’s direct intervention in the bitcoin space by ordering Chinese based exchanges to refrain from any “offline promotions,” and not engage in any “fake trading,” as well as to enact “mandatory strong KYC,” and to not mention devaluation.\n\nNonetheless, after bitcoin’s incredible rise to surpass gold parity and the crash that followed, price remains relatively stable at around $900, suggesting a cooling off period while the market gains better information on the value of the currency.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is suddenly rising, coinciding with China’s direct intervention in bitcoin. The barely two years old digital currency began a mini run on the 7th of January, further seemingly responding to today’s Yuan continued fall in value.\n\nEthereum is trading at a slightly higher price in China by about $0.10, leading some to speculate that the Chinese and their government continues the whack-a-mole game with capital controls loops opened and closed as central authorities try and steer the market.\n\nBut, there are news specific to Ethereum which may explain the recent moves. What can be called the most advanced blockchain platform as it extends the technology’s capabilities to that of smart contracts turning digital money into fully programmable money is working towards a more mature environment by providing to household names and other companies enterprise ethereum.\n\nThe Ethereum Chessboard\n\nThe digital currency has two main competitors, Hyperledger and R3, with bitcoin being a category of its own as it does not have smart contracts, thus considered by most ethers as complementary due to having a different focus.\n\nIt may be too early to say, but Eth’s public blockchain, which incentivizes the exploitation of any bugs by providing handsome bounties to the smartest people across the globe, thus through trial and error reaching a stage of bullet proof security, combined with the fact that Eth is actually ready to go, may have given the platform an edge over the other two.\n\nThat is because last year ethereum seemingly became the platform of choice for private blockchains with most based on a forked and adopted version of the public blockchain rather than on Hyperledger, which has seemingly reached out to Ethereum, or Corda.\n\nIf that is indeed the case, all talent and resources can be focused on one platform with many mutations as required for specific needs rather than a dispersion of resources towards different base protocols. Capitalizing on this, enterprise ethereum may consolidate its position, focusing attention and driving the entire space, whether public or private, forward.\n\nWhether it can indeed do so remains to be seen, just as it is unclear whether the news of enterprise ethereum are sufficient to explain the recent rise or whether, instead, eth too is now responding to global markets. What seems clear, however, is that 2017 is stacking up to be the most interesting and exciting year so far for the blockchain space in particular and the wider world more generally.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price has been trading sideways recently but made an upside break from a short-term triangle pattern, signaling that buyers are putting up a fight.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has been under a lot of downside pressure lately, thanks to warnings from the Chinese government on bitcoin exchanges and traders.\n\nPrice has consolidated after its sharp drop at the beginning of the month as investors are now waiting for more clues.\n\nBitcoin formed a small symmetrical triangle visible on short-term time frames and has broken to the upside.\n\nBitcoin price has been trading sideways recently but made an upside break from a short-term triangle pattern, signaling that buyers are putting up a fight.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA on this time frame so there may be some selling pressure left. Stochastic is also hovering at the overbought zone and hasn’t turned lower so buyers might need to take a break and let sellers take over. Meanwhile, RSI is treading sideways and barely offering any strong directional clues.\n\nStill, the breakout from the triangle consolidation pattern could be indicative of a return in bullish momentum, likely taking bitcoin price up to the next area of interest at $940-950. Stronger buying pressure could lead to a climb back to the $1000 psychological mark.\n\nOn the other hand, if another wave of selling takes place, price could revisit support at $880 or head lower, depending on how market catalysts turn out.\n\nMarket Events\n\nEarlier in the week, investors have turned their attention to China’s warnings against bitcoin trading, with monetary authorities reiterating the need for KYC and AML checks for cryptocurrency trades. This comes after the central bank intervened in the forex market to halt the yuan slide, hurting bearish speculators.\n\nAt the moment, traders are wary of similar moves in the bitcoin market, although experts have repeatedly emphasized that this would be nearly impossible to implement. Once these concerns fade, bitcoin price could regain ground as traders try to catch the longer-term rallies at cheaper levels.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The decentralized nature of the technology also makes it harder for attackers, or hackers, to take control of the network.\n\nThe D.T.C.C. project will not use Bitcoin’s blockchain. Instead it is building something similar to a blockchain, known as a distributed ledger, which multiple financial institutions can update and view at the same time.

Credit default swaps, which played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis, are essentially bets on the success of bonds.\n\nThe D.T.C.C. oversaw about $11 trillion in credit default swaps trading last year, or 80 percent of all trades in the global market.

This has gone to the highest levels, with some central banks talking about moving their own national currencies onto some sort of blockchain.\n\nBut while there have been endless announcements about tests and proofs of concept, almost no one has disclosed plans to actually use a blockchain or distributed ledger in the real world.\n\nUntil now, the most discussed announcement came from the Australian stock exchange, which said in early 2016 that it had hired an American software company, Digital Asset Holdings, to build a distributed ledger for its back-end systems. The Australian exchange, though, has said it has not made a final decision on whether it will move to the new technology.\n\nThe D.T.C.C. has been talking publicly about its interest in the blockchain for a while, and last year it announced that it had successfully completed a test of a distributed ledger database in its credit default swaps trading business. Mr. Bodson said that since then the D.T.C.C. had determined that a distributed ledger would be cheaper to run than its existing system.\n\nThe D.T.C.C. tests were done using a distributed ledger technology created by a start-up, Axoni, that will also be involved in the project, along with R3, a consulting firm working with dozens of banks on blockchain projects, and IBM.\n\n“The fact that they are taking this as seriously as they are is indicative of the broad-felt sense in the financial community that this technology is here to stay,” Charley Cooper, a managing director of R3, said of the D.T.C.C.""]"
01/10/2017,"['Gabriel Wildau in Shanghai JANUARY 10, 2017 0 Chinese regulators have taken steps to ensure bitcoin is not used to facilitate capital flight, even as investors in the cryptocurrency say they doubt it is being used to transfer large amounts of cash out of China. The apparent correlation between a depreciating renminbi and bitcoin’s price surge in recent months has prompted suspicion that the virtual asset is contributing to outflows. Bitcoin’s Chinese price rose 145 per cent in 2016, as the renminbi suffered its worst year on record, weakening 6.5 per cent. Renminbi transactions accounted for 98 per cent of global bitcoin trading volume over the past six months, according to data from bitcoinity.org.  The People’s Bank of China met with the country’s three largest bitcoin exchanges last week to remind them to “strictly” follow relevant regulations on risk control and to “clean up” any irregular practices, according to announcements by the central bank’s Beijing and Shanghai branches. Bitcoin has fallen 9 per cent since the PBoC announcements.  China’s central bank triggered a market rout in 2013 when it decreed that bitcoin was not a real currency and forbade banks from handling bitcoin transactions. But Chinese exchange operators have downplayed the most recent meetings, saying they don’t signal a renewed crackdown.  “We’ve been meeting with them regularly over the last two to three years. The only difference is that they talked about it this time,” Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTC China, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume over the past month, told the Financial Times. “I think their intent is to remind the world, ‘The PBoC is on top of this. Don’t let the price go crazy’. That’s their prerogative.”  In meetings with Huobi.com and OKCoin, the PBoC instructed the two exchanges not to mention renminbi depreciation in its marketing materials, according to Caixin, a respected business news website. Caixin also reported that the State Administration of Foreign Exchange had “surveyed” Chinese bitcoin exchanges about their business models in recent days, citing multiple industry sources. Huobi and OKCoin declined to comment.  Yet seasoned bitcoin investors say that existing regulations make the virtual currency impractical for facilitating large-scale fund transfers. Chinese bitcoin platforms require investors to link a domestic bank card to their accounts, which means transactions are not anonymous.  ""If you want to do a few hundred thousand renminbi, it’s no problem. But there’s a limit on volumes. All the Chinese domestic websites are regulated. If the amount is too large, it will attract attention,” said Yi Lihua, founder of Unishares, a Shanghai-based venture capital fund that invests in blockchain-related companies.  Experts also point to pricing patterns as evidence that capital flight is not driving the market. If bitcoin were widely used for capital flight, they say, the price gap between renminbi and foreign-currency exchanges would widen as Chinese investors bought bitcoins on local exchanges and cashed them out on foreign exchanges. But while bitcoin’s price on dollar-based exchanges is consistently lower than its renminbi price, this gap has not noticeably increased over the past year, even as Chinese capital outflows have accelerated. Live event: Year of the Rooster Join FT commentators in London on January 24 to discuss the key risks and opportunities facing China in 2017. Moreover, prices on several other non-USD exchanges are actually higher than the renminbi price.  ""If cash were really leaving China for western markets via crypto en masse, I would have a lot better spreads buying bitcoin in Canada, that’s for sure,” said David Lancashire, founder of Popup Chinese, a Beijing-based online language learning community. Mr Lancashire receives bitcoin payments from foreign customers as a cheaper and more secure alternative to PayPal.  Liquidity presents another challenge to large-scale fund transfers. The total supply of bitcoin in the world is only about $15bn, less than the valuation-adjusted $26bn decline in China’s foreign exchange reserves in December alone. Experts say that on non-Chinese exchanges, where volumes are low, any attempt to cash out a large sum would push up the price significantly. “If you moved a Beijing-apartment-sized chunk of change to Australia, it would be hard to sell without taking the market. But if you do it slowly, then you are really exposed to price changes,” said an Australian bitcoin investor living in Beijing.  Additional reporting by Ma Nan Twitter: @gabewildau', 'UPDATE, 6/27/17: Anthony Murgio was sentenced to 66 months (over five years) in prison.\n\nIn Bitcoin’s short and distinguished history of multimillion dollar frauds, Anthony Murgio’s illegal Coin.mx Bitcoin exchange stands as one of the most ambitious and catastrophic schemes to ever come crashing down in a Manhattan court room.\n\nOn Monday, Murgio became the third individual associated with Coin.mx to plead guilty to charges including bribery, fraud, money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and identity theft. He agreed not to appeal a sentence of 12 and a half years or less. In Coin.mx’s two year history, Murgio processed over $10 million in illegal Bitcoin transactions that he attempted to hide completely through a front company called “Collectables Club” which pretended to financial institutions to be a memorabilia company.\n\nAnother front company was called “Currency Enthusiasts.”\n\nWhile three have pled guilty, the investigation into Coin.mx led to the arrest of nine including the alleged mastermind behind hacks against a dozen of the United States’ biggest financial institutions including JP Morgan Chase, E*Trade and Scottrade. The Justice Department called the 2014 JPMorgan Chase breach, which impacted personal data in 83 million accounts, the “largest theft of customer data from a U.S. financial institution in history.”\n\nOverall, prosecutors say over 100 million people had their data stolen by Israeli Coin.mx owner Gery Shalon, Israeli Ziv Orenstein and American Joshua Aaron who orchestrated the cyberattacks and used Coin.mx—and over 75 other companies around the world—to launder the stolen money. The hacking was part of a complex securities fraud and stock manipulation scheme.\n\nMurgio’s connection to the hack comes through Aaron. Frat brothers in college, Aaron showed Murgio the ropes of a few smaller-time online money making schemes. Aaron immigrated to Israel and then Russia where he was arrested earlier this year on illegal immigration charges.\n\nBut while Murgio is connected to Coin.mx and the others to the stock manipulation, the identity of the actual hacker behind the attacks on JPMorgan Chase and other American firms remains unknown as yet. Aaron’s travels to Russia lends credence to the theory that the attacker is Russian.\n\nA 2015 Bloomberg report identified the hacker as “a Russian master of digital break-ins known to federal agents and U.S. spy agencies who have tracked him for years, according to three people familiar with the investigation.”\n\nMurgio’s guilty plea and Aaron’s return to American custody may signal a break, however small, for U.S. investigators building a case against the hacker behind the keyboard on some of the biggest cyberattacks of all time.\n\nThe question is what comes next. Russia does not extradite its citizens to the United States. Moscow’s government and intelligence agencies have been known to be deeply intertwined with the country’s organized crime which, in turn, closely cooperate on cyber operations for the last decade.\n\nThe system of mutual action and protection between Moscow and Russian organized crime makes any conclusion here difficult to divine, doubly so as relations between Washington and Moscow have become increasingly cold and impossible to predict. President-elect Trump’s warmer tone toward Russia injects yet another wild card into the equation.\n\n“Through their criminal schemes, between in or about 2007 and in or about July 2015, Shalon and his co-conspirators earned hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds, of which Shalon concealed at least $100 million in Swiss and other bank accounts,” Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a 2015 statement when arrests around the case began.\n\nCoin.mx operator Murgio’s defense tried and failed last year to dismiss charges of illegally transmitting money by calling into question Bitcoin’s status as money. The judge called the “property” versus “currency” argument at the heart of Murgio’s tactic “irrelevant to the inquiry here.”\n\nLaunched in 2013 and shuttered in 2015, Coin.mx had a muddy reputation among Bitcoin users because of a bad user interface, buggy code and customer service reps who, with seemingly no appreciation for life’s deep ironies, loudly threatened dozens of customers with fraud lawsuits.\n\nBut in a time when many Bitcoin exchanges were new and going through turbulent adolescences, Coin.mx saw success especially among the criminal crowd. It was regularly recommended by dark net denizens because Murgio’s operation allowed users to rapidly buy large amounts of Bitcoin. It was such a large part of their business that Coin.mx employees even offered customer service directly on dark net market forums.\n\nAnd then came the massive bribery scheme.\n\nEngineered by Murgio and an alleged co-conspirator — Yuri Lebedev, whose trial begins next month — Coin.mx allegedly paid over $150,000 in bribes to take control of Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union (“HOPE FCU”). Prosecutors describe HOPE FCU as a “captive bank” that was then used to conduct illegal Coin.mx business after late 2014. Among HOPE FCU’s most important tasks was attempting to obstruct closer examination of the bank and exchange by the National Credit Union Administration (“NCUA”) by lying about everything from the bank’s finances to the individuals who had just taken charge. Trevon Gross, who allegedly took the bribes and then worked with Murgio and Lebedev on the scheme, is set to stand trial next month alongside Lebedev.\n\n“Anthony Murgio took a new age approach to an age-old crime of fraud,” U.S. Attorney Bharara said in a statement on Monday. “As he admitted in his guilty plea today, Murgio used Coin.mx, an internet-based Bitcoin exchange, to process over $10 million in Bitcoin transactions in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, and then obstructed a regulatory examination to hide his scheme.”\n\nCoin.mx was based in Florida, had a business address in Texas and moved money around the world but it ended up being Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose office scored the conviction alongside all the other related prosecutions.\n\nThe office’s unofficial but emphatic worldwide jurisdiction has seen Bharara rack up an enormous headcount for Bitcoin-related crimes based around the country and world because of one underlying fact: The crimes are connected, thanks to the internet, to New York City. That’s often all it takes to end up in Bharara’s crosshairs.\n\nThe superseding indictment against Murgio is available here.', 'LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wave of anti-establishment sentiment sweeping the Western world is likely to help push blockchain - the technology that gave birth to the renegade digital currency bitcoin - out of cyberspace and into the real world in 2017.\n\nBlockchain, which allows the web-based currency to function, has attracted some big backers who have risen to prominence partly because of their rejection of traditional power structures - like bitcoin itself.\n\nNow they are looking at a wide range of new uses for the technology, with those outside the realm of finance expected to grow most.\n\nFor example, Italy’s biggest opposition group, the 5-Star Movement, wants blockchain to be used in streamlining public services. In the United States, President-elect Donald Trump has a number of enthusiasts for the technology in his inner circle.\n\nExperts caution that blockchain still needs several years of experimentation and development, much like the early days of the internet, and say some projects will never work.\n\nNevertheless, in an ironic departure from blockchain’s libertarian origins, the very establishment that early supporters hoped it would displace is also jumping on the bandwagon.\n\nMany of the world’s biggest banks and corporations are trying to harness the technology to make the likes of transacting cross-border payments, issuing debt and recording health data more efficient. Even Britain’s Conservative government is keen to get in on the act.\n\nBlockchain allows for transactions and data transfers to be completed in seconds through a peer-to-peer computer network, with no need for a third party. It has therefore attracted those who distrust established authority, such as the central banks that issue traditional currencies.\n\nThis is particularly the case in its first implementation, bitcoin, which outperformed all conventional currencies in 2016. Iceland’s Pirate Party, the country’s joint second-biggest party, wants bitcoin accepted as legal tender.\n\nGRAPHIC - Banking on blockchain tmsnrt.rs/2ekG6wf\n\nGRAPHIC - The bitcoin economy tmsnrt.rs/1W1E8mw\n\nSPIRIT OF 2016\n\nNotwithstanding the corporate interest, blockchain reflects the spirit of the past year when disgruntled Britons rejected the European Union, Italians brought down their prime minister and Americans elected Trump.\n\n“A global and open blockchain ... lends itself very well to current anti-establishment sentiment,” said Jon Matonis, an economist and founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation. “The general theme is removing the role of a third-party auditor or enforcement agency.”\n\nStill, it was the financial services industry that moved fastest on blockchain development in 2016, seeking ways to reduce costs and cut the time it takes to settle transactions.\n\nSome of these applications are expected to move from the laboratory and into operation this year. But 2017 also looks likely to be the year when other sectors, both public and private, find new “use-cases” via which they can adopt the technology.\n\n“You’re still going to see more and more use-cases and resources being put into financial services, so that pie will still grow. But a larger percentage of use-cases ... will be non-financial,” said Nick Williamson, CEO of Credits, a London-based blockchain infrastructure provider.\n\nWilliamson said countries were looking at using blockchain for improving transparency and accountability in public services. The British government, for example, is examining whether it could help to track and distribute welfare and pension payments.\n\nANTI-ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS\n\nIn Italy, the 5-Star Movement - which presents itself as a clean alternative to mainstream parties dogged by corruption probes - has called blockchain a “fundamental topic” that could bring about more trust in the public sector.\n\n5-Star plans to propose a law in the Lazio region this month forcing the local government to use blockchain in streamlining and bringing greater transparency to some of its activities, according to a draft seen by Reuters.\n\nIf successful, this would be the first law in Italy to incorporate the use of blockchain in government. The group also wants to introduce the technology in a regional healthcare reform, 5-star councillor Davide Barillari told Reuters.\n\nIn the United States, the blockchain sector hopes projects will gain momentum thanks to support from the incoming Trump administration. They say the technology could help run public-sector processes more efficiently, through better tracking of government agencies’ spending or reducing welfare fraud.\n\nAs a property billionaire, Trump’s anti-establishment credentials are open to question but he has presented himself as a political outsider, and has appointed blockchain and bitcoin champion Congressman Mick Mulvaney as budget director.\n\nMulvaney, who co-founded the Blockchain Caucus in Congress in September to allow lawmakers to coordinate policies on using blockchain, calls the technology a “tremendous revolution”.\n\nTrump has also chosen Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn, whose bank has invested in blockchain, as director of the National Economic Council. Billionaire tech investor and bitcoin enthusiast Peter Thiel is a member of the transition team.\n\n“MYSTICAL CAPABILITIES”\n\nFor all this support, some feel blockchain has been over-hyped. “It took on quite mystical capabilities this (past) year. I kept reading things on the internet about how it would solve poverty, eliminate hunger,” said Dave Birch, a director of innovation at consultancy Consult Hyperion.\n\n“A lot of people said they would get into blockchain because they thought it was sort of magic.”\n\nMany in the financial technology industry, Birch included, say it is important not to expect too much too soon.\n\n“Many blockchain platforms announced the beginning of projects in 2016 that will never be completed. In some cases, the technology simply didn’t work. In others, implementation is taking longer than expected,” said Adam Krellenstein, co-founder of blockchain start-up Symbiont.\n\nStill, experts hope the doubts will be dispelled as some of the smaller-scale projects - especially in the financial services sector, which has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into blockchain - are put into operation.\n\n“2016 was a year of ‘proofs of concept’; 2017 is much more likely to be a year of implementations,” said IBM’s global head of financial markets in London, Keith Bear.\n\n“CRITICAL MASS OF UNDERSTANDING”\n\nBlockchain is unlikely to change the world fundamentally this year, but awareness of it is expected to grow and this should speed up development.\n\nAlex Tapscott, founder of investment firm Northwest Passage Ventures, believes blockchain is a “general purpose technology”, whose most lasting impact will not be in the financial sector.\n\nHe sees blockchain enabling decentralized applications to run peer-to-peer services such as ride-sharing, without the need for centralized businesses such as Uber to run operations.\n\n“2016 was a coming-out party of sorts,” he said. “2017 will see the technology reach a certain level of critical mass of understanding.”', 'Bitcoin is an unregulated virtual currency designed to eliminate the ""middleman"" from financial transactions and enable direct, anonymous transactions between users. Bitcoin has several advantages over most other currencies, such as small transaction costs, a public record of transaction amounts and times, and the anonymity of users\' personal information. However, there are some downsides to bitcoin as well.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by a programmer or group of programmers using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Several people have since claimed to be the creator, but none have been conclusively proven. Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized currency, intended to eliminate the ""middleman"" from financial transactions. Payments are sent peer-to-peer from the payee to the recipient, with no transaction fees and no need to exchange any personal information.\n\nThe currency is completely virtual and is self-sufficient -- i.e., it\'s not controlled by any central authority. New bitcoins are created through a process called ""mining."" Through mining, sophisticated computing equipment solves complex mathematical problems, and the reward is a newly created block of bitcoins.\n\nIn the early days of bitcoin, everyday computers had sufficient power to mine for blocks of coins online. As the competition for the newly created blocks intensified over time, more and more sophisticated mining hardware was developed. For example, miners can be as simple as these small devices that can plug into any computer\'s USB ports.\n\nOr, they can be complex collections of advanced computing devices working together, like this ""mining farm.""\n\nThere are several readily available software programs that allow users to either mine for bitcoins on their own or join ""mining pools,"" which essentially allow participants to combine the power of their mining hardware and then share any blocks of coins that they receive.\n\nHowever, it\'s important to realize that the supply of bitcoins is not unlimited. The production rates for the next hundred years or so have been predetermined, and will decrease over time (currently, 12.5 bitcoins are released in each block, which occurs approximately every 10 minutes). There will be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins created in total, with final production occurring around the year 2140. This prevents things like inflation and dilution from impacting the inherent value of each bitcoin; unlike most currencies around the world, bitcoin has a specific limit on how much can be created.\n\nEach bitcoin can be broken into fractional units, with up to eight decimal places of precision. For example, if one bitcoin is worth $1,000, and you need to pay for a $20 item, then you would send 0.02 bitcoins (abbreviated BTC). The term millibitcoin, or mBTC, is used to represent 0.001 (one one-thousandth) of a full bitcoin.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, there is no such thing as a physical bitcoin, despite the abundance of pictures like this one:\n\nEvery finalized bitcoin transaction is kept on a massive public online ledger known as the ""blockchain."" This contains information such as the time and amount of each transaction, but it does not contain any personal information.\n\nHow to store and spend bitcoins\n\nPeople who wish to hold and spend bitcoins must create a bitcoin ""wallet,"" which stores the information needed to complete bitcoin transactions. The bitcoins themselves remain a part of the blockchain, but your wallet contains the information necessary to access and use your own bitcoins. There are several software providers of bitcoin wallets, and with a little research, you can find one that\'s best for you.\n\nBitcoin isn\'t universally accepted yet, but over the past several years, the list of businesses that accept bitcoin has grown. Just to name a few, the current list includes Overstock.com, Microsoft, Expedia, Newegg.com, Home Depot, DISH Network, and Intuit. Many small businesses accept bitcoin payments as well.\n\nOf course, with the anonymity of bitcoin comes the potential for it to be used for illegal activities, such as gambling or buying drugs or weapons. This was a bigger problem in the earlier years of bitcoin than it is now, but it still exists to some degree.\n\nWhile bitcoins are still used for illicit activities, common legitimate uses of bitcoin include paying for internet services like web hosting and advertising. There are also several popular online stores set up for the specific purpose of allowing people to shop with bitcoins, and mainstream retailers are increasingly accepting the virtual currency.\n\nAnother common use of bitcoin is for low-cost money transfers, particularly to foreign countries. The average cost of a bitcoin transfer is about $0.04, and it takes just over nine minutes to complete, making it appealing for people who need to send money overseas.\n\nAdvantages of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is popular for a reason, as it has several advantages over traditional currencies that many people find attractive. Just to name some of the biggest reasons to use bitcoin instead of say, U.S. dollars:\n\nBitcoin transactions have few or no fees. This makes them appealing for merchants -- instead of paying a credit card processing fee of, say, 2% of a sale, a merchant can pay a minuscule fee by accepting a bitcoin payment.\n\nAll information is transparent. Details of every financial transaction involving Bitcoin are available on a public ""ledger"" known as the blockchain, for everyone to see. While personal information is not visible, you can see what amount was transferred, and what bitcoin address it was sent to. This makes it easy to verify transactions, and makes it impossible for bitcoin to be manipulated by any person, organization, or government.\n\nAs alluded to in the previous point, Bitcoin is anonymous. Transaction amounts and times are public, but no identifying information is. While this has been used for negative purposes such as buying illicit items (search online for ""Silk Road"" for an example), it can also be an advantage for everyday consumers.\n\nDisadvantages of bitcoin\n\nEvery currency has its flaws (yes, even the U.S. dollar), and since bitcoin is so new, it has some unique drawbacks that people should be aware of before getting involved:\n\nBitcoin can be a highly volatile currency, which is one of its biggest disadvantages. In fact, on the day I wrote this article (Jan. 5, 2017), bitcoin hit a multiyear high of $1,153.02, then plunged 23% to an intraday low of $887.47, and then finally rebounded to just under $974 as I write. The value of a bitcoin has risen 400% over the past 16 months alone. Price swings like these are unheard of with most traditional currencies, but they\'re not rare with Bitcoin.\n\nWhile many retailers accept bitcoin, it\'s nowhere near universally accepted. Several proponents have ""lived off of bitcoins"" for certain periods of time, but it\'s not practical for the average person to rely completely on bitcoin as their only currency.\n\nBitcoin wallets can be lost. While I\'m not sure that this risk is any greater than that of losing an actual wallet containing paper money, there are other risks such as hacking, viruses, and simply forgetting your passcode to a bitcoin wallet. Entire bitcoin exchanges have been hacked, costing bitcoin owners millions of dollars. While there are safeguards to protect against most permanent losses, and the security features available to bitcoin users are continuously evolving, there\'s still a very real risk.\n\nThe bottom line on bitcoin\n\nWhile bitcoin certainly has some advantages over traditional currencies, it\'s important to be aware that virtual currencies are still in their infancy, and as such, they\'re bound to have some growing pains along the way. At this point, however, the long-term viability of bitcoin as a universally recognized currency remains to be seen.', 'Bitstamp has announced the inclusion of Ripple crypto-asset to its exchange offering across the EU. Read more...\n\nBitstamp, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchange platform has started supporting Ripple. By including Ripple, the platform now supports two different cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe growing popularity of Bitcoin led to the creation of hundreds of altcoins. Among those, only a handful of them are quite popular and have a decent user base. Ripple is one of those popular altcoins, currently holding the third position in terms of market capitalization.\n\nBitstamp announced the inclusion of new crypto-asset in its latest blog post. The two Ripple trading pairs XRP/USD and XRP/EUR will be made available to Bitstamp users starting 17 January 2017. As an introductory offer, the cryptocurrency exchange has also decided to waiver trading fee for Ripple crypto-fiat pairs for a period of one month.\n\n“After evaluating a number of digital currencies for inclusion on our exchange, it soon became clear that customer demand for XRP was particularly strong… Fortunately, Ripple and XRP also happen to be a good fit for the requirements of our EU license and so we are delighted to be able to respond to our customers’ needs in this way,” said the CEO of Bitstamp, Nejc Kodric.\n\nBitstamp users can start depositing XRP on Bitstamp from January 11, 2016. The zero fee offer for Ripple transactions will end on February 10, 2016, which will be followed by a reduced fee schedule until the end of April.\n\nIn addition to being a tradable crypto-asset, XRP is also used as a bridge currency for real-time settlement. Ripple currently has a total market capitalization of $234,878,718 at a price of $0.0065 per token. The inclusion of XRP on a licensed cryptocurrency exchange also gives Ripple a much-needed boost among the cryptocurrency community. Bitstamp holds the distinction of being the largest Bitcoin exchanges in EU, in terms of its trade volumes, and it may soon gain a similar distinction for its XRP offering as well.\n\nRef: Bitstamp Blog', 'A new investor note published today by analyst Needham & Company projects that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could attract as much as $300m in new assets in its first week alone.\n\nWriting about the potential impact of an ETF on the nascent market, analyst Spencer Bogart speculates that such an approval is likely to have a ""profoundly positive"" effect on the price of bitcoin, and that the $300m estimate is ""conservative"".\n\n""The resulting effort to source the underlying bitcoin for the trust would likely drive the price of bitcoin up significantly,"" Bogart writes.\n\nIn the scenario, he told CoinDesk that $300m in assets would mean that the ETF\'s authorized participants would need to source this volume of bitcoin for the ETF, sending prices higher. (Bitcoin\'s market cap was just over $14.5bn at press time).\n\nThe catch, however, is that Bogart doesn\'t believe one of the major bitcoin ETF filings – the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – is likely to be approved.\n\nThough the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a final decision on the filing by 11th March, Bogart speculates that the ETF\'s ""probability of approval is very low"".\n\nThe note reads:\n\n""Taken together, we think the positive effect that a bitcoin ETF would have on the price of bitcoin is vastly underappreciated and that the probability of approval is drastically overestimated within the industry.""\n\nUltimately, Bogart projects that the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF has a less than 25% chance of being approved due to a ""confluence of fear, uncertainty and doubt coupled with basic incentives at the SEC"".\n\nBogart goes on to label any approval a ""low probability"" event with ""very significant upside"".\n\nCurveball approval\n\nYet, the document also highlights a suspected peculiarity in the law that could enable the ETF to be approved – without any action from the SEC.\n\nHighlighted in the note is language that Needham says indicates could result in a scenario in which the SEC doesn\'t disprove the filing, and as a result, it is automatically approved.\n\nThe note suggests Needham isn\'t sure if it\'s interpreting its findings correctly, but that the possibility could add an interesting dynamic to the March decision.\n\n""We think this is interesting only because, politically, it might be easier for the individuals responsible for making the decision to let the decision go to auto-approval—which essentially only means they lack of a reason to disapprove—than it is to stick a stamp of approval on the rule change,"" it reads.\n\nIn statements, however, Bogart added that he believes this possibility to be ""highly unlikely"".\n\nFor more analysis, read the full investor note below:\n\nBitcoin Investment Trust Spencer Needham by Pete Rizzo on Scribd\n\nChart increase visualization via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The malware infection, which hit just before New Year\'s Eve, is now being probed by law enforcement.\n\nAccording to student media outlet, the Valley Star, the hackers, whose identity remains unknown, left a note on the college servers that said: ""You have 7 days to send us the bitcoin after 7 days we will remove your private keys and it\'s impossible to recover your files.""\n\nLike most ransomware attacks of this nature, the culprits left step-by-step instructions on how to submit the funds. ""Check our site, you can upload two encrypted files and we will decrypt your files as demo,"" the cybercriminals reportedly teased.\n\nIn the latest statement, LAVC president Erika Endrijonas said external cybersecurity experts made the call to make the payment, assessing that doing so would offer a ""high probability"" of restoring access to the systems, while failure to pay would ""virtually guarantee that data would be lost.""\n\n""The district has a cybersecurity insurance policy to address these specific types of cyber intrusions and it was activated during this incident,"" she added.\n\nEndrijonas said after payment was made, the hacker handed over the ""key"" so the campus could regain control over the disrupted networks.

On Jan. 5 it came within a hair’s breadth of surpassing its all-time high; then it lost billions in market value on fears of a Chinese government clampdown.\n\nThe traders responsible for these price swings are spread around the world. They gather on Reddit’s r/bitcoin, the legendary forum Bitcointalk, encrypted Telegram chat rooms, and Teamspeak servers (basically a rolling, public conference call, where traders can speak to each other using technology originally designed for multi-player games) such as WhalePool.\n\nBut try to join in their conversations, and you’ll likely be baffled. Why do traders persistently misspell “hold” even in the face of powerful autocorrect software? Is being a “bagholder” a pejorative? And why is the BearWhale spoken of in hushed tones?

It was established by a cri de cœur issued during the great bitcoin crash of 2013: “I AM HODLING” a post on Bitcointalk screamed.\n\nThe post’s author, “GameKyuubi,” acknowledged that he had mis-spelled “Hold”, then went into analyzing why he was holding bitcoin even as prices collapsed. His conclusion was he simply couldn’t sell: In a bear market, the only people who sell are savvy day-traders who get the timing just right, and “illusioned noobs” (unseasoned newcomers) who panic. For everyone else, there is only hodling.\n\nBear — From Wall Street lingo: a trader who believes prices will fall.\n\nWhale — From casino parlance: a trader with a fat account, usually one who is bullish on the price of bitcoin.\n\nBearWhale — By extension, a big-time trader who is bearish on the price of bitcoin.\n\nA BearWhale is a dangerous creature because he/she/it tries to sell large quantities of bitcoin on the open market, lowering the price for everyone else. The only known sighting of one in the wild occurred on October 2014 on the Slovenian Bitstamp exchange. The BearWhale was trying to unload 30,000 bitcoins in a single order—at the time worth over $9 million, and today $26 million—for $300 apiece, well under the mid-$300 range that bitcoin was trading for at the time.\n\nThe result was a sudden but temporary flattening of the bitcoin price. It was temporary because hodlers and whales assembled to soak up the BearWhale’s coins, successfully slaying it. This event was commemorated with artwork of the battle, such as the picture atop this post.\n\nBagholder — An investor who has been hodling for too long, and is left to face the consequences. Also refers to the many pump-and-dump schemes involving thinly traded “altcoins” (cryptocurrencies that aren’t bitcoin, which function more like penny stocks) on the scene.

In the chart provided by Ray, it is evident that the interest directly correlates with the performance of Bitcoin on the market, as Google searches for “Bitcoin” peaked globally when its price reached an all-time high in late 2013.\n\nAt the end of 2016, the number of searches for the keyword “Bitcoin” surged again, amid Bitcoin’s strong price rally which allowed the digital currency to surpass multi-year highs. It also surpassed its all-time high market cap of $15 bln, reaching $17.5 bln at its peak.\n\nOne major reason behind the surge of interest in Bitcoin over certain periods of time is that the demand for Bitcoin is heavily dependent on the market. Because Bitcoin has an actual user base that considers the digital currency to be a global store of value and a legal tender, its value depends on its investors and traders.\n\nBlockchain fails to captivate general population\n\nIn contrast, Blockchain technology, despite its vast potential, failed to be adopted by large industries and major financial institutions. Although blns of dollars was allocated for the development of Blockchain over the past two years, the technology was failed to be commercialized by its early adopters.\n\nEventually and inevitably, the general population lost interest in Blockchain due to the non-fulfilment of its hype and the anticipation of investors.\n\nThroughout 2016, a year in which major financial institutions and banks including the Deutsche bank and Santander bank announced their plans to adopt Blockchain technology, the interest in Bitcoin increased slightly, as the general population anticipated the deployment of at least a few commercially successful Blockchain platforms.\n\nHowever, the financial industry did not see the emergence of successful Blockchain platforms, and the interest in Blockchain declined by the end of last year.\n\nExperts say future of Blockchain is still bright\n\nStill, various experts and analysts, including the world’s most popular Bitcoin wallet service provider and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, believe that the future of Blockchain technology is still optimistic, and early adopters will see the value of the technology in the near future.\n\nSmith stated:"", 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is showing no signs of pulling up from its dive, as it went on another wave lower and could be in for more declines.\n\nA descending trend line can be drawn to connect the highs of price action, with the resistance level lining up with a former support area.\n\nPrice could pull up to this area of interest before resuming its slide.\n\nBitcoin price continues to tread lower as Chinese regulators make moves to investigate cryptocurrency exchanges and clients in the country.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA on the 1-hour chart, signaling that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In addition, the short-term moving average coincides with the descending trend line, adding to its strength as a ceiling.\n\nBitcoin price could pull up to the $900 level before resuming its drop, as this area previously served as support. Stochastic is on the move up to suggest that sellers are taking a break for the time being and allowing profit-taking to happen. RSI is heading up so bitcoin price could follow suit. Once these oscillators hit the overbought areas and turn lower, price could slump back to the lows near $700.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe lack of follow-through from earlier bullish moves suggests that bitcoin price is under tremendous selling pressure right now. This follows reports that Chinese authorities are cracking down on bitcoin activity in the mainland as part of their efforts to curb offshore investments and devalue the yuan.\n\nReports indicated that the Chinese central bank is conducting “spot checks focused on how the exchanges implement policies including forex management and anti-money laundering” so bitcoin investors are getting wary and starting to liquidate their holdings.\n\nKeep in mind that China is the largest market for bitcoin so any moves to limit activity in this country could have a drastic effect on bitcoin price. The government has an annual maximum on the amount that people can change into foreign currency but has also noted that bitcoin is not currency and shouldn’t be treated as such.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Rodriguez said in a statement.\n\nAfter consulting with the college’s information technology staff, cybersecurity experts and law enforcement, the district paid the ransom on Jan. 4, a day after classes started, according to district officials. The district has a cybersecurity insurance policy that has been activated and covers such attacks.\n\n“It was the assessment of our outside cybersecurity experts that making a payment would offer an extremely high probability of restoring access to the affected systems, while failure to pay would virtually guarantee that data would be lost,” he said. “After payment was made, a ‘key’ was delivered to open access to our computer systems. The process to ‘unlock’ hundreds of thousands of files will be a lengthy one, but so far, the key has worked in every attempt that has been made.”\n\nThe campus’ website, email and voicemail were restored the following day, according to district spokesman Yusef Robb. Classes started as scheduled on Jan. 3 for winter session and have continued to be held.\n\nThe district is still unlocking individual files, he said.\n\nInvestigators believe the unidentified hackers used ransomware, a type of computer virus, to hijack the campus’ computer system and take control of it until a payment was made, said Capt. Rod Armalin of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Community College Bureau. The Sheriff’s Department began investigating the attack the next day.\n\nArmalin said the Sheriff’s Department did not discuss with the district whether the ransom should be paid.\n\n“We would not recommend either way,” he said.\n\nThe Valley Glen campus, according to officials, was randomly targeted.\n\nAlthough the investigation is ongoing, it appears no data were breached during the attack, according to the district.\n\nThe Sheriff’s Department’s Fraud and Cyber Crimes Bureau is working on training the district’s nine campuses in online security, Armalin said.\n\nPhil Lieberman, a cybersecurity expert, said attacks such as the one at Los Angeles Valley College are common among companies and government agencies that use the Internet.\n\n“The attacks generally come out of Eastern Europe and cannot be stopped because the United States does not have pacts with the countries where the attacks are launched,” he said.\n\nRansomware is usually delivered via email or through an infected website and immediately locks a computer system, Lieberman said. After a payment is received, hackers provide an “unlock code.”\n\nFinding the hackers isn’t the hard part, he said.\n\nThe problem, according to Lieberman, is that “the U.S. government has no way to stop them, since the governments of the countries that launch this are uncooperative and in fact benefit from the criminal activity going on within their borders.”\n\nThe low-cost attacks are successful for hackers, he said. Hackers usually come up with their own scheme to get victims to click and download a virus.\n\n“Companies do generally pay out if they do not have backups of their data and the data has value,” Lieberman said.\n\nA similar attack disabled computer systems at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in February. Hackers gained control of the hospital’s system and demanded 40 bitcoin, at the time the equivalent of about $17,000.\n\nThe hospital paid the ransom to free and regain control of its infected computer system.\n\nCAPTION Walt Disney Co. plans to buy much of the media assets of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.

Unified\'s insider superintendent has made no big waves\n\nUCLA professor sanctioned over sexual misconduct allegations returns to teaching, sparking protests\n\nUSC taps diversity expert to run new research center on race and equity\n\nUPDATES:\n\n3:25 p.m.: This article was updated with details about the ransom being paid on Jan. 4 and information on the systems that have been restored.\n\nThis article was originally published at 11:45 a.m.', ""By Erik Voorhees\n\nWhen most people hear about Bitcoin, whether for the first or the tenth time, they ask one simple question: “What is it?”\n\nLike an automobile, Bitcoin is technically advanced, and it can appear complicated, depending on how much you want to know about it. But also like an automobile, it doesn’t require you to be a technical expert in order to use it—and for it to change the way you interact with the world.\n\nHere’s what you need to know. Generally speaking, Bitcoin is two things:\n\n1) A payment network (“Bitcoin”);\n\n2) The currency unit used on that network (“bitcoins”).\n\nThus, as both a payment network and the specific currency used on that network, you use “Bitcoin” to receive and send “bitcoins” from and to other people.\n\nTo clarify, take a look at the relationship between PayPal and U.S. dollars. PayPal is a payment network, but not a currency. In contrast, the U.S. dollar is a currency, but not a payment network. You use the PayPal payment network to make transactions in U.S. dollar currency.\n\nThe PayPal payment network is operated and centrally controlled by one company (PayPal Inc.), and the U.S. dollar is created and centrally controlled by one organization (the U.S. federal government).\n\nHere’s where things get important, revolutionary—and a little weird.\n\nThe Bitcoin payment network, unlike anything else before it, is decentralized. It is not controlled by any company or organization. That fact alone is its core “value-add.” Bitcoin's decentralization is why it's unique and revolutionary.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is like file-sharing: it’s a network of computers that talk to each other, but nobody controls the network itself (there is no central server).\n\nThe bitcoin currency unit itself is similarly not created or controlled by any central party. Bitcoins are created by the network itself over time, in a process that distributes the new coins to those computers that are supporting and operating the network. The number of coins created in this way is limited according to a clear mathematical schedule. As of this writing, there are 15.8 million bitcoins in existence, and this will continually increase over time to a maximum of 21 million bitcoins many years in the future.\n\nUnless you care about how Bitcoin accomplishes this, the above is really all you need to answer the question, “What is Bitcoin?” It’s a payment network, and a currency used on that network, which are controlled by no central party. People control their own bitcoins. The number of bitcoins in existence is limited by the rules of the protocol.\n\nPerhaps the more important question is, “Why should I c\xadare?”\n\nWhile computer engineers and mathematicians might find Bitcoin’s technical details fascinating, most people don’t really have the time for those complexities—just as most people don’t spend time worrying about exactly how the internet works. We trust that it does, we enjoy its benefits, and we know enough about it to use it.\n\nAnd while it’s true that Bitcoin permits financial transactions that have essentially zero cost, that can occur instantly anywhere in the world, these consumer benefits are not really what’s important, either.\n\nThe real magic of Bitcoin, the reason it’s so newsworthy, comes from the consequences of its existence.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin is decentralized, with no controlling entity, has fundamental implications. Because there is no central control, the power of the currency and its payment network belong entirely to the people who use it. And this power is tremendous indeed.\n\nBitcoin enables any two people, anywhere on earth, to transact with each other freely. They cannot be censored. The only rules of their exchange are those they set between themselves.\n\nWith Bitcoin, there is no third party presiding over the economic activity of the users. With Bitcoin, you don’t need anyone’s permission when you make a financial decision. This means people can contribute to causes they believe are important, with no government agency or financial company able to cut off the payment flow. It means an entrepreneurial child can start an internet business before he or she is 18. It means a rural African farmer can receive payment for crops from a neighboring city, even with no bank account. It means a citizen of a tyrannical nation can hide his financial assets from seizure. It means the wealthiest and the poorest of the world now have the same authority over their money – beholden neither to banks nor bureaucrats. It democratizes finance just as the internet democratized speech.\n\nWith Bitcoin, economic relationships are set and regulated by markets instead of politicians. By the individual, not the collective. The value of one’s savings now cannot be reduced through monetary debasement (i.e. inflation). Trade between individuals is now the business of only those individuals.\n\nCertainly, some of these implications are controversial. Indeed, they will have a profound impact on human society, just as all great technological achievements do. A good way to think of it is that Bitcoin represents the separation of money and state—the ability to “practice one’s own economic behavior” without the permission of anyone else. It offers privacy in an age of surveillance, and honesty in an age of manipulation.\n\nSo what is Bitcoin? It is a payment technology, sure. But more than that, it is a social and economic experiment. It is a project that, if successful, will change the relationships between humans on a fundamental level. Its implications have just barely been explored.\n\nLike any experiment, it can fail, but the genie is now out of the bottle. While this genie goes about its business, many things you take for granted will likely change. The changes will be beneficial, especially if you know something about them in advance. Remember the dawning of the internet. And educate yourself now on the phenomenon that is Bitcoin.\n\nErik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift.io, is recognized as one of the world’s leading Bitcoin entrepreneurs. Voorhees passionately advocates for Bitcoin, which he considers among the most important inventions in history. As a featured guest on Bloomberg, Fox Business, CNBC, BBC Radio, The Peter Schiff Show and at numerous Bitcoin and industry conferences, he has asserted that “there is no such thing as a ‘free market’ when the institution of money itself is centrally planned and controlled.” His writings address “the human struggle for the separation of money and state,” with Bitcoin as the instrument by which the future will happen."", ""Investors in bitcoin have had two things to get particularly excited about of late: the prospect of the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund coming to market, and the digital currency‘s massive 2016 gain, when it more than doubled in value.\n\nBut whether those gains hold may depend, in part, on whether the ETF is approved.\n\nCommodity-based ETFs—which a bitcoin ETF would likely be deemed as, given that both the IRS and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission classify bitcoin as a commodity rather than a currency—are typically structured as grantor trusts, and they have to hold the underlying commodity to cover a portion of their assets. If a bitcoin ETF saw heavy inflows, that would require the fund provider to purchase bitcoin, and that demand could lead to a spike in prices.\n\nSpencer Bogart, a bitcoin analyst at boutique investment bank Needham & Co., on Tuesday wrote that the launch of a bitcoin ETF would, in the first week alone, lead to an influx of $300 million in new investor capital into the bitcoin ecosystem. Such inflows could expand the cryptocurrency’s size to nearly $15 billion. By comparison, that is about $1 billion more than the market capitalization of Twitter Inc. TWTR, +4.25%\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission last week designated March 11 as the date by which it would either approve or disapprove the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who run Winklevoss Capital, first announced plans for one in 2013; the pair also run both WinkDex, a bitcoin price index, and Gemini, a bitcoin custodian and exchange.\n\nA spokesman for the SEC declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Winklevoss Capital couldn't immediately be reached.\n\nThere is little historical precedent to gauge what impact an ETF launching could have on the price of the underlying asset, as bitcoin would be the first asset to trade in an ETF wrapper before being offered as a mutual fund. Currently, registered investment advisers are unable to directly buy bitcoin for their clients.\n\nSome analysts pointed to the launch of a popular gold ETF, which helped to bolster the price of the underlying commodity, as a possible example of how bitcoin might perform.\n\nHowever, the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, -0.20% which was launched in 1994, isn’t a perfect analogy, as investors had other avenues—including futures and bullion—to get exposure to gold.\n\nStill, some argue that “the launch of gold-based exchange-traded products democratized access to physical gold in a way that few other inventions or technologies ever had before,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “Individual investors were suddenly able to get access to physical gold, and that widened the circle of the prospective ownership base for the commodity. Any time you see an influx in demand, basic economic logic indicates that prices will go higher.”\n\nAccording to data from the World Gold Council, the top 15 physically backed gold-based exchange -traded products, which include ETFs, held 2.14 tons of gold, as of the end of 2016.\n\nJohnson said he was dubious that an ETF would have a long-term impact on bitcoin prices, but he said that “what’s inarguable is that a bitcoin ETF would widen the circle of investors who hitherto haven’t been able to invest in bitcoin directly. Whether that means anything for price discovery…well, who the heck knows what drives day-to-day moves in cryptocurrencies.”\n\nRead: Here’s one easy way to get exposure to bitcoin ahead of the Winklevoss ETF\n\nShould the ETF be approved, it would go a long way toward promoting the mainstream acceptance of bitcoin, and signal a detente between the bitcoin community and its regulators. Bogart and Jake Smith, an account manager at bitcoin.com, believe this would also help support the price in the long term by eliminating some of the stigma surrounding cryptocurrencies, which many still view as risky and unstable.\n\nCheck out: Bitcoin plunges as Chinese authorities step up scrutiny\n\nApproval would be “a great stride toward bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance, perceived soundness and regulatory approval,” Smith said.\n\nHe also noted that a bitcoin ETF would open the doors to retail investors allocating some of their retirement savings to bitcoin.\n\nDespite that, approval of the ETF is far from certain. Bogart said the probability was “very low.”\n\n“To be clear, we don’t see any specific reason to disapprove the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF but, instead, think that the confluence of fear, uncertainty and doubt coupled with basic incentives at the SEC will make it very difficult to get approval,” Bogart wrote to clients.\n\nIn its brief history, regulators and the digital-currency community have mostly been at loggerheads. Bitcoin advocates blamed the New York State Department of Financial Services for stifling innovation in the space by requiring companies providing bitcoin-related services like trading to apply for a bitlicense, without which they are prohibited from operating in the state.\n\n“Through smart and careful regulation, New York State continues to flourish as a virtual currency leader in the global marketplace,” said a representative for NYDFS. “The Department of Financial Services will continue to encourage the development and long-term future of this growing industry.”\n\nLate last year, the IRS issued a summons to coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, demanding it turn over client records, provoking outrage and speculation about a protracted legal battle."", 'Could blockchain tech take India cashless?\n\nAs India\'s government pushes ahead with a controversial plan to move the country away from physical cash, a group of researchers backed by its central bank has called for an investigation into how blockchain could achieve that goal.\n\nThe Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) was founded in the 1990s by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and last week, it released its first major white paper focused on blockchain (which includes details of a test related to trade finance applications).\n\nIn addition to providing a broad overview of the tech’s mechanics and potential uses in the Indian banking sector, the white paper posits that the time is right to begin assessing how the rupee, India’s national currency, could be digitized through the use of a distributed ledger.\n\nThe Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sparked broad criticism for its move in early November to withdraw high-value banknotes of the Indian rupee, the country\'s currency. Modi would later double-down on his plan, calling for India to embrace digital money later that month, and the government went on to begin amending legislation to further those plans.\n\nAccording to IDRBT, blockchain could help achieve that goal.\n\nThe full report highlights work being done by central banks in countries like Canada and the UK, among others.\n\nThe paper’s authors wrote:\n\n“From a technological perspective, we feel that [blockchain] has matured enough and there is sufficient awareness among the stakeholders which makes this an appropriate time for initiating suitable efforts towards digitizing the Indian Rupee through [blockchain].”\n\nRoadmap call\n\nThe authors also suggested other avenues for India’s broader banking sector to experiment with the tech.\n\nTo start, it recommends that banks consider standing up their own internal blockchain networks, both as a boon for training purposes as well as a way to see what, if any, benefits the tech could bring to their institutions.\n\n""Banks may setup a private blockchain for their internal purposes,"" the authors wrote. ""This not only helps them to train human resources in the technology, but also benefits by enabling efficient asset management [and] opportunities for cross-selling.""\n\nFrom there, IDRBT goes on to say, banks could work cooperatively in the areas of AML/KYC, loan syndication and trade finance.\n\n""Further areas where BCT can be applied advantageously in BFSI sector would be supply chain finance, bill discounting, monitoring of consortium accounts, servicing of securities and mandate management system,"" the authors added.\n\nGrowing footprint in India\n\nThat the research group would call for broader use of blockchain within the Indian financial sector is perhaps unsurprising, given recent developments.\n\nIt was only last summer that the RBI itself called for domestic banks to pursue research into the tech, calling for institutions to work in conjunction with the IDRBT on possible applications.\n\n""Cloud-based computing, blockchain processing technologies and virtualization of IT systems are a few examples which hold potential for being used in a big way,” RBI deputy governor Rama Gandhi said during a speech in July. “Banks and IDRBT can work together to study these, test them out and adapt for best use.""\n\nIn mid-2015, officials from the central bank posited that while digital currencies could fuel money laundering efforts, they could also improve financial inclusion and reduce payments friction.\n\nSince then, a number of financial institutions – as well as private sector stakeholders beyond the banking world – have moved explore use cases and develop products using the tech.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'A month after it suspended operations in Nigeria, Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox (MMM), a Russian Ponzi scheme with over 2 million participants in Africa’s most populous country, is already plotting its comeback.\n\nMMM claimed it had to temporarily close operations due to the “heavy workload” on its system. It in turn blamed the government and media for stoking fears and causing “constant frenzy” with warnings aimed at dissuading Nigerians from participating in the scheme.\n\nGovernment bodies, like the central bank, warned Nigerians against committing their cash to “fraudsters”. But despite the government’s best efforts, MMM grew popular and thrived with a simple working model: participants committed to sending money to other participants and, after a month, they got their cash back, plus 30% interest, from other participants. Since suspending operations in Nigeria, MMM has also set up shop in neighboring Ghana, offering similar 30% monthly interest rates.\n\nThe scheme has been controversial around Africa and other parts of the world because like most ponzi schemes, the lending chain eventually collapses and thousands of people can lose money. It’s a scenario the Nigerian government would be keen to avoid, but given the tough economic conditions in the country, many participants are willing to take the risk.\n\nTo appease its Nigerian participants who faced the possibility of losing cash they’d put in the scheme, MMM promised to resume operations on Jan. 14. So far, the scheme appears on course to keep its promise, but there’s an added twist. In a letter to its participants, MMM says upon resumption they will now be able to pay and receive money in bitcoins, the digital currency.\n\nWhile MMM participants could previously provide help through bitcoins, they were paid back in naira, the Nigerian currency. MMM cites bitcoin’s steady growth in value as a reason for participants to adopt the currency. “In a month, not only 30 percent will be added to your initial amount, but, it can increase itself due to Bitcoin price growth,” MMM said in a letter to participants, according to reports. The scheme also tells participants they can convert bitcoins to naira whenever they please.\n\nBut MMM’s strategy of using bitcoin as a cherry-on-the-cake inducement ignores the currency’s sharp drop in value since the beginning of the year. A result of warnings from the People’s Bank of China about risks of bitcoin exchanges, the currency has suffered double-digit percentage drop in value in 2017.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.', 'Bitcoin startup BitX has officially rebranded as Luno, a transition that finds the firm shifting focus to the European market.\n\nFor the startup, which was founded in 2013, CEO Marc Swanepoel said the new name isn\'t about shifting away from bitcoin. Rather, he says it\'s about creating a brand that\'s both easily digestible and that doesn\'t bring to mind the connotation that the firm is only an exchange service.\n\n""I think some companies rebranded because they wanted to move into blockchain,"" he said. ""We are totally the opposite: our website and products, we\'re very focused on bitcoin.""\n\nSwanepoel told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'d like to say that we\'re digital currency agnostic in theory, but in practice, we can\'t see any digital currency compete with bitcoin.

Adam White is vice president and general manager at Coinbase, where he oversees its exchange service GDAX.\n\nIn this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Burniske and White discuss their recently published white paper, ""Bitcoin, a New Asset Class"", unpacking what they see as the tech\'s investment potential.\n\nWhile much of the traditional financial world was focused on ""blockchain"" in 2016, few gave bitcoin as much attention.\n\nWhen brought up, bitcoin was referenced in the context of macroeconomic dislocations like the depreciation of the Chinese yuan, India\'s banknote ban, or Trump\'s surprise election win. While these events often provided great examples of its use as a ""disaster hedge"" in the face of capital market turmoil, we believe the bigger story of bitcoin\'s evolution as a unique asset class was left mostly untouched.\n\nRecently, however, we have witnessed institutional investors awaking to bitcoin\'s maturation and long-term value proposition in the context of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).\n\nMPT emphasizes that investors should not consider single investments in isolation, but rather in the context of an overall portfolio.\n\nUsing MPT, investors can intelligently construct portfolios by including uncorrelated assets to maximize returns for a given level of risk. Alternative assets such as gold and oil have become a popular means to add diversification to traditional portfolios of equities and bonds.\n\nIn our paper, we show that bitcoin\'s attributes could make it a valuable addition as part of a diversified investment portfolio.\n\nMaking the case\n\nUsing six years of data, we investigated aspects of bitcoin\'s market behavior, such as its use cases, volatility, risk-reward profile and price independence.\n\nThe results show bitcoin is gaining traction as a disruptive peer-to-peer currency, a development that bodes well for its long-term potential.\n\nAs one of the three core pillars of a currency, we think bitcoin\'s use as a means of exchange is critical for its long term viability. Coinbase has unique insight into how bitcoin is being used as a means of exchange for goods and services, with around 45,000 merchants using its payment processing tools.\n\nIn 2016, both the number of transactions and monthly processing volume that merchants accepted using bitcoin, doubled from the previous year.\n\nSome of this volume is being driven by new bitcoin users. For example, the number of Coinbase daily new user signups has also doubled since January 2016. In the broader bitcoin ecosystem, transactional volumes grew 118% year-over-year, with bitcoin\'s blockchain now processing over $115,000 per minute.\n\nAs bitcoin continues to grow, Coinbase and ARK are seeing increased interest and enthusiasm from capital market investors.\n\nWe believe many institutional investors are realizing bitcoin may be one of the best ways to get ""blockchain"" exposure in their portfolios.\n\nVolatility decline\n\nBitcoin’s absolute returns have outpaced most other assets over the last five years, but few realize that its volatility has been dropping too. When measured by the trailing year standard deviation of daily percent price changes, bitcoin\'s volatility dropped 28% in 2016.\n\nMany people mistakenly equate a rising price with increased volatility. Bitcoin’s 2016 market behavior, however, provided a great counterexample to that misconception.\n\nWhile bitcoin’s price more than doubled last year, it did so in a gradual manner when compared with the more severe spikes and drops of years past.\n\nAn instance of controlled volatility was during the August 2016 compromise of the popular bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, when bitcoin\'s price dropped sharply only to quickly regain its footing.\n\nWe believe this to be a sign of mature investors taking up slack from weak holders, quickly balancing out the order books of bitcoin markets. In prior years, bitcoin’s recovery may not have been so graceful.\n\nTo give some context on how much bitcoin’s volatility has decreased, it was 30% less volatile than Twitter’s stock in 2016, and just as volatile as USO, one of the more popular oil ETFs on the market.\n\nReward versus risk\n\nDividing absolute returns (minus the risk-free rate) by standard deviation yields an investment calculation called the Sharpe Ratio, which calibrates each unit of return for the risk taken.\n\nDespite its perception as a ""high risk"" asset, in 2016 bitcoin compensated investors twice as much for the risk they took than the S&P 500 did.\n\nMoreover, 2016 provided bitcoin’s best year of risk-adjusted returns ever, as shown in the graph below from our white paper.\n\nPrice independence\n\nOver the years, bitcoin has behaved in a relatively independent manner from the broader capital markets. We believe price independence is a valuable characteristic in a world where the cadence of macroeconomic dislocations seems to be accelerating.\n\nAs we saw in 2008, world markets tend to be highly correlated in times of crisis.\n\nBitcoin, however, has shaken that trend and consistently demonstrated low correlation with other capital market assets, shown below.\n\nA digital gold\n\nBitcoin demonstrated its differentiation as an emerging asset class within the capital markets in 2016. That said, if more institutional investors begin to incorporate bitcoin into their portfolios, bitcoin may intensify in its correlation with other capital market assets.\n\nFor example, when investigating bitcoin\'s correlation with gold, it was interesting to us that in 2016 its correlation reversed, climbing back into positive territory.\n\nCertainly, correlation does not imply causation, but the narrative of bitcoin as gold 2.0 appears to be gaining steam in the capital markets.\n\nIf bitcoin shows increased correlation with other capital market assets in 2017, then 2016 may mark the beginning of convergence between the Street, the Valley, and Satoshi’s currency.\n\nMixed paint image via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

01/12/2017,"[""Bitcoin’s recent price plunge isn’t quite like late 2013 as many Bitcoin investors and traders assume.\n\nIn November of 2013, the price trend of Bitcoin was nearly identical with the rally of Bitcoin in the final months of last year. On November 25, 2013, Bitcoin reached a price of $988 on most global Bitcoin exchanges, including Bitstamp.\n\nHowever, when China announced its first “ban” on Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin dropped 36 percent within 30 days, declining to $625.\n\n#bitcoin's current price volatility due to #PBOC is nothing like the November 2013 rise and fall. Orange line = then, Blue line = now. pic.twitter.com/IqtYZSiZE5 — Chris Burniske (@ARKblockchain) January 11, 2017\n\nAs Bitcoin struggled to retain momentum, its price dropped to the low $200’s within a year and remained stable at the $200 trading margin for nearly two years.\n\nThe difference between 2013 and 2017\n\nOne major difference between Bitcoin’s major price plunge in 2013 and the digital currency’s short-term decline earlier this year is that Bitcoin is successfully retaining momentum in the market, as seen above in the price chart provided by ARK Invest’s Blockchain lead Chris Burniske.\n\nIn 2013, the Chinese government and its central bank intended to issue a ban on Bitcoin, and it did, in an attempt to halt trading and usage of Bitcoin within the country. Evidently, the attempt failed, as China is still in control of over 50 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market.\n\nRegardless of the actual impact on the market of the ruling, investors and traders began to panic and sell Bitcoin, with a misunderstanding that the digital currency can be stopped or banned by the government. At this point, many users were not aware of the structure of Bitcoin and how it was designed to precisely combat government regulation and restriction.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin showed no signs of recovery and the price plummeted down to low $200’s.\n\nBitcoin is worth more today\n\nCurrently, skeptical investors and traders have disregarded the fact that Bitcoin is worth more today than it was a month ago. This morning, Bitcoin passed the $800 mark on Bitstamp, reaching $807.\n\nToday’s Bitcoin rally is tremendously different from 2013 in the sense that the Chinese government does not intend to ban the usage of Bitcoin nor operations of Bitcoin exchanges. The Chinese government has come to a realization that regulating the Bitcoin exchange market and working closely with Bitcoin exchanges will inevitably play into the advantage of the government as underground and over-the-counter OTC markets are significantly harder to regulate.\n\nMore importantly, a substantially larger population of Bitcoin users have developed awareness on government restrictions, as many users already see Bitcoin as a global store of value and safe haven asset which can be used to avoid economic uncertainty and financial instability.\n\nAt this point, buyers should hold onto their Bitcoins because the decline of Bitcoin is temporary. As the market recovers and the media begin to accurately portray the Bitcoin market in China, the value of Bitcoin will rise in the short-term."", 'There are a few good reasons to use bitcoin: It’s global, private and won’t bulk up your wallet. But there’s another more sinister perk. The currency will not be traceable when you collect it as ransom for a computer taken hostage from a community college in Southern California. A gang of hackers recently held Los Angeles Valley College’s data at bay and received $28,000 in bitcoin ransom in exchange for setting it free.\n\nLuckily, according to the Los Angeles Times, the school has an insurance policy for such unexpected eventualities.\n\n“It was the assessment of our outside cybersecurity experts that making a payment would offer an extremely high probability of restoring access to the affected systems, while failure to pay would virtually guarantee that data would be lost,” Chancellor Francisco C. Rodriguez revealed in a statement. “After payment was made, a ‘key’ was delivered to open access to our computer systems. The process to ‘unlock’ hundreds of thousands of files will be a lengthy one, but so far, the key has worked in every attempt that has been made.”\n\nAccording to Phil Lieberman, a cybersecurity expert quoted in the LA Times, “The attacks generally come out of Eastern Europe and cannot be stopped because the United States does not have pacts with the countries where the attacks are launched. The governments of countries that launch [these] are uncooperative, and, in fact, benefit from the criminal activity going on within their borders.”\n\nAlthough it surely provides small consolation, the college is not alone in enduring a high-tech shakedown. According to the Wall Street Journal, these virtual kidnappings have become so prevalent that companies are being advised to have people on staff who actually know how to acquire bitcoin — it is apparently the currency of choice among those who prefer kidnapping data from cyberspace over kidnapping people off of city streets.\n\nOn the upside, firms that pay up can keep invasions discreet and data private.\n\n“From what we are seeing,” security industry expert Katherine Keefe told the Journal, “it appears that many hackers are finding it easier to make money by holding companies to ransom for bitcoin than through selling personal data on the dark Web,” referring to untraceable Web sites hidden from most users.\n\nSo, vulnerable CEOs, keep your insurance paid up and your bitcoin surplus deep.', 'An early version of Lightning Network, a layer two Blockchain technology, is now available for testing on Bitcoin’s testnet. With so much expectation on this latest iteration to scale the underlying Blockchain technology one may ask how does it work in practical terms and will it be able to deliver?\n\nIn other words, when will Lightning strike?\n\nGo for a party\n\nThe easiest way to explain the principles behind Lightning is the working example below when we go for a drink in a bar.\n\nSo let’s go and party. We go for a drink in a bar and I hand over my Bitcoin Card. The barman as merchant uses to open a tab (transaction channel). The barman allocates say one BTC (so we are on for a good night) the network knows I have the net open balance funds to one BTC.\n\nAs the evening progresses, new drinks are added, essentially queuing the further transactions, and payment only happens when the final closing transaction is done.\n\nThe bar owner gets the spent one BTC balance immediately as the opening of the Tab creates an HTLC – Hash Time-Locked-Contract between the parties. Given the bar owner doesn’t know or trust me, payment is guaranteed.\n\nSeriously\n\nThe principle difference with Lightning is a bi-directional channel opened with the other party(s) where transactions can be queued, as opposed to propagating transactions to all Bitcoin nodes. The first transaction essentially opens the channel and the last one closes the channel committing it to the processing of the network, whether outgoing requests or incoming payments the ‘state’ is monitored, as the authenticated and encrypted transactions are made.\n\nAlpha version\n\nThere are many very clever people working on Lightning as version 0.1 alpha is revealed the community to develop out this promising scaling solution for Blockchain that will struggle for mainstream adoption without it, and will be essential for Ethereum Serenity to move to PoS (Casper).\n\nWith SegWit struggling to gain acceptance amongst the Bitcoin miners, initial signs are that Lightning will require a lot more support to gain mainstream adoption. The number is likely to increase when new versions are available for testing.\n\nSuffice to say that miners should be excited as although the current Bitcoin reward diminishes, and with Ether struggling for value, the volume increase and scaled throughput for processing should deliver more options for Ethereum miners but it is not yet clear the economic impact.\n\nInstant payments for value\n\nLightning has come a long way since the original whitepaper by Bitcoin tech evangelist’s messers Joe Poon and Tadge Dryja who were looking to improve the performance of Bitcoin given the limiting nature of block size.\n\nAs Andreas Antonopolous said in a recent speech: “Lightning is a very exciting development and has the potential to Stream Money” - introducing the concept of what I refer to as “Instant Payment for Value”.\n\nIs there any reason why people and entities cannot be paid in real time rather than the absurd system of 30 days invoices and salary; of course no, and technically could be done today, albeit middlemen and third party validators don’t allow it (or they wouldn’t have a role).\n\nEnd game for Visa\n\nLightning and the nature of real-time Instant Payment for Value will be an essential development for IoT where machines will generate quadrillions of transactions per second and rather than end up with a huge backlog given current throughput, transactions can be cleared immediately. A structural shift in commerce that will deliver huge benefits creating market liquidity, will transform retail and levels the playing field for smaller businesses to get paid. Signally the end game for Visa and Mastercard.\n\nLightning can layer on top of a Blockchain and unlock Bitcoins massive potential. My favorite is mini-micro payments using the eight decimals places available for people to trade tiny amounts of value, where on the current Bitcoin payment rails is uneconomic to do so.\n\nInstant confirmation relying on Bitcoins Net Open Balance principles (OTXU) and structural shift in commerce, eliminating the prevalent frictional model of debt, that enables third parties to make a fee for not doing much at all.\n\nThe other potential for Lightning and more work will be required will be to equalize the exchange of tokens as Altcoins between chains, also known as BlockTrading and ChainTrading.\n\nIn a sense, Lightning could diminish Bitcoins value, but with thousands of Altcoins coming into use with new Blockchains, new solutions are needed to bring Blockchains mainstream adoption.', 'The Internal Revenue Service has filed a John Doe summons in an attempt to acquire data from Coinbase, a digital assets exchange company. If successful, digital currency users who have been using Bitcoin and other alternative currencies to dodge paying taxes could be fined by the federal agency for evading taxes.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHowever, a Bitcoin user has filed a motion to block the summons and a hearing will be heard on January 19, 2017.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin, the crypto currency that many are interested in but few understand, hit $1,153.02 on January 4, nearing its all-time high of $1,165.89, which it reached on November 30, 2013.\n\nSince January 4, the currency has plunged roughly 40 percent according to CoinDesk. The recent volatility has sparked a renewed interest in Bitcoin and its future.\n\nIn a nutshell, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency with finite limits. Bitcoin users set up a wallet that gives them a unique address, similar to an email, allowing them to exchange Bitcoins with people around the world. Every transaction since the very beginning is recorded on an unforgeable ledger, known as the blockchain.\n\nIt is a revolutionary technology in the currency world, and some believe what we are seeing today is only a fraction of its potential.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n“There’s a Marketplace because people believe the technology of Bitcoin has just begun,” Nick Spanos, founder of the Bitcoin Center NYC, said. “It’s like we just invented the wheel and soon we’re going to have the train, the motor car, the airplane - were going to have all these things come about through Bitcoin and the block chain.”\n\nSomething that makes Bitcoin unique is that unlike the U.S. dollars, which can be printed whenever the government sees fit, a centralized government does not control it.\n\n""With Bitcoin, it\'s kind of controlled by the people,"" Charlie Lee, director of engineering at Coinbase and creator of Litecoin, said. ""So, it\'s what they call a decentralized currency - it\'s because people are running the software that controls Bitcoin.""\n\nYet despite its recent upward momentum, not everyone is convinced about Bitcoin’s value. Investors especially have been hesitant to buy into the new currency.\n\n""With Bitcoin, I appreciate that the trend has been higher,"" Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said. ""That value could\'ve gone up as much as you know, who knows how many thousands percent in 2013, only to crash back down in 2014 and 2015. That\'s not what you want your paychecks to be doing or your investments.""\n\nEver since its creation in 2008, the cryptocurrency has been characterized by volatility, causing potential users or investors to think twice. A top concern: how do you determine its worth?\n\n""It\'s really hard to define it - almost a speculative commodity. For something like oil and for something like gold you can at least figure what the supply and demand picture looks like,” said Samana. “But with Bitcoin, just looking at it over the last few years, this thing is either the best store value since fiat paper currencies or it’s something that should be avoided at all costs based on just how it’s traded the last five years.""\n\nSo, the future of this innovative currency then relies on defining its “intrinsic value.”\n\n""Bitcoin\'s genius is not the ability to be untraceable, it\'s the ability to be un-censorable - that\'s the value it provides,"" said Lee. ""The value is being able to send money that cannot be blocked.""\n\nWhen donations to the site WikiLeaks were blocked by services such as MasterCard, VISA, and PayPal in 2010, the site nearly folded until it opened funding portals to digital currencies like Bitcoin and litecoin.\n\nCyber security hacks, like the incident in August of 2016 where $60 million worth of Bitcoin was stolen from Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin exchanges, have also raised red flags for investors.\n\nDespite its volatility and inherent cyber security risks, it appears people are slowly beginning to understand Bitcoin’s value. The Winklevoss twins have filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF, and if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bitcoin could see explosive growth.\n\nThe currency has also seen a dramatic increase in places that are experiencing economic turmoil. In November 2016, when India’s government decided to ban large currency bills, the weekly volume of Bitcoin trading in the country nearly doubled the following month, according to a report by Quartz media.\n\nBitcoin has grown into a service that is used by more than 100,000 merchants, according to a 2015 survey by BitPay. Some believe the technology could help shape the future of the global banking industry.\n\nBut for now, Samana says Bitcoin is still a risky proposition.\n\n“For most of our clients, and just other investors in general, I think a lot of these thing will have a positive from the standpoint of consumption and how they store and use their net worth and income. But people really shouldn’t view it as an investment.”', 'The digital currency bitcoin began 2017 with a bang, soaring to its highest level in more than three years to reach $1,150 — a record high.\n\nSince then, its price has fallen more than 30 percent as nervous Chinese authorities put local bitcoin exchanges on notice that more regulations may be coming.\n\nTo Dan Morehead — a former head of macro trading at Tiger Management who today runs his own San Francisco-based investment firm — such zigs and zags are hardly a surprise. His firm, Pantera Capital, has been exclusively focused on bitcoin and other digital currencies since 2011, and he argues that its price is “actually very predictable.” We talked with him late last week to learn more.\n\nTC: Bitcoin has been going bananas lately. Why?\n\nDM: With the exception of a bubble in 2013, the price is actually very predictable and has been rising along with the actual use of bitcoin. It was [trending up] slowly for a while because Ethereum [an open source public blockchain-based distributed computing platform] was supposed to be taking over — bitcoin was facing questions over its governance structure — but then Ethereum faded and bitcoin surged back.\n\nThat it reached another digit — into a thousand dollars — has gotten people excited, but its price has been grinding up for two years.\n\nTC: How many bitcoins are currently in circulation?\n\nDM: There are 16.09 million bitcoins now, with a roughly $14.4 billion market cap. In a hundred years, there will be 21 million bitcoins. So more than two-thirds of bitcoins have already been issued.\n\nEarly on, 50 bitcoins were issued every 10 minutes, then it was 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes, now it’s 12.5 and in another four years it’ll go to 6.25. So as their value is appreciating, the number of bitcoins that are being issued is being cut in half. The total value is going up fast as a result.\n\nTC: Where do those 16 million bitcoins mostly reside?\n\nDM: There’s no solid data on this, but anecdotally, it’s extremely popular in China because a lot of the transaction processors — or bitcoin miners — are there as chip manufacturing is there and electricity is inexpensive because of big hydro plants. Also, with Chinese currency devaluing and speculation that the country’s banking system is suspect or bankrupt, it’s a great way for citizens to store their wealth; some see it as a safer depository institution than their bank.\n\nTC: Why would anyone ever use the currency, versus merely hold it?\n\nDM: It’s definitely enticing for an investor to hold bitcoin, because they can buy more assets in the future. We have a fund where we’re investing in digital currency startups, but we have another where we invest in the currency and just hold it because we think it’ll be more valuable in the future.\n\nTC: How much bitcoin has that second fund amassed?\n\nDM: It’s $100 million in value at this point. We launched it when [the currency was valued at] $65.\n\nBut a lot of people are using it for real commerce, including to send money across borders. You and I have talked in the past about Bitpesa, a really cool company in Africa that helps people send money across borders using bitcoin [and is a Pantera portfolio company].\n\nIn almost every country, you can make a domestic payment pretty much for free and in real time, but any time you cross a border, even from the U.S. to the U.K., it takes several days and you have to pay some large yet non-transparent fee for converting that currency. So bitcoin has been very useful at helping people send money, whether it’s remittances or transfers by big multinationals.\n\nIf I download the software and my friend in Japan downloads it, I can send money instantaneously and free. Most immigrants aren’t going to that, but venture-backed companies are managing the process for them, then charging them a third or a quarter of what Western Union has been charging.\n\nTC: What other companies have you funded recently that excite you?\n\nDM: We raised a first fund, in 2013, that invested in the infrastructure company Xapo and [in the bitcoin marketplace] Bitstamp. We’re closing our second fund soon and one of our newest bets there is Brave, whose browser is faster than Chrome or Safari and much more private, but also uses bitcoin to do micropayments, so you can avoid ads — or you can be paid to view ads. Another newer bet is Abra, which is offering cross-border money movement as a service, rather than taking custody of any money, as does Bitpesa.\n\nTC: How big is this new fund, and do you have the same limited partners as in your first fund of this kind, which attracted funding from Benchmark, Ribbit Capital and Fortress Investment Group?\n\nDM: It’s $25 million, and no, it’s a different set of LPs — more standard institutional investors.\n\nTC: Is that because some lost their appetite for bitcoin? You certainly hear Silicon Valley investors talk about it a lot less than was the case a few years ago, even with this run-up.\n\nDM: You’re right that in late 2013, everybody was talking about bitcoin, then in 2014 and 2015, a lot of venture investment went in. Now, I think we’re in this period where most venture firms have made one if not several bets in the space, and most of the first wave of use cases already feature some pretty dominant leaders. It would be hard to launch a new exchange or a new custodian. Right now, it’s essentially just proving out those use cases, with more activity coming from corporates — big banks, mainly, but also Visa and MasterCard. They’re driving marginal investment in blockchain companies for financial but also strategic reasons. They’re trying to figure out how blockchain will change their businesses in the future.\n\nTC: What’s the biggest hurdle in bitcoin’s more widespread adoption right now?\n\nDM: The biggest hurdle used to be regulatory risk three or four years ago. There was a chance that the G7 would outlaw bitcoin. But mostly countries have been progressive or at worst, neutral.\n\nThe last big frictional point is banking relationships. It’s still hard to get big nationally chartered banks to [service bitcoin startups and other users]; they’re always struggling to cobble together more regional solutions.\n\nBut banks are slow. Three or four years ago, it was very difficult to work with banks. Now, it’s a hassle. A few years from now, it won’t be an issue at all.', 'Jeffrey K Berns is a bitcoin user, Coinbase customer and a managing partner at multi-specialty law firm Berns Weiss LLP.\n\nIn this CoinDesk opinion piece, Berns explains why he chose to seek to intervene in the IRS\'s attempt to obtain from Coinbase the identities of, and information concerning, millions of US cryptocurrency users.\n\nOn 30th November, 2016, a federal court issued an order allowing the IRS to serve an unprecedented summons on Coinbase, Inc, a cryptocurrency exchange, seeking the identities of each of the company\'s millions of US customers and essentially every piece of information in the company\'s possession concerning those customers.\n\nAs a consumer protection and class action attorney (as well as a cryptocurrency and blockchain entrepreneur), I am deeply concerned about the potential impact that Coinbase\'s disclosure of this information could have on the burgeoning industry.\n\nI am also troubled by the IRS\'s motives in issuing this summons.\n\nWhile I don\'t want to bore you with the legal procedure that led to the issuance of the summons, the bottom line is that courts grant the IRS substantial leeway to issue a ""John Doe"" summons to a third-party to require it to identify its customers whom the IRS suspects of tax evasion.\n\nTypically, this has occurred when the IRS identifies a practice that has no legitimate purpose, such as improper tax shelters or offshore bank accounts.\n\nIn those cases, the IRS has the power to issue summonses to tax shelter promoters and financial institutions to identify likely tax evaders, as there is no other way for the IRS to obtain that information.\n\nIn contrast to those circumstances, cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin and ether) have clearly legitimate uses, such that there is no reason to suspect that an individual is engaging in tax avoidance behavior merely because they have chosen to buy or use cryptocurrency.\n\nIndeed, many major online retailers already accept bitcoin, such as Overstock.com, Dell and others.\n\nSpeaking up\n\nSo, how did I get here?\n\nThe IRS\'s characterization of all cryptocurrency users as potential tax evaders concerned me immediately when I first learned of the summons.\n\nAs I have been involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community since 2012, I knew that there was no reason to suspect that any meaningful portion of Coinbase\'s customers were transacting in cryptocurrency to avoid tax obligations.\n\nAs I investigated the matter further, I learned that not only was I correct, but that the IRS\'s actions were even more outrageous than I had originally thought.\n\nIncredibly, the IRS\'s petition to serve the summons seeking information for millions of Coinbase customers was based primarily on three instances of supposed tax evasion involving bitcoin.\n\nI was so appalled by the flimsy justification for the summons that I determined to investigate the matter further and, as a Coinbase customer, fight the IRS if and when the court granted its petition to serve the summons on Coinbase.\n\nWhy me?\n\nMy interests in pursuing this action are twofold.\n\nFirst, I am concerned about the privacy rights of all Coinbase customers, as the IRS is seeking an extraordinary amount of information. This unprecedented demand raises massive security issues concerning the cryptocurrency owned by the customers in view of the government\'s difficulty in protecting itself from hackers.\n\nSecond, I am very worried about the effect this summons could have on the continued expansion and development of blockchain technology in the US.\n\nGoogle co-founder Larry Page has said, ""Lots of companies don’t succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future.""\n\nTo the extent that it is taking steps to actively discourage the use of cryptocurrency by US citizens, I strongly believe that the US government is jeopardizing the country’s role in the global economy going forward.\n\nWhat\'s next\n\nCryptocurrency, and the blockchain technology that underlie it, have virtually unlimited potential to change the way that individuals and businesses transact with each other. I believe that this will happen in a way that will greatly benefit consumers through better privacy, reduced transaction costs, enhanced security and faster processing times.\n\nIn this way, my stance is about how the government should be fostering this technology, rather than fighting it.\n\nWhile the IRS is mounting a procedural challenge to prevent the court from considering the issues that I have raised, I pledge to do whatever is necessary to insure that the IRS must explain how it could possibly be entitled to the information that it seeks.\n\nThe federal government must not be allowed to trample on the rights of individuals and to stifle innovation due to an undisclosed political agenda.\n\nBoxing fist via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

While the peer-to-peer digital currency system processes more than 300,000 on-blockchain transactions per day and recently reached an $18 billion market cap for the first time, the path toward scaling this system to a global economy over the long-term is sometimes seen as unclear.\n\nAfter years of debate over Bitcoin’s effective transaction capacity limit, the plan for capacity increases that has gained the highest level of support from current Bitcoin Core contributors, bitcoin wallet providers and bitcoin miners was put forth by Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell in December of 2015.\n\nMaxwell’s plan includes a variety of changes to the protocol to improve the usefulness of various second-layer approaches to scaling Bitcoin, such as the lightning network. The most recent improvement released as part of this scaling roadmap is called Segregated Witness, and it includes an effective doubling of Bitcoin’s block-size limit.\n\nThere were a number of other proposals made for scaling Bitcoin over the years, and at least one developer, Mike Hearn, left the project entirely after his preferred solution was not implemented by the Bitcoin community. In a widely circulated blog post published roughly one year ago, Hearn claimed that the Bitcoin experiment had failed.\n\nIn the time since Hearn’s departure, which BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen referred to as a “whiny ragequit,” the bitcoin price has nearly doubled.\n\nBitcoin Price Rises Despite Network Congestion Concerns\n\nOne of the main reasons Hearn referred to Bitcoin as a failed experiment had to do with network congestion. The effective limit on the number of transactions that the Bitcoin network can process has not been raised, and blocks were effectively full with a backlog of pending transactions on more than one occasion this past year.\n\nSome in the Bitcoin community believed this network congestion would effectively block new people from entering the Bitcoin ecosystem or at least turn off new users via higher fees and longer payment confirmation times.\n\nIt’s likely true that at least a few potential new users decided not to use Bitcoin in 2016 because of the perceived issues associated with full blocks. The reason the bitcoin price continued to rise in 2016 despite this network congestion may have to do with the fact that those who are using bitcoin primarily as a store of value aren’t much affected by network congestion.\n\nAfter all, in order to use bitcoin as a store of value, users technically only need to complete two transactions, potentially years apart: one for buying the bitcoins and one for selling the bitcoins. Those who decide to take $1 million and put it into bitcoin are the ones who have the greatest effect on the price. Those who are simply transacting via the Bitcoin network as a payment rails will have a buy and sell order on both sides of their transactions, which therefore has a marginal effect on the overall price.\n\nThose Who Need Bitcoin Are Willing to Pay Higher Fees\n\nOutside of use for philosophical reasons, there still aren’t many use cases for Bitcoin. Having said that, the use cases that do exist usually involve situations where there is simply no other solution on the market. For these use cases, demand for Bitcoin tends to be inelastic. This isn’t to say there aren’t some transactional use cases of Bitcoin that are being priced out by higher fees.\n\nFor example, someone who has been victimized by a hacker by way of ransomware has no option other than Bitcoin to make that ransom payment. If the ransomware victim feels he or she has to make the ransom payment in order to regain access to their files, then they aren’t too concerned with what type of fee will need to be attached to their payment (within practical limits).\n\nThose who view bitcoin as a store of value also fall under this category as there is no competition with bitcoin in the “digital gold” market. Yes, alternative digital currencies exist, but they have roughly zero non-speculative use cases and they’re often viewed as nothing more than testnets for Bitcoin. For this reason, Bloq Economist Paul Sztorc refers to them as “testnet scams.” Anyone who wants to use an algorithmically controlled store of value will need to pay the necessary fees to gain access to the bitcoin tokens.\n\nBitcoin Still Needs to Scale for Payments\n\nAlthough clear, reliable Bitcoin user statistics can be difficult to analyze, there are indications that most people use bitcoin as a store of value. Having said that, it still makes sense to make improvements to make sure bitcoin also works well as a medium of exchange. Although bitcoin could do quite well as a store of value that is somewhat difficult to move around, a large amount of value can be added by helping the technology fulfill its original, overstated promise of free, instant and anonymous online transactions.\n\nThere is a variety of potential solutions in the works when it comes to fulfilling these key aspects of bitcoin as a digital bearer asset, and many of them were on display at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in October. The most helpful advancements may be the ones that are able to improve scalability and user privacy at the same time, such as lightning networks or TumbleBit.\n\nAdding new features to Bitcoin can be extremely difficult when it is supposed to be an apolitical, algorithmic store of value. For this reason, privacy and scalability improvements are rolled out in a backward-compatible manner in a process known as a soft fork.\n\nHard forks, or changes that are incompatible with Bitcoin’s current consensus rules, may also be possible, but some investors, such as Needham & Company, are concerned with the potential negative effects a split of the network into two separate assets could have on the perception of bitcoin as a digital gold.\n\nThis is an op-ed by Kyle Torpey.

Also, bitcoin price is right on the 61.8% Fib and 100 SMA dynamic support, which might be enough to keep losses in check. A larger dip could last until the 200 SMA which coincides with the long-term trend line.\n\nThe trend line and moving averages also span an area of interest from $650-750, which has held as resistance in the past and could hold as a floor moving forward. If so, bitcoin price could be back on track towards testing the swing high at the $1100 area and beyond.\n\nRSI is heading south to indicate that there’s still an amount of selling pressure left, likely just enough to trigger a test of the $650-700 area. Stochastic is also moving lower to indicate that sellers are in control for the time being. Both oscillators are approaching oversold regions, though, so bears might need to take a break at some point and let buyers take over.\n\nStill, a move below the trend line support could pave the way for a longer-term decline, possibly taking bitcoin price to the $500 major psychological support next. A lot of this hinges on how the Chinese government cracks down on bitcoin exchanges and clients, as tougher restrictions could lead more investors to wind down their long positions in the coming months.\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Instead of trading bitcoin through a central intermediary as a typical exchange would, Bitsquare users connect through a peer-to-peer protocol and exchange money directly. To keep everyone honest, traders put up security deposits, while an arbitration system serves as a fallback.\n\nThe open-source project led by Manfred Karrer recently ran into a setback, however, as the team tried to register the Bitsquare trademark. Payment processor Square contends that the name Bitsquare is too close to their registered trademark and opposes the registration.\n\nRather than fighting to keep the name Bitsquare, the team behind the decentralized exchange decided it will pick a new name.\n\n“We would have preferred to keep using the name Bitsquare, but we sought professional legal advice from two independent lawyers, and it appears the odds are stacked against us. Given that fact, we’ll focus our limited resources on improving the platform, rather than on a lengthy and expensive legal process,” Karrer told Bitcoin Magazine. “We’ll pick a new name.”\n\nThe Bitsquare team is currently asking the community for input on a new name on the Bitsquare forum. Karrer will personally award the person who comes up with the winning name — to be decided by the Bitsquare team — with 0.5 bitcoin.\n\nDespite the slight setback, Bitsquare itself has been doing well, Karrer said. After a slow start in April of last year, volume on the decentralized exchange has increased organically over time. The number of successful trades on Bitsquare grows each month, with monero, the euro and the US dollar ranking as the most traded currencies. (All trades on Bitsquare happen against bitcoin.)\n\n“We saw the biggest increase of users in times where centralized solutions were conspicuously failing,” Karrer explained. “Most notably, the Bitfinex hack seemed to be a clear signal to many people that their funds are not safe on centralized exchanges. Similarly, we saw an uptick around the The DAO debacle and the subsequent Ethereum hard fork, where centralized exchanges attempted to impose what the real Ethereum chain was on their users.”\n\nThough, as Karrer noted, Bitsquare itself is still a work in progress as well. Volume on the decentralized exchange is still low compared to alternatives. And while rare, there have been some failed trades where arbitrators had to step in to reimburse funds, especially in the volatile altcoin markets. Future versions of Bitsquare will therefore include a more flexible deposit system, while the software will also be extended with APIs that can be linked, for example, to Bitcoin ATMs. For added security, integration with the Trezor hardware wallet is also in the works.\n\nAs an even more ambitious step in the development process, Karrer plans to turn Bitsquare into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) later this year. It is a tainted term since the Ethereum debacle carrying the same name, Karrer acknowledged, but he believes it to be a crucial step to ensure long-term sustainability of the project.\n\n“Much like Bitcoin itself, it is important that Bitsquare has no single point of failure. Of course, the code is already open source, and the protocol peer-to-peer, but ideally management of the project would further decentralize over time as well,” he said.\n\nFor now, however, Bitsquare first needs a new name.']"
01/13/2017,"['Chris Burniske is blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive innovation and co-author of the new white paper, ""Bitcoin, a New Asset Class"".\n\nIn this CoinDesk opinion piece, Burniske pushes back on the mainstream media, arguing that the idea bitcoin is merely repeating the infamy of 2013 is misinformed.\n\nA common but mistaken refrain is building that bitcoin\'s behavior of late has been a replica of the infamous late 2013 rise and crash.\n\nCertainly, a similar narrative could be spun: bitcoin breaks $1,000, the People\'s Bank of China issues some comments that scare people, bitcoin crashes. But if a few marketplace characteristics are investigated, I think the difference in bitcoin\'s maturity between then and now becomes clear.\n\nOn 5th December, 2013, a short while after bitcoin broke $1,000, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) sent out a statement claiming bitcoin was ""not a currency in the real meaning of the word"". The PBOC went on to restrict financial institutions from getting further involved with the technology.\n\nLast week, on 6th January, 2017, a short while after bitcoin broke $1,000 for the second time in its eight-year life, the PBOC sent out new statements indicating that its representatives had met with major China-based bitcoin exchanges to reinforce the importance of remaining compliant with ""relevant laws and regulations.""\n\nThe tenor of the statements was markedly different, but let’s focus on the numbers.\n\nThen and now\n\nFollowing both announcements, bitcoin quickly fell below $1,000, which is what has led to the false proclamation that bitcoin hasn’t changed a bit since 2013.\n\nI believe such a proclamation is born of ignorance around the specific market dynamics.\n\nAs shown below, the daily percent changes in bitcoin\'s price both leading up to the PBOC announcement, and after the announcement, have not been nearly as severe as they were in 2013.\n\nOn the X-axis of the graph is a metric called, \'Days Removed from People’s Bank of China Announcement\'. In other words, the zero point for 2013 is 5th December, while for 2017 it\'s 6th January: those are the days when the PBOC announcements went public.\n\n""-60"" is sixty days before the PBOC announcement, in each respective year.\n\nTaking the standard deviation of these daily percent price changes yields one of the most common metrics for volatility, as shown below.\n\nIn 2013, the volatility in the 60 days leading up to the PBOC announcement was more than 3x the volatility preceding the PBOC announcement in 2017.\n\nThe volatility in the week after was twice as great in 2013, as well.\n\nSome context\n\nIt appears, however, that some bitcoin investors are suffering PTSD. After all, the 2013 announcement precipitated a long slide in bitcoin’s price through 2014, bottoming in January 2015.\n\nSuch fear may explain why volatility on a relative basis jumped more after the recent announcement than it did in 2013. In other words, in 2013 the volatility roughly doubled after the PBOC announcement, while this year it has roughly tripled.\n\nThat said, volatility after the PBOC announcement this time around is still less than the volatility before the PBOC announcement in 2013.\n\nCritics have come out of the woodwork recently, many once again proclaiming bitcoin is too volatile for most portfolios.\n\nHowever, if an investor has held Twitter, LinkedIn, Workday, Netflix, GoPro, Tableau and many more high-flying tech names over the last few years, then they have endured single day drops greater than bitcoin has experienced over the last week.\n\nA new asset class\n\nI think bitcoin\'s subdued volatility in the face of fears over China is a sign of its maturing markets.\n\nFor instance, liquidity has improved considerably, with global trading volumes roughly 30x greater than they were in late 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, it appears a more informed base of investors now has the conviction to hold through the whims of nation-states, picking up the slack from weak hands.\n\nYet, at the moment, bitcoin may not be stable enough to be a currency.\n\nIts price swings are still great enough that they could cause havoc if bitcoin was a broadly used unit of account (and they do wreak havoc on other cryptocurrencies, where bitcoin is often used as the unit of account).\n\nFurthermore, changes in bitcoin’s price make it harder to use bitcoin as a means of exchange, because significant exchange rate risk can arise.\n\nBut, if bitcoin is a new asset class — as I\'ve put forth in paper authored with Coinbase — then it doesn’t need to behave like other assets we already know in order to gain mainstream adoption.\n\nI think it just needs to mature, and signs are that it’s doing just that.\n\nOld phone, new phone image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

(Photo by Jamie Holladay-Collins/LAVC)\n\nThe cyberattack struck Los Angeles Valley College late last month, disrupting email, voice mail and computer systems at the public community college in Southern California. Then, school officials found a ransom note.\n\nThe missive advised the college that its electronic files had been encrypted and that the files could only be unlocked with a “private key.” The attackers would supply the key after receiving payment in the valuable digital currency known as bitcoin, which can be used anonymously without a centralized bank.\n\n[Why bitcoin just had an amazing year]\n\n“You have just 7 days to send us the BitCoin after 7 days we will remove your private keys and it’s impossible to recover your files,” the attackers warned, according to a copy of the note obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nLeaders of the Los Angeles Community College District decided to pay the ransom.\n\n“In consultation with district and college leadership, outside cybersecurity experts and law enforcement, a payment of $28,000 was made by the District,” Francisco C. Rodriguez, the district’s chancellor, said in a statement on Jan. 6. “It was the assessment of our outside cybersecurity experts that making a payment would offer an extremely high probability of restoring access to the affected systems, while failure to pay would virtually guarantee that data would be lost.”\n\nDistrict officials report that the payment yielded the desired information. Email and other information systems were back in working order as Los Angeles authorities investigated what officials believe was a randomly targeted attack. As of Thursday evening, IT experts were still working to unlock some of the college’s files.\n\n\n\nExcerpt from a ransom note obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nClasses were proceeding normally, on campus and online, officials said. Students returned from winter break on Jan. 3, as scheduled, days after the attack was detected on Dec. 30.\n\nThe incident at the 19,000-student community college provides another cautionary tale of the vulnerability of higher education to malicious hackers. Like businesses, colleges and universities are in a continual quest to stay a step ahead of attackers who threaten in numerous ways to breach or disrupt critical databases and networks.\n\nThe Privacy Rights Clearinghouse counts 19 educational institutions that disclosed data-security breaches in 2016, including hacking episodes at the University of Virginia, the University of Central Florida, the University of Connecticut and Michigan State University.\n\n[‘Phishing’ hack at U-Va. compromises employee computer records]\n\nNow colleges and other institutions face the rising threat of ransom seekers. The term “ransomware” has been coined to describe software that can infiltrate a computer and block access to files when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious download link in an email or a pop-up window.\n\nHollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Southern California acknowledged paying a $17,000 ransom last year to regain control of its systems after an attack.\n\n“Ransomware has rapidly risen, from my perspective, to be one of the foremost threats we’re facing in information technology, anywhere, let alone in higher ed,” said Joseph Moreau, vice chancellor of technology at Foothill-De Anza Community College District in Silicon Valley.\n\nMoreau, who serves on the board of directors of Educause, a nonprofit group focused on information technology in higher education, said he found the latest Los Angeles incident “frightening.” Word of the attack spread quickly through California’s large community college system, he said.\n\n“It was big news, for sure,” he said. Staying ahead of hackers is difficult, he said, especially if they are able to steal the user names and passwords of students or staff. “We’re constantly plugging new holes,” Moreau said.\n\n\n\nExcerpt from a ransom note obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nMoreau said his district, like its counterpart in Los Angeles, is insured against losses due to cyberattacks. Los Angeles district officials noted that their insurance policy was activated after the recent attack.\n\n“While much time will pass before this matter is resolved, we have already availed ourselves of the resources provided by the policy, including assistance of cybersecurity experts,” district officials said in a statement.', 'Local advertisements for OneCoin and other digital currency investments have drawn the ire of Nigeria’s top securities regulatory.\n\nIn a statement published yesterday by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulator warned that potential investors should ""exercise extreme caution"" in light of radio advertisements and other sales pitches made for OneCoin, bitcoin and types of digital currencies.\n\nThe agency said in a statement:\n\n""The Commission wishes to alert the public that none of the persons, companies or entities promoting cryptocurrencies has been recognized or authorized by it or by other regulatory agencies in Nigeria to receive deposits from the public or to provide any investment or other financial services in or from Nigeria.""\n\nNigeria\'s SEC went on to state that in some cases, those promoting the aforementioned advertisement may be conducting wholly fraudulent enterprises.\n\n""The public should also be aware that any investment opportunities promoted by these persons, companies or entities are likely to be of a risky nature with a high risk of loss of money, whilst others may be outright fraudulent pyramid schemes,"" the statement read.\n\nThe timing is perhaps unsurprising, given recent developments.\n\nEarlier this month, the controversial Ponzi scheme system MMM announced that it would reopen its doors in Nigeria, telling prospective users that it would introduce bitcoin as a form of payment, according to a report from Quartz.\n\nOneCoin – which has widely accused of operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme and has been targeted by other regulatory warnings and investigations – also does business in Nigeria.\n\nNigerian authorities have previously called for improved regulation of digital currency in the country.\n\nIn mid-2015, Okwu Nnanna of the Central Bank of Nigeria advocated for the creation of new rules to prevent potential money laundering arising from use of the tech.\n\nNigeria image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In order to bring true mainstream sensibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem, accessibility of the cryptocurrency has to be simplified, especially for the unbanked.\n\nReady for the future\n\nAccording to Ray Youssef, CEO of Paxful, the present complexity of acquiring and using Bitcoin by the average person needs to be eliminated. He says this can be achieved by employing a feedback mechanism that interacts with real people in the form of a useable application built on a peer-to-peer marketplace for money.\n\nHe continues by noting that it may seem like a given that things should be easy but this has yet to be attempted for the acquisition of Bitcoin by the unbanked. A situation which he describes as absolutely necessary in order to get Bitcoin into the mainstream.\n\nYoussef tells Cointelegraph that his company is working on a foundation that will form the basis for numerous Fintech applications. He is certain:\n\n“In the future, the applications built on this foundation will be numerous and solve problems for many industries and perhaps even in the geopolitical area.”\n\nBitcoin - a beacon of hope\n\nFor Youssef, Bitcoin is all about having options and hope. “I see Bitcoin as a huge beacon of hope,” he says.\n\nHe also explains that his company has launched a program which rewards individuals that participate in creating awareness about the easy accessibility of the cryptocurrency.\n\n“Lottery is all about hope and while many have become a kind of tax on the people, this is quite different as you do not pay anything to partake you simply share among your network and help Bitcoin grow,” he concludes.\n\nA viable alternative\n\nTim Frost, the Founder of Taurus vision, sees Bitcoin as a viable alternative which offers new possibilities to the unbanked people across the globe. Frost identifies the cryptocurrency as an option for those who wish to escape their local currencies.\n\nFrost says:', 'President-elect Donald Trump has met bitcoin startup 21 Inc CEO Balaji S. Srinivasan, one of two contenders to lead the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe surprising announcement came unexpectedly to both technology and bitcoin communities, mostly because of his contributions to Silicon Valley and to the field of technology. However, as Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd noted, Srinivasan was previously involved in the medical industry, leading DNA screening startup Counsyl and obtaining a degree at the Stanford university’s department of developmental biology.\n\nSources reveal that Trump is likely to select either Srinivasan or former Goldman Sachs Asset Management chairman Jim O’Neil, mostly due to their expertise and experience in dealing with startups and businesses. In particular, Srinivasan’s background in pursuing the development of innovation in various industries complements Trump’s pro-business and anti-regulation approach.\n\nIt is highly likely that Srinivasan was elected as a contender to lead the FDA by recommendation of Peter Thiel, multi-billionaire supporter and now, adviser to Trump, who previously met with the President-elect to discuss FDA positions.\n\nSrinivasan’s Innovation-Centric Approach\n\nIn early 2016, Srinivasan openly criticized the FDA for their interference with innovative projects pursued by technology conglomerates such as Apple. He revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook prevented from launching health monitoring features of the Apple Watch because Cook believed the FDA would regulate the watch and transform it into a government-licensed health product.\n\nSrinivasan further condemned the FDA’s consistent efforts in limiting innovation in virtually every field the organization is permitted to oversee.\n\n“Why care about the FDA so much? Well, whether you want a new drug or to get to transhumanism they are the man to beat – or escape, via exit,” said Srinivasan.\n\nPolitico publication The Hill confirmed with Trump spokesman Sean Spicer that both Srinivasan and O’Neil are being considered for a position in the United States Agency for International Development. The publication also emphasized Thiel’s close ties with Srinivasan, noting that Thiel had previously donated to a bitcoin startup founded by Srinivasan.\n\nPotential Impact on Bitcoin\n\nApart from Srinivasan, Trump has established close connections with two pro-bitcoin individuals including Thiel and U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney.\n\nCCN previously reported that the Trump administration selected bitcoin supporter in Mick Mulvaney as U.S. Budget Director. With Mulvaney, Thiel and Srinivasan serving the Trump administration as advisors, it is likely to see some changes in the US government’s attitude towards bitcoin and the development of financial technologies.\n\nMulvaney made positive remarks on bitcoin as early as 2014, when the general population didn’t develop much awareness on bitcoin as a store of value or as a currency. Mulvaney stated:\n\n\n\n“Just wrapped up a Small Business Committee hearing on Bitcoin. I know it isn’t a mainstream issue yet — and may not become one — but it is extraordinarily interesting and something that could eventually influence the dollar and our monetary policy. In fact, one of the witnesses drew favorable comparisons between Bitcoin and Milton Friedman.”\n\nIt will be interesting to observe the roadmap the US government develops in the next few months and if bitcoin or other financial technologies are an essential part of it. It could also indirectly impact other controversial decisions or rulings, including the sentencing of Ross Ulbricht, who is serving life in prison for allegedly running Silk Road.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '“Mastering Bitcoin” author Andreas Antonopoulos was recently a guest on Trace Mayer’s Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast, where the two longtime Bitcoin advocates discussed the current state of Bitcoin and how much the technology has grown over the past eight years. Near the end of their discussion, Antonopoulos made the point that Bitcoin is stronger than ever and all of the drama in the community needs to be ignored.\n\nThe Technology Is the Most Important Thing in Bitcoin\n\nThere has been plenty of Bitcoin-related drama on social media lately, especially when it comes to issues involving scalability (and the block size limit). Some Bitcoin enthusiasts now prefer the /r/BTC subreddit due to disagreements with the moderation policies of /r/Bitcoin. There is a stark contrast between the two subreddits when it comes to each group’s vision for how Bitcoin should scale over the long-term.\n\nMany of the disagreements between the two sects of the Bitcoin community have turned ugly, and Antonopoulos believes it’s best to get back to the technology’s roots.\n\n“I think the most important thing is to try to objectively look at what’s really important in the Bitcoin space, which is the technology,” said Antonopoulos. “Try to not be discouraged by a lot of the extraneous drama that’s going on. In my mind, a lot of the drama is distracting from the real progress that’s being made.”\n\nAntonopoulos went on to point out that, by many metrics, Bitcoin is stronger than ever. In his view, Bitcoin has never been as diverse or distributed as it is today. The “Mastering Bitcoin” author is also impressed with the large amount of technological innovation that has taken place in the space.\n\nTo Antonopoulos’s point on innovation, there are a few enhancements to Bitcoin that are on the horizon. To many, TumbleBit, lightning networks, Segregated Witness, Mimblewimble and RSK are some of the most exciting technological advancements the Bitcoin community has seen up to this point.\n\nBitcoin also recently achieved an all-time high for confirmed transactions in a single day on January 5, and despite the recent drop, the bitcoin price has nearly doubled since early 2016.\n\nSome of the Drama Is Manufactured to Be Divisive\n\nWith such a large amount of drama going on in the Bitcoin community, Antonopoulos is convinced that at least some of it is coming from nefarious actors. “All too often people can get caught up in the drama, and I do believe that a certain percentage of that drama is manufactured to be divisive [and] distracting,” he said.\n\nAntonopoulos went on to note that every grassroots movement and disruptive organization in history has had infiltrators and provocateurs who are paid to cause turmoil. “It would be naive to assume that Bitcoin is the first one where that isn’t happening,” he added.\n\nWhile there is a lot of infighting among the core Bitcoin community, it’s unclear if most users are even aware of it. Many end users may be more concerned with whether or not the technology works. “There are billions of people that are still unbanked, and they don’t care about the petty squabbles of who insulted who and called the other person the wrong name,” said Antonopoulos.\n\nAntonopoulos’s advice to the Bitcoin community was simply to keep innovating on the technology if they want to see it succeed over the long-term.', ""Lightning Labs, one of the prominent companies working to realize the lightning network, announced this week the alpha release of the open-source lightning daemon they've been spearheading: LND. While only compatible with Bitcoin’s testnet so far, the software is relatively feature-complete and operational.\n\n“We’re now looking for the wider community to test the software,” Joseph Poon, Lightning Labs developer and co-author of the lightning network white paper, told Bitcoin Magazine. “To get it ready for widespread use, but also to explore new use cases this enables.”\n\nThe Lightning Network\n\nThe lightning network is a highly anticipated second-layer protocol to be rolled out on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Cleverly utilizing Bitcoin’s programmable elements (like multisignature and time-locks), lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions with instant confirmations and at low cost. This should boost Bitcoin’s micropayment-ability, overall scalability and even privacy.\n\nThe release of LND v0.1-alpha, written in the Go programming language, signifies that development of the protocol is on track. The implementation developed by Lightning Labs, but also BitFury and others, can open and close channels with counterparties to transact, route payments over the network, forward transactions from other users and more.\n\n“Things are progressing very well,” Poon acknowledged. “We now mainly need to finalize the specification, work on cross-compatibility with other implementations and improve various components like payment receipts and multi-hop payments. Additionally, we’ll focus on optimizing performance over the next couple of months.”\n\nThat said, the lightning daemon is not very user-friendly yet, as it’s mostly intended for developers and experimentation. It doesn’t include a user interface — though that will soon change, the team noted — and is so far only compatible with Bitcoin’s testnet.\n\nLightning Labs will also publish a walk-through post soon, and open a channel faucet for anyone to get their hands on some testnet coins in lightning channels.\n\nTimeframe\n\nThe big question, of course, is when everyday users will be able to send and receive lightning transactions on Bitcoin’s main net.\n\nEarlier estimates suggested that the lightning network could be operational this winter, which from a technical perspective doesn’t seem far off now. Different lightning teams met in Milan after the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in October of 2016, where they agreed on shared specifications now known as “BOLT.” At least two other companies, Blockchain (Thunder) and Blockstream (Lightningd), have released early iterations of lightning software as well, while ACINQ, Amiko Pay and MIT’s DCI are also working on implementations.\n\nWith the exception of Thunder, most lightning software cannot yet be used on Bitcoin’s main net, however, as it is built with Segregated Witness in mind. The soft fork protocol change proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team requires 95 percent hash power support from miners to activate — but has so far remained stagnant around 25 or 30 percent.\n\nWhile Segregated Witness is not strictly necessary for the lightning network to work, Lightning Labs pointed out it would significantly benefit the protocol.\n\n“It would allow users to outsource channel monitoring, which means they won’t have to constantly keep an eye on the Bitcoin blockchain. Meanwhile channels could be kept open longer and closed quicker. It would offer a better user experience overall,” Lightning Labs developer Laolu Osuntokun said.\n\nLightning Labs Co-Founder Elizabeth Stark added: “One of the reasons why we wanted to put our software release and blog out there is to show how much better all of this could work with Segregated Witness activated.”\n\nIf the Segregated Witness soft fork does activate, the LND alpha software could immediately be tested on Bitcoin’s main net. Though for security reasons, as the team pointed out, preferably only with tiny amounts at first."", 'On January 17 and 18, 2017, in downtown Miami, a worldwide audience of innovators, enthusiasts, developers and thought leaders will gather for the fourth annual North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC). Amid burgeoning interest in new frontiers of Bitcoin and blockchain innovation, this year’s conference promises to offer new insights into the future trajectory of these technologies.\n\nThe conference features a series of educational offerings and exhibits highlighting emerging ideas and trends in the field. Guest speakers at this year’s event include Intellisys CTO and Bitcoin evangelist Charlie Shrem, Veritaseum founder Reggie Middleton, Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, OpenBazaar founder Brian Hoffman, Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine, Bitfury founder Valery Vavilov and many more. Exhibitors include the likes of Unsung, Genesis Mining and the Blockchain Education Network.\n\nOn the eve of this year’s conference, we had a chance to talk with conference organizer Moe Levin about the history of TNABC, hot topics of interest and his biggest hopes for the 2017 event. Here’s what he had to say.\n\nThe Beginnings of TNABC\n\n“TNABC began in 2012, drawing 100 delegates. In 2014, the event welcomed more than 2,000 visitors from 40 nations, while 2015 and 2016 boasted over 6,000 visitors from 120 nations. I attribute this growth to our efforts at meticulously selecting speakers who share with our attendees the strategies, technologies and innovations they’ve developed and mastered.\n\n“The North American Bitcoin Conference was created to draw [the] community together — a group ranging from enthusiasts to financial institutions that provide an open and hard-hitting forum for moving the conversation forward. Having been a part of the Bitcoin universe for several years, I’m truly excited about where these developments are going to take us in the coming years.”\n\nAnticipated Topics of Interest\n\n“This conference intends to cut through the noise in order to focus on actionable innovations and technologies that attendees can apply right away. We want guests to discuss strategies they’ve developed and mastered, and share them with others so that we can all apply and build upon them. With this in mind, we hope guests come ready to tackle complex concerns we face today, [and] leave armed with solutions that harness the power of blockchain technology.\n\n“The first [topic] is obviously the huge price increase and Chinese demand. This in itself will mean that the conference will be crowded and electric.\n\n“Bitcoin’s recent price surge has invigorated investors and entrepreneurs in the industry. Post-election, we’ve seen bitcoin prices steadily rise and more and more people become interested in alternative currencies as not only a viable but potentially necessary investment. All of this, I’m sure, will fuel some very interesting discussions around just what role bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will play in the future landscape of banking and fintech.\n\n“The second topic is the block-size debate, and how it will be resolved. There’s been a lot of discussion in the past, and not a lot of movement. I’m hoping this conference will be able to move the conversation further.\n\n“Right now is a critical moment for Bitcoin as it is entering a crucial phase in its development and adoption. In the past few months it has seen a dramatic increase in visibility, experiencing both the good and bad sides of the limelight — like rising interest among corporations and investors, alongside more regulatory scrutiny, and uncertainty. More than ever before, we need the global community to help us ensure a prosperous and well-balanced future for the technology.”\n\nTNABC and the Future of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology\n\n“Bitcoin and Bitcoin technology is fast emerging as a key area of innovation, and is generating huge interest in the world today. In recent times, government entities and financial market regulatory bodies have come forward to express their keen desire to adopt this sophisticated technology to enhance the efficiency of their transactions. Not surprisingly, today the world is witnessing significant increase in digital transactions. While most easily identified with virtual currency, the software underlying bitcoin has demonstrated a range of business applications beyond finances, offering immense potential in several other areas for a variety of sectors and industries.\n\n“The North American Bitcoin Conference offers a unique opportunity to explore these trends and understand the impact of this technology in various areas as well as look at its regulatory aspects. We also offer a broad platform to work together on possibilities of developing new relationships to encourage further innovation in this technology.\n\n“Those who are not well schooled in bitcoin and its underlying technology are not alone. Most executives in fact don’t understand the repercussions of this new disruptive tech. The North American Bitcoin Conference [helps] to get up to speed on the applications, ramifications and nuances of Bitcoin and the blockchain, allowing one to profit from this new technology.”', ""If the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic wasn’t definitive before, it is now.\n\nEthereum Classic, the project born out of rejection of Ethereum’s reversal of The DAO, hard forked today. With that, Ethereum Classic has implemented the biggest protocol change yet, and further differentiated itself from the Ethereum project.\n\nMost importantly, the hard fork — dubbed “Die Hard” — diffused the difficulty bomb, which was set to freeze the protocol later this year. Additionally, Ethereum Classic implemented replay protection, to ensure Ethereum transactions are no longer valid on the Ethereum Classic chain and vice versa. It also adjusted technical parameters to increase the cost of certain spam attacks.\n\n“This protocol upgrade demonstrated growing maturity of Ethereum Classic, as it's starting to blaze its own path not only in terms of ideology, but also technical choices,” Ethereum Classic’s project coordinator, “Arvicco” told Bitcoin Magazine. “Such as a commitment to staying on proof-of-work consensus for a prolonged period.”\n\nThe Difficulty Bomb\n\nThe original Ethereum protocol, as implemented by the Ethereum Foundation, included a so-called “difficulty bomb.” Baked into the software, Ethereum’s mining difficulty is programmed to increase exponentially over time. This has been unnoticeable up till now, but by around April or May of this year, it is set to increase so rapidly that mining will necessarily become unprofitable. As a result, no more blocks will be found at all, and the protocol will effectively freeze, creating an “Ice Age.”\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation implemented this difficulty bomb to force its own hand — and that of the broader Ethereum community. As outlined in its release documents, the Ethereum Foundation planned to roll out the Ethereum project in several stages, each one requiring a hard fork. The difficulty bomb was implemented to ensure that developers and the community would have to switch to a new protocol this year; eventually working toward a proof-of-stake mining algorithm known as “Casper.”\n\nAs a continuation of the original Ethereum protocol, Ethereum Classic also included that difficulty bomb. The Ethereum Classic community, however, has decided it will not follow the Ethereum Foundation road map, most notably regarding Casper. As such, there is little need for Ethereum Classic to keep the difficulty bomb, and it was removed with the Die Hard hard fork.\n\nThis gives the project more time to work on further protocol development, Arvicco said.\n\n“Now that the most critical technical issues such as difficulty bomb and replay protection are resolved, ETC dev team will start focusing more on longer-term changes, such as monetary policy and improved platform stability and security.”\n\nThe Split\n\nWith every hard fork, there exists a risk of not everyone switching to the new protocol, in effect creating two different networks and currencies. This is how the Ethereum Classic project itself started, of course, and could happen again.\n\nSo far, however, Die Hard seems to have gone through with few holdouts. While it is too early to tell with full certainty whether the ecosystem has fully switched to the new protocol, there didn’t appear to be much opposition beforehand. A vast majority of hash power has also made the switch — though at time of writing a small number of miners hadn’t yet.\n\n“Even though we campaigned for two weeks for everyone to upgrade, about 0.5 percent of hash power kept mining on the old chain for a while,” Arvicco said. “That was to be expected, though; with our last fork in October that was about 3 to 5 percent. So, there is progress.”\n\nAnd the odds of these holdouts bootstrapping their own currency seems unlikely, Arvicco believes.\n\n“Not unless there is a community ready to support it both in terms of participation and real money. And the prospects of such community is not good with the bomb blowing up pretty soon.”"", 'A few weeks ago, LogRhythm which helps companies guard against cyber attacks and threats has released its seven predictions for 2017. According to them, this year, the Internet will be shut down for up to 24 hours.\n\nJames Carder, LogRhythm´s Chief Information security officer and Vice President said:\n\n“We saw the massive DDoS attack against DynDNS just a few months ago, which resulted in sites like Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon being unavailable for a few hours. We saw a similar DDoS hit Brian Krebs before the attack against Dyn.”\n\nCarder is certain that these were just tests, and we are going to see a rise in attacks on fundamental protocols of Internet communications. The security expert said:\n\n“If you can prove that you can take down massive sites and a large chunk of the United States Internet for a few hours, a 24-hour outage seems pretty easy to do.”\n\nWhat exactly could the implications be for such a series of attacks?\n\nNowadays, technology is essential for economic development. A 2015 Internet Association report found that the web generates around $966 bln in the United States alone, which is equivalent to about six percent of the entire country’s economy.\n\nThe multifaceted effect of the Internet on financial markets cannot be denied. It significantly facilitates information flows and interaction among economic agents. It facilitates more direct access to financial markets by various economic agents. Finally, as it is a truly global network it allows operating across national borders. Simply put, without it, businesses are not able to engage in e-commerce and provide digital services and products.\n\nNow that the world is dependent on the Internet, economies and financial markets are bound by its sustainability to threats and attacks. Pushed past the breakpoint, all systems risk collapse.\n\nIf the Internet goes down, financial markets will tank\n\nIn 2011 we have seen Egyptian authorities shutting down the entire Internet for five days for the reasons of national security. The damage caused by such initiative was dramatic. According to estimations made by the OECD, the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, this decision cost Egypt $90 mln. If the connectivity was cut for a year, it would have reduced country’s GDP by three to four percent. According to research by the Center for Technology innovation at Brookings, Internet shutdowns between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016, cost at least $2.4 bln in GDP globally.\n\nIs Bitcoin under threat?\n\nBut what about Bitcoin which basically exists within the Internet space? Is it even possible for some sharp criminal minds to shut down Bitcoin cutting its main artery - the Internet?\n\nBitcoin is getting more widely used for transacting between Internet users, and we see businesses starting accepting payments with Bitcoins. Connectivity shutdowns undoubtedly cause damage to the system. However, experts believe that Bitcoin will keep demonstrating a high resistance to attacks. David Li from Onchain says:\n\n“The root of DDoS is inseparable from the character of ""single point of failure"" in centralized systems, which allows attackers to take down the entire system by launching attacks on a single point. We believe that distributed ledger will become the basic architecture of future financial IT systems. Bitcoin per se is excellent in DDoS-resistance, although the current fixed 1 MB block size is choking the network. We consider the debate on block size to be a comprehensive issue of politics, economics and technologies. We hope the community can come to a consensus in 2017.”\n\nSMS and broadcasting\n\nObviously, without Internet access, the possibility to send and receive Bitcoins is significantly limited. In more general terms, Internet shutdowns weaken innovation and undermine users’ confidence in the future of digital currency.\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation around the topic with community members trying to imagine what would happen with Bitcoin if the entire Internet shuts down. Apparently, transactions with Bitcoin could still be possible even with no Internet connection. Some companies such as 37Coins suggest sending Bitcoin through the use of a third party SMS wallet provider. There is also a Finnish project called Kryptoradio which is researching possibilities of broadcasting Blockchain data over DVB-T.\n\nSo far, the Bitcoin community has proven to be extremely creative and open-minded. This makes all of us feel reassured- if the Internet shuts down, we will just take a deep breath and start sending and receiving Bitcoins through radio frequencies or through Morse code.']"
01/14/2017,"[""Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 7th through 13th January.\n\nBitcoin prices experienced significant volatility for much of this week, calming down during the last few sessions.\n\nAmid these fluctuations, the digital currency’s price rose to as much as $942.06 on 8th January and declined to $752.11 on 11th January before trading between reasonably tight ranges for most of the week’s remainder, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nMarket analysts cited ongoing Chinese regulatory developments – and the resulting suspense they have been creating for market observers – as driving this week’s bitcoin price movements.\n\nRik Willard, founder and managing director of Agentic Group LLC, framed the situation thus:\n\n“Right now, China is calling the shots in bitcoin. When they sneeze, the market catches a cold.”\n\nAt least for now, the uncertainty surrounding Chinese regulation has once more taken center stage in the world of bitcoin trading.\n\nDriving volatility\n\nThese ongoing regulatory developments were first credited with provoking notable uncertainty and significant price volatility in bitcoin.\n\nIn recent weeks, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has held meetings with representatives of bitcoin exchanges Huobi, BTCC and OKCoin, announcing 6th January that it had provided these exchanges with warnings.\n\nBitcoin prices suffered consequent volatility, falling more than 10% on the day of the announcement. The suspense created by the news continued to fuel intense price fluctuations, as bitcoin surged above $940 on 8th January before plunging to as little as $878.10 the following session.\n\nOn 11th January, bitcoin prices dropped to $752.11 – their lowest since 2nd December and a more than 40% drop from the recent high of $1,153.02 reached on 5th January, BPI figures reveal.\n\nWhen explaining this decline, some analysts stated that the Chinese government’s efforts to more closely monitor the nation’s bitcoin industry were creating significant anxiety for traders.\n\nA new calm\n\nWhile bitcoin prices experienced several days of volatility, these sharp fluctuations seemed to calm somewhat from 12th January, at which point the digital currency began trading within the relatively modest range of $745 to $775.\n\nBitcoin prices broke out of that range about halfway through the session, but even then, their volatility was limited, as the digital currency failed to reach $830 on either 12th or 13th January.\n\nWhen explaining the reduced volatility, more than one analyst stated that market participants had taken a step back to wait and see what would happen.\n\nArthur Hayes, CEO and co-founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk that the market was in a state of “suspense” as it waited to see what action the PBoC would take in regards to the major Chinese exchanges.\n\nHe speculated that the central bank would both eliminate margin trading at these exchanges and “require a minimum fee to be charged on all trades.” Hayes speculated that these moves would lessen speculator interest in bitcoin.\n\nBank guidance\n\nBitcoin traders got their first piece of clarity on 13th January, when BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi quietly revised their margin trading policies. Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, told CoinDesk that his exchange made these changes after receiving guidance from the central bank.\n\nWhile Hayes spoke to the potential negative impact that such changes could have on bitcoin markets, some analysts seemed more optimistic about the situation.\n\n“There has been a relative calm over the market since the PBoC news was released,” said Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, provided similar sentiment, telling CoinDesk:\n\n“The bitcoin markets are relatively calm as traders await more clarity from the PBoC investigations that are taking place in China as we speak.”\n\nA silver lining?\n\nWhile some analysts have expressed concerns about how the looming possibility of new regulations might be creating anxiety for traders, Kong Gao, oversea marketing manager for Richfund, took a different tack.\n\n“The creation of regulations will more likely benefit the industry than hamper it,” he told CoinDesk. “We are already seeing this happening. BTCC has just announced that they had stopped providing leverage and other exchanges will likely follow suit.”\n\nHe elaborated on the situation's foreseeable costs and benefits, stating: “We will likely experience a price decline, but bitcoin's volatility will be reduced. Reduced volatility, combined with a stamp of approval from PBoC with regulation, will likely positively contribute to bitcoin's adoption in China and elsewhere.”\n\nZivkovski took a similar view, saying:\n\n“In a nutshell, regulating margin trading is a very smart consumer protection policy.”\n\nThe reduced use of margin should lower the incidence of long and short squeezes, he emphasized, which should reduce volatility.\n\nExamining charts image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But the government might not give them a chance.\n\nThe Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned Nigerians about investing in digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Reason: companies trading in Bitcoin are not recognized by it.\n\nThis was not exactly the position of the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Company (NDIC) last December. NDIC had announced that a committee had been set up, in conjunction of the Central Bank, to study fast growing digital currencies, especially Bitcoin.\n\nThis digital currency deserves more attention in Africa, and not a pedestrian one.\n\nA Kenyan start-up, BitPesa, has started bringing the continent closer to China –the biggest traders in Bitcoin — by letting companies trade with Chinese businesses in Bitcoin. This novel idea has cut transaction costs by 60 percent.\n\nBut there are issues around Bitcoin, which need to be looked into. The BBC reported, in December, that the value of Bitcoin climbed from $435 to $900 in 2016. However, this digital currency caught some cold after Chinese regulators sneezed this January. The increasing regulations in China on Bitcoin Exchanges caused the digital currency to drop from $1100 to $760.\n\nAnd this is a major problem with Bitcoin. It’s price has been very volatile – a rise from $435 to $900 in one year is phenomenal. This explains one of the reasons why some global retailers are still analyzing the prospects of Bitcoin.\n\nTwo former US Fed Chairmen have expressed their reservations. Though Ben Bernanke argues that some of the ideas behind Bitcoin – [like the Blockchain technology, I suppose] – was a useful takeaway, he says the ‘unregulated nature’ of the digital currency makes it a vehicle for illegal money transfers.\n\nBut it is not all bad news for the digital currency. In a sign that global markets might have overcome their skepticism, Barclays Bank and the UK’s FCA, last year, opened the British market to Circle Internet Financial Ltd, a start-up that allows users send each other payment in Bitcoin. (This company had earlier received a $50 million investment from Goldman Sachs.)\n\nBut what do these banks see in Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin uses the blockchain technology, which is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions – which are stored in electronic wallets called Blocks — and allows everyone connected to the Blockchain network to see transactions. Thus, no one can illegally spend a Bitcoin twice for the same purpose.\n\nUsing computer algorithms and rules acceptable to all members of the community, blocks- which are records of all Bitcoin activities over a specified period—can be confirmed and created by miners. And each time blocks are successfully created, Bitcoins are allocated to successful miners.\n\nEven though regulators and global banks are still analyzing Bitcoins, the idea behind it can be applied to many businesses. And Nigeria should take note of this.\n\nFor instance, over 50 major banks are thinking of adopting the Blockchain technology. Interestingly, IBM and Microsoft have been working with many companies on how to adopt the Blockchain technology for their businesses.\n\nThe Blockchain technology works like a Google document. Using this technology, parties in a contract no longer need to keep separate documents. A Blockchain technology allows parties to look at documents at the same time over a network, make changes and agreements that can be seen by all parties involved, including their lawyers.\n\nIt’s important that Nigerian regulators, including the ministry of communications, look into this technology and figure out how it would benefit Nigeria.', 'The Israel Tax Department has drafted new cryptocurrency tax rules that consider Bitcoin as an asset, eligible for capital gains taxes. Read more...\n\nThe cryptocurrency community in Israel now has some clarity about the legal status of Bitcoin in their country. The country’s tax authorities have recently announced that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be considered as assets and are taxable.\n\nThe legal status of Bitcoin has always been a grey area in many countries across the world. But with the Israeli authorities clarifying their stance over the cryptocurrency, people can now manage their tax filings accordingly. At the same time, few community members have expressed their concerns over certain prohibitive clauses that might make cryptocurrency usage a very costly affair.\n\nAccording to media reports, the Israel Tax Authority clarified the tax rules about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in its latest draft paper. The authorities claim to have done so following multiple requests from the cryptocurrency community within the country. However, it is not clear when Israel will implement the regulations.\n\nThe authorities have classified cryptocurrencies as assets that are not synonymous with financial securities or stocks. At the same time, it will not be considered as a form of currency either. It also makes cryptocurrencies eligible for a 25 percent capital gains tax whenever somebody sells their cryptocurrency holding. Also, the exchanges trading cryptocurrencies will have to charge a 17 percent VAT for asset sales and pass it on to the government in addition to the existing corporate income tax.\n\nThe new draft is set to increase the cost of every single cryptocurrency transaction in the country, negating some of its benefits. Also, the implementation of such draft rules is expected to make it much harder for businesses receiving cryptocurrency payments as they will have to classify it as a barter and file paperwork accordingly, says an online financial magazine.\n\nBitcoin has already proven itself to be a reliable form of currency. The digital currency, like gold, satisfies all the properties of an ideal money. But governments are hesitant to call Bitcoin a currency as they should, mainly because they fear losing control over the monetary system.\n\nThe situation is expected to remain the same for a long time unless some country wakes up and decides to call bitcoin a form of currency openly.\n\nRef: Finance Magnates | Image: NewsBTC', 'The cyberattack struck Los Angeles Valley College late last month, disrupting email, voice mail and computer systems at the public community college in Southern California. Then, school officials found a ransom note.\n\nThe missive advised the college that its electronic files had been encrypted and that the files could only be unlocked with a ""private key."" The attackers would supply the key after receiving payment in the valuable digital currency known as bitcoin, which can be used anonymously without a centralized bank.\n\n""You have just 7 days to send us the BitCoin after 7 days we will remove your private keys and it\'s impossible to recover your files,"" the attackers warned, according to a copy of the note obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nLeaders of the Los Angeles Community College District decided to pay the ransom.\n\n""In consultation with district and college leadership, outside cybersecurity experts and law enforcement, a payment of $28,000 was made by the District,"" Francisco C.

As of Thursday evening, IT experts were still working to unlock some of the college\'s files.\n\nThe Washington Post Excerpt from a ransom note. Excerpt from a ransom note. (The Washington Post) (The Washington Post)\n\nClasses were proceeding normally, on campus and online, officials said. Students returned from winter break on Jan. 3, as scheduled, days after the attack was detected on Dec. 30.\n\nThe incident at the 19,000-student community college provides another cautionary tale of the vulnerability of higher education to malicious hackers. Like businesses, colleges and universities are in a continual quest to stay a step ahead of attackers who threaten in numerous ways to breach or disrupt critical databases and networks.\n\nThe Privacy Rights Clearinghouse counts 19 educational institutions that disclosed data-security breaches in 2016, including hacking episodes at the University of Virginia, the University of Central Florida, the University of Connecticut and Michigan State University.\n\nNow colleges and other institutions face the rising threat of ransom seekers. The term ""ransomware"" has been coined to describe software that can infiltrate a computer and block access to files when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious download link in an email or a pop-up window.\n\nHollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Southern California acknowledged paying a $17,000 ransom last year to regain control of its systems after an attack.\n\n""Ransomware has rapidly risen, from my perspective, to be one of the foremost threats we\'re facing in information technology, anywhere, let alone in higher ed,"" said Joseph Moreau, vice chancellor of technology at Foothill-De Anza Community College District in Silicon Valley.\n\nMoreau, who serves on the board of directors of Educause, a nonprofit group focused on information technology in higher education, said he found the latest Los Angeles incident ""frightening."" Word of the attack spread quickly through California\'s large community college system, he said.\n\n""It was big news, for sure,"" he said. Staying ahead of hackers is difficult, he said, especially if they are able to steal the user names and passwords of students or staff. ""We\'re constantly plugging new holes,"" Moreau said.\n\nMoreau said his district, like its counterpart in Los Angeles, is insured against losses due to cyberattacks. Los Angeles district officials noted that their insurance policy was activated after the recent attack.\n\n""While much time will pass before this matter is resolved, we have already availed ourselves of the resources provided by the policy, including assistance of cybersecurity experts,"" district officials said in a statement.', 'Image: George Hodan\n\nA hammer-wielding group involved in the bitcoin ATM business is allegedly smashing its way around Detroit and Chicago in an effort to destroy the competition, according to court documents filed last month and obtained by industry blog CoinDesk.\n\nAndrew Konja, Alvin Konja, Sam Konja, and Odai Mabrouk—along with a number of other co-conspirators—are allegedly running a scheme to put competing bitcoin ATMs out of business in the Detroit and Chicago areas.\n\nSome backstory on Andrew Konja, who\'s allegedly the ring-leader: He was running his own bitcoin ATM business, the Southfield, Michigan-based MT Group, before either selling it to or merging it with Bitexpress, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought to Northern Illinois District Court by SandP Solutions, Inc., also known as Bitcoin of America, claims that the Brothers Konja are deploying a band of lackeys to bash the screens of their competitors, in an effort to put them out of business. The lawsuit claims they\'ve also threatened owners and demanded ransom, which worked on one owner. The lawsuit claims that they told one owner that ""he would be shot in the head if he continued to operate bitcoin ATMs in the Detroit metropolitan area.""\n\nBitcoin of America claims the Konjas are responsible for smashing up nearly 20 of their own machines, and as many 70 ATMs of other owners in total. According to the lawsuit, in some instances, after they damaged the machines, some of their goons have approached ATM owners offering to replace them with their own machines.\n\nThe whole thing\'s been coordinated using ""sites that automatically destroy posted messages after the passage of time,"" the complaint notes, making it harder for authorities to track their plans. It is not clear what tool or website the lawsuit is referring to here, or why Bitcoin of America or the police wouldn\'t be able to document these exchanges, but it does claim it\'s been going on for at least nine months, and is ongoing.\n\nKonja was interviewed and photographed for the Detroit Free Press in 2015 in a story about bitcoin ATM owners. At the time his business was also called MT Group. Earlier that year he was arrested for possession of a fraudulent transaction device.\n\nCoin ATM Radar estimates total cost of a new Bitcoin ATM at around $10,000-15,000, not including rent and legal guidance.

Near the end of their discussion, Antonopoulos made the point that Bitcoin is stronger than ever and all of the drama in the community needs to be ignored.\n\nThe Technology Is the Most Important Thing in Bitcoin\n\nThere has been plenty of Bitcoin-related drama on social media lately, especially when it comes to issues involving scalability (and the block size limit ). Some Bitcoin enthusiasts now prefer the /r/BTC subreddit due to disagreements with the moderation policies of /r/Bitcoin . There is a stark contrast between the two subreddits when it comes to each group\'s vision for how Bitcoin should scale over the long-term.\n\nMany of the disagreements between the two sects of the Bitcoin community have turned ugly, and Antonopoulos believes it\'s best to get back to the technology\'s roots.\n\n""I think the most important thing is to try to objectively look at what\'s really important in the Bitcoin space, which is the technology,"" said Antonopoulos. ""Try to not be discouraged by a lot of the extraneous drama that\'s going on. In my mind, a lot of the drama is distracting from the real progress that\'s being made.""\n\nAntonopoulos went on to point out that, by many metrics, Bitcoin is stronger than ever. In his view, Bitcoin has never been as diverse or distributed as it is today. The ""Mastering Bitcoin"" author is also impressed with the large amount of technological innovation that has taken place in the space.\n\nTo Antonopoulos\'s point on innovation, there are a few enhancements to Bitcoin that are on the horizon. To many, TumbleBit , lightning networks , Segregated Witness , Mimblewimble and RSK are some of the most exciting technological advancements the Bitcoin community has seen up to this point.\n\nBitcoin also recently achieved an all-time high for confirmed transactions in a single day on January 5, and despite the recent drop, the bitcoin price has nearly doubled since early 2016 .\n\nSome of the Drama Is Manufactured to Be Divisive\n\nWith such a large amount of drama going on in the Bitcoin community, Antonopoulos is convinced that at least some of it is coming from nefarious actors. ""All too often people can get caught up in the drama, and I do believe that a certain percentage of that drama is manufactured to be divisive [and] distracting,"" he said.\n\nAntonopoulos went on to note that every grassroots movement and disruptive organization in history has had infiltrators and provocateurs who are paid to cause turmoil. ""It would be naive to assume that Bitcoin is the first one where that isn\'t happening,"" he added.\n\nWhile there is a lot of infighting among the core Bitcoin community, it\'s unclear if most users are even aware of it. Many end users may be more concerned with whether or not the technology works. ""There are billions of people that are still unbanked, and they don\'t care about the petty squabbles of who insulted who and called the other person the wrong name,"" said Antonopoulos.\n\nAntonopoulos\'s advice to the Bitcoin community was simply to keep innovating on the technology if they want to see it succeed over the long-term.', 'Josh Stark is a lawyer and head of operations and legal at Ledger Labs, a blockchain consultancy based in Toronto.\n\nIn this CoinDesk Op-Ed, Stark argues that the field of ""law and blockchain"" encompasses two distinct topics: the application of law to the technology, and separately, the potential for that technology to transform legal systems and services.\n\nIt\'s rare for any issue in the blockchain industry to escape conversation about legal implications.\n\nThis past summer, The DAO hack prompted discussion of the legal responsibilities of blockchain developers, and the differences between code and law. The popularity of token crowd-sales has led many to wonder about the application of securities laws to blockchain technology. Virtually every blockchain use case involves considering the capabilities and limitations of smart contract code and smart legal contracts.\n\nAs such, ""law and blockchain"" as a subject covers many areas of law. It can be applied to many different industries, and it cuts across many different use cases of the technology. Yet, it can be hard to see from a high level what these topics have in common, or how they might be organized in relation to one another.\n\nIn my view, the questions that make up the study of ""law and blockchain"" can be usefully divided into two types:\n\nFirst, we have questions of application. How does the law apply to blockchain technology? How should it apply?\n\nIncluded in this category are questions such as whether cryptocurrencies are legal tender, or how to regulate decentralized applications. Here, blockchain technology is a subject of law – something that our laws will have to adapt to, just as they adapted to the Internet, new medical technology, or social media.\n\nSecond, there are questions of transformation. How will blockchain technology change the legal system? How will it change the legal services industry? In this category you\'ll find topics like how smart legal contracts might be used by businesses, or the potential for decentralized applications to offer services to consumers without a legal entity.\n\nIn this instance, blockchains are not simply some new technology to which our laws and regulations must adapt. Rather, they are a tool for the law itself – a new technology that could be usefully applied in legal services. They are part of the more general category of ""LegalTech"", alongside artificial intelligence and Big Data.\n\nDistinguishing between these two categories helps us view each more clearly.\n\nQuestions of application\n\nNew technologies often raise novel legal questions.\n\nThey may not fit into current legal categories, thereby challenging existing definitions. They may give people powerful new capabilities that lead to unforeseen consequences.\n\nFor instance, file-sharing services that reshaped the music industry and changed the way we approach intellectual property. These changes often prompt legal responses, as regulators and lawmakers determine how to reconcile the new world with laws that were built for the old one.\n\nBlockchain applications – cryptocurrencies, decentralized apps, and token crowdsales, to name a few – have already raised many legal questions. They offer new capabilities to engage in financial activity in ways that don\'t fit neatly into existing legal frameworks.\n\nFor regulators, this means determining how best to regulate a new sphere of financial activity. For entrepreneurs, it means navigating uncertain legal territory in order to innovate safely.\n\nCharacterizing blockchain tokens\n\nWithin this set of questions, one stands out.\n\nMany issues in the application of law to blockchain technology are some variation of the same question: How do we legally characterize blockchain tokens?\n\nBlockchains allow us to create discrete, ownable digital ""tokens"" that serve as a new type of digital asset. This includes bitcoin, ether and zcash, often referred to as ""cryptocurrencies"" because they function as a digital equivalent of cash.\n\nWhen the first blockchain token – bitcoin – gained widespread attention, regulators, lawmakers and courts began to consider how to characterize it under law. Is bitcoin a commodity, a currency, a security or something else?\n\nThese questions aren’t just theoretically interesting: they have immediate practical importance. If bitcoin is a commodity, then the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has jurisdiction over bitcoin exchanges. Whether or not it is a currency under certain legislation might determine whether bitcoin transactions can be taxed.\n\nRegulatory bodies responsible for preventing financial crimes like FinCEN in the US or FINTRAC in Canada introduced new regulations to bring bitcoin within the scope of its enforcement, although striking the right balance in these regulations is a continuing challenge.\n\nIn other cases, blockchains are used to create tokens that aren\'t designed to be cash at all. For instance, programmable blockchains like ethereum let users create decentralized applications that have their own tokens.\n\nThere are decentralized applications with ""app tokens"" that entitle the holder to report outcomes to a prediction market or receive a share of revenue from a content platform. These blockchain tokens, like cryptocurrencies, are tradeable and may have a market value, but their purpose is more specialized.\n\nRecently, it has become popular for blockchain companies to hold “Initial Coin Offerings” (ICOs) or token crowdsales. In an ICO, a company or group of developers raises funds by selling app tokens in exchange for cryptocurrency (eg bitcoin or ether). The app tokens, in turn, offer some kind of utility or future value to the purchaser. Here, the token is used in a way that is similar to company stock, which could bring these activities within the jurisdiction of securities regulators.\n\nThis issue is what motivated a group of blockchain companies to publish a securities law framework for blockchain tokens. While this remains an unsettled area of law in many jurisdictions, entrepreneurs should exercise caution and, always, speak to a lawyer.\n\nObservers looking at blockchain technology typically view these issues – whether cryptocurrencies are money, whether tokens are securities – as discrete questions, because they involve very different areas of law. However, it’s useful to see them as part of a more general issue.\n\nBlockchain tokens won\'t be limited to currency-like tokens or stock-like tokens.\n\nBlockchains are a flexible medium for the creation of any kind of value-token we can design and find practical use for, and ""currency"" and ""stock"" are just the first of many possible applications.\n\nAs the technology develops, we should expect that they will be used as analogs to other kinds of value-objects, where they will raise new legal questions wherever they find adoption within regulated areas of economic activity.\n\nMany applications, many legal issues\n\nBlockchain technology raises many other interesting legal questions beyond the characterization of tokens. While a full review is beyond the scope of this article, there are a few other interesting topics worth highlighting.\n\nPublic blockchains like ethereum or bitcoin raise interesting questions of liability.\n\nIf a blockchain breaks or fails in some way, is anyone liable? With traditional financial infrastructure, there is ultimately some entity who can be held responsible when something goes wrong.\n\nWith public blockchains, there is no legal entity in control, but rather a decentralized network of participants, like developers and miners. The question is whether such persons have legal duties to the users of the blockchain they maintain. Angela Walch explores this issue in a piece considering whether core developers of public blockchains like ethereum are fiduciaries.\n\nThe issues we’ve discussed so far focus on public blockchains. But there are also interesting legal questions in private blockchain implementations.\n\nBecause these ""permissioned"" blockchains are being designed with existing regulations in mind, they do not challenge legal frameworks as obviously as public networks. Rather, the legal questions more often result from the intrinsic features of blockchain technology.\n\nFor instance, blockchains may raise challenges where financial institutions are forced to comply with certain privacy laws.\n\nSome financial organizations are required by law to be able to permanently remove data when required to do so by a court (often called ""right to be forgotten"" laws). This can be a challenge for existing blockchain technologies because blockchains by their nature do not allow for past data to be deleted, but rather only updated in subsequent blocks, which may not be sufficient to comply with the law.\n\nQuestions of transformation\n\nThe second category asks: how can blockchain technology be used in conjunction with, or as a replacement for, certain legal services?\n\nThe second category is what makes blockchain technology particularly important for lawyers. Blockchain technology isn\'t just a new subject for law. It is also a legal technology that could transform law and legal services, by offering new methods for achieving legal purposes.\n\nIt\'s important, too, to be clear about how blockchain technology differs from other technology of this type. The category of ""legal tech"" is mostly made up of tools for lawyers: software to help lawyers draft documents more efficiently, or AI to help analyze case law.\n\nBlockchain technology, in contrast, might also offer tools for clients of lawyers: tools that help them solve problems that, today, are exclusively solved through legal services.\n\nWithin these “questions of transformation”, there are two primary topics:\n\n1, Smart legal contracts and smart alternative contracts\n\nThe most well-known example of this capability are ""smart contracts"".\n\nIn a previous article, I articulated a distinction between smart contract code – a program or script executed on a blockchain – and smart legal contracts, the use of smart contract code to define and enforce a legal agreement.\n\nIn most cases, ""smart legal contracts"" would be a combination of traditional legal language and smart-contract code. A typical legal contract would handle terms that can’t be easily reduced to code, like clauses relating to liability or human performance. The smart-contract code portions would handle aspects of the contract that could benefit from automation, like a transfer of funds on certain conditions.\n\nThis approach to smart-legal contracts is being built today, seen in the efforts by Monax and R3, among others.\n\nIn other cases, ""smart contract code"" might be useful in the absence of a traditional legal relationship. These ""smart alternative contracts"" would create financial relationships between parties – mediated entirely through code – that might be sufficient for some narrow purposes.\n\nMany lawyers are understandably skeptical of smart legal contracts. However, often the criticism is naive. Most often, ""smart legal contracts"" are simplistically compared to traditional legal contracts, with the former being dismissed because they don’t match some particular feature of the latter.\n\nThinking clearly on this issue requires stepping back and taking a broader view of the purpose of contracts in commercial relationships. Businesses don\'t sign contracts with one another because they need a contract. Businesses sign contracts because contracts are a tool that solves a specific problem: How can I trust the other party?\n\nContracts solve this problem by reshaping the incentives of each party until they are sufficiently aligned, enabling them to engage in the risky business of trade. With a legal contract, I have confidence that the other party will pay a significant penalty if they breach the agreement, and that I have access to legal remedies if something goes wrong.\n\nDirectly comparing ""smart contracts"" to ""legal contracts"" is the wrong approach. It’s comparing a new tool to an existing one, rather than assessing both tools against the problem they are designed to solve. The right question to ask is not \'Can a smart contract do exactly what a legal contract does?\', but rather, \'How can smart-contract code, in conjunction with or separate from legal contracts, be used to create trust between parties?\'\n\nEven then, people look at this technology and conclude it won’t change much.\n\nThey recognize that ""smart contract"" technology is interesting, but simply don’t think that it would add much value to the vast majority of commercial relationships that exist today. Contracts as they are today work for most businesses, and wouldn’t benefit much from automation or other features of smart-contact code.\n\nThat might be correct in a limited sense. These technologies might not replace the traditional contracts used in the majority of commercial relationships. But this view doesn’t consider that the type of commercial relationships that make up our economy will change over time.\n\nNew markets, with new needs, may develop that take advantage of the unique capabilities of blockchain technology and smart contract-code.\n\nOne obvious candidate in this category is enabling machine-to-machine commerce, where contracts articulated using code and which can be ""enforced"" without relying on legal entities might be ideal. For instance, a self-driving car that can receive payments from passengers and pay for its own gas or electricity.\n\nIf the share of commerce involving machines or automated systems grows significantly, then so too will the importance of smart contracts that today seem like a niche product.\n\nBlockchain technology offers us new tools to solve an old problem: how to create sufficient trust between parties in order to make trade possible.\n\nThis doesn’t mean we will throw away existing ways of solving this problem, like traditional legal contracts. It just means we have a new tool in our toolkit, with new capabilities and weaknesses. It might help us solve existing problems of this type in new ways, and it offers us the tools to solve new versions of this problem in new areas of commerce.\n\n2. Coordinating complex economic activity without a legal entity\n\nBlockchain technology has made it possible for decentralized software systems to coordinate complex economic activity that, until now, was only practically possible for a centralized legal entity like a corporation.\n\nThis is usually framed as a contest between centralized and decentralized systems, as in this piece by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. But at the same time, it challenges our assumptions about the role of legal entities as the de-facto center of economic activity.\n\nOpenBazaar, for example, is a decentralized marketplace. From the user\'s perspective, it is similar to eBay: you browse items for sale from various sellers, pay them (in this case with bitcoin) and they ship the item to you.\n\nBut unlike eBay, there is no legal entity at the center of this service: payments are directly between users, there are no fees collected by a middleman, and interactions between buyers and sellers are mediated through a decentralized application built on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMany believe that other ""peer to peer"" marketplaces - like Uber and AirBnB – could similarly be replicated with a decentralized platform.\n\nBefore now, complex economic activity of this kind was only practically possible for a legal entity like a corporation. In other words, there is now a new solution to an old problem: how do I create a service that can manage a complex web of commercial relationships between many different participants?\n\nUntil recently, the only answer to that question was to create a legal entity to be a nexus for legal contracts. Now there is another option: build a decentralized application.\n\nLooking forward\n\nSeparating these two categories is helpful in articulating why blockchains are different from other technologies.\n\nBlockchains offer people new capabilities that require answering new legal questions and adjusting regulatory systems to compensate where necessary. This is a process that legal systems are by now familiar with, having adapted (albeit slowly) to new information technology over the last few decades.\n\nBut more than this, blockchains offer new tools with which to structure commercial relationships or organize complex economic activity. This fact makes blockchains not merely an area of niche practice, but a critical piece of the future for our legal systems and legal services industry.\n\nWhile these two categories are conceptually distinct, they also interact with one another. The transformational properties of blockchain technology raise difficult questions for the application of our laws to the same.\n\nFor instance, our legal systems assume the existence of a legal entity at the center of any complex economic activity. Whenever we decide that an area of economic activity needs to be regulated – for instance, to protect consumers or prevent fraud – we usually do so by controlling the legal entities at the center of that activity. For example, by imposing steep fines on corporations who break the law.\n\nBut now it is no longer true that there will always be a legal entity at the center of complex economic activity.\n\nHow do we regulate a market if it is mostly made up of decentralized, rather than legal, entities? Decentralized applications like OpenBazaar are small today, but they’ve proven the concept. If decentralized systems grow to the point where lawmakers decide they must be controlled through regulation, how will this be accomplished with no entity to fine or sue?\n\nAs the technology matures, the questions in both categories will continue to grow. Distinguishing between them is a useful first step in understanding the full scope of the interaction between law and blockchain tech.\n\nComplicated connections image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles. As such, the opinions expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nFor more details on how you can submit an opinion or analysis article, view our Editorial Collaboration Guide or email news@coindesk.com.', 'As the legal maneuverings over the rights of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to gain access to Coinbase customer accounts continue to wind through the courts, Brian Armstrong, Co-Founder, and CEO at Coinbase, has taken to the publishing platform, Medium, to explain his side of the story.\n\nBut first, a little background. In November of 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a formal request on behalf of the IRS to serve a ""John Doe"" summons on all United States Coinbase customers who transferred convertible virtual currency from 2013 to 2015. A ""John Doe"" summons is an order that does not specifically identify the person but rather identifies a person or ascertainable group or class by their activities.\n\nDays later, the request was granted by Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. In response to the ruling, a self-identifying Coinbase customer and managing partner of Berns Weiss, Jeffrey K. Berns, filed a motion to set aside the ruling which would prevent the summons from being issued. He did so as an ""intervenor"" meaning that he was asking the court to allow him to participate in the legal process even though he had not been specifically named in the original summons. Berns argued, among other things, that the summons was overbroad.\n\nIn late December of 2016, the IRS fired back, arguing that since Berns outed himself as a Coinbase user, he\'s no longer subject to the summons, meaning that the matter as it affects Berns has been resolved and his motion is now moot. With that, the IRS wanted to proceed with issuing the ""John Doe"" summons on Coinbase customers. In January of 2017, Berns filed an answer to the IRS response claiming the IRS is attempting to ""artificially moot the motion"" because it does not want the Court to scrutinize its actions in pursuing a summons he characterizes as ""improper.""\n\nDespite the very public back and forth in the courts, Coinbase, the company affected by the subpoena, has been relatively quiet about the subpoena (they did post a statement to their blog in November 2016). This week, however, Armstrong decided to share the company\'s side of the story.\n\nCoinbase, Armstrong writes, has ""worked to comply with all IRS guidance in our space, beginning with the March 2014 guidance on virtual currency."" Why? Armstrong says that he believes that ""Coinbase and the IRS fundamentally want the same thing: for all U.S. users of virtual currency to pay their taxes."" However, he says, ""I also feel that the IRS sending us a John Doe summons on all customer accounts is not the best way for us to mutually accomplish this objective.""\n\nIt\'s not simply about a subpoena, indicates Armstrong, pointing out that Coinbase has previously complied with tailored IRS subpoenas. It\'s the scope of the most recent subpoena - asking for detailed transaction information on all United States Coinbase customers over a period of time - that is concerning. Armstrong notes that the language and tenor of the argument in favor of the subpoena also ""incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes.""', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Bitcoin and blockchain technology can be used to do many different things. Albeit most people are focused on the financial side of things, the Bitcoin network is also a communication tool that creates eternal tamper-proof records. One user took it upon himself to express love for someone else by sending small Bitcoin transactions to custom-generated wallet addresses.\n\nShowing Your Love With Bitcoin\n\nBlock number 448064 on the Bitcoin blockchain is a piece of art in its own right. Somebody sent a lot of small Bitcoin transactions to different addresses. If one looks closely at the recipient addresses, it becomes evident the addresses themselves spell out a particular message. In this case, the message is the following:\n\n“Dayah Dover, your personality is unmatched, your intelligence just shines, you can do things few people can, and you’re always just gorgeous. You are really my entire world, giving my life meaning and fun. Dayah, I love you1!!!!!!! Forever !!!!!!”\n\nQuite an intriguing way to express your love for someone, yet it also showcases the power of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Although this is one of the “first’ love letters on the Bitcoin blockchain, not everyone seems to see it that way. The Bitcoin community on Reddit seems somewhat appalled by this technique to express love or to be more precise, by the recipient of the message.\n\nCreating Bitcoin vanity addresses allow people to embed messages in a Bitcoin address without friction. Doing so requires either a lot of computation power or some money to “buy” the addresses in question. Generating a total of 11 vanity addresses will easily set you back US$200, if not more. Some people may see this as “excessive and useless,” even though one has to appreciate the thought put into this show of affection.\n\nThat being said, vanity addresses have specific limits as to how “deep” they can go regarding generating one. Most of the output addresses found in this particular transaction are impossible to generate, which means the outputs of the transfer are unspendable. This reduces the time to generate such addresses, as the rest of them technically do not “exist.” Or to be more precise, no one has the private key for these addresses, making the funds in their balances unspendable.\n\nAdditionally, it appears there is a hidden meaning to the transaction amounts included in the transactions as well. Every TX is for the same amount of 0.00314159 Bitcoin. A closer look at that number will show how this related to pi, a number that goes on forever and ever. A nice touch to express your undying love for someone else, even though using Bitcoin and the blockchain may creep some people out for sure.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
01/15/2017,"['See that image to the right? That’s a video game character’s “bag,” similar to the the backpack for one of my many virtual personas in World of Warcraft. Near the bottom you see the character’s “money,” denominated in gold, silver, and copper “coins,” roughly analagous to dollars and cents. Players earn that in-game dough various ways, looting the corpses of monsters or other players we kill, robbing hidden stashes, and completing quests. Just like in the real world, this in-game currency not only allows you to buy lots of cool stuff and services, but you can quite literally purchase the labor and loyalty of other players.\n\nEarning money like this is a little slow, and that virtual money is so useful that given the chance, some players are willing to pay real money for larger amounts of the fake stuff. And so a weird new industry grew up quickly around selling in-game gold to other players for real American dollars, or real German marks, or real Japanese yen, or whatever. Central banks and regulatory agencies didn’t know what to make of this. They knew they didn’t particularly like it, but gold farming as it came to be called was small potatoes and wasn’t perceived as an immediate threat. Besides, there wasn’t much they could do about it, outside of shutting down highly popular video games. Gold farming and in-game to real-world currency exchange mostly flew under the radar and happened largely outside of their respective jurisdictions and area of operations anyway.\n\nNaturally, that freedom from regulatory oversight and a decentralized currency appeals to some people for various reasons. Anonymous, pseudonyms, under the radar, dark … those all may sound ominous now. But just 15 years ago that was all not only common, it’s how we all operated online—regular law-abiding citizens and degenerate scumbag scammers alike. So in that environment some gaming geeks, perhaps those with an especially strong libertarian or anarchist streak in them, spent many long hours speculating on how great it would be if only there was a sort of virtual exchange unit out there, one beyond the control of video game developers and nosy national security agencies and corrupt bankers. It’s unclear if the creator[s] of bitcoin were gamers themselves or were motivated by this reasoning. But in-game currency and gold farming certainly set the stage for the idea of a cryptocurrency.\n\nEnter Bitcoin: an open source, peer-to-peer process mostly consisting of anti-counterfeiting measures. In brief, bitcoins are mined when a user downloads a simple program that awards fractions of the cryptocurrency as the processor chugs along doing what processors do: adding and iterating. Think of a random magic number, and when a processor randomly hits that exact magic number out of billions, a tiny fraction of a bitcoin is awarded to that user. Over time they accrue. Thus, each bitcoin has a detailed history of creation consisting of many, many recorded processor events, and that along with any subsequent use is referred to as block-chain. That block of history is encrypted, distributed, and updated to devices all over the world. When a bitcoin changes hands, those devices are checked for that digital footprint, and if a majority report back that all is proper, if the history exists and matches in details with that distributed cached network data, the coin is validated as authentic.\n\nAs processors grew in power, finding that magic number has to get harder and harder. Otherwise, Moore’s Law would be a road to easy riches! What started as a random search for hundreds of “nickels” sitting somewhere randomly in virtual landscape the size of a city block is now a giant professional manhunt for a few “pennies” thrown randomly into a virtual landscape the size of Texas. It takes enough processing power now that the primary break-even parameter at this point is the cost of electricity. If you could get your juice really cheap or better yet, for free ... well, let’s just say there are now even thumb drives made that plug into your work PC and look to any snooping sys admins, like any drive drawing a modest current. But they’re actually loaded with processors whirring away, trying to stumble on the proverbial needle of gold in a virtual haystack.\n\nFor several years bitcoin existed in relative obscurity, mostly used by gamers and computer nerds in smallish transactions between individuals. But beginning around 2010 the Dark Net began to rise from the ashes of a harsh world-wide recession. By 2012 they had come into their own: online markets where anything goes, where everything was available, narcotics, rhino horns, stolen goods of all kinds, etc. The most notorious is the now defunct Silk Road, but it wasn’t alone, and lo and behold, some of these alt-crazy networks accepted bitcoin. That’s when demand really, suddenly—seemingly out of nowhere—shot up dramatically, and bitcoin burst into wider public consciousness. Therein lies the source of its fame, and therein lies the rub.\n\nTo be a genuinely useful, practical new currency, a given kind of money has to be reasonably widely accepted, as reputable as possible, and ideally, relatively stable. Right now it’s debatable if bitcoin is any of these. It swings up and down wildly almost daily, it comes with a checkered past to say the least, and at best bitcoin is grudgingly accepted by a handful of medium-sized vendors. On the latter, think of it from the business viewpoint: big swings, limited supply, and uncertain liquidity are great for speculators willing to make bets and shoulder risk, but that’s all lousy for run-of-the-mill vendors and service providers who simply want to get paid in full and on time with minimum hassle. For these reasons and others, the future of bitcoin is as uncertain as the fading Wild West version of the Internet it sprang from—or the rate it will trade at tomorrow.\n\nThere are other cryptocurrencies out there and more to come. Navcoin and shadow cash are a couple that turned up when researching this piece. I don’t know enough about alternatives to bitcoin to form an educated opinion just yet. But ideally, a cryptocurrency would be lawful or at least not unlawful, and it would be accepted for enough goods and services that people would feel comfortable holding them without fear they’d be worthless tomorrow. And as long as we’re wishing, the New Money, for lack of a better term, would be readily exchangeable for dollars or yen or something that’s relatively stable, safe, and seen as intrinsically valuable. But until that time comes, we may have to keep lumbering along with old-fashioned cash in our wallets, and electrons dancing in our online bank accounts.', 'Mumbai: In a boost to use of blockchain technology in banking, the RBI \'s research arm has completed the first ever end-to-end test of the technology behind Bitcoin in a project involving regulators, banks, financial institutions and clearing houses. The RBI\'s arm, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), conducted the project using the technology behind Bitcoin in a trade application with banks and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) participating too.Blockchain is a public ledger that enables historical recording of all transactions that has occurred in a network in a way that it cannot be altered. Following the project, IDRBT last week released a white paper titled, \'Applications of blockchain technology to banking and financial sector in India\'. In a foreword to the white paper, RBI deputy governor R Gandhi said that the banking industry world over was looking at the technology, which has the potential to disrupt financial business applications. The white paper concluded that the overall proof of concept provided a good demonstration of the use-cases and helped broaden the understanding of the technology and its potential to other real-life applications.The technology partner for the project was New York-based MonetaGo, which provided the actual platform for test cases including payments with its proprietary enhanced information payments system (EIPS) and trade finance. In an interview to TOI, Jesse Chenard, CEO, MonetaGo, said that the project was believed to be the first ever end-to-end test of blockchain using existing banking protocols, including regulators, banks, financial institutions and clearing houses.In another pilot conducted last year, ICICI Bank demonstrated that trade finance deals can be concluded instantly as against days using the technology. Earlier this month, Yes Bank implemented a multi-nodal blockchain transaction to fully digitise vendor financing for Bajaj Electricals. Last week, Axis Bank tied up with distributed financial technology company Ripple to offer cross-border payments solution through technology innovation.According to Chenard, it is still too early for the network effect to kick in for use of BCT. ""Most bank experiments to date have been either with single institutions or with only a couple of parties to a transaction. And then again, those have been in closed sandbox environments that were deployed simply for testing purposes,"" he said.Other than the public Bitcoin, blockchain and a few other similar projects, there still haven\'t been any actual productionised platforms, he added. ""That is why it is one of our focuses here at MonetaGo. Until you have a platform that multiple parties can use and connect to, you can\'t get a real network effect. As with any new technology, entrants rely on different platforms and methodologies and it will take some time for standards to evolve. That\'s one of the reasons we are active with the Hyperledger Project.""MonetaGo provides blockchain solutions to financial institutions and central banks. It also helps institutions identify and deploy software that integrates with existing banking systems, processes, and settlement mechanisms. ""By using existing infrastructure and protocols instead of replacing them, we help our customers quickly get up-and-running without having to change their whole systems,"" said Chenard.According to Chenard, the basis of this regulator approach to BCT is largely around Know Your Customer requirements and the reporting of suspicious activity. ""However, one of the interesting things for regulators when it comes to this new technology is its ability to provide greater visibility and transparency in real time into the actual transaction records than was previously possible. This innovation has the potential to bring about additional financial stability and market efficiency, which is why many regulators are taking a cautionary but optimistic approach,"" he said.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

A break past that area could be an early signal of a reversal, especially if it is followed by an upward crossover.\n\nStochastic is heading up but is closing in on the overbought zone, which suggests that buying pressure could fade soon. Similarly, RSI is heading north so bitcoin price could follow suit but bulls might need to take a break and let sellers take over in a while.

Read more...\n\nKraken, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchange platforms has announced the inclusion of a new cryptocurrency offering. The exchange announced the new development in its latest blog post, published a few days ago.\n\nMonero, the anonymous cryptocurrency based on CryptoNight protocol has been exhibiting a promising trend in the cryptocurrency industry lately. Its inclusion into Kraken is going to offer the digital currency a much-needed boost to further improve its foothold in the market.\n\nMonero is currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. The digital currency currently trading between $11 and $12 made the headlines recently after being adopted by few leading darknet marketplaces.\n\nKraken in its blog states,\n\n“Monero is one of the leading cryptocurrencies that has seen huge 40x market cap growth in 2016 and trades with high volume and liquidity.”\n\nWith the launch of Monero support, Kraken users can access XMR/XBT, XMR/EUR and XMR/USD trading pairs. In the coming days, the cryptocurrency platform also intends to introduce margin trading for its latest digital currency offering.\n\nSecurity experts have earlier indicated the potential rise of Monero on the deep web. The core principles of Monero — privacy, decentralisation, open development, scalability and fungibility will enable the digital currency to compete with Bitcoin when it comes to anonymous usage. Few have predicted a rise in the usage of Monero among hackers and cyber criminals owing to its unique decentralised ledger which makes tracking virtually impossible.\n\nIn its blog post, Kraken mentions the upcoming Monero hard fork at block 1220515 to enable RingCT transactions. It also advises users to upgrade to Monero v0.10.1 before the hard fork to ensure better stability and privacy. Eventually, the hard fork was introduced successfully on January 10, 2017.\n\nKraken had indicated that all XMR deposits on the platform will go offline before the hard fork and will remain so for few hours after the completion.\n\nThe development team behind Monero has consistently been working on new upgrades and product offerings. Even though XMR might not replace Bitcoin as the preferred cryptocurrency, it is expected to find broad application in the market.\n\nRef: Kraken Blog | Image: NewsBTC', 'Smart contracts were a popular trend throughout 2016, as investors, banks and major financial institutions explored the potential of smart contract-based protocols such as Ethereum to build innovative and decentralized applications.\n\nYet, even Ethereum, a network valued at nearly US$930 million, struggled to demonstrate practical usage and efficient commercialization of smart contracts due to several internal bugs, delays in transactions and other security issues emerged from its prioritization of security over flexibility.\n\nSevere security compromisations and technical issues arise when a cryptographic network like Ethereum choose to favor flexibility and functionality over security. In theory, a highly functional, flexible and scalable network should be able to welcome large-scale projects with sizable consumer bases but in reality, if necessary security measures aren’t present, the entire network becomes at risk of exploitation.\n\nUsing Bitcoin as a Smart Contract Platform\n\nMany researchers and experts have looked into a wide range of solutions and technologies within bitcoin to use the Bitcoin network as the foundation of a smart contract platform. One interesting technology in development is the Lightning network, which was modeled after former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn’s work and Blockstream co-founder Matt Corallo’s payment channels.\n\nThe basic concept behind the innovative Lightning Network is that by using Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) to multi-party contracts, it allows receivers to pre-determine the amount of transaction or the transaction itself before actually receiving it.\n\nIn other words, similar to a traditional contract wherein party A agrees to pay party B at a certain given time frame, HTLC allows bitcoin to carry out conceptually identical agreements. Thus, Lightning can be fully utilized as a smart contract platform in the sense that users can agree to receive or send certain amounts of money prior to signing the actual transaction with a cryptographic proof.\n\n“The Lightning network is, in my opinion, the most ambitious smart contract project the ecosystem has produced so far. Poon & Dryja’s work has inspired a number of different teams from everywhere around the globe to contribute to its emergence,” said Alex B. of Blockstream.\n\nMore importantly, Lightning also enables a complex smart contract to be carried out with multiple transactions without running in conflict with transaction verification times as only the last or the final transaction is actually broadcasted to the blockchain.\n\nFor instance, if Bob and Alice settle 21 transactions between themselves and a third party, the last transaction will include all of the transactions and effectively merge them as one single transaction for miners to pick up.\n\nAnother innovative concept that is still in development is the utilization of federated sidechains to allow the settlement of smart contracts. If implemented, it allows alternative networks to directly converge with the main bitcoin network to settle transactions.\n\n“Federations propose an alternative trust model that enables users to interface with the technology without having to rely on the strict requirements of Bitcoin’s consensus,” added Alex B.\n\nWith innovative and practical smart contract concepts planned for development and testing, many enthusiasts believe 2017 may be the year enterprises and corporations experiment with bitcoin to settle smart contracts.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '""I’ve been sending death threats since I was 8.""\n\nI know a lead-in like that piques interest and so does Chris DeRose, one half of the abrasive and influential podcast \'Bitcoin Uncensored\'.

While maybe nothing on its own, ‘BU’ has coalesced into a (mostly) cohesive (and controversial) flavor of bitcoin intellectualism – one that is at once a rejection of the technology’s earlier Libertarian values and a supposed embrace of its more scientific merits.\n\nThat\'s not to say DeRose and Unseth think differently than the bitcoin maximalists of 2013, it\'s just that they’ve developed a new way to espouse the message.\n\nTheir claim to fame is that they tout this in a rather tasteless and increasingly offensive and visible way. (The duo was ranked number nine in our year\'s-end, ""most influential"" reader poll).\n\nTo many, though, the vote shone a brighter light on their more unsavory actions. They’ve been called misogynists, racists, anti-Semites and homophobes by the most well-known faces in the industry. (Many of whom refused to go on record about the subject).\n\nBefore we continue, we\'ll want to bear in mind this juxtaposition.\n\nTo understand DeRose and Unseth, one must also understand bitcoin evangelists, a group that for years now has either been getting made fun of or ignored by most everyone that\'s not a \'believer\'. Traditional financial institutions, large enterprises, venture capitalists – most have bowed out for a tangential industry, \'blockchain\'.\n\nAnd it’s this buzzword that has emerged as the central focal point of the BU universe.\n\nThe problem, according to DeRose and Unseth, is that none of the bitcoin haters seem to know what a \'blockchain\' is. That, and because it’s being used as a buzzword to secure funding rounds at the expense of the innovators who created it. (And they\'re not alone in this claim.)\n\nTo some, DeRose and Unseth have become something of a mascot for this crusade. And to those who are opposed, they’ve become another name on their Twitter block list.\n\n\'Bullying and harassment\'?\n\nIn the middle of this tug-of-war are the critics who allege that DeRose and Unseth instigate nothing more than bullying and harassment (and that acknowledging them at all amounts to ""letting them win"").\n\nAnd there\'s plenty of evidence to back this up. This article by blog Bitcoinist highlights some of the more colorful and unfriendly words they\'ve used for notable investor-backed projects, including Zcash and thought leaders like Andreas Antonopoulos.\n\nIn interview, DeRose didn’t see to have a firm stance on whether or not his actions constitute ‘trolling’. This is despite admitting to making harassing phone calls to people’s family members and creating (or encouraging) lewd gifs and memes that lampoon industry figures.\n\nIndeed, DeRose seems unable to see the human cost of these actions, preferring to emphasize his seeming belief that any engagement in the industry amounts to an entrance ticket into a kind of prolonged intellectual warfare.\n\n“I don’t know what trolling is anymore,” DeRose told CoinDesk. “Is any peer review trolling now? Is anything that is meaningful now considered trolling?""\n\nIn his mind, this is what allows him to say, criticize someone\'s appearance in a sexualized way, or attend an industry conference in disguise and antagonize its organizers.\n\n""What I’ve worked hard for is to have a culture where people are evaluated by their ideas and not as people,"" he adds.\n\nIn some ways, this is historically how the bitcoin and blockchain space has interacted with outsiders (see the development community’s sprawling mailing list and Twitter arguments, as evidence). Conflict definitely garners attention.\n\nDeRose and Unseth have even acknowledged the accusations about their behavior on their show, though when they do it\'s often dismissive.\n\nIn response to the topic of subjective morality on a recent show, DeRose quipped ""I don\'t think there\'s anything worse than that."" The conversation quickly routs through discussion of the bible, sex crimes and how confrontation is sometimes the only way to make people face thought paradoxes they may not have previously considered.\n\nAnd as some of their favorite public targets have struggled – banks leaving the R3CEV private blockchain consortium, scammers running away with the money raised by initial coin offerings and The DAO hack and subsequent ethereum hardfork – the two have earned a kind of niche celebrity in the industry for forcing the conversation.\n\nEven their critics are increasingly acknowledging a difficult truth – they may be partly right.\n\n\'Toxic and flawed\'\n\nJae Kwon, founder and CEO of the open-source blockchain platform Tendermint, has been in the line of fire of DeRose and Unseth before, but he’s more level-headed about the antagonism.\n\nDespite being the butt of some of their jokes, he said he shares some of the chagrin that their sprawling podcasts and social media firepower have helped give voice to.\n\n""I’m also frustrated by some of the things coming out of this industry under the umbrella of blockchain,"" Kwon said. ""The core of what they’re saying has a lot of truth to it.""\n\nHe credits the rise of Unseth and DeRose to the anonymity afforded by the Internet itself, one that he said has created ""subculture where trolling is promoted as the method by which one arrives at the truth"".\n\nAnd in the bitcoin space it\'s only secured by the mythos surrounding the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, plus most supporter\'s belief that technology can usurp social problems.\n\nIf you have good technologically sound ideas, then it doesn’t matter who you are as a person, right?\n\nBut sometimes it does matter, because there are more effective ways of changing the right people’s minds than via condescension and humiliation.\n\n""The approach they take – bullying and trolling – and their criteria, any proof-of-stake blockchain or fundraiser is a scam, are toxic and flawed,"" he said.\n\nKwon’s Tendermint co-founder, Ethan Buchman, agrees. ""I suspect much of their effectiveness is lost due to the tactics,"" Buchman said.\n\nThe \'Perianne incident\'\n\nTo understand where this sentiment comes from, however, one has to go back to the most influential ‘Bitcoin Uncensored’ episode, featuring Perianne Boring, founder and president of the non-profit Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n\nToday, the narrative has been reduced to something like this – DeRose and Unseth coaxed Boring into appearing on the show to talk about blockchain. There, she, in the midst of forceful questioning, conceded that it was basically like the SWIFT secure financial messaging service, a comment the pair immediately and harshly criticized.\n\nTheir point was essentially this: if blockchain is just like SWIFT, what would be the point of luring banks into spending vast amounts of time and money stripping their architecture?\n\nFor many though, it wasn’t what was said, but how it was carried out (as well as subsequent discussion that found them emphasizing her physical appearance).\n\nOn the audio, you can even hear how DeRose and Unseth know full well that they’re prepared to rip apart her ideas.\n\n""She didn’t learn anything from it because she was immediately put on the defensive. It was great for their ratings, but if they actually want her [and others] to learn something or have a positive impact, they need another approach,"" Buchman said.\n\nBitcoin\'s right wing\n\nSure, you could say that standing on a soapbox and patronizing people isn’t always effective – but then again, the latest US election would just about prove you wrong.\n\nOn a larger, sociological level, DeRose and Unseth have simply borrowed from President-Elect Donald Trump’s playbook. Stoke animosity, attack political correctness and the crowd goes wild. This can also be seen broadly in the many pro-bitcoin Twitter accounts that routinely retweet Trump rhetoric, unbecoming memes and other incendiary online content.\n\nUnseth\'s former Twitter description, for instance, claims, ""If you support me and @derosetech [Chris], then you also support @realDonaldTrump.""\n\nPart of the script is to willingly give ammunition to the haters. They know that defending themselves against trolls is a lost cause, because well, they play that game.\n\nThe duo\'s most ardent supports liken them to something like venerated court jesters, there to prove, as one blogger put, that the emperors have no clothes.\n\n""The bottom line is – any community that wants to evolve past bad habits and toxic over-optimistic utopian thinking will have to face ridicule and humor. Because it is often only when we speak in jest, that we are truly saying the truth,"" Plutus.it\'s Filip Martinka wrote.\n\nOthers, like bitcoin developer Paul Storzc, use even more vaunted historical terms:\n\n“Not wanting to be misunderstood, the BU hosts aggressively reject the premise that \'they must be understood\'. They are only interested in the truth; and, in the spirit of Socrates and Sir Karl Popper, they deliberately stack the deck, so that it will be as *difficult* as possible for them to make their case.”\n\nThe argument goes like this: So, what if Unseth (who\'s not light-skinned) says he doesn’t like people of color, hasn\'t his belief that bitcoin is the only blockchain with a circular economy promoted interest in how this might be successfully replicated?\n\nAnd who cares if DeRose brags about his love of escorts? His position that bitcoin is supported by regulatory arbitrage (the idea that government rules and restrictions give the blockchain its usefulness) is now a de-facto phrase.\n\nBut many do care, just like they care about President-Elect Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nBecause the way people in power act and speak gives others an example, an excuse to act in the same way.\n\nFame monsters\n\nIn interview, Unseth and DeRose display a certain cockiness that can be palpable as well.\n\nTheir worst quality, interruption – not only in the interview but at conferences (where they’ll lampoon speakers with question after question) – can be grating. Still, their passive aggressive questions and satirical statements are, many times, on point. And while they cast themselves as imbeciles, heroin addicts and \'johns\', it’s only to mask real concern.\n\n""The secret truth is that we actually care about bitcoiners,"" DeRose said.\n\nFinally, a moment of clarity in an interview that all-too-often digresses into a swirl of jokes.\n\nTo some, DeRose and Unseth are already sympathetic due to their \'outsider\' status.\n\nAccording to Toni Lane Casserly, partner at BitNation, a blockchain-powered ""decentralized borderless voluntary nation"", it\'s best to view their offensive, in-your-face tendencies as a result of emotional baggage that they carry around.\n\n""They were placed in situations where people didn’t value them, where they were treated like they weren’t good enough or smart enough, and the way they’ve dealt with that is through humor,"" she said.\n\nBack to the death threats\n\nIn some instances, though, it\'s hard to laugh. As the saying goes, there’s a fine line between clever and stupid, and Bitcoin Uncensored certainly likes to cross that line.\n\nAt stake in the whole narrative is the question of who is the real bully.\n\nIs it the hordes of bitcoin enthusiasts on Twitter who lampoon and attack their intellectual opponents in anonymity? Or is it the businesses and conferences that all too often lock out this dialogue for a PC or \'business-friendly\' environment?\n\nIn this light, one would be remiss not to mention the central characters of ""The Big Short"", another set of outsiders who were attacked and ridiculed, only to be proven right.\n\nA core intellectual question here is, as Unseth and DeRose allude to, which is the greater harm?\n\n""When we started doing this show, it was obvious where the space was going. To us 2+2=4 and then there were a bunch of people in the space claiming that 2+2=15,"" Unseth said.\n\n""If [people are] out there advocating people throw their money into toilets and we’re telling people that those are toilets, are we really the assholes?""\n\nIt could be argued that both parties are guilty for the poor state of the dialogue.\n\nBut then, there’s that line again. After all, I\'m still here trying to figure out if the pair sends death threats to blockchain industry entrepreneurs, when DeRose finally admits to the action. Unseth quickly jumps to his defense.\n\nAt its core, its this kind of camaraderie that is also key to their appeal.\n\n""It’s interesting, though, because these guys are known scammers,"" he says, alluding that I’m trusting the wrong people.\n\n""I don’t mean to disrespect; just trying to validate,"" I said.\n\nDeRose quickly strikes back:\n\n“You couldn’t disrespect us if you tried.”\n\nImage via Bitcoin Uncensored\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Within Spain’s 7,000 ATMs, a person can convert their bitcoin into fiat currencies and vice versa, helping to push the country into the digital world.\n\nHolyTransaction has teamed up with HalCash, a global electronic platform that allows users, both banked and unbanked, to send and receive money, nationally and internationally, instantly and securely. This means that any banks linked to the HalCash network can convert bitcoin into Euros and withdraw cash from the banks ATMs.\n\nSpeaking to CCN, Francesco Simonetti, CEO of HolyTransaction, said:\n\nWe started working with HalCash and a local payment processor to enable the withdrawal of cash for HolyTransaction’s Spanish customers. [We] then decided to help expand HalCash’s network to more countries.\n\nOn top of Spain the HalCash network also includes Poland, bringing the total number of ATMs that can convert bitcoin and Euros up to more than 10,000.\n\nWith the use of Teleingreso, a fast and secure payment processor, an individual can purchase bitcoin through its network of over 3,000 ATMs, 2,000 post offices, and 300 retail stores.\n\nBy selecting Teleingreso as the preferred online payment method, a person will receive a unique nine-digit code, which enables a payment to be made after visiting any of the networked ATMs to make a payment.\n\nBitcoin on the Rise After 2008\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, which saw many European economies including Spain’s fall into decline, many people started seeking alternative measures that didn’t require traditional banking methods.\n\nSimonetti states that the rise of bitcoin in Spain has increased since then with bitcoin continuing to advance in the Spanish nation.\n\nSince a lot of people lost their houses during the financial crisis, more people started to look into bitcoin in order to live without using a bank.\n\nIn October last year, a report from Europa Press found that AMETIC, an information technology foundation in Spain, had announced that there was a need for the Spanish government to form a Ministry of Economy and Digital Society. It was reported that this was to help define the digital strategy for Spain.\n\nSimonetti believes, however, that it is down to the regulated environment and the readiness of local banks to help with bitcoin services that is helping to drive the digital currency in the country.\n\nWhat Next?\n\nTo use HolyTransaction a person doesn’t require a wallet on the platform and doesn’t require registering either. However, if they already have a wallet from a different wallet provider this can be used on HolyTransaction.\n\nCustomers of the exchange also have the opportunity of creating a prepaid virtual Visa card with bitcoin that enables them to buy anything they want online with most e-commerce shops accepting Visa payments.\n\nAccording to Simonetti the recently launched platform has attracted thousands of customers from around the world, but he points out that they have plans to grow the company.\n\nWe plan to expand to India soon. The list of available countries will grow with Mexico, U.S., and Columbia within the year as well, making it possible to sell bitcoin within those countries.\n\nFeatured image by Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Almost immediately after the announcement of Brexit, Bitcoin and Blockchain startups started thinking of leaving Britain to other Fintech hubs such as Germany and Belgium. To prevent a shortage of Fintech startups and talents in the country, London is forming a Fintech bridge with Belgium’s financial sector.\n\nEarlier this week, Belgium’s finance minister and a delegate from the Belgian Fintech sector entered into a strategic partnership with Innovate Finance, a non-profit industry body serving the Fintech community of the UK.\n\nSources revealed that the Belgian government-owned platform “B-Hive” signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Innovative Finance to ensure that Fintech startups from both countries collaborate with each other for the development and commercialization of innovative financial technologies.\n\nBelgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt stated:\n\n""London is the financial sector of Europe – there’s a lot of infrastructure...there\'s a huge talent pool that is there, there\'s the capital availability that is there, so of course even with Brexit, that won’t go away just like that. It’s an important change but we should not underestimate the resilience of London as a financial (and Fintech) center.""\n\nNew Ecosystem\n\nIn July of last year, many German agencies, research firms and politicians echoed the sentiments of Senator Cornelia Yzer, who told her audience at London Fintech Week 2016 that over 100 startups were considering moving to Berlin post-Brexit.\n\nStartups and entrepreneurs expressed their concerns towards the lack of connection between the UK and European countries, which is presumed to limit the growth of the Fintech industry significantly.\n\nIn particular, Yzer emphasized that Berlin is ahead of London due to the willingness of international funds to support local German startups. Brexit effectively restricted the level of investment international investment firms could make to startups in the country.\n\nYzer said:\n\n""Sorry to say we also were ahead of London. This will probably improve. Most of the money came from international funds of course; those who are based in London today, many of them have money from the European Investment Fund, in some cases the investment fund is the anchor investor.”\n\nIn consideration of Belgium’s position in the European Fintech industry and their influence over the EU, it is likely that some considerable changes will be made within the financial sector of Brexit. Fintech, Blockchain and Bitcoin startups will see light in terms of investments and the establishment of international connections.']"
01/16/2017,"['China is at the center of Bitcoin as it should be. After all, most of the world’s Bitcoin is mined and traded there. However of late, the Chinese Bitcoin scene has a new persona on the stage and that is the country’s almighty central bank, the People’s Bank of China hereinafter PBOC.\n\nThe PBOC has of late issued two statements, one on Jan. 11, 2017 and the other on Jan. 6, 2017 both of which have sent Bitcoin falling from the early January highs the currency had achieved above the $1,000 mark. So what is prompting the PBOC to take an interest in Bitcoin and what is the likely outcome of this interventionist approach?\n\nPBOC has a point\n\nThe last fall in Bitcoin did more than just terrify their investors, it actually hurt. In an article in the South China Morning Post, the author Xie Yu cites the case of Ding Wen, a 34-year old man who lost 40 percent of his investment in Bitcoin as he was unable to log into his Huobi account.\n\nDing Wen was using leveraged betting to invest in Bitcoin. As Xie Yu writes:\n\n“Now speculation, derivative products, leveraged betting and program trading appear to be spreading in the largely unregulated Bitcoin market. Such practices are thought to be responsible for pushing up the price of Bitcoin by more than 260 percent since early 2016.”\n\nThat is not all. China Daily also cited a Bitcoin trader Ma Yuanchuan who also lamented:\n\n“Sometimes platforms suspend trading when prices plunge. For investors, this could mean a significant loss if they cannot sell and withdraw immediately.”\n\nLet us be honest here: if the PBOC has found a reason to investigate these exchanges, it is because of the laxity on their part. People not being able to log into their accounts to execute trades is a serious lapse. However, now that they have the opportunity the PBOC can also serve their other purpose.\n\nA Chinese ‘custodian’ of Bitcoin\n\nSCMP quoted The China Securities Journal, which is sponsored by China’s official news agency Xinhua, “Regulators have noticed that some Bitcoin platforms crashed during the recent market volatilities, causing some investors, particularly those trading with leverage tools, to bear huge losses because they were unable to log on to the website during the sell off.”\n\nThe newspaper further added that there is a discussion among Chinese regulators and industry insiders about improving trading security by setting up third-party custodian platforms on the Bitcoin market.\n\nNow you can argue all about the ridiculousness of a custodian service or the likely benefits or disadvantages of having one but the very idea that PBOC and Chinese regulators are mulling it over considers the level of control they can exercise over Bitcoin at least within their own borders.\n\nGiven that most of the Bitcoin world is presently in China, the impact would be felt far beyond the Chinese frontiers if such action was to be taken by the authorities.\n\nKill one, terrify a thousand\n\nSun-Tzu said these famous words and they stand true to this day.\n\nIt may not be the Chinese central bank’s intention to destroy Bitcoin or to control it. It may just be to give a gentle reminder to everyone that they can cause it go crashing down.\n\nNo, it was not the media reports including any report from us that sent prices down, it was the PBOC. This is an undeniable fact.\n\nWas the famously opaque central bank issuing these press releases for routine inspections as a matter of course? Was there anything sinister intent behind their motivations to cause a decline in Bitcoin? Will this volatility induced by PBOC lead people to feel jittery over Bitcoin?\n\nRemember Bitcoin had been fairly stable for 2016 before these helpful and friendly statements of PBOC. If there is some explaining to do over this, it should not come from the targets of the ‘investigation’ but it should come from the central bank itself. If it was a routine on-site or off-site inspection, they could have gone around it without making any announcement but they chose to do so in this case and that is the question at the center of this all.\n\nChina is the Middle Kingdom for Bitcoin\n\nFor the foreseeable future, there is no escaping from China if you live in Bitcoin land. No India is not going to be an alternative.\n\nThe ground situation in India is simply not conducive as of yet to become a Bitcoin alternative. China and India both have the same issue of capital controls. Indian capital controls are even more restrictive. Add to that the lack of infrastructure and the high temperatures that make mining difficult.\n\nAs Kumar Gaurav, Founder & CEO at Cashaa, Auxesis Group says:\n\n“India is certainly not an ideal destination for the mining farms which produce enormous amounts of heat and lack of electricity, but necessity is the mother of invention. Also, Solar power in India is a fast-growing industry, and especially last year initiatives of PM Narendra Modi has fuelled the ambitious Solar projects. Undoubtedly, this will bring down the cost of electricity in India. But more than that current movement around Bitcoin and recently Blockchain are picking up and no surprise if we see some investment in the mining sector. Mining has become a need due to the Bitcoin market dynamic to meet the local Indian demands, no matter what premium it requires.”\n\nSo that leaves us with China and if the Bitcoin culture in China has to survive, it is more than likely it will have to play by the rules laid out by PBOC. We are entering an era of centralisation of a decentralized currency. Brace yourselves.', 'Image: Flickr/Images Money\n\nIn November of 2016, the Internal Revenue Service ordered bitcoin trading company Coinbase to hand over the identities of millions of customers who made transactions through the company over three years, to find out who hasn\'t been paying their taxes.\n\nNow, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has suggested in a Medium post that the company will go to court with the IRS, writing, ""...it appears we will be forced to contest [the subpoena] in court to protect our customers\' privacy, at great expense.""\n\nOnline bitcoin exchanges are the key point of access for people buying or selling bitcoin. Coinbase, founded in 2012, is one of the oldest and largest.\n\nThe IRS ordered Coinbase to turn over the identities of all US customers who used the exchange between 2013 and 2015, in order to determine whether users have been paying taxes on their bitcoin.\n\nRead More: How Coinbase Traders Are Fighting Back IRS Attempts to Reveal Their Identities\n\nThe summons has been highly controversial in cryptocurrency circles since it would reveal the identities of many people not under active investigation, and who haven\'t broken any laws. People do pay taxes on bitcoin (or they\'re supposed to), and according to the IRS, virtual currencies are treated like property for federal tax purposes.\n\n""Asking for detailed transaction information on so many people, simply for using digital currency, is a violation of [customers\'] privacy, and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective,"" Armstrong wrote.\n\nArmstrong also suggested an alternate way forward for Coinbase and the IRS, which he writes is for all US bitcoin users to pay their taxes: Coinbase would send a yearly tax form that is commonly used by stock brokers to report financial gains or losses to customers and the IRS, he argued.\n\nMotherboard reached out to the IRS for comment on whether this proposal is realistic, but hasn\'t received a response.\n\nBut this proposal still wouldn\'t help the IRS to understand whether past Coinbase customers paid their taxes. So, if Coinbase is planning to stick to their word, it looks like the company may be headed to court.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.\n\n', 'The Israeli Tax Authority has issued an official draft circular to clarify the tax guidelines that apply to bitcoin adopters.\n\nIn an announcement last week, the Israel Tax Authority released its draft [PDF] on the proposed taxation of virtual currencies which are considered “assets”. Pointedly, the announcement also cites the Bank of Israel – the country’s central bank – which does not see bitcoin or virtual currencies as foreign currencies and will, therefore, be taxed according to existing fixed tax rates.\n\nAn excerpt from the announcement reads:\n\n[Bitcoin] will be considered in accordance with the Income Tax Ordinance as “assets” and their sale will be taxed as a sale of “property.” Income from their sale will be classified as capital income and capital gains will be taxed according to fixed tax rates.\n\nFurther, the income of individuals working in bitcoin trading or mining will be taxed in business tax rates.\n\nAccording to a report in Finance Magnates, translated details of the draft reveal key findings including significant tax numbers. Broadly speaking, the draft proposes policies that could ultimately prove a hindrance toward bitcoin adoption and usage among individuals and businesses in Israel.\n\nFor instance, individual users will be required to pay the country’s capital gains tax of 25% every time they sell bitcoin. Exchanges and businesses trading virtual currencies will be required to charge a 17% VAT upon their clients.\n\nBesides the tax disadvantages, companies will be discouraged from receiving bitcoin payments as settlements for services. AS the report reveals, bitcoin’s lack of status as a ‘currency’ means that companies receiving payments with the cryptocurrency will be required to classify it as a ‘barter’ rather than a payment before dealing with the necessary paperwork.\n\nThe draft is a result of repeated queries from the cryptocurrency community in Israel about its taxation status, the authority added. There is currently no timeline if or when the draft’s proposed tax guidelines could be implemented by the government.\n\nIsrael’s tax guidelines for bitcoin users in the country is in contrast to the stance increasingly taken by other countries around the world. For instance, Japan will end its 8% consumption tax rate imposed on bitcoin buyers in the country. The Australian Government is currently debating if bitcoin can be treated as “money” as the country looks to kill the goods and services tax (GST) with bitcoin transactions that saw a ‘double taxation’ levied on digital currencies in the country.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'High-Speed Traders Dominate Bitcoin\n\nForget libertarians, speculative individual investors and Chinese savers trying to spirit money overseas. The reality is that professionals armed with cutting-edge technology now drive as much as 80 percent of bitcoin trading, mimicking strategies honed by some of the biggest players on Wall Street. To them, bitcoin is just the latest asset class ripe for conquering with machines. Bloomberg\'s Lulu Chen has more on ""Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia."" (Source: Bloomberg)', ""Recent Bitcoin price behavior, due to the happenings in China, has raised the question of whether the digital currency can survive without the support of the world’s largest country where a majority of its related activities are considered to be taking place.\n\nHowever, insiders’ views and a keen look at the turn of events show that China has presented the world with an exemplary opportunity to make the Bitcoin market less dependent on it.\n\nThere have been talks about a regulatory framework in the making not just in China but other parts of the world. The debate has started on how far a government can go to ban Bitcoin use in its jurisdiction. The recent drop in Bitcoin price has also encouraged a somewhat form of redistribution of wealth as some reports say the low price of Bitcoin made it possible for some new users in countries in India, South America and parts of Africa to lay their hands on the coins.\n\nFrom cash to cashless\n\nIn short, it demonstrates that when governments can't make something illegal, they bring it into their fold. It has seemed friendlier to embrace Bitcoin in the United States, European Union, China, Russia and Japan.\n\nCountries now tend to see the opportunities Bitcoin presents to them to meet the needs of a growing middle class and those people moving from cash to cashless.\n\nNote it is not a single nation that has gotten involved. Though China still has the upper hand in terms of the early adoption, several countries are getting involved in Bitcoin related activities going be new information emerging with time.\n\nChina’s dominance does not translate to control\n\nAccording to the COO of Remitsy and organizer of Beijing Bitcoin Meetup, Neil Woodfine, China’s huge trade volume has been misleading and the country’s dominance in Bitcoin mining does not translate to control. He also argued that thinking in terms of nation-states does not work when it comes to Bitcoin.\n\nWoodfine states that Bitcoin’s value proposition is too great to just disappear even in the worst-case scenario that Chinese exchanges were closed down, or Chinese traders got bored and moved onto another hyped asset.\n\nFor the CEO of DECENT, Matej Michalko, told Cointelegraph on China’s perceived grip on the entire crypto-world:"", ""Despite slow adoption, many Nova Scotians believe blockchain has a bright future.\n\n“I believe blockchain is a big deal, more than bitcoin, and is likely here to stay,” says Jesse Rodgers, CEO of Halifax-based Volta Labs. “The idea of a distributed ledger that you get with blockchain shows promise in a variety of capital applications. The technology can remove a large corporate authority from being the bottleneck or high-priced service with transactions.”\n\nA blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions on thousands of computers globally. The online transactions are secure and cannot be altered retrospectively.\n\n“Blockchain appears to be the digital ledger for the modern time,” says Rodgers. “The Canadian banks are experimenting with this technology.”\n\nTD Bank, for one, announced in 2016 they plan to implement blockchain technology in trading operations. Bitcoin usage fell 33 per cent in 2016.\n\n“I think if I were a business that stored records, I would want to understand bitcoin and spend some time finding ways to apply blockchain,” says Rodgers. “For banks, it is a threat to their business around service fees as Blockchain would remove the need for a lot of their service.”\n\nBitcoin is a form of digital currency — or crypto currency — touted for its security. Volta Labs hosted a workshop on bitcoin and blockchain on Jan. 12.\n\n“At the start of 2016 there was a lot of talk about whether bitcoin was dead or if it was going to take off,” says Rodgers. “It does not look like it will replace currency in the near term but it also doesn't seem to be going away. The future of crypto currency is certainly yet to be determined.”\n\nBitcoin ATMs have appeared in a few places in Halifax such as Dalhousie University and Durty Nelly’s but many have now disappeared.\n\n“Studies at MIT have found that bitcoin is not that popular with students and I don’t think it’s all that popular generally outside of the group of early adopters,” says Rodgers. “That is not to say it is not a large group of people but I don’t think it has jumped into the popular realm as yet.”\n\nHe says he doesn’t know how many Nova Scotian companies accept bitcoin.\n\nHalifax-based startup Peer Ledger provides blockchain identity services to enterprises so they can deploy useful blockchain applications, such as track-and-trace. The company provides a bridge between the latest blockchain identity-management technology and clients’ existing security solutions.\n\n“Blockchain technology is a game-changer,” says Dawn Jutla, president and CEO of Peer Ledger. “Blockchain is an electronic ledger that can be distributed between people or groups. These parties have a lot of flexibility in what they do with the ledger, though it’s best known for directly transferring money (in the form of bitcoin) without a third party. What is ironclad is there is a permanent record of who accessed these ledgers and what they did, guaranteeing security of the transaction. Blockchain transactions create a tamper-proof log, which means they decrease fraud.”\n\nThe ledger records a person’s holdings as digital assets, Jutla says. These digital assets can be tied to a currency, gold, diamonds, securities, a house or a car — anything that has value and can be exchanged, she adds.\n\n“Carrying out transactions with these digital assets can be enhanced with the use of smart contracts, which are available from a range of sources, including Montreal-based Blockstream,” says Jutla. “Smart contracts let corporations connect events and data and take automatic action. They manage automatic work-flow execution and make operations more efficient.”\n\nThe 2014 Ivany Report calls on Nova Scotia to increase the number of startups and exports.\n\n“A lot of businesses see blockchain as the next big thing,” says Jutla. “So companies across all industries are experimenting with blockchain technologies to set off a new wave of innovation in various operations.”\n\nFor example, blockchain applications can enable an organization like the Canadian Blood Services to know which patient has received its blood product and how the patient reacted to it, she says.\n\n“This type of capability could revolutionize patient care,” Jutla says.\n\nFollow @NOWNovaScotia"", 'The bitcoin price may be stuck in the $800s for some time, a new investor note from Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment (GABI) argues.\n\nPublished today, the note finds one of the technology\'s more well-known hedge funds (led by ex-JP Morgan trader Daniel Masters) asserting that the market is ""temporarily broken"" after rising to near all-time highs of more than $1,100 at the start of 2017.\n\nOverall, the firm projects that bitcoin\'s price is likely to continue to be volatile, and that further gains could remain elusive due to the uncertainty that it expects in the aftermath of the decline.\n\nThe note reads:\n\n""The extreme move and the damage no-doubt done to a number of latecomers to the market will mean that no clear trend will emerge in the very short term. We believe that we will see a series of failed rallies fueled by new players, of whom many perceive bitcoin as \'cheap\' relative to recent highs.""\n\nIt continues: ""In short, the price isn’t going anywhere fast.""\n\nThat said, GABI is bullish on digital currency as an asset class long term.\n\nOf note is that it believes there is the possibility bitcoin could see another breakout in 2017, with a ruling on a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) snapping the market out of the doldrums.\n\nAs reported last year, the SEC is expected to rule on two applications, one by the New York-based investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the other by New York-based startup SolidX, as soon as this March.\n\nGABI goes on to suggest that its buyers accumulate bitcoin in advance of the expected rulings, and to establish long positions for when the time comes.\n\n""There is room for a considerable upside during the last three quarters,"" the note reads.\n\nThe findings follow a separate note from investment banking and asset management firm Needham & Co, which contends that the Winklevoss filing has a less than 25% chance of being approved.\n\nStill, it projected that an approval would be a boon for the market, attracting as much as $300m in capital in the first week of trading alone.\n\nLeverage to blame\n\nYet, the note was also critical of a bitcoin market it identified as still insufficient for the needs of an expanding investor base.\n\nAccording to the note, bitcoin traders should have been aware that the market was in for what it termed an ""impending collapse"" due to what it framed as the industry\'s acceptance of out-of-control leveraged trading.\n\nThe note goes on to break down offerings from both BitMEX, a Hong Kong-based leveraged trading specialist and Beijing-based OKCoin, one of the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange firms, noting the disparities between the two models.\n\nOverall, it pointed to a lack of standardization as a culprit, noting that exchanges offer ""divergent funding rates"" that are often based on little more than the risk tolerance of its users.\n\nIt also painted the wider market as one that was forcing investors to consider bitcoin due to the possibility of large returns.\n\n""Chinese investors and speculators – who are faced, as previously noted many times, with weak domestic currency, stocks, credit and commodity markets – turned to bitcoin as a non-correlated investment and speculative opportunity,"" it reads.\n\nThe note concludes:\n\n""Wherever you looked around the bitcoin ecosystem in early January, the message was clear.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', ""Although far from ubiquitous, bitcoin ATMs are a lot more common these days than they used to be. BLUE1647 has one, as do a number of currency exchanges and convenience stores across the city. One bitcoin ATM is even located inside a Chicago brewery taproom.\n\nConsidering the cryptocurrency’s high-tech backbone, the idea of going to a physical location to exchange pieces of paper for bitcoins may feel strangely anachronistic. But, as it turns out, there are good reasons why hard cash is still part of the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n“Once I send bitcoin to somebody, I have no way of getting it back,” said Jonathan Solomon, co-founder and CEO of Chicago bitcoin startup Digital Mint. “It’s the same as putting $100 in an envelope and dropping it into a blue mailbox.”\n\nMost forms of digital transactions, like credit card payments and bank transfers, can be disputed after the fact — which is bad news if you've already handed over a bitcoin. To protect themselves, many vendors put strict limits on transaction sizes, or put transactions on hold until they've cleared through the bank.\n\nBy completing transactions in cash, bitcoin ATMs can deliver a customer's bitcoins immediately. Solomon and co-founder Marc Grens say the instantaneous transaction is one of their company’s biggest selling points.\n\nFounded in 2014, Digital Mint was born out of a hobby project. Solomon moved to Chicago in 2013 and started attending bitcoin meetups that he described as “10 characters meeting in a mall food court.” It didn’t take long, however, until the Chicago bitcoin scene started taking off.\n\n“We held a meetup where you could actually buy things with bitcoin,” said Solomon. “I think that was sort of a catalytic event, because you could go to this bar and buy pizza and beer with an app that I developed.”\n\nThe Chicago bitcoin scene has since exploded. Chicago hosted its first bitcoin conference in 2014, and held another the following year. 2015 was also the year Chicago’s first cryptocurrency incubator — Chicago Bitcoin Center, where Solomon serves as executive director — opened its doors inside 1871.\n\nFor Digital Mint’s co-founders, what started off as a hobby project of owning a bitcoin ATM or two soon turned into a full-fledged business. Today, the startup has nine full-time employees, operating 50 ATM and teller locations in nine states across the country. Some of the ATMs even let customers withdraw cash for their bitcoins.\n\n“Our goal is to cover every inch of the United States, and then to expand overseas as much as we can,” said Grens.\n\nAlthough they are open to branching into other cryptocurrencies, Digital Mint’s founders said they are currently focusing on bitcoin because it is the only digital currency that has gained real traction so far. Companies like Microsoft, Steam and Overstock.com already take bitcoin, and Uber switched to bitcoin-based payments in Argentina last summer after regulators blocked credit card companies from working with it inside the country.\n\nBitcoin has also come to take on a similar role in the cryptocurrency world to that of the U.S. Dollar in traditional markets.\n\n“Bitcoin is viewed as the reserve currency for all other digital currencies, and many people buy bitcoin first in order to purchase other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, and many others entering in the market,” said Grens.\n\nGrens and Solomon said they’re excited to see the interest expressed by tech companies and traditional consulting firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG around the currency. But payments are only one use case for bitcoin technology. In November 2016, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds announced its plans to study how it could use the currency’s underlying distributed ledger system to track property transfers.\n\nThe pair briefly considered getting into consulting to help businesses get a handle on bitcoin, but they eventually decided to keep their focus on growing Digital Mint instead.\n\n“We’re growing, and we’re looking for talented marketing and business development people, as well as for technologists with Ruby on Rails experience,” said Grens. “It’s kind of open-ended. If we find somebody we like, we’ll grab them.”\n\nImages via Digital Mint and Twitter.\n\nWhat's your company's story? Let us know with a tip or a tweet @BuiltInChicago"", 'Pavel Kravchenko is a decentralized systems expert, public speaker and the founder of Distributed Lab, a startup dedicated to bringing open-source blockchain to the financial sector.\n\nIn this CoinDesk opinion piece, Kravchenko offers a rebuttal to a feature penned by Ferdinando Ametrano, titled ""Why 2017 Will Prove \'Blockchain\' Was a Bad Idea"", arguing that while the enterprise blockchain industry has yet to gain real traction, that doesn\'t mean it\'s failed.\n\nWe all tend to have similar assumptions about the future.\n\nIf you were to poll financial industry experts, the majority would agree that by 2050 sending payments will be as easy as WhatsApp messaging.\n\nWe all (on some level) believe payments will be digital and instant – money transfers will be free, transactions will be private, the origin of funds will be provable, and that the user will be the ultimate owner of his or her funds.\n\nWhere you\'ll run into arguments, is whether or not \'bitcoin\' or \'blockchain technology\' is the right tool to bring about this change.\n\nVested interests\n\nFirst, a step back. When bitcoin appeared, it looked like a prototype for the future.\n\nBitcoin transfers were almost instant, cheap (even for microtransactions), kind of private (until you dug deeper) and transparent (until we saw Monero), and users (mostly) had sole control over their funds.\n\nThere were some who, seeing these attributes, were quick to herald that bitcoin was the path to this bright future. There was a catch, though: it was generally those who were most heavily invested in bitcoin that were saying bitcoin would be widely used.\n\nIn the process, this group assumed bank fees, regulation, wealth inequality and the risk of the failure of third parties in finance would be enough to convince the average Joe to follow suit.\n\nBut even though bitcoin has amassed an $18bn market cap and hundreds of millions people have heard about it, it is not yet in widespread use.\n\nEdge cases\n\nThat\'s not to say it has failed. Rather, I would argue bitcoin is succeeding, but not where it\'s original supporters had hoped. If you look at this report from Chainalysis, you will see that the majority of bitcoin is used for speculation or in the \'gray economy\'.\n\nThere are a few reasons for that: there is actual utility for bitcoin in the gray economy, bitcoin’s legal status is not well clarified in many countries, it still displays high volatility, and its public reputation is not that positive.\n\nTo sum it up with a generalisation, most \'bad\' people don’t use bitcoin because they expect that it will be legal, and most \'good\' people don’t use bitcoin because they expect it will become illegal.\n\nOn the other hand, even in the gray economies, there is huge potential for bitcoin to grow. Far from being marginalized, bitcoin could find a real role here in facilitating global commerce.\n\nBitcoin is a great invention, and has big potential.\n\nIt solves one important problem: the need for fast, cheap, trustless, anonymous, international money transfer, and it solves it really well.\n\nThe hype\n\nBut, bitcoin isn\'t for banks. Even if some of them liked bitcoin, they can\'t use it. In its place, then, they have focused on how decentralized systems could actually be used to handle precious assets and provide self-governance.\n\nIn 2015, tech dreamers and bitcoin enthusiasts began eyeing bank budgets, and all of a sudden, bitcoin was transformed.\n\nThese people invented the term \'blockchain payment\', and instead of talking about a \'digital currency\', chose the more politically acceptable term.\n\nHowever, a lot of confusion resulted from the fact that \'blockchain\' was understood differently by different people.\n\nDepending on who you\'d you ask, it could mean: the bitcoin blockchain, blockchain as a technology, or a specific implementation of blockchain tech.\n\nAdding this confusion of meaning, the mainstream media was extremely careless with the terminology.\n\nThe above definition mixes up the bitcoin blockchain with the pure technology and creates overblown and incorrect expectations.\n\nIs it any wonder why we now have groundless hype?\n\nPushback\n\nObviously, when people who understand what blockchain is hear something like ""bank Y will adopt payments on blockchain"" or ""blockchain is an immutable record of tracked changes"", they can\'t help but become a bit irritated.\n\nBlockchain, defined broadly, is a mechanism for reaching consensus regarding the state of a shared ledger between an unknown number of parties who don’t trust each other. But, \'blockchain\' has become a chimera sent to solve all the problems banks and governments have today.\n\nThe real irony is that private blockchain solutions haven\'t evolved from the advanced database technologies that have been around for some time.\n\nBut \'blockchain\' has done one thing well, too – that is, show how big the market for core banking, processing and wallet software is.\n\nBanks do realize they have to modernize their technology, and thanks to bitcoin, they understand that something can be changed soon. It\'s just that, in banking, there are no multiple parties that don\'t trust each other.\n\n\'Blockchain\' doesn’t mean \'decentralization\' for the financial industry, it means \'changes and innovation\'.\n\nFailed so far\n\nJust a few companies, however, have developed some blockchain mechanisms to test how change and innovation could be achieved.\n\nUnfortunately, these are generally more expensive than current database technologies. They might improve the efficiency of some of their processes, but on an organization level, there won\'t be any significant effect.\n\nApplying standard business approaches to the \'blockchain industry\' – patents, proprietary components – have been just as misguided.\n\nFor example, in the computer industry, every consumer device, regardless of the producer, is able to operate on the Internet. This is true for Linux, eTorrent, Android, bitcoin – all of which generated global change because they were open source and license free.\n\nWhat the financial industry needs are products that share the same philosophy, just like the Internet needed Apache web server and the TCP/IP stack.\n\nNot over yet\n\nThis is why I believe it\'s too early to declare bitcoin the winner – not every invention is used as intended.\n\nIndeed, on further scrutiny, the comparison doesn\'t hold much water. (It would be like comparing C++ and WindowsXP or HTTP and WhatsApp).\n\nThe codebases powering blockchain projects will lead to crypto-based account management, synchronization between databases, proofs of integrity of history and decentralized reconciliation. Yes, you can build these things using old methods, but the presence of blockchain codebase will reduce the time needed to do so.\n\nEven in this regard, it is clear that blockchain technology has much wider implications than databases. Because of this promise, technological research should continue in earnest on consensus protocols, cryptography, smart contracts and databases.\n\nThe inevitable evolutionary process of the market will weed out the substandard business models and only leave standing those that create real and lasting value.\n\nIronically, though, there will be change.\n\nMost of the blockchain projects that survive will transform into enterprise software companies with all the related consequences (just look at Coinbase – it became a bank).\n\nThere is a high expectation of a coming revolution in the financial industry – and \'blockchain-based\' products are likely to become a foundation of it.\n\nHowever, I would argue we should keep our eyes on that bright future we all see ahead.\n\n\'Blockchain\' may not change our lives, but it will inspire open software that will.\n\nAlarm clock image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

With the stated aim of focusing on the ‘big things’, Juncker outlined ten key areas in which he wanted ‘the EU to make a difference and deliver concrete results for citizens.’\n\nEntitled The Juncker Commission’s Ten Priorities: State-of-Play at the Start of 2017 [PDF], the ten policy priorities are:\n\nA new boost for jobs, growth and investment A connected digital single market A resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy A deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base A deeper and fairer Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) A reasonable and balanced free trade agreement with the United States An area of justice and fundamental rights based on mutual trust Towards a new policy on migration Europe as a stronger global actor, and A union of democratic change.\n\nWhen Juncker took office on November 1, 2014, all ten priorities were adopted by the Commission during the first year. After more than two full years since taking office, the European Commission is approaching the midway point of its mandate. In this latest report, however, it mentions, for the first time digital currencies, calling them virtual currencies.\n\nLooking at the Role of Digital Currencies\n\nIn the previous publication, State of Play in Mid-2016, the report doesn’t make any mention of digital or virtual currencies.\n\nIn this latest report, though, it mentions the currency under priority seven under the area of fighting terrorism.\n\nIn July, 2016, the European Commission proposed stricter rules for the use of digital currencies targeting amendments to the 2015 Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, bringing an end to the anonymity associated with digital currency transactions.\n\nIn the report, it states:\n\nThe issues addressed include safeguards for financial flows from high-risk third countries, EU financial intelligence units’ powers, centralized national bank and payment account registers, and risks linked to virtual currencies and anonymous pre-paid cards.\n\nThe amendments seek to impose stricter rules on virtual currencies, including bitcoin, so that terrorism financing and anonymous payments are reduced.\n\nAt the end of the report, European Parliament President Martin Schulz, Council President Robert Fico, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared that ‘better protecting the security of our citizens’ will be one of the top ten points receiving priority treatment to ensure substantial progress by the end of 2017.\n\nOne of the ways this can be achieved is ‘improved instruments to criminalize terrorism and fight against money laundering and terrorist financing,’ which is where digital currencies fall under.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
01/17/2017,"['Coinbase, the most well-known bitcoin exchange in the U.S., filed court papers last week to support a challenge to an IRS demand that the startup turn over information about millions of customers’ accounts. The IRS had cited a “suspicion [the group] includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law.”\n\nThe legal filing by Coinbase comes after one its customers sued the IRS in December, claiming the agency’s demand is too broad and sweeps in too many customers who have done nothing wrong.\n\n“If the IRS were to approach Citibank, Fidelity, or Paypal and ask them to turn over all customer records, they would rightfully push back. And I feel we have the same obligation to do so,” wrote Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a blog post after the filing.\n\nIn its filing, Coinbase asks a federal judge to delay a hearing, currently scheduled for Thursday in San Francisco, until March so that it can have time to prepare a proper response.\n\nAccording to Armstrong, Coinbase expects the legal fight to cost it between $100,000 and $1 million, adding he believes the money would be better spent building products or hiring employees.\n\nArmstrong also argues the IRS process is unfair given that Coinbase has complied with numerous IRS subpoenas in the past, and has built tools to help its customers comply with their tax obligations. He also questions why Coinbase appears to be the only exchange targeted by the tax agency, even though it has cooperated with the IRS more than other bitcoin exchanges, including ones abroad.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe Coinbase CEO also extends an olive branch of sorts, saying the company is willing to be the first bitcoin exchange to adopt the tax reporting structure used by brokerages:\n\nI believe a good option would be to use the same third-party reporting mechanism that brokerage firms like Fidelity and Charles Schwab use today: the 1099-B form. We’d ideally like to see that structure applied evenly to all companies in the industry, but even if we’re required to go first, we’re ready to implement 1099-B reporting.\n\nIf the judge agrees to allow Coinbase to intervene in the case, and to delay the scheduled hearing until March, the company says it will offer additional arguments to those put forth by Jeffrey Berns, the lawyer and Coinbase customer who first sued in December.\n\nThere is also a strong chance Coinbase and the IRS will reach a settlement before March. As one cryptocurrency lawyer told Fortune last year, the initial demand by the agency for millions of accounts is likely no more than an opening position, meaning the IRS may eventually curtail its demands to include only larger accounts.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has been largely unaffected by the legal tussles.

Instead they make money via withdrawal charges out of the exchange. Further, these fees reduce as your trading volume increases, so this incentivizes traders to bolster this figure by buying and selling from themselves at zero cost.\n\nStill, there\'s a ocean of data coming from the markets, and they hold hidden secrets.\n\nIn this study, I\'ll peer into the data and attempt (as far as I know) the first estimate of true China-based volumes using data driven methods.\n\nStarting points\n\nFor this post, I\'ll define ""true volume"" as what the volumes would have been, had the exchanges charged a trading fee.\n\nPrior estimates (really just educated guesses) have put Chinese volumes at 50% of the global market. Let\'s see how well this compares with the data.\n\nTo begin, we must remember that China was not always a zero-fee market.\n\nBTCC, the first China-based exchange, started with 0.3% fees on trades. Likewise the second Chinese exchange, OKCoin, initially charged 0.3%.\n\nThen, on 24th September 2013, BTCC instigated what was to be a three-month experiment in zero fees. This started an arms race between all the domestic exchanges, heralding in an era of zero fees from which China has never returned.\n\nBut, how do we know the effect this had on volumes?\n\nFor one, there was an immediate spike. Expressed as a ratio to non-Chinese volume, it went from 17% to well over 100% in barely six weeks.\n\nThis visualization is useful in one other aspect.\n\nWe can see China\'s exchange volume growth was steadily increasing at a predictable rate (of about 4% week on week) before the introduction of zero fees.\n\nThis becomes our first tool to estimate true volume, as we can use this steady growth to extrapolate what volumes may have been like had this trend continued.\n\n\'Legit volumes\'\n\nNow, there is one market in China where the volumes have never been faked, LocalBitcoins, a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers connect and trade.\n\nHere’s what its volumes look like:\n\nLocalBitcoins was founded in June 2012, and you can see it gained traction rapidly. By Q4 2013, we can see it began tracking global on-exchange volumes quite well.\n\nThe exchange is also available in many countries globally, meaning each market has a ratio between “on the streets” volume and what volume their local online exchange is doing.\n\nThis ratio differs depending on local conditions, but the two will track each over over time.\n\nThis will be our second tool in our estimation strategy.\n\nWe can use LocalBitcoin\'s volume to show local market demand, and scale it up to estimate exchange volumes.\n\nPutting it together\n\nWe are now ready to reconstruct real Chinese exchange volume.\n\nThe historical estimates has three phases:\n\nReal Chinese volume before the zero fees era Chinese volumes were in a predictable growth pattern prior to the zero fees era, so we can extrapolate the growth for long enough to get us to the next phase Once LocalBitcoins entered the picture, and was given enough time for it to gain adoption, we can scale up its volumes to estimate what the exchanges should have been doing as the two are tightly correlated.\n\nThe final composite looks like this:\n\nThe Results\n\nFrom this composite, we can reconstruct the true global market volume.\n\nHere\'s the estimated true volume vs the reported volume. The differences are significant:\n\n￼\n\nExpressed as Chinese marketshare of global exchange volume, it looks like this:\n\n￼\n\nExpressed as a ratio of fake volumes to true volumes, it looks like this:\n\nYes, it\'s been almost 40x overreported at times.\n\nStill dominant\n\nPrevious educated guesses have put the real marketshare at 50%, but the data implies it\'s much higher, around 85%.\n\nChina is still the dominant players controlling bitcoin volume, but not nearly as dominant as reported volumes suggest, about 10-40x less dominant, depending on the week.\n\nData from CoinDesk Research, for example, based on publicly available data, indicates the reported figure to be 95%.\n\nIt\'s also worth mentioning that exchange volume doesn\'t make up as much of global bitcoin trade as one might assume.\n\nThe exchanges may set the prices, but most of the volume happens off exchanges in over-the-counter trades, so true globally traded volume is (supposedly) hidden.\n\nUsing similar methods to these here, I can probably make an estimate of OTC trade, but I\'ll leave that to another day.\n\nVisit Woo\'s blog to read more cryptocurrency markets coverage.\n\nFalse teeth image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

But the incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that he is under consideration for the position of heading FDA, the all-important federal agency for the drug and pharma industry.\n\nSrinivasan, along with Jim O’Neill, Managing Director of Mithril Capital Management, are being considered for positions in the FDA, Spicer told reporters.\n\nSpicer said Srinivasan currently serves as the CEO and co-founder of 21.co and is a partner in Andreessen Horowitz. He has won FDA approval as a genomics entrepreneur.\n\nI am broadly interested in new technology, with a particular focus on “real world” applications where digital bits interface with physical atoms and substantive problems, such as quantified self (healthcare), MOOCs/edtech (education), Bitcoin (finance), drones, and 3D printing, Srinivasan wrote on his LinkedIn profile.\n\nHe has also been a lecturer at Departments of Statistics, and Computer Science at the prestigious Stanford University. He is currently teaching Stanford’s Bitcoin Engineering course at bitcoin.stanford and the Startup Engineering MOOC at coursera.org/course/startup.\n\nAlso read : Meet the Indian woman whom Trump nominated to top administration post\n\nOn his website, Balaji describes himself as a computer scientist, investor, entrepreneur, and academic. He holds a BS, MS, and PhD in Electrical Engineering and an MS in Chemical Engineering from Stanford. He was the CTO and co-founder of Counsyl, a genomics startup that began in a Stanford dorm room and now tests four percent of all US births. After 10 years in genomics and five years at Counsyl, he stepped back from an executive role in November 2012 to work on other areas of technology.\n\nAlso read : Trump’s deputy assistant and communication and research director is an Indian\n\nMedia reports said Srinivasan is closely associated with Peter Thiel, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and co-founder of PayPal. He was among the few Silicon Valley leaders to have supported Trump in his presidential campaign. Srinivasan’s parents are from Chennai, who came to the US in early 70s.', 'Bitcoin is seriously considered a currency in major economies of the world, yet there is still a conservative reaction on some markets which is remarkable. Market and institutional conditions sometimes lag behind the tech opportunities but we are here to promote it.\n\nCointelegraph continues to discuss what you can do and where you can go in Russia if you want to spend your Bitcoins right now.\n\nHow Russia got a Bitcoin village\n\nWe are now witnessing the situation where Bitcoin is accepted as a form of payment in multiple big and small companies all over the world. In such a conservative business environment as Russia, no one would expect for Bitcoin to be adopted any faster. Hereby it is indeed a sign of interest when businesses take certain steps to adopt the global trend.\n\nOn the wave of the latest optimistic news from the Russian village Kolionovo, where the innovator and farmer Mr. Mikhail Shlyapnikov has put the whole business on Bitcoin exchange, one should keep in mind that not everything in the garden is rosy. For now, there are only several yet remarkable cases when happy Bitcoin owners can pay for goods and services in Russia.\n\nPioneer resellers who approve Bitcoins for payment appear sporadically on the Russian market. What are the companies that accept Bitcoins? Let us go through the list of fire-eaters in a certain order: from those who cover basic needs to some more sophisticated services.\n\nPaying for the Internet\n\nWho are we? People! What do we need? To be online! Selectel hosting provider accepts Bitcoins as well as competitors’ Litecoins for their services. They have taken Western hosting companies as a role model.\n\nYou can transfer virtual money via the OKPay payment system with no commission. The account is usually refilled within one hour.\n\nFood for thought and thoughts for food\n\nIf there is no food in one’s stomach no will to do anything, however, you can still surf the net in starving unconsciousness. There you would find out that two Subways in Moscow sell subs for Bitcoins.\n\nThe Subway franchise on Dmitrovskoe highway and Dolgoprudny owned by a go getter Mikhail Kuzmin, accepts Bitcoins. The first location choice is dubious in a sense of Bitcoin payment popularity.\n\nHowever, the second spot has Moscow Physico-Technical Institute as a neighbor, so geeky students and scientists come to eat their sandwiches for virtual money.\n\nKolionovo farm, already mentioned above, also opens up possibilities for Bitcoin owners to buy fresh products such as dairy, fish and vegetables. Located in the Moscow region they welcome everyone to buy in Bitcoins. This provides an opportunity to buy ecological food for little money.\n\nIn the past Christmas season, the owner Mr. Shlyapnikov has organized a sale of Christmas trees on the farm attracting many Muscovites. A real fur tree for a cozy celebration was selling at a price of a couple of hundredth of Bitcoin, which was transferred to the crypto wallet of the farm. Blockchain was in action and not only in high tech industry.\n\nPay cryptocurrency for fun\n\nArt spaces along with bar Klutch (KL10CH) which originally opened in St. Petersburg still continue the tradition of the Bitcoin payment extravaganza even when they moved to Moscow. Now Klutch (KL10CH) represents multifunctional spaces in three areas of Moscow where one can rent offices, use coworking and conference rooms.\n\nFurthermore, there are bars and various happenings for the creative individuals and IT people ranging from lectures and game tournaments to Geek speed dating and gigs. Bitcoin is in the right place to be the currency of exchange with great potential.\n\nTravel local and global\n\nTraveling locally within one city and paying with Bitcoins is possible when using Wheely. The taxi service started accepting Bitcoins in 2014, and according to latest information continues to do so.\n\nThe only condition is that the client should top up their balance in advance on the Wheely website. In this case, all clients are obliged to provide information of their credit card. Just in case, you know.\n\nDespite the fact that AirBaltic is a Latvian based company, we listed it here since it flies from Russian cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg. AirBaltic pioneered in accepting cryptocurrency yet for now only for budget tickets marked Basic. The payment is processed via the Bitpay system on a desktop or mobile apps with no commission.\n\nJust to be trendy\n\nThe position of Bitcoin as a legal currency being equal to all the physical money is still uncertain. Previously it was announced by the Central Bank of Russia that Bitcoin is viewed as a money surrogate and is not considered by the officials as a real money instrument.\n\nUnfortunately the initiatives of local businesses to enlist Bitcoin as a payment currency has met the resistance of officials to recognize it legally. Once the official commentaries on Bitcoin appeared, several if not the majority of companies have stopped accepting it.\n\nFor instance, Russian legendary watch producer Raketa and the bar network KillFish fell by the wayside in using Bitcoins. Raketa in 2014 and KillFish in 2015 having just started using Bitcoins closed Bitcoin payments in less than one month of use.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin in Russia\n\nWhat Russian businesses can fragmentarily hear from officials is not enough to make any conclusions. They feel unsafe using Bitcoins in commerce. In the end of 2016 the Ministry of Finance discussed Bitcoins to equal foreign currency, therefore we can figure out if the Bitcoin emission in Russia would be illegal.\n\nAt the same time, the same institute considered Blockchain technology as preliminary approved. We are just left here waiting for the further news to see what 2017 holds for Bitcoin usage in Russia.\n\nThe more companies would endorse Bitcoin remuneration the more likely Bitcoin will have official status. And, after all, the more the merrier, guys.', 'Around $1bn was invested into blockchain in 2016, but how can the technology most famous for Bitcoin be used in development and humanitarianism?\n\nWhat is it?\n\nBlockchain is a digital ledger that provides a secure way of making and recording transactions, agreements and contracts – anything that needs to be recorded and verified as having taken place.\n\nHowever, uniquely, rather than being kept in one place like the more traditional ledger book, the database is shared across a network of computers. This network can encompass just a handful of users, or hundreds and thousands of people. The ledger becomes a long list of transactions that have taken place since the beginning of the network, getting bigger over time.\n\nHow do you use it?\n\nBlockchain runs on specialised computer software that operates behind the scenes, automatically distributing information to the database as new transactions are made. Most individual users will not see a blockchain performing and this instantaneous nature means there is little to no window of time for someone to alter a transaction before it is recorded on to the ledger. Blockchain software is an area of experimentation and in June, a market assessment estimated that $1bn would be invested in blockchain technology in 2016 alone.\n\nHow is it secure?\n\nA blockchain database consists of blocks and transactions. Blocks contain batches of transactions that are “hashed” and encoded. Each block contains the hash of the block before it, which links the two and forms the chain. This process validates each block, all the way back to the original, and is integral to the database’s security.\n\nThe ultimate aim would be to track every pound in aid, from donor to recipient\n\nWhen a transaction takes place, its details are encrypted and a unique multiple-character transaction number is generated. Instead of other users in the blockchain being able to see the exact details of the transaction, this number is recorded in the ledger as a placeholder. All the users of the network will be able to see that the transaction has taken place but only the parties involved in the transaction can access and view its details.\n\nAll this makes any fraudulent activity easier to spot. An external hacker would have to gain access to every computer that holds a copy of the blockchain database, and at the same time, in order to tamper with it.\n\nWhat is it used for?\n\nBlockchain technology has been around for a number of years and its most well-known use so far is Bitcoin, the virtual currency that came to prominence in 2008. The uses of blockchain are not limited to financial transactions, though, and enthusiasts are looking into other ways applications for the technology, especially for the types of transactions where there are often disputes or trust issues, such as with land rights.\n\nWhat does it mean for development?\n\nAs an emerging technology, blockchain enthusiasts are hopeful it could be the next big development disruptor. In providing a transparent, instantaneous and indisputable record of transactions, its potential to remove corruption and provide transparency and accountability is one area of intrigue. But there are still many questions around how to apply the technology. Does blockchain really meet a need that is not already being served? And is there a market where it serves a purpose?\n\nHow could it be used in the sector?\n\nTowards the end of last year, the Start Network announced a project to trial how blockchain technology can speed up the distribution of aid funding and trace how it is spent. The ultimate aim would be to track every pound in aid, from donor to recipient.\n\nBlockchain could also be used for land tenure and property rights. Traditionally, governments keep records of who owns a certain piece of land or property, and the owner may or may not have a piece of paper to prove it. But government records can be lost or manipulated, or the government might have issued a deed to someone else for the same piece of land so two people could claim ownership for the same plot. The blockchain, however, could function as a neutral broker to determine who owns what; the chain could prove which parties are involved and what they agreed to as the original contract would have been verified by a blockchain database, and stored securely on the ledger.\n\nWould blockchain work in a country where the government frequently shuts down the internet? Probably not Ben Mann\n\nDevelopment Alternatives Incorporated (DAI) is also looking into how blockchain technology can be used in electronic medical records, which are becoming more common around the world. “There are so many people involved in the healthcare process for a single patient – hospitals, doctors, insurance companies and, in some cases, the government – so how do you make sure those records remain secure, encrypted, and that they’re not lost or corrupted?” says Ben Mann, global practice specialist at DAI. “Blockchain can act as an encryption process so that documents can be shared securely, and also ensure that documents are not altered.”\n\nWhat are the drawbacks?\n\nIn the development space, there are concerns over whether the technology is appropriate. Blockchain is resource-intensive by its nature; distributing a common digital ledger across a network requires many servers, computers and people. “Would blockchain work in a country where the government frequently shuts down the internet, where there is civil unrest, or poor energy infrastructure and rolling brown outs? Probably not,” says Mann.\n\n“We know that some governments struggle to equip their staff with basic IT equipment, let alone run expensive programmes on them. Any blockchain technology in this setting would need to be subsidised by development partners and donors … and that raises questions around sustainability.”\n\nShould we be using blockchain?\n\nIn January 2016, the UK’s chief scientific adviser urged the government to adopt the technology, and companies such as Microsoft are developing their own blockchain services. But, like any nascent technology, there are still kinks to work out, such as those around cultural acceptance and uptake, building the right infrastructure, and making sure the right levels of regulation are in place.\n\n“Bitcoin is the one solid, mostly-undisputed success story of blockchain, but there are lots of obstacles to come and we still don’t know if it can stand the test of time,” says Mann. “We’re still in the exploratory, Wild West phase of blockchain development but I am hopeful that it can serve a purpose.”\n\nIs your development or humanitarian organisation using or investing in blockchain?

The firm’s foray into the country comes after the much-publicized and controversial demonetization event that led to a crippling cash crunch. Subsequently, interest and adoption of bitcoin as a digital currency has never been higher in the country.\n\nThe lack of an authority wielding totalitarian moves has proven appealing for Indian adopters at a time when the country slowly begins to finds its feet after an unprecedented cash ban.\n\nBelfrics group CEO Praveen Kumar stated:\n\nThe element of neutrality that the blockchain can bring to the financial system, without the involvement of an intermediary or a regulatory body, is going to redefine the way in which assets are transacted.\n\nBelfrics also says that it will introduce point-of-sale (PoS) and bitcoin payment gateway protocols for online and retail merchants in India, as a means to pushing bitcoin adoption. The company further adds that there will be no charges in transacting with bitcoins for e-commerce transactions or over-the-counter settlements.\n\nThe firm says its digital currency trading platform will be accessible through desktops as well as mobile devices. There’s no word of a mobile application in the announcement.\n\nBitcoin Premiums\n\nThe launch of a new bitcoin exchange in India also comes during a time when continuing demand for the cryptocurrency sees bitcoin buying at a premium price.\n\nAt Unocoin, a major Indian bitcoin exchange that snagged a record round of funding from investors home and abroad recently, the price of a single bitcoin is INR 66,590 (approx. $978.61). With taxes and fees via the KYC-enabled exchange, the total cost of a single bitcoin is INR 67,356 or $989.87. That’s over a $100 premium when compared to current BTC/USD rates on the Bitstamp Price Index.\n\nWhile significant, the figure pales in comparison to a near 35% premium for bitcoin buying toward the end of November 2016, the month that saw the country’s demonetization drive was enforced by the Indian government. Unocoin is leading the pack of Indian bitcoin exchanges pushing for adoption with the release of mobile applications and APIs for bitcoin- and blockchain-based remittance.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', '- By Nicholas Kitonyi\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of the cryptocurrency industry is still clouded with doubt since Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has been one of the biggest critics of the market. Bitcoin is, by far, the leading unit in the cryptocurrency market and based on Buffett\'s comments over time, it is fair to say the legendary investor does not value it at all, let alone imagine a bright future ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, just after bitcoin hit an all-time high, Buffett warned investors to stay away from it, saying it was nothing more than a mirage. In response to a question regarding cryptocurrency by Dan Gilbert, the Quicken Loans founder, he said:\n\n\n\n\n\n""It\'s a method of transmitting money. It\'s a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? You can transmit money by money orders. People do it. I hope bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about bitcoin\'s future on CNBC\'s Squawk Box, Buffett said, ""Stay away from it. It\'s a mirage, basically.""\n\nTrue to his word, bitcoin lost more than 80% of its value within the following year (falling from more than $1,000 a coin in December 2013 to about $200 in January 2015). After a 12-month hiatus in 2015 however, bitcoin has since recovered to rally close to the $1,000 level.\n\nAs demonstrated in the chart above, bitcoin\'s price appears to have picked up momentum over the last 12 months in a trend that took it to above $1,000 at the start of the year. Unlike the previous rally that took the price to an all-time high, this time around the trend has been more stable, with significant trackbacks and rebounds.\n\nIn 2013, the price of bitcoin spiked from a trading price of under $250 per unit to more than $1,000 within a couple of months as traders bought bullishly in a frenzy.\n\nNow, based on the current Bitcoin price and its fluctuations over the last three years, it is safe to say the cryptocurrency has stabilized. As such, it looks as though bitcoin can be billed to have succeeded thus far. This is backed by the fact that several other companies, including BitGold and OneCoin, have launched their own types of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis also shows people are putting trust in the infrastructure used by cryptocurrency companies to generate and manage the exchange of such currencies.\n\nBlockchain, the infrastructure that supports bitcoin and several other applications, looks set to continue growing given the success of bitcoin thus far. Therefore, major technology companies like International Business Machines (IBM) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are looking to capitalize on the current bullish outlook of this technology and, as per recent reports, some are making huge investments in the market.\n\nBlockchain is a new software technology that allows businesses to work together with trust and transparency. The network allows all parties involved access to an encrypted digital record of transactions that cannot be changed.\n\nThe technology can be applied in a variety of industries, especially in the financial sector. As of 2016, the blockchain market was valued at $210 million, but is projected to grow to more than $2 billion within the next five years.\n\nSome of the biggest concerns facing bitcoin are issues regarding the security of transactions and its ability to deal with cases of money laundering. If more industries like the banking sector continue to use the same technology used by bitcoin however, this might work out to be a vote of approval for using bitcoin as a currency.\n\nNonetheless, this still does not answer Buffett\'s question on bitcoin. His keynote view was the fact that bitcoin is nothing more than a means of transmitting money, which means it is hard for it to gain intrinsic value over time.\n\nStory Continues']"
01/18/2017,"['The business management division of the People\'s Bank of China (PBOC) has reportedly released the results of a previously announced inspection of domestic bitcoin trading platforms.\n\nIn reports today, the central bank is said to have found irregularities in the operations of major bitcoin exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin that it believes were the cause of abnormal fluctuations in the price of bitcoin.\n\nSpecifically, the report concludes that the companies were found to be carrying out margin trading activities, though no details on any punishments were issued.\n\nThe reports, by China-based news source Hexun and Jiefang Daily, further state that the platforms were also found to be operating outside of anti-money laundering rules, an area of concern the PBOC previously highlighted in public releases.\n\nIt further moved to warn investors about the downside risks of purchasing bitcoin, a product considered under Chinese law to be a ""virtual good"".\n\nIn statements, members of China\'s bitcoin community (perhaps unsurprisingly) sought to downplay the findings.\n\nEric Zhao, an engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, for instance, told CoinDesk that the result was ""to be expected"", even though he acknowledged that the reports do not provide much detail on what was discovered.\n\nChina-based bitcoin mining firm founder Eric Mu, commented similarly, deriding the reports as ""nothing new"".\n\nThe news comes nearly two weeks after reports first surfaced that the PBOC had held meetings with the exchanges, a development that followed a rapid increase in the price of bitcoin at the start of 2017.\n\nAt press time, only BTCC had issued a formal response via its online Weibo account.\n\n""BTCC will continue to actively cooperate with the central bank and its associated departments and carry out rectifications.

Not only does Japan treat Bitcoin like money, it is all set to end the sales tax on purchases of cryptocurrencies this spring.\n\nWhat is more interesting lately, however, has been the surge in Bitcoin trading volumes in Japan.\n\nWhile China is easily the leader in Bitcoin volumes, what is going on with the Japanese volumes is an interesting story itself. It would come as no surprise that it closely mirrors the mysterious case of the Chinese volumes.\n\nA high volume euphoria\n\nIn order to understand what is going on in Japan, we talked with Kagayaki Kawabata (Kaga), Business Development Lead at Coincheck.\n\nHe attributed the rising volumes to the legislative initiatives to be taken soon in Japan. There is a turnaround in the perception of the Japanese around Bitcoin it seems. Kaga says,\n\n“One major factor that boosts the trading volume of Bitcoin is the new virtual currency law which will be enforced by this spring in Japan. After this announcement various large media that once negated Bitcoin started to feature Bitcoin again, this time as an innovative technology. After the Mt. Gox incident the media broadcasted Bitcoin as a tool for money laundering. Japanese national TV shows and newspapers such as NHK and NIKKEI featured stories about cryptocurrency expanding awareness to the general public, bringing in various users with a diverse background ranging from college students to the elderly.”\n\nSomething completely different\n\nThere are others though who are less sure of whether these volumes are authentic or not. The rise of trading volumes could represent something completely different.\n\nMaybe the volumes are just the salting of the mine to attract more ‘investors’. Takao Asayama, CEO of Tech Bureau Corp (Zaif Exchange) stated:\n\n“I am not so optimistic about this. Since most of the exchanges take no fees here, it makes it so easy to fake numbers for them. My estimation of the actual volume is less than 30 percent. I see this as a not so healthy situation as the market looks much bigger than what it actually is. When all gets revealed, it would look like the market size shrunk.”\n\n“Some are paying a few users a lot to make the most of the volume, and others are building order books from their own pocket. This means this chicken game would end sooner or later as their stamina drains out.”\n\n“While Bitcoin exchange startups are doing that, new Japanese laws will be implemented starting this April. As a response starting around the fall season all Forex businesses would jump start Bitcoin trade with their own existing customers. I still see this leading to chaos here, it would take some more time for the storm to go away. All I hope is what will be left is a clean and big market built under that storm. Since my primary business is Blockchain software distribution while at the same time being one of the exchanges, I am kinda enjoying observing the situation.”\n\nParallels with China\n\nThere have always been allegations that exchanges are pumping up the volume numbers in China. Just like in Japan, the Chinese exchanges take no fee either.\n\nWhile the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has come down hard on Bitcoin players in China effectively shutting down the high limit margin trading business there, things are still to catch up in Japan.\n\nAs Takao Asyama puts it, “I think Japanese Bitcoin traders see the Chinese market as a barometer for the Bitcoin price trend. It was a big headline here about that but no big reactions here. This time Chinese exchanges have quit margin trades, but Japanese regulations are not catching with that either. This means the same thing could happen here in Japan but I believe it will not be that sudden or extreme.”\n\nTaking root\n\nWhile the trading volumes may be completely misleading, the real proof of the Bitcoin pudding is in seeing how it is being used in the country. While Takao Asayama was of the view that people either use Bitcoin in day to day life either because they love it or because they want to use the crypto without exchanging it to fiat.\n\nHe thinks it would be difficult for Bitcoin and others to compete with e-money services which have millions of users but he thinks there can be another use case:\n\n“Cryptocurrency might be more useful for visitors from overseas. Any country has regulations on how much cash they can bring in. Bitcoin might help with this situation.”\n\nKagayaki Kawabata is euphoric and tells us that Bitcoin acceptance in Japan has increased phenomenally, “Many still think of Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. However, in the past few years, the situation is changing where Bitcoin is also starting to be used as a payment method. Currently, there's more than 5,000 merchants and websites that accept Bitcoin as payment. In Japan, 99 percent of them use Coincheck payment. Regarding volume, compared to January of last year the monthly volume increased by 8900 percent. This number can accelerate in next few years.”\n\nWith the Olympics due in Tokyo in 2020, Bitcoin might get a much-needed boost. As for trading volumes in East Asia, that is still an unfolding story."", ""Bitcoin has recouped a good portion of its early losses. The cryptocurrency trades down 2.8%, or almost $26, at $880 a coin as of 11:05 a.m. ET. That's a notable recovery from the drop less than $853 that occurred early in US trade. Bitcoin raced above $915 late Tuesday night but struggle to take out resistance in the $880/$920 area.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has had a volatile start to the year after gaining 120% in 2016, making it the world's top performing currency for a second straight year. It raced to a gain of more than 20% in the opening days of 2017 before rumblings that China was going to crackdown on trading began to surface.\n\nThen, nearly a week later, China announced it had begun investigating bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai on suspicion of market manipulation, money laundering, unauthorized financing, and other issues. When the dust settled bitcoin had lost 35% of its value in a handful of days. The price bottomed out after finding support in the $750/$800 area and has managed to fight its way back to the current resistance level.\n\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>"", 'Virtual currencies may be the promise of the future of finance, but the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) seems to prefer to keep things real.\n\nIn a circular distributed on Friday, the apex bank of Africa’s largest economy warned local financial institutions against doing business in virtual currencies like bitcoin as they “are not legal tender in Nigeria.” Banks who trade and exchange digital currencies do so at their own risk, CBN said. It also included Ripples, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Onecoin in its warning.\n\nThe warning by CBN is similar to notices issued by the People’s Bank of China on Jan.5 about the risks of trading in bitcoin. As a result of the warning from China, confidence in bitcoin was rocked, resulting in a sharp dip in value.\n\nWhile China appears to be worried about bitcoin being used to avoid the country’s capital controls, for its part, CBN cites the possibility of exploitation by criminals and terrorists. With transactions “largely untraceable and anonymous”, CBN claims virtual currency transactions are “susceptible to abuse by criminals, especially in money laundering and financing of terrorism.”\n\nGiven the risk of loss of money if digital currency exchange companies collapse or shutter operations, CBN says there is a “need for guidance to protect the integrity of the Nigerian financial system.” As such the apex bank has drawn up a procedural guide for local financial institutions trading in digital currencies, including ensuring effective money laundering controls and reporting suspicious transactions, “pending substantive regulation.”\n\nDescribing the CBN’s concerns as “valid,” Nonso Obikili, research associate at Economic Research Southern Africa, says the central bank’s measures can be justified. “There are significant risks around terrorism financing and other illicit flows with virtual currencies, especially due to the anonymity,” Obikili told Quartz.\n\nBut while the CBN suggests money laundering and national security as its main concerns, just like in China, the warning is seen as a pretext for capital controls. Given a prolonged dollar shortage, Nigerians have began exploring bitcoins and other virtual currencies as a workaround to access foreign exchange. NairaEx, a digital currency trader, corroborates this reality. “Trading has increased significantly in [the past] few months as more Nigerians realized the potentials of bitcoin for remittance, investment and other types of financial instrument,” a NairaEx rep told Quartz via email.\n\nCBN is also likely wary of the adoption of virtual currencies by the controversial money-making schemes such as MMM, a popular Russian Ponzi offer with over two million participants in Nigeria. Having caused panic after suspending operations last month, MMM has launched a comeback with participants now able to make and receive payments through bitcoin.\n\nObikili also agrees the apex bank’s stance on virtual currencies “might be related to a loophole which is currently being used to get around the CBN’s capital controls.” With Nigerian bank cards not working consistently outside the country, Obikili says digital currencies “have become a real alternative.”\n\nUnlike Nigeria’s Central Bank, other African countries have been more welcoming of digital currencies. In late 2015, Tunisia digitized its national currency using blockchain technology. Closer to Nigeria, fellow West African nation Senegal has announced plans to digitize its currency this year. The eCFA, as the digital currency will be called, is expected to be used across most of Francophone West Africa.\n\nRegardless of the CBN’s current motives though, long-term, Obikili advocates more flexibility by the apex bank to allow for exploring financial technology. “If the future of finance is there then you want your financial industry to be there as well, not to play catch up after the fact,” he told Quartz.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.', 'BITCOIN\n\nPrepare your popcorn—Coinbase is fighting back.\n\nThe U.S.-based bitcoin exchange finally shattered its silence two months after the Internal Revenue Service ordered it to hand over records of all transactions that took place from 2013 to 2015.\n\nLast week, California-based Coinbase filed court papers supporting a challenge to the IRS demand, which claimed that the tax agency’s order was too broad and might incriminate customers who have done nothing wrong.\n\nIn its filing, the virtual currency exchange asked a federal judge to delay the hearing—set for Jan. 19 in San Francisco—until March so the company will have enough time to prepare a proper response.\n\nIn December, a Northern California District Court judge allowed the IRS to require Coinbase to submit records of its customer transactions as part of an investigation into possible tax fraud committed by U.S. residents who engaged in business with or through the bitcoin wallet service. The Department of Justice made the request for a “John Doe” summon, which essentially identifies a person or ascertainable group or class by their activities, several weeks ago on behalf of the IRS.\n\nThat order, however, was challenged by lawyer Jeffrey Berns—a Coinbase customer himself—on grounds that the John Doe summons “would constitute an abuse of process,” describing the tax agency’s request to obtain the user records as “overboard.”\n\nNow, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is questioning why Coinbase—which he says has cooperated with the IRS in the past—appears to be the only exchange targeted by the tax agency.\n\n“If the IRS were to approach Citibank, Fidelity or Paypal and ask them to turn over all customer records, they would rightfully push back. And I feel we have the same obligation to do so,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a blog post. “Asking for detailed transaction information on so many people, simply for using digital currency, is a violation of their privacy, and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective.”\n\nIf the judge allows Coinbase to intervene in the case and move the hearing to March, the bitcoin exchange says it will offer additional arguments to those written by Berns.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nThe legal tussle between Coinbase and IRS has yet to affect the price of bitcoin, which was trading around $899 early Wednesday.\n\nComments', 'The fallout from the Israeli exchange Coin.mx’s shut down two years ago continues with three more people due to be sentenced in court next month.\n\nAmong them is the United States resident Ricardo Hill, accused of engaging in fraudulent activities while working for the exchange which orchestrated cyber attacks against companies such as JPMorgan Chase while it was operating.\n\nIn July 2015, Cointelegraph reported on the initial indictment of Coin.mx, which prosecutors believe is partly responsible for a cyber attack compromising the details of around 80 mln customers at the global accounting firm.\n\nMore pulled from Coin.mx Web\n\nNow, Hill and former operator Anthony Murgio will face charges “that included conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud,” Finance Magnates reported Wednesday.\n\nNeither is accused of hacking JPMorgan Chase and other companies directly, however, there are charges placed on seven other conspirators, including the exchange’s alleged owners Gery Shalon and Joshua Aaron.\n\nHill had previously been released on a $75,000 bond in November 2016.\n\nMurgio, his accomplice Yuri Lebedev and others were suspected of selling Bitcoins to victims of ransomware attacks, helping fund criminal activity, the FBI stated when the case first came to light:\n\n“Murgio and his co-conspirators have also knowingly exchanged cash for Bitcoins for victims of “ransomware” attacks. In doing so, Murgio, and his co-conspirators knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes, yet, in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, Murgio never filed any suspicious activity reports regarding any of the transactions.”\n\nGuilty pleas\n\nCoin.mx was in fact shielded during its operations by several front businesses, including one in the United States called Collectibles Club.\n\n“Murgio, Lebedev and their co-conspirators engaged in substantial efforts to evade detection of their scheme by operating through a phony front company, “Collectables Club,” and maintaining a corresponding phony “Collectables Club” website,” the FBI report continued,“In doing so, they sought to trick the major financial institutions through which they operated into believing that their unlawful Bitcoin exchange business was simply a members-only association of individuals who discussed, bought, and sold collectable items, such as sports memorabilia.”\n\nIt is understood that Hill and Murgio have pleaded guilty to all charges along with two other men due to face trial in February.', ""Almost all bitcoin trading is done in China.\n\nThe share of the cryptocurrency that's traded via China's mainland currency escalated over the past few years, overtaking the US dollar as the dominant currency. From less than a 10% share in January 2012, the yuan now makes up nearly 100% of all bitcoin trading.\n\nBitcoin surged 120% last year, outperforming every other currency in the world. It kicked off 2017 by rising above $1,000 for the first time since 2013.\n\nThose moves were made possible largely because of China.\n\nVolumes of bitcoin trading increased as China's foreign reserves shrank, by about 8% to $3.05 trillion in 2016. Meanwhile, the yuan weakened against the dollar, hastening the rush of money out of the country and increasing interest in bitcoin.\n\nLast week, the cryptocurrency came under pressure after China announced it was investigating exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai on suspicion of market manipulation, money laundering, and other issues.\n\nAs of 8:34 a.m. ET on Wednesday, bitcoin traded down 4.8%, or $43, near $862 per coin.

Bitcoin is\n\npotentially such a technology and much more. The fact that it can disrupt the largest and most interconnected marketplace in the world—money, banking and finance—makes it perhaps the most promising investment opportunity of our age.\n\nUnlike our current increasingly unstable and unpredictable financial system, Bitcoin has 21st century technologies at its very core.\n\nThe digital currency and clearing network is open source, mobile, peer-to-peer, cryptographically protected, privacy oriented and native to the internet. The fusion of these technologies allows for a level of security and efficiency unprecedented in the world of finance.\n\nThese are some of the areas in which Bitcoin-based technologies can directly compete:\n\n$2 trillion annual market for electronic payments.\n\n$1 trillion annual e-commerce market.\n\n$514 billion annual remittance market.\n\n$2.3 trillion hedge fund market.\n\n$7 trillion gold market.\n\n$4.5 trillion cash market.\n\n$16.7 trillion offshore deposit market.\n\nBitcoin’s potential is not going unnoticed. After it had been praised by tech moguls such as Bill Gates (“a technological tour de force”) and Gmail founder Paul Buchheit (“Bitcoin may be the TCP/IP of money”), the money started speaking. We saw investments in Bitcoin by top venture capital brass such as Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman, Fred Wilson and PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel; by billionaires such as Jeffrey Skoll (eBay cofounder) and Li Ka-shing (by all reports the richest person in Asia); by iconic executives such as Vikram Pandit (Citigroup), Blythe Masters (JPMorgan Chase) and Tom Glocer (Reuters); and most recently by large cap companies such as Google, Qualcomm, NYSE, Nasdaq, USAA (American bank and insurer) and NTT Docomo ($75b Japanese phone operator). Finally, several academic and government heavyweights have also affiliated themselves with Bitcoin companies: Larry Summers (ex-Treasury Secretary, World Bank Chief Economist), James Newsome (CFTC and NYMEX), and Arthur Levitt (SEC). The core value proposition of this network is the fact that, in the words of IBM executive architect Richard Brown, “Bitcoin is a very sophisticated, globally distributed asset ledger.” What Brown and others hint at is that Bitcoin will in the future be able to serve not only as a decentralized currency and payment platform, but also as the backbone for an “internet of property.”\n\nThis entails a decentralized global platform, smartphone-accessible, on which companies and individuals can issue, buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and a myriad of other financial assets. The effect will be to remove much of the current bureaucracy and barriers to entry, presenting a huge opportunity for the world’s 2.5 billion unbanked people.\n\nWhich raises the question: why Bitcoin, and not some other digital currency? The answer may lie in the network effect: of all the digital currencies, Bitcoin is the one with the highest adoption rate and the strongest security. The combined computing power of the Bitcoin mining industry serves as a protective firewall around the payment network. To give an idea of its size, as 21 Inc. CEO Balaji Srinivasan has pointed out, “All of Google today would represent less than one percent of mining.” In short: no other digital currency is as secure as Bitcoin. This attribute in itself attracts more capital, which in turn makes the network even more secure and performant.\n\nBecause of its robustness, the Bitcoin network is now the reference protocol for the new paradigm in finance. And just like TCP/IP became the mainstay for the internet of information, the Bitcoin network will likely become the value anchor for the internet of money and finance. Speed may be provided by offchain, lightning network, or sidechain transactions, but for the high-value transactions of tomorrow, Bitcoin could very well become the security-providing reference currency.\n\nSo, how much of all this potential is already realized? Well, from the inception of Bitcoin in 2009 until January 2011, its market cap grew to $1.5m. From there, it rocketed to $145m in January 2013, spiking to over $10 billion in January 2014, and after a two-year consolidation period, it recently regained that $10 billion market cap.\n\nDespite significant price fluctuations, year\xad-on\xad-year adoption trends markedly point upward: as of Q1 2016, there were more than 13 million Bitcoin wallets (+60 percent), and the hashrate of the network was 1,028 pth/s (+300 percent).\n\nEnticed by its great potential, investments in the Bitcoin ecosystem are taking off rapidly. In 2013, little over 40 VC deals were made that raised a total of $96 million. That number nearly quadrupled over 2014, with $335 million invested. For 2015, despite a softening VC climate, Bitcoin and blockchain startups raised a total of $490 million, an increase of 46 percent.\n\nThe value of bitcoins in circulation has been rising steadily. This can be explained mostly by the fact that it is a scarce commodity (maximum supply is 21 million) with rapidly growing utility. Here are a few possible scenarios for the future value of one bitcoin:\n\nThe scenarios projected above are, of course, not cast in stone. Bitcoin faces several risks going forward. These include:\n\nThe emergence of a much better digital currency that steals its market lead.\n\nAn undetected bug in the system.\n\nA hard fork (what happens when some nodes in the network start running a Bitcoin software upgrade that is incompatible with previous versions) causing the Bitcoin payment network to split in two.\n\nA sustained attack by an organization with substantial financial resources, such as a government.\n\nHow serious a risk do these challenges pose? Let us examine them.\n\nA better currency is possible, but experience shows that disruptive protocols—such as SMTP for email and TCP/IP for internet—have proven to be very resilient once adopted by a critical mass of the population.\n\nAs with any software application, the discovery of bugs may destabilize the system, but the open-source nature of Bitcoin allows for many eyeballs to help track problems, and many brains to help figure out a solution.\n\nA hard fork creates competition between two versions of Bitcoin, and after a period of fear and doubt, eventually the value will flow to the version deemed most useful by its users—not a long term threat in other words.\n\nAn organized attack on the network is possible but expensive, and there are many potential defense mechanisms: miners can refuse suspicious transactions or raise fees, vulnerabilities in the code can be fixed, and so forth. From the perspective of the government, approaching the robust, decentralized Bitcoin network with an outright ban is nigh impossible. Therefore taxation, regulation and acceptance seems the more likely outcome.\n\nIn any case, it seems exceedingly clear that the technology of the digital currencies is here to stay. Bitcoin does not appear to be a fad or bubble, nor merely a one-off hedge against gold. With a risk-reward proposition this attractive, holding a small percentage of bitcoins in one’s portfolio as a speculation on increased adoption may be one of the wisest investment decisions of our age.\n\n1) Source: http://tinyurl.com/HFresearch2013\n\n2) Source: http://tinyurl.com/argentine-USDcash\n\n3) Source: http://tinyurl.com/GMabovegroundgoldstock\n\n4) Source: http://tinyurl.com/worldbank2012remittances\n\n5) Source: http://tinyurl.com/ecommerceglobal\n\n6) Sources: http://tinyurl.com/VOXEUshadowecon and http://tinyurl.com/CIAworldGDP\n\n7) Source: http://mises.org/content/nofed/chart.aspx\n\n8) Source: http://tinyurl.com/HKMAoffshore\n\nTuur Demeester is founder of cryptocurrency-focused economic research firm Adamant Research and editor-in-chief of The Adamant Newsletter. He first discovered Bitcoin on a research trip to Argentina, and started recommending it as an investment at $5 in January 2012.', 'The Blockchain hype isn’t over yet say analysts at the University of Pennsylvania. If developers and companies successfully overcome regulatory and security-related hurdles in the upcoming months, the university says it is likely to see the implementation and commercialization of Blockchain in 2017.\n\nDead end\n\nBanks, financial institutions and leading multi-bln dollar corporations are struggling to deal with various conflicts in the implementation phase of Blockchain stemming from regulatory and security issues.\n\nIn order to stay on par with financial policies and money transmission regulations, it is necessary for banks or other institutions to remain in control of a network, regardless of its cryptographic or technical attributes. Because Bitcoin is decentralized in nature, banks are trying to utilize its underlying technology and remove decentralization from Bitcoin to retain control of transactions and other operations within the network.\n\nThis has always been a dead end for any major entity experimenting with Blockchain technology as they either have to build a permissioned or centralized Blockchain and compromise security or develop an immutable and decentralized Blockchain platform and decline to comply with regulations.\n\nThe traditional financial industry is a heavily regulated market. It has strict regulations and policies set in place to ensure that money is not used to fund illicit operations and any criminal activities. The failure to comply with regulations may result in blns of dollars in penalties, as seen in the recent mortgage fraud case of Deutsche Bank, in which the German company agreed to a $7.2 bln settlement.\n\nJoe Ventura, CEO of AlphaPoint, told the University of Pennsylvania that:\n\n“The truth is, once you give someone access to a network, many times, more often than not, they can end up very easily getting blanket access to that network. This is a huge security problem. Basically, you have to jump through so many hoops simply to pass the message from some party to another party.”\n\nBlockchain or database?\n\nCurrently, the Blockchain industry is being funded by venture capital firms, banks, financial institutions, angel investors and large technology firms that see great potential in the technology. However, Blockchain is still in its early stage and it is important for startups or any entity attempting to utilize Blockchain technology to ask themselves if it is the database technology they are seeking or really an immutable Blockchain platform.\n\nTyler Mulvihill, director of ConsenSys, told the university:', 'Yahoo, a technology conglomerate which recently agreed to rebrand to Altaba, short for alternative and Alibaba, published a controversial article entitled “Is Warren Buffett Wrong About Bitcoin?,” citing multi-billion dollar investor Buffet’s viewpoint on Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2014, Buffett described Bitcoin’s price rally as an illusion, calling the digital currency a mirage on CNBC’s Squawk Box. At the time, the price of Bitcoin plunged from over $1,000 to $200, mostly because of the Chinese government’s declaration of Bitcoin as a virtual good.\n\nBuffett further suggested that Bitcoin will not be able to gain intrinsic value over time as a currency. He explained that Bitcoin is only effective as a money transmission method and that it doesn’t have an actual real world value.\n\nDan Gilbert, the Quicken Loans founder, supported the claims of Buffett, stating:\n\n""It\'s a method of transmitting money. It\'s a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? You can transmit money by money orders. People do it. I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.""\n\nLumping everything together\n\nYahoo’s article suggests that still to this date, Bitcoin can be recreated. It explains that Blockchain technology has led to the introduction of more efficient money transmission methods and platforms when in reality, the Blockchain market is yet to see a commercially successful or fully implemented Blockchain project.\n\nAbsurdly, the article goes on to give two specific examples BitGold and OneCoin, out of many other cryptocurrencies that are based on legitimate cryptography such as Monero and ZCash.\n\n“As such, it looks as though Bitcoin can be billed to have succeeded thus far. This is backed by the fact that several other companies, including BitGold and OneCoin, have launched their own types of cryptocurrencies,” the article reads.\n\nWe need to talk about OneCoin\n\nOver the past few years, Cointelegraph has offered extensive coverage on OneCoin, which has proven over time has a complete Ponzi scheme and scam. Many countries and governments including the United Kingdom’s financial conduct authority (FCA) issued warning against OneCoin, perceiving it as an obvious scam developed to profit off other people’s investment.\n\n“As OneCoin is not authorized, consumers who deal with it will have no protection from the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,” said the FCA.\n\nDisregarding the increased awareness on Bitcoin as a digital currency and safe haven asset used by investors and traders worldwide to protect their wealth in economic uncertainty. Several mainstream media outlets are purposely presenting highly controversial and biased narratives which may negatively affect the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.']"
01/19/2017,"['Huobi and OKCoin, two of the world\'s largest bitcoin exchange businesses by volume, have formally announced they have halted margin trading services.\n\nIn statements issued today on the OKCoin\'s Chinese-language website and Huobi\'s Weibo account, the exchanges confirmed changes rolled out quietly roughly a week ago when customers reported restrictions on lending-based services.\n\nRepresentatives from Huobi told CoinDesk that the exchange stopped its services two days ago, and that it will no longer offer margin trading on its China-facing website or its international alternative, BitYes. They also confirmed that Huobi was asked directly by the People\'s Bank of China (PBoC) to stop the services today, but that it had not previously heard from the central bank on the matter.\n\nThis coincided with what appears to be a formal acknowledgement of findings circulated in China-based news outlets yesterday.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the PBoC has issued a statement that reads:\n\n""These exchanges have been in violation by getting into the margin financing business, causing abnormal market volatility. The inspection also found these exchanges didn’t put in proper international anti-money-laundering controls.""\n\nYet, other exchange representatives sought to downplay the idea that the changes may be permanent.\n\nAn exchange representative, who declined to be identified, called yesterday\'s news stories ""sourceless reporting"". ""This is informal guidance that is being interpreted as formal guidance,"" he said.\n\nLikewise, Huobi indicated it believes the guidance to be ""informal"", and that it may lack the weight of formal written guidance or a legally binding edict.\n\nAs with other China-based exchanges, Huobi said it would continue to cooperate with the central bank and its requests\n\nRepresentatives from OKCoin could not be reached for official comment.\n\n\'Not illegal\'\n\nDespite the formal acknowledgement of changes, exchange representatives seemed to push back against the idea that there was full clarity on how China\'s regulatory climate would move forward.\n\nIn statements to Reuters, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee added that the PBoC\'s requests were ""not based on any official documentation"", and that the central bank has not issued an opinion that bitcoin margin trading is ""illegal"".\n\nLee could not be reached for additional comment at press time.\n\nThe representative from Huobi also suggested there remains a lack of clarity on how things will develop going forward.\n\nWhen asked if this meant that margin trading would end in China, she noted only that smaller exchanges had not been asked to end the practice.\n\n""I just know regulators asked the three major exchanges to stop,"" she added.\n\nA representative from OKCoin, speaking privately, said that he believes it may be possible for margin trading to continue for international customers. OKCoin operates both a China-facing bitcoin exchange (OKCoin.cn) and an international website (OKCoin.com) that operates out of Hong Kong.\n\n""You could have margin go away, or there might be a situation where Chinese people can\'t use it,"" he said.\n\nLittle impact\n\nAt press time, the price of bitcoin was up 0.5% on the day, suggesting the impending announcements were already priced in by market participants.\n\nYet, there was a sense among some traders that any prolonged end to margin trading could have an impact on the global bitcoin market.\n\nReports have suggested China accounts for as much as 95% of global trading, though other estimates peg this figure at the lower, but still dominant figure of 85%.\n\nChina-based over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong suggested that there is a fear that reduced margin trading could impact exchange liquidity.\n\nOther traders expressed that they are still in ""wait and see"" mode, pending any formal statements from China\'s regulators.\n\nMahjong image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Will the US currency be the next one to devalue?\n\nAre the conditions beginning to emerge as we look down the barrel for a repeat of 2008? A perfect storm gathers for Bitcoin to become not only a safe haven currency but a real alternative, scaling to 100 mln active users. This will trigger Bitcoin’s price progression to the next level.\n\nBanks run amok\n\nDid Satoshi know this moment was coming, that history would repeat itself?\n\nWell, yes but with the lessons not being learned where modern day values of greed and fear drive unwanted but inevitable behaviors.\n\nAs Thomas Friedman, the Pulitzer Prize winner, famously states: “I’ll be gone. You’ll be gone,” meaning that by the time crisis hits, he will already be spending his bonus, which you couldn’t afford to pay anyway.\n\nWill Trump withdraw the Dodd-Frank Act in a similar vein to Clinton who ignored Glass-Steagall and let the banks run free?\n\nEnd of Eurozone\n\nThis is the moment when a hard Brexit looms, which will almost certainly spell the end for the Eurozone.

Whether the answer is to print more money or increase debt that devalues everyone’s net worth and the things they have worked hard for, the question remains - what is going to happen?\n\nA massive buy signal for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is in the right place and at the right time. With 30+ banks in negative interest rates, things could only get worse. Behaviors would have to change as people cannot be trusted to make decisions and be their own validator. The rules of commerce would need to be enforced by a mechanism that works for all, using and relying on the primary concept of trust that is only established as there is no trust and miners behave in self-interest.\n\nWith China looking at another devaluation, now is the time, Bitcoin’s time.', 'The biggest benefit of Bitcoin isn\'t the ability to instantly send and receive money regardless of borders, it\'s the technology that underpins it--at least that\'s how top regulators and banking executives see it.\n\nIn a panel discussion, dubbed the ""Global Fintech Revolution,"" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, fintech luminaries like David Craig, president of financial and risk at Thomson Reuters, praised the technology behind crypto-currencies like Bitcoin. More specifically, they\'re keen on the ""blockchain"" ledger that lets companies make and verify transactions without a central authority.\n\nIt may well hold the key to winning back customer confidence in the banking industry, which has suffered various setbacks in recent years. ""Blockchain distributes trust among a group of people who have to work together, and who don\'t necessarily trust each other,"" said Craig. ""They have to collectively agree to a standard of how they federate trust. The financial industry hasn\'t traditionally been good at collaboration, and this offers a way of changing.""\n\nOther businesses may benefit from the blockchain, given that most anything of value--from money to identities, and even votes--can be managed and stored on the public ledger. Consensus Systems, for instance, builds applications on top of the ledger that could enable a more transparent, ""triple-entry"" accounting system. Blockchain also has the potential to limit cyber crime, by making it easier for businesses to detect fraud.\n\nEven traditional banking representatives are bullish on blockchain. Cecilia Skingsley, the deputy governor of the Swedish National Bank--whose job it is to regulate the country\'s currency, the Swedish krona--is skeptical about the benefits of cryptocurrencies, but seemed excited over the utility of blockchain.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ether, Dogecoin, Monero and ZCash tends to be less stable, she noted, precisely because they aren\'t governed by a central authority. (Consider that on September 18th, 2016, the value of Bitcoin was $608.70; as of present writing, exactly four months later, the value is $897.63, according to pricing index CoinDesk.)\n\n""To be efficient, currency has to be a stable store of value. That is something that Bitcoin does not have,"" Skingsley explained. ""We have a strong product to offer from the central bank,"" she added, noting that the vehicle of payment is itself somewhat arbitrary. ""If people don\'t like it, and they don\'t trust the state, they can use other methods. Use black cats, or cupcakes, that\'s up to you. We provide the state option, which is safe, efficient and widely distributed, with a stable store of value.""\n\nStill, she added, ""I love the technology behind it, and am learning more about it.""\n\nAnt Financial CEO Eric Jing echoed her enthusiasm. ""The essence of blockchain is not about decentralization, but trust,"" he said.', 'Despite volatility and fluctuation, the overall trend of Bitcoin’s price has tread upward due to improved capitalization, robust monetary policy and growth in awareness of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 to be a payment network. Before Bitcoin existed a number of other payment networks existed such as PayPal and Visa. However, Bitcoin arrived with its own disruptive element giving rise to a significant chain reaction within the world’s financial system.\n\nHow is Bitcoin different?\n\nThe uniqueness of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lies in the existence of tokens which have a price that is floated against other currencies. This implies that based on various factors, a given amount of Bitcoins will either increase or decrease in value relative to other currencies.\n\nIn terms of price variation, Bitcoin has had its own fair share of ups and downs. Volatility has become a common word within its ecosystem. Events of early 2017 prove that the cryptocurrency can achieve significant changes in price over a short period of time.\n\nInflux of investors\n\nBitcoin is still in its developmental stage and stability within the ecosystem is expected to keep improving. In recent years, price volatility has become an obvious characteristic of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, despite the intermittent ups and downs, Bitcoin’s price has retained a predominantly upward trend. Simon Dixon, CEO BnkToTheFuture.com, says:\n\n“While volatility continues, the fundamental use case of Bitcoin as a store of value continues to drive new investors jumping in on every dip. Bitcoins properties as a global store of value are stronger than the warnings of central banks like PBOC as investors seek new homes for their capital.”\n\nOther factors\n\nThe prevailing upward trend in the price of Bitcoin is not unrelated to certain fundamental factors that predict an even brighter future for the cryptocurrency.\n\nKumar Gaurav, Founder & CEO of Cashaa (Auxesis group), tells Cointelegraph that the solid monetary policies and technology behind Bitcoin are growing day by day. Gaurav notes that the mere fact that after having multiple attacks every day, the Bitcoin Blockchain is standing firm is reason enough to issue a vote of confidence on the cryptocurrency.\n\nAnother reason identified by Gaurav is the growth in awareness based on two facts. The first is that people are now getting to really know how Bitcoin works and they can separate facts from negative publicity which surrounded Bitcoin for a long time. The second is the disadvantage of having centralized systems which have burst out during the financial crisis shaking the belief of many people in the financial institutions.\n\n“The biggest thing is that this is happening continuously and creating an atmosphere of distrust in the existing system,” concludes Gaurav.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""In the last few years, we have seen a boost in interest in universal basic income schemes. The idea for it is not a new nor a radical concept. It first appeared at the beginning of the 16th century in the work of Thomas More, Utopia.\n\nFor centuries governments around the world have been exploring the potential of universal basic income in easing the vulnerabilities of working people exposed to threats of transforming the labor market. The recent growing experimentation clearly shows that there is a need to find effective solutions to alleviate the perils of globalization.\n\nOpinions are divided\n\nSupporters of the idea strongly believe that provisions of universal basic income would be a more efficient and fair way to protect people in changing social and economic circumstances. Besides, it is seen as allowing much greater financial independence and flexibility for people allowing to balance work and education, leisure and care responsibilities, while recognizing a huge value of unpaid and voluntary work activities.\n\nCritics, however, claim that the idea is too expensive and impossible to implement, fearing that it could actually worsen the situation by increasing inequality as it does not take into account individual needs properly.\n\nExperiments worldwide\n\nSeveral cities in the Netherlands are providing basic monthly income for testing groups participants under varying conditions. The Italian city of Livorno started providing a guaranteed basic income of 500 euros each month to the city´s 100 poorest families. Ontario in Canada, as well as Fife and Glasgow in Scotland, are looking into trial universal basic income schemes that are planned to launch this year.\n\nFinland has just embarked on a historic journey with Finnish Parliament passing the act authorizing a basic income trial. For a two-year period, a random sample of 2,000 individuals drawn from current working-age beneficiaries of unemployment benefits will be receiving an unconditional payment of 560 euros.\n\nWhile the main objective of the experiment is to find ways to reshape the existing social security system, it also offers a great chance to explore ways for reducing of bureaucracy and streamline the complicated systems and processes. Modern technologies are showing huge potential in this process.\n\nPerfect bureaucrat\n\nTim Draper, an American venture capitalist investor, once suggested paying the basic income in Bitcoin:\n\n“Some governments are starting to talk about basic income for everyone. And they can easily do it by giving everyone a Bitcoin wallet. Every week or every two weeks you could give them their basic income.”\n\nAccording to Draper, Blockchain technology could help make this plan a reality. He sees Blockchain as the perfect bureaucrat, the perfect government official, as it’s incorruptible, fair, and honest. It just gets the job done. It’s the most efficient thing ever.\n\nPaying universal basic income in Bitcoin\n\nWhy not? In theory, cryptocurrencies can be programmed to carry out certain tasks. Program them to pay dividends to a group of recipients on a regular basis and you will make a system of welfare payments much cheaper.\n\nGreg Slepak says:\n\n“Basic income, especially universal basic income, requires a secure, tamper-proof ledger that can be audited by anyone to ensure the safe delivery of funds. And that's one thing cryptocurrencies provide.”\n\nHowever, paying universal basic income in Bitcoin still might sound Utopian, and here’s why. As Finlow-Bates, CEO at Chainfrog, explains Bitcoin is not really a good option for issuing universal basic income mostly due to its high volatility. It does have a real value, which would require an entity. For instance, the government should purchase Bitcoins in volume with fiat currency. This, however, would result in significant changes of its price.\n\nCrypto identity\n\nSpeaking of the key rules for cryptocurrency-based universal basic income systems Finlow-Bates emphasizes the need for a means to correctly identify every eligible citizen and issue them with a cryptocurrency account.\n\nHe explains:\n\n“Even in well-regulated information-gathering countries such as Finland, where almost every citizen has a unique identification number, this seems a tall order. In countries such as the United Kingdom where identity cards are eschewed it would be almost impossible. Possibly some biometric systems used in the generation of the private keys could eventually provide a solution.”\n\nIn addition to the identity issue, a significant problem in his opinion would be to provide cryptographic key security for every participant, in particular finding a way to handle the revocation of compromised keys and reissuing of new keys to citizens that have their keys compromised or have simply forgotten or lost their private keys.\n\nFinally, there is one more aspect that should be taken into account. Even seeing its rapid development one cannot say that this is a real alternative for fiat money mostly due to the limited amount of service providers accepting cryptocurrency.\n\nUkko Kumpulainen from UKKO.fi explains:\n\n“Implementing any currency transfer between two parties requires some kind of software to enable this transaction while at the same time applications record this transaction for legal and accounting purposes.”\n\nKumpulainen believes that the potential of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in revolutionizing systems of social security benefits is significantly limited. The money should be easily converted preferably in real time from cryptocurrency to traditional currency. In this way, people could use fiat money simultaneously via one credit card or mobile application.\n\nThe idea of designing a cryptocurrency-based universal basic income scheme might seem far-fetched, nevertheless, we can’t help but wonder what if."", 'The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, has warned Deposit Money Banks and other financial institutions in the country not to do business in crypto or digital currencies.\n\nThe Apex bank listed some of the virtual currencies to include bitcoin, ripples, monero, litecoin, dogecion and onecoin.\n\nThe CBN had during the week, lectured Nigeria on the danger of transacting in such virtual currencies.\n\nIn a circular dated January 12, 2017, CBN warned the DMBs and other financial bodies that the digital currencies were not accepted in Nigeria.\n\nIt further warned that any institution or individual dealing in such currencies was doing so at their own risk.\n\nThe document titled, “Circular to banks and other financial institutions on virtual currency operations in Nigeria,” was signed by the Director, Financial Policy and Regulation, CBN, Mr. Kevin Amugo.\n\nIt reads, “The attention of the banks and other financial institutions is hereby drawn to the above risks and you are required to take the following actions pending substantive regulation or decision by the CBN: Ensure that you do not use, hold, trade and/transact in any way in virtual currencies; and ensure that existing customers that are virtual currency exchangers have effective AML/CFT controls that enable them to comply with customer identification, verification and transaction monitoring requirements.\n\n“Where banks or other financial institutions are not satisfied with controls put in place by the virtual currency exchangers/customers, the relationship should be discontinued immediately; and any suspicious transactions by these customers should immediately be reported to the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit.\n\n“The CBN reiterates that the VCs such as bitcoin, ripples, monero, litecoin, dogecoin, onecoin, etc and similar products are not legal tenders in Nigeria, thus any bank or institution that transacts in such businesses does so as its own risk.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'The seminal Bitcoin sidechains white paper “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains,” released in 2014 by a team that went on to form Blockstream, a leading company in the blockchain space, envisaged an ecosystem of “sidechains” separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but interoperable with it via peg mechanisms.\n\n\n\nA sidechain can carry bitcoin as currency, in which case users will be able to seamlessly transfer bitcoin between the sidechain and the main blockchain. A sidechain can implement more powerful scripting features or more watertight privacy. Increased throughput is another key improvement over Bitcoin that can be implemented in a sidechain.\n\nIn 2015, Bitcoin Magazine covered Blockstream’s plans for the first commercial Bitcoin sidechain, code-named “Liquid,” able to provide instant transactions with a fast settlement layer for bitcoin exchanges, brokerages and other industry members. “As its main advantage, Liquid provides instant and secure transactions among all users of the sidechain,” claims Blockstream. “While Bitcoin transactions can typically take up to an hour to be sufficiently secured by the blockchain, Liquid offers a similar level of security within seconds.”\n\nNow Blockstream has released another white paper, titled “Strong Federations: An Interoperable Blockchain Solution to Centralized Third Party Risks.” The new white paper introduces improvements over the federated peg mechanism mentioned in the first white paper. In particular, the consensus mechanism and trust model have been updated; mechanisms that allow settlement back to a parent chain in case of failure have also been introduced.\n\nIn essence, Strong Federations are cleverly constructed multisig addresses, where bitcoins are “locked in.” These bitcoins can be unlocked only if enough key holders agree the payment is valid. This setup can make for publicly verifiable, Byzantine-robust transaction networks that facilitate movement of any asset among disparate markets, without requiring centralized trust in any single party. It can also provide commercial privacy, with support for transactions where asset types and amounts are opaque while preserving the public verifiability inherent to Bitcoin.\n\nThe new white paper consolidates and expands the initial concept of Liquid, which is now presented as a first implementation of a Strong Federation. “The first working implementation of a Strong Federation is Liquid — a Bitcoin exchange and brokerage multi-signature sidechain that bypasses Bitcoin’s inherent limitations while leveraging its security properties,” note the authors. In Liquid, “consensus history is a blockchain where every block is signed by the majority of a deterministic, globally-distributed set of functionaries running on hardened platforms, a methodology that directly aligns incentives for the participants.”\n\nAccording to Blockstream, Strong Federations will be useful in many general-purpose industries, especially those that need secure and private exchange of digital assets, without a single party that controls the custodianship, execution and settling of transactions.\n\n“This new construction establishes a security profile inherently superior to existing methods of rapid transfer and settlement among exchanges and brokerages, and is directly applicable to other problems within existing financial institutions,” note Blockstream experts Johnny Dilley, Jonathan Wilkins and Marta Piekarska, co-authors of the white paper.\n\nIt’s worth noting that, contrary to the current trend toward sanitized, “permissioned” non-Bitcoin blockchains that deliberately disown the libertarian attitude of early Bitcoin adopters, the Blockstream approach remains anchored to the public Bitcoin blockchain and informed by a commitment to privacy and liberty.\n\n“Our efforts focus on developing systems that protect individual liberty through cryptographic mechanisms as the right to privacy is one of the essential components of a free society,” the authors of the white paper state. “Liquid and Strong Federations attempt to improve upon the privacy guarantees offered by Bitcoin, whose open-by-default model often results in users inadvertently leaking personally-identifying information.”', 'Hackers have infected every public computer in the St. Louis Public Library system, stopping all book borrowing and cutting off internet access to those who rely on it for computers.\n\nThe computer system was hit by ransomware, a particularly nasty type of computer virus that encrypts computer files.\n\nThis form of attack renders computers unusable -- unless victims are willing to pay an extortion fee and obtain a key to unlock the machines.\n\nAccording to the library, hackers demanded $35,000 in the electronic currency Bitcoin -- but the library refuses to pay.

01/20/2017,"['The price of Bitcoin has been growing steadily in what seems to be a recovery from the setback it suffered on Wednesday, January 18 following reported allegation of irregularities in the operations of major exchanges in China by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).\n\nOfficials of the Bank had met with key exchanges – BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi – on January 11 to remind them of their responsibility to conduct their activities according to the laws of the country. The news of the meeting dipped the price of Bitcoin from the $916 range to as low as $761 due to panic selling which emanated from fears that the onsite inspection could jeopardize investment in the digital currency.\n\nHowever, after a review of messages from all indications – the PBOC, the exchanges and cryptocurrency insiders, nothing new came out of what was misconstrued for a ban in some quarters aside reiterating what the Chinese government had earlier established about Bitcoin and other digital currencies not being legal tender in China.\n\nIt is not new for a ban on cryptocurrency-related activities to come to mind when it comes to China as the country is estimated to be handling about 90% of the world’s Bitcoin operations and holdings. This is a view that has been held for long and hinged on the need for the digital currency’s distribution to be considered a geopolitical risk exposure.\n\nRather than a ban in this instance, the government called for a “self-examination” which, in retrospect, means the exchanges and other stakeholders’ need to manage the digital currency’s price fluctuation responsibly owing to the price sudden rise in the first few days of 2017.\n\nThe CEO of Decent, Matej Michalko, blamed the “bad players” for the situation. He says in a chat:\n\n“The heated discussion about BTCC compliance with People’s Bank of China showed a palpable misunderstanding of context. The point was to adopt the set of regulatory policies called AML/KYC, that calls for detailed anti-corruption due diligence information sharing and anti-money laundering. Bitcoin came under fire because of the outright abuse of the technology. Various people avoided capital outflow laws and transferred large sums of money, what grabbed the attention of financial agencies. Fault isn’t precisely on the state, nor currency itself, but on the bad players.”\n\nThe Chinese government’s expressed concern seems to indicate that it wants to see the price of Bitcoin remain stable. And that was what has been seen in the market for the following days. After the dramatic drop, the price started building up again from January 13 moving between the $801 and $831 range for four days when Theresa May’s speech on the Brexit plan triggered interest in Bitcoin.\n\nIt gained more than $80 in the less than 24-hours that followed until the news came out that the results of the PBoC probe into China exchanges would be released on Friday, January 20. The $913 height was back to $864 but has been climbing back to $877 (according to CoinMarketCap) as at the time of this writing.\n\nWhile it is clear that China has not come down hard on Bitcoin and its recent involvement could be seen as a legitimate concern that could obliquely publicize Bitcoin as recognized by the government, what would happen in the next few days would be critical for Bitcoin owing to the caution that is being exercised presently by the three most influential exchanges in China as well as observing Bitcoin investors.\n\nIt is unclear whether the price stability that is currently at play will be sustained for longer to bring about the real growth that is anticipated in the long term based on predictions that 2017 would be a better year for Bitcoin. However, what is clear is that the quick spike to over $1000 in the first five days of the year has put all the major stakeholders on alert and we just have to wait to see what the year would bring for Bitcoin.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The race to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund for retail investors became a three-way competition.\n\nIllustration: Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n\nAccording to Paul Vigna at The Wall Street Journal, Grayscale Investments, a firm run by technology entrepreneur Barry Silbert, filed with the SEC to list its Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nGrayscale joins two other groups seeking approval for their bitcoin ETFs. Winklevoss Capital, the firm operated by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is awaiting an SEC decision on its filing, which is expected by March. SolidX is also seeking SEC approval for its bitcoin ETF, which also would be listed on the NYSE.\n\nAs the newspaper reports:\n\nThe move by Grayscale Investments, a unit of Mr. Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, could expand the audience for the fledgling virtual currency if the fund is approved by the SEC. It also could prove an early test for how an SEC run by a Donald Trump appointee will greet innovations that may raise investor protection or other market-structure issues.\n\n…The benefits of being first on a major exchange could be big, assuming that bitcoin does manage to establish itself as a viable asset class. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF launched in Nov. 18, 2004, and has $31 billion in assets. The iShares Gold Trust ETF launched on Jan. 21, 2005, and has $7.7 billion in assets. Gold, a commodity not backed by any particular government, appeals to investors for some of the same reasons that bitcoin does.\n\nIn recent weeks, trading in bitcoin has been volatile. Prices have been helped by uncertainty following the election, but recently, concern about events in China sent the price sliding to near $900 from more than $1,100.', '0\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jeffrey Tucker\n\nIt’s like clockwork. When the price of Bitcoin (the dollar exchange rate) goes up, my inbox lights up.\n\n“What is Bitcoin and how can I buy it?”\n\nThen the price goes down, and it’s radio silence again, but for people who complain that their investment hasn’t panned out.\n\nEvery new technology must enter our lives through real-time market experience.\n\nWhat’s going on here is the classic pattern. Non-specialists buy high (because of rising public attention) and sell, and then fail to buy low (because low prices don’t make the news). It’s no different with cryptocurrency than it is with any other stock.\n\nWhat’s difficult for people to understand is that far more is at stake with Bitcoin than your investment portfolio. Anyone who thinks of this innovation merely as a chance for riches has completely misconstrued the significance of what we are dealing with here.\n\nStill, every new technology, even revolutionary ones like railroads or flight, must enter our lives through real-time market experience, with all its trials and errors, failures and success, legit companies and frauds, along with investors who get burned and those who make it big.\n\nThat’s what captures the headlines. What doesn’t grab attention is the deeper implications of the technology driving Bitcoin: in time, it could fundamentally alter the relationship between the citizen and the State, not just at home but all over the world.\n\nBlockchain > Politics\n\nThe structure of technology in our time has flipped the traditional model of what makes societies tick.\n\nAfter a wildly contentious election season, you might get the impression that the future of the country, if not the world, hinges on the quality and ideology of top-down leadership. That’s actually wrong. Very little was said during the entire election about digital technology; nothing ever came up concerning distributed ledgers and the remarkable invention of a fully private currency that lives on the Internet and works without third-party intermediaries.\n\nRead More: Colombian Army Says FARC Violated Ceasefire\n\nIt’s a paradigmatic case of how the structure of technology in our time has flipped the traditional model of what makes societies tick and what drives history forward. As we are learning, presidents and parties come and go; what persists and what keeps advancing regardless of political trends are the tools we use to improve our lives. Here is where the real action is.\n\nBitcoin Miami\n\nThis blessed reminder was granted unto me in the last few days.\n\nI addressed and attended sessions at an industry-backed conference on Bitcoin in Miami, Florida (nice write up here). No political party or cause was represented at this event. I don’t think I heard a word from the podium concerning platforms or voting or needed legislation. Instead, the presentations were about new ways to use cryptocurrency and distribution ledger technology to bring ever-better services to people all over the world.\n\nBitcoin has matured beautifully since its release in 2009.\n\nThe discussions were technical and detailed, with some of the best minds in the Bitcoin space conferring, sharing, and sometimes arguing. I found the whole environment invigorating to say the least.\n\nBitcoin has matured beautifully since its release in 2009. It has long since moved past the incredulity stage, though apparently skeptics will always be with us. What we see now is the drive toward mass adoption and industry application in every area, from payment processing to enterprise-building to security titling and contracting.\n\nTo people who live and breathe in the Bitcoin space, the progress might appear slow. But by any historical standard, the passage of time between invention and public availability has actually been remarkably fast. After all, we are only now celebrating its 8th birthday! And as time has marched forward, awareness of the sheer awesomeness of this technology has dawned on more and more people.\n\nWhat Is It and Why It Matters\n\nBitcoin is a market-based money and payment system that operates on its own, without the need for regulators, central banks, or even financial intermediaries.\n\nTo those who own Bitcoin, develop within Blockchain applications, and read about this topic all the time, all of this is old news. And yet this knowledge is far from having gained popular recognition. Every time I’m interviewed, the questions come up: what is Bitcoin and why does it matter?\n\nMy best attempt: Bitcoin is a market-based money and payment system that operates on its own, without the need for regulators, central banks, or even financial intermediaries. It is not only a money and payment system, however; it is also a system for bundling, documenting, and trading immutable packets of any kind of information that can include contracts, property titles, or any other form of human agreement, regardless of geographic proximity. This means that the resulting currency and/or information system operates completely outside borders and outside the domain of the nation-state.\n\nAnd it does all of this at an extremely low cost.\n\nWhere did it come from? This is the interesting part. The first explanation was posted on a free email list, followed by the release of the “genesis block” in public but very few people paid any attention at all. Fully 10 months went by before Bitcoin obtained any kind of posted price.\n\nThe people behind the technology were brilliant, to be sure, but unconnected from power. The blueprint didn’t appear in an academic journal. The currency was not created by the Fed or the Treasury. No policy maker was consulted. The geeks behind this innovation asked no one for permission; they trusted the market, which is to say people, to determine its success or failure.\n\nAnd why does it matter? Everyone has his or her own opinion on this. My angle is monetary. If there can be a parallel currency to nationalized monies, developing in tandem, the world economy is granted a future beyond the current miasma. So many modern problems and horrors trace to government money: economic depressions, declining incomes, wars, government growth and debt, cultural destabilization, and so much more. Finding a solution to this problem, and a path for reform, is a priority for anyone who loves liberty.\n\nIn 1976, F.A. Hayek wrote as follows\n\nWhat we now need is a free-money movement comparable to the free trade movement of the nineteenth century, demonstrating not merely the harm caused by acute inflation, which could justifiably be argued to be avoidable even with present institutions, but the deeper effects of producing periods of stagnation that are indeed inherent in the present monetary arrangements … It will be necessary that the problem and the urgent need of reform come to be widely understood. The issue is not one that, as may at first appear to the layman, concerns a minor technicality of the financial system that he has never quite understood. It refers to the one way in which we may still hope to stop the continuous progress of all government towards totalitarianism that already appears to many acute observers as inevitable. I wish I could advise that we proceed slowly. But the time may be short. What is now urgently required is not the construction of a new system but the prompt removal of all the legal obstacles that have for two thousand years blocked the way for an evolution that is bound to throw up beneficial results that we cannot now foresee.\n\nCertainly no one, not even Hayek, could foresee the brilliance of the Blockchain in its operation and possible effects on the world. But we are fortunate to be living in the midst of its emergence and development.\n\nThe Block Size Debate\n\nThe Bitcoin system is being developed in the context of consensus from actual stakeholders and tested by market results.\n\nAt the conference I attended, there were fierce debates about the correct size of blocks on the chain. It is currently limited to 1 megabyte, and many people complain that this is not enough to permit the system to be scaled for universal use. Other people believe that a fundamental change in the core code is too dangerous, and that issues of scaling should be handled by add-ons and external layers to the current protocol.\n\nRead More: Macri Maintains Kirchner Era Price Controls in Argentina\n\nI’ve heard all sides and I’m not in a position to say which is best. What I find remarkable is the method by which a solution is going to be found. It is not about experts with resources and power imposing a solution from above. We’ve been there and done that and the results have been terrible (consider Bretton Woods or Nixon’s monetary reform).\n\nThe Bitcoin system is being developed in the context of consensus from actual stakeholders and tested by market results. This is the right path forward. Whatever the results, they stand a much stronger chance of putting the world economy on a forward path than any legislation or executive order coming from any government or political party.\n\nJeffrey Tucker is Director of Content for the Foundation for Economic Education.

It doesn\'t take much time to understand.""\n\nHe added that other consensus models in the space are ""complex"" and ""not well-studied,"" making it ""difficult to predict how they might react to \'adversarial conditions\'"".\n\nOther differences\n\nThe project\'s backers say its so-called \'strong federations\' could allow financial institutions to pin certain types of private sidechains to the bitcoin blockchain, in part to take advantage of the network’s security and the control that it gives to users.\n\nIn conversation with CoinDesk, Bergeron emphasized that this gives participants another option if the federation goes awry.\n\n""If they don’t feel like participating anymore, users can return to the main chain and be done with it,"" Bergeron said.\n\nAndrew Poelstra, a mathematician for Blockstream, said that the paper constitutes ""a pile of improvements"" over other systems given the company\'s experimentation with new bitcoin features such as SegWit and confidential transactions, which shield transaction information, on testing sidechains.\n\nA sidechain using confidential transactions would also potentially be more private than the main bitcoin blockchain, as it stands today.\n\n""They provide commercial privacy with support for transactions where asset types and amounts are opaque while preserving the public verifiability inherent to bitcoin,"" the announcement blog post reads.\n\nThat said, Poelstra stressed that a strong federation needs certain conditions to work properly.\n\nThe system requires a ""small, well-defined"" set of participants in order to make the guarantees that sidechains do. He described this state as ""Byzantine robust"".\n\n""As long as the majority of the participants are acting correctly and adhering to the protocol, then we can prove that the system will continue to move forward and the trades will execute,"" he said.\n\nBut, rather than having the bitcoin blockchain secure the network, a group of signers is responsible for validating the transaction history, similar to other private blockchain structures. (The paper further explains how participants are incentivized to do ""the right thing"").\n\nAs far as how such an arrangement would impact bitcoin, Poelstra explained that the main network remains safe even if such a federation implodes.\n\n""If there’s anything wrong with bitcoin that would affect the sidechain, but the other direction doesn\'t apply,"" he said.\n\nStrong federation use cases\n\nSo, where might this system be useful?\n\nBergeron argued that it could provide a more efficient mechanism for prime brokerage, which normally requires a third party to help quickly move, say, $1m.\n\n""What Liquid does is it replicates this model, but it removes the custodianship aspect. Participants can commit their funds to the system without requiring a third party to hold and operate the movement of funds between each other,"" he explained.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""To me that’s one very clear example of the efficiencies that strong federations bring to the table.""\n\nOn the other hand, Poelstra described it in much broader terms, framing the concept as potentially useful for ""any system where there\'s a small, fixed set of participants who want to work together contractually, but don\'t fully trust each other"".\n\nHe stressed that it offers other properties, again pointing out the privacy guarantees and the way in which participants can ensure others are playing by the rules, so to speak, while at the same time hiding information (perhaps financial) they wish to keep private.\n\nThe \'other\' sidechains\n\nThough this might seem like a novel direction for sidechains, onlookers might be more excited about Blockstream’s ""other"" idea for the technology: to allow the means to move tokens between public blockchains with different rule sets without having to trust an intermediary.\n\nThis was one idea described in the company\'s first white paper two years ago. But, they might have a ways to go, as not all bitcoin developers are convinced that current sidechain implementations will uphold the security of the main bitcoin network.\n\nAlthough bitcoin developer Chris Stewart argued on social media that trustless sidechains are actually ready to be deployed (the code has been put through its paces on a test Elements sidechain), he asserts that bitcoin’s current political climate has perhaps stopped it from being implemented.\n\nWhatever the case, the strong federation system seems to be making some headway.\n\nIt\'s not yet production-ready, according to Poelstra, but when it is, the next step is to open source it ""so that anyone will be able to take that code and use it"".\n\nIn this light, he said, the team is releasing the paper in a bid to get feedback from academics and developers as the company looks to chart a strong course forward.\n\nUpside down image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The transaction numbers in these areas are starting to match up with the consistent growth in bitcoin adoption and development effort across the ecosystem.”\n\nInternational payments are one significant market where bitcoin performs better than traditional methods as bank wires tend to take days or more and charge hefty fees. Moreover, managing payments from or to many countries and currencies can be a headache for businesses with employees or customers scattered all over the world. That’s if they can make such payments at all as individuals in many developing countries may not even have a bank account or may be unable to accept foreign currency.\n\nWith bitcoin, BitPay tends to manage much of the process, making it attractive for global businesses, such as affiliate networks or international payroll, which have seen a considerable growth in their use of bitcoin. To further serve these markets BitPay has launched a new tool, Bitcoin Payouts, that “makes paying 1,000 sellers as simple as paying 10.” Indicating untapped demand, it has seen an incredible 1,800% growth, suggesting a significant niche market that is far better served by the digital currency.\n\nAlthough bitcoin has experienced an increase in fees over the past year to an average of almost $0.50 per transaction, they remain far below international wire transfer charges, making it an attractive alternative for cross border payments. To make it easier, BitPay recently announced they are integrating Coinbase, as well as allowing all merchants to have access to advanced risk mitigation tools for instant bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe company stated in November that they provide merchants with three options, very low risk payments which require six confirmations, medium risk payment of just one confirmation and High risk zero confirmation instant transactions. To make zero confirmation payments less risky BitPay stated:\n\n“For many years, BitPay has offered a feature to our Enterprise customers which analyzes incoming transactions and determines if they have a higher-than-normal risk of not being confirmed. We proactively adjust these higher-risk invoices to a Medium transaction speed while letting lower-risk payments proceed at High speed.”\n\nIn this way, bitcoin continues to provide merchants with the option of accepting instant and fairly cheap transactions. As such, merchant adoption may continue to increase, especially following the recent price rise to near all-time highs together with the corresponding awareness and adoption that indicates.\n\nIf this trend continues, adoption might eventually even reach a level where a small locale operates entirely on bitcoin or where an entire supply cycle is completed by only using the still new digital currency. At that point, bitcoin would fulfill all three qualities of money: store of value, unit of account, and an excellent means of exchange.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Supposedly reactionary Nigerian financial regulators have suddenly begun to pay attention to the cryptocurrency industry. Multiple publications from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) released recently, stress the use of Blockchain in the country.\n\nA Blockchain committee\n\nMost recent among these publications is a circular from the CBN to commercial banks requesting nominations of representatives to the committee that will produce the policies and guidelines that will guide Blockchain regulation in Nigeria, and also generate the operational framework for instituting a domestic cryptocurrency in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the circular, Blockchain technology is gradually becoming a pervasive platform in the conduct of modern payments. It has presented itself to the world of payments by giving strong value propositions around security, digitalization and trust.\n\nA political undertone\n\nThere have been mixed reactions from citizens towards this sudden interest by the Nigerian financial system regulators.\n\nConsidering the present crisis rocking the system, which appears to have overwhelmed the capacity of the key players within, Olukunle Taiwo, a cryptocurrency enthusiast, thinks that these agencies are only being political with their recent moves.\n\nTaiwo says that what is unfolding is simply a struggle for relevance and a quest to appeal to the confidence of the citizens which have been long lost.\n\nTaiwo says:\n\n“The CBN is only trying to be politically relevant. At the moment, they are all about impressing the public whose confidence they have lost by their inability to navigate the country out of recession.”\n\nBlessing in disguise\n\nThe CEO of Hyperchain Technologies, Chigozie Ononiwu, holds a more optimistic opinion with regards to the development.\n\nOnoniwu tells Cointelegraph that the recent interest and news media reports attributed to SEC and CBN is a blessing in disguise to Blockchain, Bitcoin and Altcoin adoption by the mainstream. Ononiwu says that their actions are offering the public the opportunity to acquire an insight into the mindset of the government and monetary regulation authorities.\n\nAccording to Ononiwu, the government is concerned that Bitcoin/Altcoins are being used to siphon stolen money in and out of Nigeria. They want the public to self-regulate by putting in place AML/KYC compliance mechanisms to mitigate against corrupt practices, he says. As for the CBN’s letter to the banks, it is, in his opinion, an indirect endorsement of all things Blockchain. They have realized the inevitable crowning of Blockchain as the backbone for all future technologies.\n\nOnoniwu concludes:', 'Dutch public prosecutors and the tax inspection agency are ramping up their fight against bitcoin money laundering this year.\n\n\n\nAccording to research conducted by Dutch financial newspaper Het Financieel Dagblad (FD), at least three criminal cases pertaining to money laundering with bitcoin are scheduled for 2017. Additionally, the FIOD — the investigative arm of the Dutch tax authority — wants to lower the bar for prosecution of unlicensed bitcoin traders. The FIOD will also try to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering operations.\n\nThe Challenge of Anonymity\n\nBitcoin’s relative anonymity (sometimes referred to as pseudonymity) and censorship resistance have made the digital currency a popular means of exchange on darknet markets like Alphabay and Silk Road. Europol believes that more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends is done with bitcoin.\n\nDarknet market merchants typically do exchange their earned bitcoins for fiat currencies. While trading bitcoin for fiat is in and of itself not illegal, most exchanges apply strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) standards. This is usually requested from the financial institutions and banks that they work with. Darknet merchants, therefore, often prefer to exchange their bitcoins at what FD refers to as “bitcoincashers”: exchanges and dealers that do not comply with such rules.\n\nThe FIOD is now attempting to make prosecution of these bitcoincashers much easier. The tax authority wants the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to recognize illegal bitcoin trade as a type of money laundering. That would allow detectives to start an investigation without first needing to prove reasonable cause. A spokesperson for the FIOD told FD that it expects such recognition to be granted later this year.\n\nAdditionally, FD reports that the FIOD wants to have bitcoin mixers recognized as money laundering indicators as well, though it’s unclear how far this regulation would reach. It would presumably apply to centralized mixers like bitmixer.io, which exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins to break the path to any particular piece of currency. But users of trustless mixing services, like ValueShuffle or TumbleBit servers, may become a target, too.\n\nPending Cases Before the Courts\n\nAt least six bitcoincashers will appear before Dutch courts this year, divided over three different cases. The first of these are two men accused of drug dealing, money laundering and partaking in a criminal organization. Public prosecutors suspect these dealings involved about $2.6 million [€2.4 million] worth of proceeds from illegal activities. The second case concerns four individuals suspected of running an illegal bitcoin exchange that guaranteed anonymity to its users. The third case is part of a larger international investigation on money laundering.\n\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to The FIOD for further clarification but received no response at time of publication.', 'A planned approach to regulating digital currencies is winning praise from industry participants, public documents reveal.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation published its initial guidance in late November as part of a broader push to create a working environment for startups working with the tech (public comments for which the state will be publishing on Monday)\n\nThe digital currency guidance notably included language that, if finalized, would apply money transmission rules to companies that exchange digital and government-issued currencies, leaving firms that only deal in digital currency outside of those requirements. Elsewhere, the state said that digital currencies wouldn\'t be considered \'money\' under the state’s Transmitters of Money Act, or TOMA.\n\nStill, published comments reveal that some are questioning elements of the release. That said, the approach being taken by Illinois drew wide support from those who responded to the state’s request for comment.\n\nPeter van Valkenburgh, director of research at the non-profit advocacy firm Coin Center, wrote:\n\n""This is an extraordinary approach, particularly in light of the increasingly convoluted landscape of state-by-state money transmission licensing and the emergence of premature and mis-calibrated digital currency licensing regimes that can stifle innovation here in the US without offering concomitant benefits in consumer protection.”\n\nOthers who submitted comment include the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Illinois-based Fornaro Law, among others.\n\n\'Mining\' definition questioned\n\nWhile supportive, some commentators took aim at the guidance depiction of mining, or the process by which new transactions are added to some public blockchains.\n\nBlockchain Consulting Group founder Taylor Gerring wrote that, as currently written, the description that all cryptocurrencies rely on mining as it is carried out on the bitcoin network falls short of the truth.\n\n""More generally, this process can be seen as \'validation\' since the participants (\'miners\') are working to finalize the information as quickly as possible, which each subsequent validation provides increased assurances the information will not be reverted,"" he wrote.\n\nConversely, Gerring went on to state that the process by which new coins are created also differs from cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency.\n\n""Although bitcoin is famous for its limit of 21 million bitcoins released at a rate that halves every approximate four years, it is not a strict requirement that new units of currency are generated this way,"" Gerring explained.\n\nSuggested changes\n\nOther commenters suggested that Illinois think deeper on some of the issues that its guidance raises.\n\nFor example, Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring wrote that the state should consider relaxing application requirements for Illinois-based startups looking to break into the digital currency space.\n\nBoring wrote:\n\n""To the extent the Director has the authority to waive portions, if not all, of the application requirements for digital currency companies who are deemed to trigger the licensing requirement in Illinois, such a consideration will prove beneficial to market growth and innovation in a strategic state such as Illinois.""\n\nPhilip Fornaro, principal attorney for Illinois legal firm Fornaro Law, suggested that the state consider other solutions for regulating the industry instead of TOMA.\n\nHe reasoned that the state, in opting to declare that digital currencies lie outside of the definition of money”, shouldn’t impose money transmission regulations on brokers, for example. While some kind of licensure ought to be required, Fornaro wrote, determinations by agencies like the IRS (which deemed bitcoin to be a kind of property in 2014) should be fully embraced by the state.\n\n""In our opinion, the IDFPR should spend more time observing this emerging market before concluding that the Illinois Transmitters of Money Act is the most appropriate regulatory framework by which to regulate the use of digital currency,"" Fornaro wrote.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The same happened when the Indian government abruptly banned notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000. Inevitably, for one reason or another, it falls almost as sharply as it rises.\n\nWelcome to the world of the Bitcoin, the most volatile currency out there. Although many would question that description and prefer to a call it a cryptocurrency, which is what it is.\n\nThe Bitcoin has now been around since 2010. Despite many questions about its usability in the real world of transactions, it has survived. Just in the last 30 days, according to data available on data platform bitcoinity.org, over 18.5 crore bitcoins were traded globally.\n\nThe first bitcoin transaction reportedly took place on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. Each of those bitcoins was then worth $0.008. The value of the bitcoin climbed rapidly in 2013, but then crashed dramatically after China tightened rules on bitcoin transactions.']"
01/21/2017,"['Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 14th through 20th January.\n\nAfter a wild start to 2017, bitcoin took it slow this week.\n\nThis relative calm was punctuated by a handful of sharp fluctuations, which saw the digital currency’s price fall to as little as $810 on 15th January and rise to as much as $914 on 18th January, data reveals.\n\nBut, despite the calm, there was uncertainty under the surface.\n\nAccording to analysts, the market is still reluctant to make big moves in the wake of continued news from China that has found its central bank more actively engaging with local exchanges.\n\nTrader reluctance\n\nFor now, this is keeping traders on the sidelines.\n\nRyan Rabaglia, head trader and digital asset specialist at Octagon Strategy, described the situation as one where \'wait and see\' is still the attitude.\n\n""Although the last round of news out of the mainland has seemingly been fully digested, we\'re still seeing most traders sitting on the sidelines,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n""The fear of any rumor or news has spooked most.""\n\nThis state of mind contrasts, however, with market performance.\n\nBitcoin prices surged close to 10% on 17th January, climbing to as much as $908.13, but overall, markets have struggled to move above that mark.\n\nThe digital currency proceeded to fluctuate below $900 for most of the week’s remainder, trading at $894 at the time of reporting.\n\nInvestigation unfinished\n\nWhile the PBoC investigation started out with central bank officials meeting with representatives of OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC, the first two of these major Chinese exchanges have now ceased margin trading.\n\nThis means the big question for now is, how will the lack of margin impact liquidity at what are effectively the world\'s largest exchanges.\n\nIn this context, bitcoin prices will likely trade within a range between $850 and $950 for some time, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin exchange BitMEX.\n\n""The market also needs to absorb the unwind of the Chinese margin books,"" he told CoinDesk.\n\nHayes is certainly not the only one optimistic about bitcoin markets moving forward, as other analysts – and market data – appear bullish.\n\nMarket sentiment has pushed higher over the last several days, as data provided by leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub shows the market was 91% and 93% long on 19th and 20th January, respectively.\n\nPetar Zivkovski, COO of Whaleclub, noted the currency’s price recovery in recent week as a positive sign, but emphasized that the markets are cautious.\n\nChina\'s importance\n\nCompounding matters is that China is still the effective center of bitcoin trading activity.\n\nThough data sources peg the market share of its exchanges at 95%, recent market assessments beg this closer to 85%. Either way, both data points are indicative of what\'s at stake.\n\nAccording to analyst Jacob Eliosoff, the ongoing developments surrounding the nation’s central bank could make China even more important than usual in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""The market will probably continue to be hypersensitive to the latest whispers on that front.""\n\nBinoculars image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Five years after co-founding Coinbase, one of the most well-funded Bitcoin ventures, Fred Ehrsam has decided to leave the company.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs (gs) trader revealed in a blog post Wednesday that he would resign from his day-to-day role at the company at end of the month. He plans to remain on its board.\n\nHaving raised a total of $117 million in venture capital funding at a private valuation approaching half a billion dollars, Coinbase was one of the first well-designed Bitcoin wallets to enter the scene. Since its debut, the company has transformed into more of a brokerage for people to trade digital assets that exist on a blockchain, the public ledger system that undergirds digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\n(Read about one of those digital currencies and the network behind it here.)\n\nEhrsam isn’t the only key employee to leave Coinbase recently. Last year, Olaf Carlson-Wee, the company’s earliest hire, went off to found a cryptocurrency hedge fund.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nIn an interview after announcing his planned departure, Ehrsam discussed Coinbase’s battle with the IRS over obtaining information about its customers (he feels confident in the company’s stance) and the growing professionalization of the Bitcoin trading world (he’s all for it). The following is an edited transcript.\n\nFortune: Everybody seems to be leaving Coinbase. What’s the deal?\n\nEhrsam: Starts out with a heavy hitter [laughing]. First of all, everyone is not leaving. The reason I feel comfortable leaving now is because the company is doing really dang well. And I think the industry is doing really dang well, to the point where it’s actually feasible for the first time, in my opinion, to start building other ideas.\n\nWhy now?\n\nWe’ve accomplished a lot of things in the last six-to-nine months that made us feel like it was a good time. The business grew more than two and a half times by revenue in 2016. So the business is doing well. The second part is the executive team has grown quite stronger. We hired a VP of engineering this year. We just hired a chief risk officer, a guy named Mike Lempres, who was the CCO [chief compliance officer] at another Bitcoin company called Bitnet, the GC [general counsel] at Silicon Valley Bank, and a U.S. attorney, amongst other things. He’s starting next week.\n\nThe last point is we finally got the dang BitLicense [a certification for Bitcoin companies to operate in New York] after what feels like an eternity. It’s a sign that the company is maturing and strong.\n\nWhat are you planning to do next?\n\nDo you have any good ideas?\n\nYou haven’t settled on a particular thing?\n\nNo, I haven’t. I’m going to take a little time off. I think it’s highly likely that I’ll do something in the crypto space [short for cryptocurrency]. Like I said, I think this is the first time it’s become viable that you can build some really powerful new ideas on top of the blockchain infrastructure that’s available now. Especially with Ethereum [a decentralized cryptocurrency network and rival to Bitcoin] coming onto the scene and continually strengthening. I’ll take some time off and then start tinkering again.\n\nAre you thinking about founding a hedge fund like Olaf [Carlson-Wee, Coinbase’s earliest hire]?\n\nProbably not a hedge fund. I’m an advisor to Polychain Capital [Carlson-Wee’s fund]. I believe in his thesis around blockchain-based assets [the currencies native to networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum] becoming a huge thing, especially this idea of tokens. [Essentially, the monetary units of blockchain applications, and the fuel that keeps them humming. See some of Ehrsam’s own writings on the subject.] But my desire is to build a product basically, not to start a fund.\n\nWe’re not going to see a “Fredcoin” are we?\n\n[Laughing] Maybe I’ll do something that involves the token model. I definitely wouldn’t rule that out. But I hope to God that it’s not called Fredcoin. Otherwise that thing is probably not going anywhere too fast.\n\nYour exit is coming at a time when Coinbase is embroiled in a legal battle with the IRS, which is trying to get information about Coinbase’s users. How is that going to shake out?\n\nThe end point seems pretty clear: Coinbase as a responsible regulated institution in the United States will fall under the same, or a similar, tax reporting regime as the major banks and brokerage houses. Just like Bank of America (bac) has to file 1099 forms, or some sort of tax forms, to the government, as does a Fidelity. We’re going to have to do the same.\n\nThe only open question is are they [the IRS] going to retroactively impose these requirements? I think that’s a little overreaching.\n\nFor more on the IRS, watch:\n\nA lot has happened in Bitcoin- and blockchain-land since you cofounded Coinbase five years ago. How do you feel about what’s happened?\n\nWhen Coinbase was starting we thought we were seeing the birth of something that was really important—what I would almost describe as the future fabric of society—the system for who we are our, our identities; what we own, our assets. We thought it would be a better system than what we have now because it’s mutually owned by everyone who’s part of the system. We sit here 5 million customers later, and adding a quarter of a million every month—all time highs. It’s hard not to feel good about that. I feel really good about that.\n\nOf course, with any new technology, especially one as powerful as this with such broad reaching implications, there are always going to be little bumps along the way. I think we’ve made bets that have been a little too early at times. That’s fine. But there’s increasing reach and acceptance around the space as each month passes.\n\nA Bloomberg article recently mentioned how much high frequency trading has taken the Bitcoin world by storm. How do you feel about that trend?\n\nI think it’s fundamentally a good sign that more and more professional traders and market makers are providing liquidity to the whole ecosystem. It allows people to move much larger quantities of digital currency more quickly than they would if that were not the case. It’s healthy.\n\nWhat are the odds that you’ll return to Goldman Sachs (gs)?\n\nI jokingly told people here that eventually there’s going to be a “crypto desk” at Goldman, and maybe that will be a retirement job for me. For the foreseeable future, I’m all about building blockchain-based decentralized services. So that’s probably not anytime soon.', 'The first step in any recovery, even an economic or political one, is the admittance of an actual problem. In the grand scheme during our present day, this is politically or economically impossible due to the fickle nature of markets and the increasingly fast nature of the press media. Were Bitcoin or something like it to eventually, as it were, take over the economy, this would inflict both political and economic consequences on the people at large. Namely, the value of all money would rise if transactions were primarily conducted with a fixed-supply asset.\n\nSuch things seem obvious to us now, having had years of experience with Bitcoin in practice. The first question of many is: is Bitcoin a store of value, a currency, or is it a digital currency? We understand that it does, in fact, work as all three currently, despite what some believe. If you had earned a lot of bitcoins in 2015, for instance, when Bitcoin’s core price dropped as low as $200, or even lower on some exchanges, and then had recently decided to sell them, you’d have made a handy 400% profit on your work. Such is an incentive to buy and hold, or accept and hold – which is really buying with goods, anyhow – bitcoins, and then sell them when the price rises. There are charts currently showing Bitcoin capable of reaching $1200.\n\nBut, our dear reader is not surprised to hear such things from the likes of CryptoCoinsNews. After all, this is what we do. It is our wheel house. If it is crypto related, we are there. But what of the mainstream financial press, who cover many of the same aspects as us? Over the past five years, the mainstream media have gone through several steps of the recovery process with Bitcoin. First, they had to acknowledge that it existed, and that it may be solving a problem they didn’t know existed: the desire to transact privately, with cash, without a trace and without actual cash – as in, online. Thus was born the currency aspect, and this was most blown out of proportion during the Silk Road times. Just before that time, 2011, Financial Times wrote of Bitcoin:\n\nWe like the currency trader’s rather more nuanced take, and also Simpson’s own appraisal after using bitcoins to buy lunch (houmous and olives, if you were wondering) at a New York restaurant: “My Bitcoins have lost value since I bought them, but I’m not writing this to ask you to buy them from me. I’m completely content to be the greater fool. I’m writing this to emphasize that Bitcoin is an experiment, which is something very different from a Ponzi scheme. This experiment will probably fail at some point for reasons other people have already enumerated, and that’s fine. We’ll have learned an enormous amount from it.”\n\nThen, during that time, in 2012, the Financial Times said of Bitcoin:\n\nBitcoin halved in value on other exchanges after Mt Gox posted a message on its website saying: “Orders will not be accepted for the moment as we need to upgrade our database to accommodate the trading volume.” The question now is whether merchants and Bitcoin users abandon the nascent economy because of the volatility.\n\nThis is a running theme with the Financial Times versus Bitcoin: Bitcoin’s volatility on trading markets is a liability to it as a currency. Meanwhile, said volatility is also what makes it most attractive to traders, who ultimately produce its value at market. Therefore, the single thing that makes Bitcoin most valuable at this time in terms of dollars is also the thing which the Financial Times likes the least about it.\n\nIn 2013, the publication took a more in-depth look at the currency. This is the year that made Bitcoin, in many people’s eyes. Everyone was talking about it, from the crime beats regarding the Silk Road to the financial press. The publication had no choice, and so said of it, on deeper review:\n\nIf Bitcoin has value, thus, it’s in its ability to dodge taxes and its antisocial nature.\n\nYes, forget about the soundness of the figures – the impossibility to counterfeit, and the myriad of other positives that Bitcoin represents. Obfuscation of funds from government agents is its only value, this particular article. Perhaps in 2014, we’ll get a more honest assessment of the thing, but instead we\n\nPerhaps in 2014, we’ll get a more honest assessment of the thing, but instead, we find:\n\nTo wit, something which originated as pirate code for the purpose of extending the durability of illegitimate cash claims has turned into a veiled public extortion mechanism.\n\nSeveral times, the publication has wrongly named Bitcoin a “pyramid scheme,” and these acts of intellectual dishonesty are not consistent. As we see, in 2011, the publication accepted that Bitcoin was experimental, rather than a scam. After all, the technology itself prevents money from being stolen in ways that banks can simply never achieve – properly done, it’s infinitely more secure than handing your funds over to someone else in plain text (cash). Yet, in 2015 and again this month, FT has gone full sour grapes.\n\nFT seems incapable of making up its mind about Bitcoin as a currency, a tradeable asset, or even a technology. Here in the cryptosphere, we’ve long since decided that there is something worth investigating here. We spend a lot of time researching and talking about this thing, because it is in our wheelhouse. Given that FT does not consider Bitcoin as an actual threat to the banking system, or a valid way to do currency, or even a particularly novel technology, what have they to gain by writing about it at all?\n\nThere is a possibility that coverage in the Financial Times has more to do with influence than information – that is, perhaps a wide swath of its readership need to be influenced away from Bitcoin. So long as the masses of investors are stuck in the status quo, so too can the fiat money system, and so too can the many layers of rent-seekers who exist around it. Perhaps this is explanation: it is against their better interests to be in any way kind to something which could bankrupt much of their readership if allowed to flourish. What is for sure: the Financial Times is not interested in honestly assessing Bitcoin up to this point. The speed at which they do so probably correlates to the rate at which their readership passes on to the next life.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The largest internet conglomerate in Japan, the GMO Internet Group, recently announced that they will be diving into the cryptocurrency industry, adding another own wallet and exchange to the already-competitive Japanese Bitcoin landscape. A new company founded specifically for this venture, GMO Wallet Co., Ltd., was founded in October.\n\nAs the largest and most successful company in the country, for both Internet services and online securities trading, GMO could quickly become serious competition to the rest of Japan’s Bitcoin industry.\n\n- GMO Internet Group\n\nWhile estimating that the market size in Japan for cryptocurrencies will grow to 1 trillion yen, or US$8.7 billion, “in a few years,” the main reason for the new venture cited is a recent improvement in the Japanese regulatory environment, following several bitcoin rulings from the Japanese government.\n\nA December ruling from the newly-formed Cabinet Office Ordinance on Virtual Currency, part of the Japanese Financial Services Agency, debated the “revised fund settlement law"" announced in May. The agency is in favor of making Japan the first country to legally treat bitcoin and other digital currencies as a currency instead of a commodity.\n\nAnother law advancing digital currencies in Japan mentioned has yet to pass, but according to the GMO Internet Group, hints at the possibility of a change in digital currency taxation. “The Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency are considering the elimination of the consumption tax on the transaction of virtual currency by the spring of 2017,” states the recent GMO Group announcement.\n\n- GMO Internet Group\n\nThe GMO Group is the umbrella company for a range of internet businesses, which make it the primary internet infrastructure company in Japan. As the first and largest domain registrar in the country, and the source of all .tokyo domains, the company started in the early 1990’s.\n\nThe group has a focus on IT infrastructure business such as domain, cloud, hosting, and security. “We have many services with the largest share in Japan,” the company claims.\n\nThe company has over 5,100 employees located in 60 offices throughout 18 countries. The most recent company estimates claim 135 billion yen, or US$1.17 billion in sales during 2016. To learn more about the company in an entertaining way, be sure to read GMO Internet Group’s short Manga comic featuring their full-service line.\n\nMuch like Google, the company has been buying complimentary internet-based services that work together synergistically. Unlike Google, however, GMO has also found success in video gaming, online Forex trading, and securities marketplaces, offering some of the most popular trading websites in the world.\n\nGMO Click Securities, known since 2005 as Z.com, is the largest Japanese Foreign Exchange (Forex) trading market, and the world’s seventh largest Forex market according to Fairreporters, an independent polling agency. Registered in Hong Kong, Z.com focuses primarily on the Japanese market and had a daily volume around $7.1 Billion USD in 2015.\n\nDespite being new to the Wallet and Exchange sectors, the group has been operating as a Bitcoin merchant payment services provider since November 2014. GMO Payment Gateway is already the biggest provider of credit card merchant processing in Japan with over 48,000 retail clients.\n\nThe Group’s capital investment arm, GMO Ventures, is also an investor in Bitflyer, a leading bitcoin exchange. Bitflyer has been sending merchants to GMO Payment Gateway when they need bitcoin payment processing. The announcement did not mention whether that relationship will continue once a GMO Internet Group company becomes the competition.\n\nJapan is currently the world’s second-largest bitcoin trade market, with roughly twice the daily trade volume of the US dollar market, and has a range of bitcoin services on offer. Bitflyer currently leads the exchange market, with nearly 68 percent of the daily Bitcoin trading volume.\n\nThe fourth-largest competing exchange by volume, Zaif, launched the Zaif Coin Reserve in May last year. The new bitcoin investment service allows users to buy their bitcoins automatically, with Dollar Cost Averaging. Meanwhile, the company partnered on a TV show called “BitGirls” in September, a variety style show that lets young women compete with random talents for a chance at stardom while viewers trade contestant specific cryptocurrencies.\n\nCoincheck, the third largest exchange at press time, is working with several utility companies across Japan to offer it’s customers a way to pay their electricity bill with bitcoin. The company also offers merchant services to Japanese businesses who want to take Bitcoin, and has signed up some large companies already such as DMM, a mixed-format entertainment store that is the 26th most popular website in Japan.\n\nThe second largest Yen exchange is Singapore’s Quoine. Several other countries like China, Luxembourg, and the US all have popular exchanges in the Yen market as well.', 'Marijuana, the wonder plant as some call it is going through a liberation phase in the United States. In 37 out of 50 states have relaxed the laws regarding the sale and use of marijuana and its derivatives in the past few years. Most of these states approve of the medical use of marijuana while a handful also makes an exception for recreational use. But these relaxations come with riders to make it difficult for businesses dealing with cannabis.\n\nAccording to reports, Senators Steve Conway and Ann Rivers have filed a new bill in the Washington State Senate to prevent local cannabis businesses from using Bitcoin as a mode of payment. An excerpt from the bill was quoted on one of the online publication saying,\n\n“A marijuana producer, marijuana processor, or retail outlet must not pay with or accept virtual currency for the purchase or sale of marijuana or any marijuana product.”\n\nThere have been multiple reports in the past stating the unwillingness of mainstream banking and financial institutions when it comes to providing services to marijuana businesses. In the absence of proper access to financial services, the marijuana industry has started depending heavily on Bitcoin as an alternative. Many dispensaries have been accepting cryptocurrencies since 2014. If the bill gets passed in the Senate, these businesses will be in trouble as they will have no other alternative but to handle significant amounts of cash on a daily basis. It will also turn these businesses into potential targets for thieves.\n\nThe current issue is mainly due to the difference of opinion between the state and federal governments regarding the legality of marijuana. Unlike state laws, possession, sale, and use of marijuana remain a federal offence.\n\nThere are speculations in the press about an upcoming legal battle between cannabis businesses and the government in the event of the bill being passed, targeting a particular industry with unjustifiable restrictions.\n\nRef: HighTimes | PewTrusts | Image: NewsBTC', 'At this week\'s North American Bitcoin Conference, P2P digital cash startup Abra announced that, starting next month, it will begin its long-awaited global rollout.\n\nIt\'s a move that Abra has had in the works since May, when CEO Bill Barhydt said he was eager for the startup, founded in 2014, to make the transition ""as quickly as possible"".\n\nNotably, the latest news provided new details on what this long-held plan might look like in action.\n\nIn a blog post published this week, Abra revealed that, at launch, its wallets will support the buying, selling and storing of bitcoin, as well as over 50 traditional currencies, which it said can also be sent peer-to-peer using the service.\n\nAccording to Barhydt, the system is now ready for primetime.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""We\'ve put the system through its paces over the past year and built out our infrastructure to be able to scale to millions of users.""\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based startup will begin gradually launching the service in select markets, where users send digital cash via their phone number.\n\nAs previously detailed, users can also act as tellers, providing liquidity to the system along with the startup\'s exchange partners. Abra users can find a teller nearby and carry out a cash transaction in exchange for bitcoin or fiat currency in the app.\n\n""I hand that teller $500, he accepts the $500, pushes whatever currency is on his phone to my phone, it automatically gets converted to bitcoin regardless of which currency in their Abra wallet they\'re holding,"" Barhydt explained. ""The Abra system is capable of doing a dual foreign exchange transaction on the fly.""\n\nThis feature is still being finalized, but if the on-boarding works with little or no hiccups, the firm will ""flip the switch globally,"" he said.\n\nFocus on usability\n\nAt the core of the product is usability. Barhydt likes to point out how his mother, in her 70s, can use the Abra app with no issue.\n\nBut in spite of the boasts, the CEO remained tight-lipped about the company\'s user numbers and teller numbers. He claimed the company will begin publishing statistics in late spring, but told CoinDesk that in the Philippines there are a few thousand tellers and a backlog of people applying to take on the role.\n\nIt\'s a clichéd comparison, but the CEO likens the Abra system to Uber. Location and fees are some factors in choosing a teller, but so too are the ratings, which generate trust.\n\nThe primary motivation for becoming a teller is, of course, making money. Tellers can set their own rates for transactions (from which the startup will take a cut of around 20%), so the cost for users will vary.\n\n""If you\'re in Mexico City, the teller is going to get away with 1–2.5% for money in and money out and be very competitive with ATMs,"" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, he said someone in a rural location with fewer users around, you may get away with rates as high as 3–5%.\n\nHowever, Barhydt believes some tellers will use the app in settings like relief work and charities to help people get access to money. In these cases, no rate is charged and Abra takes no cut.\n\n""Their motivation is helping people help themselves, like giving them access to financial services that they normally wouldn’t have access to,"" he said. ""Think about Somalia, think about the African refugees that are coming to Europe.""\n\nHurdles to overcome\n\nAbra is pushing the teller system hard, and it wants everyday people to sign up and become tellers to help grow the network. Yet, according to some technology observers, the ability for such a network to take off remains in question.\n\nTo Dr Paul Ennis, assistant professor at University College Dublin, it\'s still difficult to tell if this teller model will work at scale, but not just because it\'s built on the bitcoin network.\n\n""As novel as human ATMs sound, I think all that will matter to most people are the fundamentals – namely, are they cheaper than Western Union when it comes to remittances?"" he said.\n\nEnnis emphasized that the cost factor would like be an issue for any user, even those who had previously used only an open-source wallet on top of bitcoin. He called it a challenge, but potentially an ""exceptionally rewarding one"".\n\nStill, Barhydt envisions that, in the short term, most Abra users will be using tellers, but eventually more people will integrate their bank accounts too.\n\n""My prediction is that 50% will use Abra via bank accounts using our exchange partner integration, and 50% will use the teller network,"" he said.\n\nThe main barrier to that right now is the paucity of exchange partners in major markets.\n\nIt currently has no such partners in Europe, so if the app launches there soon, only the teller system will be available. Barhydt said it is working on deals in this area to facilitate more people linking their bank accounts.\n\n""We\'ve been working with exchanges all over the world for some time and expect to see lots of announcements in that area,"" he said.\n\nCritical mass\n\nAll in all, Barhydt has plenty of lofty ideas about what Abra can become, but expectations may need to be managed.\n\nCurrently, the startup is letting a select number of merchants accept payments with a view to selling merchant APIs in the future.\n\nOnce again it sounds all very simple, but it’s going to take time. The reality is that Abra still needs to build up its network of tellers, get more liquidity in the system and constantly improve the usability to make it attractive to merchants in the first place.\n\nSome observers have been positive about the firm\'s plan.\n\n""I believe Abra\'s model is potentially viable,"" Dr Garrick Hileman, senior research associate at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, told CoinDesk.\n\nHe added:\n\n""There are two key elements to it succeeding: the expansion of Abra’s teller network, which will need to achieve critical mass, and wide-scale user adoption of alternative channels for moving value across borders.""\n\nIt\'s a work in progress, but next month’s global launch marks a significant step for the startup, which has raised $14m in VC funding so far.\n\nBarhydt concludes by saying he believes the world hasn\'t seen anything like Abra before:\n\n“You have a lot of domestic payment apps both in the banking world as well as the bitcoin world, but you don’t have anybody that’s tried to be that global P2P solution to send money between any two phone numbers in the world.”\n\nGlobes image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It protected assets and wealth of individuals struggling to deal with economic uncertainty and financial instability of certain regions.\n\nThe next stage in the long-term roadmap of Bitcoin is building mainstream awareness as a currency, taking over multi-trillion dollar markets dependent on fiat or banking services.\n\nTuur Demeester, chief editor at Adamant Research, specified seven major multi-trillion dollar markets which Bitcoin can compete with in the future. These included electronic payments, e-commerce, remittance, hedge fund, gold, cash and offshore deposit market.\n\nHuge potential of electronic payments and remittance markets\n\nSome markets mentioned above are already being challenged by Bitcoin primarily because of Bitcoin’s ability to eliminate third-party service providers or institutions to oversee activities through manual processes.\n\nIn particular, the $2 tln electronic payments and $514 bln remittance markets have seen a rapid emergence of innovative Bitcoin startups and service providers that are gradually acquiring promising market share.\n\nWithin the global remittance market, Cointelegraph reported yesterday that the highly anticipated Bitcoin-based application Abra is planning its international launch next month to create a decentralized network of remittance senders and receivers.\n\nEssentially, Abra is like a peer-to-peer version of dominant remittance companies like Western Union, in the sense that users can send payments to recipients internationally who can then receive transactions through individual Abra tellers. The key difference between Western Union and Abra is that the latter guarantees lower fees and a more secure network with non-fraudulent transactions.\n\nThe Philippines which oversees some of the largest remittance markets across the globe has also seen the growing popularity of Bitcoin-based remittance service providers like Bitspark, Rebit.ph and Coins.ph three companies that have established reliable and robust infrastructures within the country. Startups like Bitspark and Rebit.ph even allow Filipino users to send money to international recipients instantaneously with low fees.\n\nIn several multi-trillion markets, Bitcoin has overtaken key players and industry leaders. For example, within the remittance market, the market cap of Bitcoin surpassed Western Union a dominant organization which has served the global remittance market as the base platform.\n\nOldie but goldie\n\nThe $7 bln gold market is another key market that Bitcoin is directly competing against.\n\nIn regions like India and China where gold imports and exports are either banned or heavily regulated with local authorities seizing the precious metal from residents, the demand for Bitcoin is increasing at a rapid rate.\n\nTraders and investors in two of the largest gold markets are looking for alternative safe haven assets like Bitcoin to protect their wealth.', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur.

ING and Societe Generale, a Dutch and French bank respectively will aid in the execution of the deal, a Reuters report has confirmed.\n\nThe deal was announced by Mercuria co-founder and chief executive Marco Dunand during the recently concluded World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nDunand has previously stated that blockchain technology was going to usher in “a digital transformation of the oil and gas industry.” Speaking at an October 2016 industry summit, he had stated at the time: “I’ve seen sufficient bank presentations to believe the [blockchain] technology is there and it’s solid.”\n\nThe executive described the existing process of a trade as “pre-archaic” during the WEF panel. Necessary paperwork requires the bill of lading, essentially a document issued by the transporter acknowledging receipt of cargo for shipment, to be stamped by the ship’s captain. This paper will then have to go through customs at ports, surveyors, and other officials along the way. The paperwork is compounded with letters of indemnity, if the original documents see processing delays.\n\nIn contrast, Dunand sees blockchain technology make for a sweeping solution with standardized smart contracts. Besides the reduction of time and effort in paperwork, costs associated with financing and physical transactions would also be significantly streamlined with the participation of creditors and banks. Dunand estimates that costs could be reduced as much as 30%.\n\n“It’s a pre-archaic process,” Dunand said of today’s trading process, before adding:\n\nSo, introducing blockchain will allow to pass title from buyer to shipper to seller without going through massive paperwork of bills of lading.\n\nThe global scale of the trade industry coupled with the lack of acknowledgement of blockchain technology by authorities around the world is perhaps the only stumbling block toward standardized adoption.\n\nHe stated:\n\nGoing forward the challenges will be on the legal side as the blockchain technology is still not recognized by many governments.

01/22/2017,"[""SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges, whose activities have drawn increased scrutiny from the central bank, said they will begin charging trading fees effective Tuesday.\n\nBTCC, Huobi and OkCoin said in separate statements on their websites late on Sunday that they will charge traders a flat fee of 0.2 percent per transaction.\n\nEach of the statements said assessing fees will “further curb market manipulation and extreme volatility”.\n\nThe absence of trading fees has encouraged volumes and boosted demand at Chinese bitcoin exchanges. The New York Times, citing data by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, reported in late June that 42 percent of all bitcoin transactions took place on Chinese exchanges in the first half of the year.\n\nThe bitcoin price BTC=BTSP soared to near-record highs in the first week of this year, attracting attention from Chinese regulators. During 2016, China's yuan currency CNY=CFXS weakened 6.6 percent against the dollar, its worst performance since 1994.\n\nOn Jan. 11, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) launched spot checks on BTCC, Huobi and OkCoin to look into a range of possible rule violations, amid increasing government efforts to stem capital outflows and relieve pressure on the yuan.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said the exchanges had not received direct instructions from the PBOC, but decided to introduce trading fees to align with its wishes to see the bitcoin market cool down.\n\nOn Monday morning, the price of bitcoin was down around 1 percent on the BTCC exchange to 6,317 yuan, equivalent to around $923.\n\nBTCC Chief Executive Bobby Lee said last week that the three exchanges had discussed introducing trading fees."", 'Grayscale Investments LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, Inc., recently filed to list its Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in a $500 million initial public offering, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Shares of the trust, which have traded over the counter, have traded at a premium to the bitcoin price, according to Marketwatch.\n\nThe trust, which launched in 2013 and exclusively invests in bitcoin, is one of the few options available to institutional investors who seek to exposure to bitcoin. BIT began trading on the OTCQX market May 4 under the ticker symbol GBTC.\n\nRestrictions On Share Purchases\n\nThe offering will be made only by means of a prospectus. According to the SEC filing, the shares can be purchased from the trust only in one or more blocks of 100 shares. The trust issues baskets (100 shares) to certain authorized participants. Each authorized participant must be a registered broker-dealer and have entered into a participant agreement with the sponsor.\n\nThe trust is currently in discussions with KCG Americas LLC and Wedbush Securities to serve as authorized participants.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the transfer agent for shares of the fund. Xapo Inc., a bitcoin wallet, will act as custodian of the BIT bitcoins.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2016, the trust’s net asset value was $102,639,992 and its net asset value per share was $56.94. As of Sept. 30, 2016, its bitcoin holdings were $102,767,265 and its bitcoin holdings per share was $57.01.\n\nFiling Notes Risk Factors\n\nUnder the section on risk factors, the filing noted the growth of bitcoin is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of this industry include:\n\n• continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins and other digital currencies;\n\n• regulation of bitcoins and other digital assets and their use;\n\n• changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\n• maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol;\n\n• availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;\n\n• general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets; and\n\n• negative consumer perception of bitcoins specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.\n\nThe filing also noted that in 2014 and 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the trust considered Bitstamp to be its principal market, with an exception for the period of Jan. 5, 2015 through Jan. 31, 2015 when it relied on pricing from Bitfinex. On Jan. 5, 2015, Bitstamp suffered a disruption of operations, and in accordance with the trust’s procedures for determining its principal market, Bitfinex was relied upon until Jan. 31, 2015 when the trust determined that it could again rely upon Bitstamp as the principal market.\n\nSEC Considers 2 Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe SEC is now considering whether to approve two proposed bitcoin ETFs.

The Scottish Crypto will be 11 years old in February. Frankly, its performance in 2016 was something to write home about. The security conscious digital currency made a strong statement when it stormed the top 10 on CoinMarketCap in the last quarter of the year dislodging digital assets like NEM, Augur and even Steem to the bottom.\n\nNick Lambert, Chief Operating Officer of MaidSafeCoin, attributes their notable success to changes in the technical team and how they work. Before 2015, 10 percent of their developers were based outside Scotland but in 2016 that changed to 75 percent.\n\n""We have been decentralizing our developer base to recruit worldwide and we were able to get a much better caliber of developers,"" Lambert revealed to Cointelegraph.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Price is fluctuating, Altcoins take time for improvements\n\nMaidSafeCoin\'s initial focus in 2017 is enabling non-technical people to use encryption technology like PGP, run their own servers, anonymize, and so on to make sure their data is secure and private.\n\nLambert also mentioned the development of a mobile wallet but when asked whether the crypto community should expect a MaidSafeCoin mobile wallet in 2017, he declined to make a commitment. It is clear the focus has been on the desktop wallet to make sure everything works precisely.\n\nHe says:\n\n“We are now changing our API so that we\'ll cater for people to run on mobile devices which are always essential. Most of Africa runs on Smartphones and we need to cater for all those markets.”\n\nWhile the Chief Operating Officer of MaidSafeCoin agrees that their primary focus is security, however, he differs in that the crypto is the most secure but in the echelons of the most secured. ""Everything we do around the network is focused on security. MaidSafeCoin is hopeful it will be one of the most secure,"" Lambert assured.\n\nThe company sees underfunding and lack of enough developers as the most pressing problem. But the COO does not think there will be an ICO sooner or later.\n\nFargocoin and Byteball added to CoinMarketCap\n\nCoinMarketCap added two Cryptos a couple of weeks before 2016 ended that deserve mentioning. Fargocoin and Byteball have got something new and unique to enrich the ecosystem. They deserve our attention and resources.\n\nWith its unique Blockchain platform designed to increase network security and improve the limitations and functionality of initial cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Fargocoin’s Proof of Stake concept allows mining without massive hash power.\n\nA Spokesman of Fargocoin told Cointelegraph:\n\n""Proof of Stake is the best alternative solution to the original Proof of Work system that Bitcoin pioneered. A proof of stake system provides increased protection from a malicious attack on the network.""\n\nThe Crypto company claims since Proof of Stake is less energy, it is seen as a greener way to run a cryptocurrency network. Actually, the concept requiring spending no electricity to mine, creates an incentive for all to keep their wallets running 24/7.\n\nTony Churyumoff, CEO of Byteball, believes they are on board with a number of technical differences, which are important, but most of all ease of use, which is commonly neglected in the crypto market. As at the time of filing this report, Byte was at number 26 on CoinMarketCap. That is very impressive for a digital currency that was listed less than two months ago.\n\nTo expand beyond the narrow niches that the industry currently occupies there is the need for user experiences that appeal to average users who are not experts in cryptography. Byteball makes payments easier with an integrated communication making most interactions in Byteball wallet conversational.\n\nChuryumuff revealed:\n\n“We have a built-in chat which allows users to accomplish tasks quite fast and in the lightweight interface with payments that can be done in two clicks. ”\n\nThe cryptocurrency\'s decentralized platform for payments gives users the degree of control that they never had before. It allows to be connected to payments of events happening in the real world, and this is achieved through smart contracts that are user readable, easy to understand, and don’t require to trust a developer.', ""The debate about whether Bitcoin network is becoming increasingly centralized rages on. But if the community doesn't start focusing on scalability, it may not matter anymore.\n\nBitcoin is an open source, decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. That has been the standard definition of the popular digital currency. But many agree to disagree with it, leading to a never-ending debate on increasing centralization of Bitcoin network.\n\nThere are those who believe that it is highly unlikely for the Bitcoin network to become centralized anytime soon. And then there many who think that the Chinese mining farms and pools are already commanding a dominant position in the Bitcoin network by owning a significant chunk of hashing power.\n\nThe current state of affairs in the Bitcoin community has done nothing but reinforce the doubt about the network becoming increasing centralized. There has always been a lack of consensus between the developer and miner communities. Now the debate is renewed, thanks to scalability issues currently faced by the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe CTO of BitGo, Ben Davenport in his recent tweet has mentioned,\n\n“Centralization of mining has led to some miners thinking they’re in charge of Bitcoin. They forgot where Bitcoin’s value comes from.”\n\nHis tweet received a response from Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and Director of Engineering at Coinbase. He included the mining pools into the equation by saying,\n\n“@bendavenport what’s more surprising is that pools think they are in charge.”\n\nHowever, what triggered this conversation is up for speculation, and it is possible that the recent argument about whether or not SegWit is the answer to Bitcoin scalability may have a bearing on it.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin Unlimited, with the blessing of “Bitcoin Jesus,” Roger Ver seems to be trying hard to get noticed as the next best thing for scaling Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAnswering to Ben’s question to the miners, it is quite evident that the Bitcoin value is driven by the demand and supply, created by traders and users of the digital currency. Without these transactions, miners will probably be unable to get anything out of the cryptocurrency network.\n\nNo matter who is calling the shots, and whether Bitcoin is centralized or not. It is time for the digital currency community to get together and address the increasing problem of overcrowded mempool. If the delays in Bitcoin transactions and the growing miner fee is not tackled, the cryptocurrency might never emerge as a real, feasible alternative to fiat and fiat-backed cryptotokens operated on private blockchains by banking and financial institutions.\n\nRef: Twitter | Medium Blog | Image: Bluehill Research"", 'Journalism funding is in crisis. As the industry shifts to digital and its meagre click-based ad revenues, something in the model needs to change if quality news sources are to survive.\n\nAlternatives are emerging, however.\n\nNew attention, for example, is being paid to alternatives to traditional ad models. Major publishers including Time and The New York Times are increasingly keen on accessing the feasibility of micropayments models.\n\nAmidst the rising demand for blockchain projects, the two ideas are now becoming more intertwined.\n\nCoinDesk recently inked a partnership with bitcoin-powered browser called Brave. The startup is seeking to take significant steps towards implementing a cross-platform micropayment system for news content – an idea that has been mooted since the 2000s and before, but never implemented.\n\nLess well-known is another more niche use of cryptocurrency as a new media strategy: the issuance and trading of custom tokens as a way to raise funds, reward audience engagement and grant privileged access to premium content.\n\nThis technique is already being pioneered by bloggers and blockchain enthusiasts on a smaller scale.\n\nKoji Higashi, author of the Japanese language Coin And Peace blog, went so far as to create a custom token – CNPCoin – using a blockchain protocol called Counterparty. He is now distributing the token to readers who comment on his blog or share its links on social media.\n\nHigashi explained the idea:\n\n""Say I write an article, update my blog and tweet about it. If someone retweets it I follow up and say, \'You retweeted my article – if you can create a Counterparty wallet and tell me your address, I can give you X amount of my coin.\'""\n\nValued content\n\nThe attention received from this idea has helped Higashi to bootstrap the blog, even though the token had no real-world value at first.\n\nHowever, as readership and interest in the blog grew, he started to create premium content that could only be accessed by readers holding more than a certain amount of CNPCoin.\n\nFrom then on, CNPCoin started to take on a demonstrable value as an access token, which let Higashi move into the next phase: setting up a system where readers could tip him in bitcoin if they enjoyed his blog posts – and receive CNPCoin in exchange.\n\n“It started off as a pure experiment, just to see what would happen, but I actually got quite a lot of tips from it,"" Higashi said.\n\nHigashi said one unknown reader even tipped him 1 BTC, a significant amount no matter when it might have been sent over the last few years.\n\nThe cost of \'free\'\n\nThe idea has other proponents as well.\n\nAs an early mover in the field of using tokens as a media promotion strategy, Adam B Levine, CEO of Tokenly and creator of the ""Lets Talk Bitcoin!"" podcast, began distributing a currency token called LTBCoin to contributors and participants of the LTB network in 2014.\n\nLevine said that underpinning LTBCoin was an initial idea that whatever is valuable in the currency ecosystem should be rewarded with a payout, but this could extend beyond the process of mining, the method by which contributors to the bitcoin protocol earn for participation.\n\n""I realized that if you didn\'t need to pay miners, you could reward people for other things. So, in our case that was podcasting, commenting, participating in the forums,” he said.\n\nEach week, new LTBCoins are created and distributed, up to a limit of 510 million coins over a total time span of 260 weeks.\n\nBut rather than computational hash solving, \'mining\' is done through content creation, audience participation and platform development.\n\nLTBCoin has been popular with the show\'s following (as product marketers have long known, giving any kind of free tokens or coupons is a great way to build interest), but in some cases it can also be a double-edged sword.\n\n""What we learned from the rewards programme is that it\'s hard to get people to value something when they\'re used to getting it for free,"" said Levine.\n\nThe initial problem was that LTBCoin was trying to create value, while being perceived as \'free money\', he said.\n\nLevine explained that some recipients of the coin, particularly those based in poorer countries, would try to immediately sell up on exchanges, creating a negative feedback loop that depressed the value for other holders of the coin who wanted to keep a vested stake.\n\nTo combat this, it became clear that what was needed was a supporting ecosystem that allowed coins to be used in a broader range of settings than just direct monetary exchange.\n\nLevine said:\n\n""At first we couldn’t do e-commerce with it, we couldn’t do anything with it ... Over time, that\'s what I\'ve spent the last several years of my life doing, building out the infrastructure and the different end user applications that you can easily make tokens valuable in.""\n\nIn practice, that meant developing services like Swapbot, a system that creators of a custom token can use for automatically issuing and redeeming tokens against other forms of cryptocurrency (an example is the Tokenly bot).\n\nBut even with additional services, developing a community token is fraught with problems.\n\nRecently, LTBCoin holders were disappointed by the decision of Poloniex to delist the coin from its exchange due to low trade volume, adding more friction to the process of conversion to and from other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBigger picture\n\nFor media producers outside of specialist cryptocurrency circles, distributing custom currency tokens is unlikely to be a big revenue stream for now.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that cryptocurrency as a whole remains obscure to much of the mainstream media – as an illustration, consider that even in a time of declining revenue, most major news organizations have not made any progress toward accepting bitcoin donations.\n\nBut success stories from solo entrepreneurs like Koji Higashi suggest that tokens could be a better fit for independent bloggers or small networks, which are often more open to experimentation beyond conventional channels.\n\nCryptocurrency alone won’t provide a big enough patch for holes in revenue left by the decline of print publishing, but it’s still one of many possible income streams that have been underexploited by the mainstream so far.\n\nAs with many applications of blockchain tech, time may tell how it will come to fruition.\n\nNewspaper image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In a lot of cases, a Trojan alert will show up, indicating the file download is potentially malicious. However, that does not seem to be the case, and this alert is a false positive. Users are still advised to manually verify the SHA256 checksum for the file, though.\n\nIt seems rather strange downloading Bitcoin Core would trigger a Trojan warning. According to Reddit sources, the reason behind this false positive is not difficult to find. Allegedly, some /r/BC members have made false virus reports on the Bitcoin Core client downloads. This issue has been going on for some time, as previous client versions were also flagged with riskware warnings.\n\nBitcoin Core Is Safe To Download\n\nIt is unclear why these /r/BTC members would deliberately try to get Bitcoin Core flagged as a malicious client. This seems to be a desperate attempt to push Bitcoin Unlimited adoption, which is going nowhere right now. If that is the case, this is a fine example of the new lows some people will stoop to. It is unfortunate to see events like these take place, though, as it brings negative attention to the Bitcoin industry.\n\nThankfully, it is not hard to verify the integrity of the latest Bitcoin Core client. Most antivirus solutions will not report any major issues with the download. False positives can be quite annoying to deal with, especially when the report makes a mention of malicious Bitcoin mining software included in the client.\n\nBaidu labels the Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 client as a WisdomEyes Trojan, even though that is not the case. Quick Heal sees it as the Controller Trojan. It is quite intriguing to see all of these scanning services report something entirely different, indicating this is just a collection of random fake reports. Very disturbing, to say the least, yet there is a way to verify the integrity of this download.\n\nEvery time someone aims to download the Bitcoin Core client from the website, it displays the SHA256 checksum. Users can manually verify this checksum to determine if the file is genuine. A quick check will show the entire world everything is just fine, and this file can be trusted. Sadly, most users will not take the necessary steps to go to these lengths. All they will see if the fake virus warning and decide not to download the client. In the long term, this could have catastrophic consequences for Bitcoin as a whole.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'The Fintech industry is currently in its prime. The increasing usage of cryptocurrency technology for financial applications has made blockchain technology synonymous with financial technology. The year 2016 signaled the rise of fintech sector, with many companies, both big and small coming up with some of the cutting-edge technology for banking and financial institutions.\n\nA leading online technology magazine has recently published its predictions for 2017, similar to the one from last year. The author behind these predictions claims to have gotten at least 75% of previous year’s predictions right.\n\nAccording to the author, this year will see the number of fintech companies, at least in the United States reduce drastically. The reasons for such an occurrence ranges from increasing costs, realignment of focus towards different verticals apart from fintech, stiff competition from startups and even mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships. Such an occurrence is already prevalent in the cryptocurrency industry, which makes it a bit less surprising to the Bitcoin community.\n\nThe fintech companies that are responsible for some of the leading technology solutions may soon find themselves in the position to offer services to investors directly. These fintech companies are expected to receive banking charters, enabling them to provide B2C asset management services. The creation of commodity and asset-backed crypto-tokens is a start. These tokens along with proprietary blockchain platforms will soon become the best places for easy and quick investments and trading.\n\nEven though most of these predictions are directly or indirectly related to the developments in distributed ledger technology, blockchain receives a special place in the forecast. The author expects blockchain based platforms to become operational during 2017. Many platforms have already undergone successful trials in the past year, and there are chances of at least a small percentage of them going live in 2017.\n\nThe previous year has already laid the groundwork for all the predictions that are stated by the author. If the fintech industry continues to develop at the same pace, then all these aforementioned scenarios are bound to unfold. However, there are concerns of Brexit throwing a spanner in the works, in which case, there will be a slight delay in these predictions coming true.\n\nRef: TechCrunch | Image: NewsBTC', 'Hardly anyone will be surprised to learn virtually nothing has changed in the Monero markets over the past 48 hours. It is one of the most stable alternative cryptocurrencies to date, which makes it less appealing to speculators. That is a good thing in general, as it gives XMR plenty of time to grow organically.\n\nMonero Continues To Truck On In Its Own Way\n\nWhen cryptocurrencies grow stable for too long, they risk becoming boring to the average speculator. Monero is well underway to become one of the most boring altcoin markets right now, and that situation will not change anytime soon. Some people will see this as a positive trend, as less speculation means less volatile price swings.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of traders are attracted to cryptocurrencies due to their wild price changes, as bitcoin continues to hover around the same mark for quite some time now. If Monero continues its current stable course, it is not unlikely the trading volume will continue to decline as more time progresses.\n\nSpeaking of the trading volume, things have been going from bad to worse for XMR in this department. Its USD volume continues to shrink on a near-daily basis and is well below 10,000 XMR right now.That is anything but a positive trend, although it has not affected the price all that much. Thankfully for Monero, the current Bitcoin price is keeping its value afloat.\n\nIn the Bitcoin market, Monero continues to hang on to its value just above 0.013 BTC per XMR. The lack of trading volume is less apparent in the BTC market, with over 190,000 XMR worth of bitcoin changing hands over the past 24 hours. HitBTC has taken over the lead from Poloniex in this market, which is quite a surprise. Up until a few days ago, HitBTC was not even in the top 3 for XMR/BTC volume.\n\nAll things considered, Monero continues to hold on, albeit it is by a thin thread. Its value has not plummeted yet, even though there is plenty of liquidity in the bitcoin trading market. It is a mystery why HitBTC is so popular all of a sudden, but it puts an interesting spin on the XMR market for sure.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock']"
01/23/2017,"['Bitcoin is little changed at $924 a coin as of 7:26 a.m. ET.\n\nMonday\'s flat session comes despite some big news out of China. According to Reuters, the country\'s three largest bitcoin exchanges announced plans to begin charging a flat fee of 0.2% for each transaction. Releases from BTCC, Huobi, and OkCoin reportedly said the fees were being implemented to ""further curb market manipulation and extreme volatility.""\n\nBitcoin has had a wild start to 2017. The cryptocurrency rallied by more than 20% in the opening days of 2017 amid huge interest from China, which accounts for nearly 100% of trading. In fact, data from Cryptocompare found, ""In the first 24 hours of the new year, over 5 million bitcoins were bought in Chinese yuan, equating to $3.8 billion. In contrast, just 53,000 bitcoins were bought in US dollars.""\n\nThe early gains vanished in a matter of days, however, as bitcoin tumbled 35% on concerns that China was going to crack down on trading, with Beijing having announced it had begun investigating bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai on suspicion of market manipulation, money laundering, unauthorized financing, and other issues.\n\nBut bitcoin has managed to work its way off support in the $750 area, and it is trying to break out of resistance in the $880/$920 area that has defined trade for the past week.\n\nMonday\'s announcement could reduce some of the market volatility, as bitcoin traders in China won\'t be allowed to buy and sell without paying the new transaction fee.', 'Steve Jobs once said that “the ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do”.\n\nThat’s the motto an anonymous person took to heart as he shook up the financial world by creating an unregulated tech-based currency in early 2009. That very currency was developed using another revolutionary technology which is now in the news for its uses beyond trading unregulated online money, and has become a hot topic amongst financial and business executives recently.\n\nLet’s discuss what both technologies offer their users, and what the future holds for each.\n\nBitcoin’s introduction\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, created and held electronically on your PC or in a virtual wallet. No one controls it or sees it – it’s decentralized so no person, institution or bank controls the currency.\n\nIt was the year 2009 when bitcoin burst onto the financial scene, and soon computers all over the world started running sophisticated programs that would mine blocks of bitcoins by solving extremely complex mathematical equations. Mining bitcoin means to discover or verify new bitcoins because unlike traditional currency, bitcoin cannot be printed. Miners make money every time they discover new bitcoins or verify a bitcoin transaction.\n\nThere can only be a fixed 21 million bitcoins [to prevent inflation], out of which 15.5 million are currently in circulation, which leaves 5.5 million bitcoins to be discovered. These valued blocks of online information skyrocketed in price as time went on and investor appeal in the new technology grew. Today, January 19th, bitcoin is showing an upwards trend and is trading at US $890.90, below the US $1000 threshold it broke in November 2013.\n\nFigure 1 Bitcoin price between July 2010 and Jan 2017. Source: Coindesk\n\nTrading could be done online – anonymously, quickly, without hassle from regulatory and exchange bodies. The ease of use and lack of a trail led to flexibility unheard of in the financial world. But for all its benefits, the currency was overshadowed because of its anonymous, unregulated nature as it became easy for people to use the currency for illicit transactions that would stay off the books, as well as for schemes that swindled people.\n\nCoinbase has been one of the biggest proponents and enablers of bitcoin use. In an era where most traditional financial institutions avoid bitcoin discussions, the company sticks vehemently to its stand on bitcoin, likening the resistance of business executives to bitcoin to how companies once preferred private intranets over the open internet. We all know who won that battle!\n\nThe Blockchain\n\nWhile bitcoin had the power to make transactions untraceable, it was another innovation that promised to make every transaction transparent and permanent. Underlying the use of bitcoin is blockchain, which is almost entirely opposite its more famous alter-ego. Blockchain possesses the ability of having permanent records of the transactions the blocks (the name for their portions of value) are used for, and at any time people can see those changes online in real time. It is this transparency that people have hopes in, but that’s not the only thing blockchain does differently than the cryptocurrency it drove for so long.\n\nBlockchain can easily transfer everything from property rights to stocks and currencies without having to go through a middle man and clearing institution like SWIFT, while offering the same safety, higher speed and lower costs. Consider it from the financial perspective: billions of dollars are transferred daily in the financial markets, with every transaction being “cleared” by a middle man. Replacing the middle man with a revolutionary technology that is faster, cheaper and as secure will help save millions for businesses.\n\nTo put into perspective just how big the market is now and how big it will become, the World Economic Forum shared some metrics on Bitcoin and Blockchain. It estimates that currently $20 billion dollars’ worth of Bitcoin exists now on record. The bigger prediction, though, was that by 2027 about 10 percent of the entire global GDP would be stored on blockchains, meaning anyone who wanted to become part of that process still has time to get a piece of the pie.\n\nBanking allies\n\nBecause of its “cleaner” reputation than bitcoin, blockchain has garnered the support of different financial institutions behind its design. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Bank of America have expressed great interest in blockchain by joining a coalition to implement it into banking practices. In addition to those large financial players, Visa, NASDAQ, Citi, and others have also agreed to be clients for blockchain related services and technology. These large, long established institutions feel that blockchain has less of a negative image attached to it than bitcoin, and because of that they seem more open to trying out the technology.\n\nThe rush towards blockchain is simple: banks can increase the efficiency of their transactions by using their own permissioned blockchains to record all transactions done by their customers, as opposed to trying to record all that data with different types of software that become outdated every few years.\n\nHowever, some experts like Don Tapscott [University of Toronto] think that banks should be using blockchain technology not just to increase their banking capabilities, but to completely change how banking computing looks like for the entire industry.\n\nIndeed, outside of traditional banking, blockchain services have allowed users to engage in high value currency transactions already. The processing times on these transactions are very quick, and allow for a high volume of money to be exchanged and recorded.\n\nBitcoin startups and their evolving strategies\n\nMajor bitcoin players include names such as Bitreserve and Circle.\n\nBitreserve serves as an online portal to convert currency from one form to another. In the beginning, users had to deposit their currency in bitcoin form, and could then convert their bitcoin into 25 other world currencies or four different types of valuable metals. Circle at first only allowed use of its transfer services – amazingly quick money transfers to anyone, anywhere – to be done in bitcoin money, including the process of depositing, holding, and sending of currency.\n\nMany of the companies who started off using bitcoin as their main currency are changing to focus on blockchain as a whole. Bitreserve changed its name to Uphold and has since allowed depositing of currency in any form, and Circle has changed to allow use of credit and debit cards to be used for deposit, holding, and sending of money worldwide.\n\nMany startups that were created with a focus on bitcoin are changing to accommodate alternative currencies and to let others know that they are not nearly as bitcoin dependent as before for what seems to be a similar reason to the one banks use: that bitcoin has a negative connotation to it, and since blockchain is the hot commodity now, it seems like a smarter idea to tie the business to that. They hope that, as more businesses and users adopt the blockchain technology, their use of it will also allow them to gain in popularity and use.\n\nWhat it means for businesses\n\nFor players in the financial sector, the best thing to do right now would be to seriously consider the advantages of blockchain. While bitcoin is the most top of mind for the general public, blockchain is attracting the biggest forces in the finance sector with its clean reputation. More than that, blockchain offers the opportunity to revitalize modern value transactions as we know it, and those who get their stakes in before that happens will have the best chance to shape what happens after. It’s business management 101: first-mover advantage!\n\nIs it crazy to change course of your company to try something so new, something so different from what you have has been accustomed to. Maybe so. But as Steve Jobs very rightly noted when thinking about changing the world, financial or otherwise – it’s usually the crazy ones who do.\n\nRead next: ASUS made a beefed-up Raspberry Pi rival that plays 4K video', 'In May of 2010, someone on a Bitcoin forum by the name of Lazlo claimed to have bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. It was the first time anyone had purchased anything with the new digital currency, which at that time was valued at practically nothing.\n\nToday, the cryptocurrency market is worth nearly $19 billion and those 10,000 bitcoins would be worth more than $10 million. Most of the cryptocurrency market is in Bitcoin, followed by Ether, the currency used by the smart contract platform Ethereum. Now tech giants, like Microsoft, IBM and Amazon, as well as major Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, are investing in blockchain technology, the underlying class of technology that started with Bitcoin. Infosys, TCS, HCL, and Accenture are working on blockchain-based products for banks as well.\n\nWith the new year, everyone is wondering what’s to come in the next chapter. Based on my work in the field, here are five predictions on major trends in cryptocurrencies for 2017.\n\nInvestment funds will look to invest in cryptocurrencies\n\nAs an asset class, cryptocurrencies are tough to ignore. As I write this, Bitcoin is trading at just over $1,000. Hedge funds and venture capital firms will look for more ways to tap into the cryptocurrency market. Doing so will remove some of the social stigma around cryptocurrencies—mainly due to Bitcoin’s history of use on the dark markets—and popularize investment in cryptocurrencies.\n\nGlobal currency disorders are on the rise: Think of what’s happening in India, where the government recently scrapped 86 percent of cash in circulation, and in Venezuela, where currency is so devalued people now need to carry stacks of cash just to buy food. As a result, many retail investors are turning their attention to digital currencies, as well. Cryptocurrencies are free from government control. Governments can’t easily call in bitcoins or halt their movement across international borders without taking drastic actions.\n\nFinancial institutions, bound by charters that describe the types of investments they can embark upon, have had few means of putting their money into bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. But in 2017, we’ll see a greater push towards a diversity of cryptocurrencies as investments, and ETFs, hedge funds, and derivatives will start to act as conduits for institutions to gain exposure and get into the cryptocurrency game.\n\nPrivate blockchains will start feeling the burn\n\nPrivate blockchains (like the Hyperledger project from the Linux Foundation, R3CEV’s Corda, and the Gem Health network) will start to feel real friction. To date, private blockchains have gotten the benefit of the doubt, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in funding with little to show for it in production. Many of their projects are not terribly innovative, and haven’t been subjected to the same rigorous review as more public projects.\n\nGreater scrutiny from analysts, well-informed media, and investors will put some much-needed cold water on private blockchains in 2017.\n\nBitcoin will see SegWit introduction\n\nDespite the enormous technological and political difficulties involved in upgrading Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s core developers have finally introduced Segregated Witness to the network. The benefits of SegWit are clear: a higher transaction throughput without altering the block size, no transaction malleability and faster block validation. SegWit also makes it easier to develop better wallet software and permits off-chain transactions on the Lightning Network, a protocol for scaling and speeding up blockchains.<\n\nThere are no clear downsides to this upgrade, but it’s been taken hostage in the political battle over block size. Some mining pools are refusing to switch to SegWit, holding out for a block size increase instead, which does involve trade-offs. However, the fight seems to be running out of steam, which bodes well for SegWit.\n\nBitcoin usage will not change significantly\n\nThe price of Bitcoin will continue to rise due to increased demand from investors but usage—that is, how many people are using it to actually buy and sell things in the open market—will not change substantially. Arguably the biggest application for Bitcoin over the last few weeks has been as a tool for capital flight. In China, for instance, investors are buying bitcoins as part of a rush to convert their RMB into currencies that aren’t losing value. This means the currency won’t necessarily be trading hands much. Instead people will be holding on to it as a hedge or using it to get money out of their countries.\n\nExchanges will become a source of scrutiny\n\nRegulators will keep a light touch on the technologies behind cryptocurrencies, but they will look more closely at exchanges, which is where traditional banking meets the new world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile exchanges are an excellent resource, allowing people to conveniently buy and sell digital currencies with ease, they also centralize risk. This makes them a virtual honeypot for hacks and thefts. So increasingly we will see governments stepping in to oversee how they operate with an eye on consumer protection. Some regulation will include new ways to confirm identities and block money laundering—and in extreme cases, block exchanges all together. Take the case of Colbitex, the first bitcoin exchange in Colombia, which the Colombian government closed down in August, claiming bitcoin was not real money and therefore unregulated.\n\nOver a relatively short amount of time, we’ve watched cryptocurrencies evolve from relative obscurity to a point where governments and financial institutions are taking it seriously and making huge investments in blockchain technologies for their own use. Through 2017, we’ll see that evolution continue as serious blockchain platforms begin to emerge and people begin using cryptocurrencies, not just for capital flight and a hedge against hyperinflation, but for real day to day trading—and we’re not just talking pizza here.', 'The late-night robbery of a Montreal grocery store last night resulted in the apparent theft of an on-site bitcoin ATM.\n\nAccording to information provided to CoinDesk, the Euromarché grocery store on Rue Lachapelle in Montréal was targeted around 10:30pm EST.

He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', 'Bitcoin’s mining difficulty increased by 16.6 percent over the weekend, signaling that the network’s overall hash rate has also increased by a similar amount over the past two weeks. The network’s total estimated hash rate has essentially doubled since the middle of October. A large chunk of this increase has taken place over the past month, where the hash rate has increased by more than 50 percent.\n\n\n\nThe network hash rate is the total amount of computing power pointed at the Bitcoin network.\n\nPools That Saw Their Share of Total Hashing Power Increase\n\nIt’s difficult to know where exactly this new hashing power is being deployed, but it is possible to see the differences in mining pools’ shares of the overall hash rate.\n\nWhen comparing the most recently completed difficulty period with a run of 2016 blocks from the middle of October, GBMiners is the pool that saw the largest amount of growth. GBMiners enjoyed an increase of 62 blocks compared to the total set of 2016 blocks from October. Recently, it was found that GBMiners is connected to a Ponzi scheme disguised as a bitcoin cloud mining operation in India.\n\nSince October, BTC.TOP has grown from nothing to roughly 3 percent of the network hash rate. Batpool also emerged during this period of time to grab a little over 1 percent of the network. Not much is known about either of these China-based pools, other than the fact that ltc1btc.com Founder and CEO Jiang Zhuo’er is behind BTC.TOP and does not much care for Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness improvement.\n\nBoth GBMiners and BTC.TOP signal support for Bitcoin Unlimited as opposed to Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Unlimited is software that intends to replace Bitcoin’s 1 MB block size limit with the concept of emergent consensus. At this time, it is unclear if this new digital currency network would be a new version of Bitcoin or an altcoin.\n\nIn terms of pools signaling for Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness improvement, Bitfury saw the largest amount of growth. The mining pool saw an increase of just under 3 percent between the middle of October and the most recently completed difficulty period.\n\nPools That Saw Their Share of Total Hashing Power Decrease\n\nIf the above mining pools are mining more blocks, then that means someone else must be mining fewer blocks.\n\nNo miner saw a bigger drop in their share of the network since October than BTCC. BTCC now mines about 35 percent less blocks than they did in October.\n\nNo other pool came close to BTCC in terms of a loss in their share of the network hash rate, but ViaBTC and Slush Pool also saw notable declines. These two pools are mining about 25 percent less than the number of blocks they were mining in October.\n\nThe two largest mining pools on the network, Antpool and F2Pool, mined roughly 5 percent fewer blocks when their numbers were combined.\n\nAlthough never the largest pools on the network, Bitcoin.com, GoGreenLight and Kano CKPool all saw sizable declines.\n\nHash Rate Continuing to Increase\n\nAlthough the last difficulty period saw a rather massive increase of 16.6 percent, it appears that hash rate is continuing to be added to the network. At 118 blocks into the current difficulty period, there has already been another estimated 15.25 percent increase in the network hash rate.\n\nJudging from the rapidly increasing hash rate, it appears multiple mining pools are receiving shipments of new hardware. While some predicted Bitcoin could crash and burn as a result of the halving event over the summer, the mining pools were correct in predicting a more positive outcome.\n\nAs Bitcoin’s total hash rate increases, it becomes more difficult for a motivated adversary to pull off an effective attack on the network.', '\n\nIndia has made efforts to move toward an economy less dependent on cash. (Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSilicon Valley fancies itself the global leader in innovation. Its leaders hype technologies such as bitcoin and blockchain, which some claim are the greatest inventions since the Internet. They are so complex that only a few mathematicians can understand them, and they require massive computing resources to operate — yet billions of dollars are invested in them.\n\nIndia may have leapfrogged the U.S. technology industry with simple and practical innovations and massive grunt work. It has built a digital infrastructure that will soon process billions more transactions than bitcoin ever has. With this, India will skip two generations of financial technologies and build something as monumental as China’s Great Wall and America’s interstate highways.\n\nA decade ago, India had a massive problem: nearly half its people did not have any form of identification. When you are born in a village without hospitals or government services, you don’t get a birth certificate. If you can’t prove who you are, you can’t open a bank account or get a loan or insurance; you are doomed to be part of the informal economy — whose members live in the shadows and don’t pay taxes.\n\nIn 2009, the government launched a massive project, called Aadhar, to solve this problem by providing a digital identity to everyone based on an individual’s fingerprints and retina scans. As of 2016, the program had issued 12-digit identification numbers to 1.1 billion people. This was the largest and most successful I.T. project in the world and created the foundation for a digital economy.\n\nIndia’s next challenge was to provide everyone with a bank account. Its government sanctioned the opening of 11 institutions called payment banks, which can hold money but don’t do lending. To motivate people to open accounts, it offered free life insurance with them and made them a channel for social-welfare benefits. Within three years, more than 270 million bank accounts were opened, with $10 billion in deposits.\n\nAnd then India launched its Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a way for banks to transfer money directly to one another based on a single identifier, such as the Aadhar number.\n\nTake the way that credit-card payments are processed: When you present your card to a store, the cashier verifies your signature and transmits your credit-card information to a billing processor such as Visa, American Express or MasterCard — which works with the sending and receiving banks. The billing processors act as a custodian and clearing house. In return for this service, they charge the merchants a fee of 2 to 3 percent of the transaction. This is a tax that is indirectly passed on to the customer.\n\nWith a system such as UPI, the billing processor is eliminated, and transaction costs are close to zero. The mobile phone and a personal identification number take the place of the credit card as the authentication factor. All you do is to download a free app and enter your identification number and bank PIN, and you can instantly transfer money to anyone — regardless of which bank he or she uses.\n\nThere is no technology barrier to prevent a UPI from working in the United States. Transfers would happen within seconds, even faster than the 10 minutes that a bitcoin transaction takes.\n\nIndia has just introduced another innovation called India Stack. This is a series of secured and connected systems that allow people to store and share personal data such as addresses, bank statements, medical records, employment records and tax filings, and it enables the digital signing of documents. The user controls what information is shared and with whom, and electronic signature occurs through biometric authentication.\n\nTake the example of opening a mobile-phone account. It is cumbersome everywhere, because the telecom carriers need to verify the user’s identity and credit history. In India, it often took days to produce all the documents that the government required. With the new “know-your-customer” procedures that are part of India Stack, all that is needed is a thumb print or retina scan, and an account can be opened within minutes. The same can be done for medical records. Imagine being able to share these with doctors and clinics as and when necessary. This is surely possible for us in the United States, but we aren’t doing it because no trusted central authority has stepped up to the task.\n\nIndia Stack will also transform how lending is done. The typical villager currently has no chance of getting a small-business loan, because he or she lacks a credit history and verifiable credentials. Now people can share information from their digital lockers, such as bank statements, utility bill payments and life insurance policies, and loans can be approved almost instantaneously on the basis of verified data. This is a more open system than the credit0scoring services that U.S. businesses use.\n\nIn November, in a move to curb corruption and eliminate counterfeit bills, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shocked the country by announcing the discontinuation of all 500- and 1,000-rupee (about $7 and $14) notes — which account for roughly 86 percent of all money in circulation. The move disrupted the entire economy, caused pain and suffering, and was widely criticized. Yet it was a bold move that will surely produce long-term benefit, because it will accelerate the push to digital currency and the modernization of the Indian economy.\n\nNobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, that the United States should follow Modi’s lead in phasing out currency and moving toward a digital economy, because it would have “benefits that outweigh the cost.” Speaking of the inequity and corruption that is becoming an issue in the United States and all over the world, he said: “I believe very strongly that countries like the United States could and should move to a digital currency so that you would have the ability to trace this kind of corruption. There are important issues of privacy, cybersecurity, but it would certainly have big advantages.”\n\nWe are not ready to become a cashless society, but there are many lessons that Silicon Valley and the United States can learn from the developing world.\n\nRead more from The Washington Post’s Innovations section.', ""Empty blocks have turned into a controversial topic in the Bitcoin community over the past few months. This renewed attention on the topic has been sparked by the number of nearly-empty blocks mined by Antpool recently.\n\n\n\nAn empty block is one that only contains a coinbase transaction. This may seem counterproductive, but there are incentives in place that make mining empty blocks a practical endeavor from the perspective of a miner.\n\nWhy Do Miners Mine Empty Blocks?\n\nAccording to Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo, there are three main reasons as to why empty blocks have been mined in the past.\n\nThe first issue had to do with a mining pool letting the network know that a new block had been found. This was especially problematic when a miner in China was trying to let nodes on the other side of the Great Firewall know about a newly mined block. Other nodes would essentially be notified of a new block’s existence but would still need to download the entire block over a slow connection.\n\nBlock relay time between peers was also a problem in the past, but Corallo’s FIBRE network has mostly negated this issue. FIBRE is a protocol used to relay blocks around a network of nodes with essentially no delay.\n\nLastly, it takes time for a miner to figure out which transactions are in a block and validate them. The process of validating the previous block’s transactions and removing them from the mempool is the main culprit behind the majority of the empty blocks that are still being mined on the network.\n\nThe Decline of Empty Blocks\n\nIn 2015 and early 2016, empty blocks were quite common on the network. According to data from Bitfury, a total of 264 empty blocks were mined in November 2015. At an average of 1,994 transactions per block (the average transaction count in completely full blocks up to this point), that’s the equivalent of over 525,000 transactions worth of unused block space. That is many more transactions than the entire network has processed on any single day of its existence.\n\nDecember 2016, the most recent month for which data is available, only 34 empty blocks were mined. So what happened?\n\nFor one, the issue of empty blocks was brought up at the inaugural Bitcoin Roundtable meeting between the Bitcoin mining community and a few Bitcoin Core contributors.\n\n“Everyone was saying more capacity was needed, so that was something we could address in the very short term.” BTCC COO Samson Mow told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nAccording to Mow, BTCC’s mining pool was able to reduce the number of empty blocks they produced through various architecture improvements involving bandwidth reduction and data broadcast improvements.\n\nAntpool has also made improvements to its own systems.\n\n“We developed a new block broadcast system,” an Antpool representative told Bitcoin Magazine. “Blocks can be broadcast to the world in one to three seconds through this system, the recent system is the final testing, and now there will be some empty or small blocks, but after we finished the test, the probability of [an] empty block appears to be minimum, and we will open source system.”\n\nIn the view of BTC.com’s Kevin Pan, the decline of empty blocks has occurred in large part because of compact blocks, which is an improvement that was implemented in Bitcoin Core 0.13 and FIBRE.\n\nViaBTC’s own improvements allowed it to become the largest mining pool that does SPV mining to not mine an empty block over the course of last month.\n\nBitFury, on the other hand, has never mined an empty block.\n\n“Bitfury started to use special techniques to avoid empty blocks because it is against the community,” Bitfury CIO Alex Petrov told Bitcoin Magazine. “We support more transaction processing, and the easiest way to do that is just avoiding empty blocks mining.”\n\nPetrov says he has offered to help other mining pools avoid empty blocks since 2014, but many pools only became interested in avoiding empty blocks in late 2015 as Bitcoin had to deal with full blocks for the first time.\n\nBesides being the driving force behind FIBRE, Corallo implemented compact blocks in Bitcoin Core. In his view, a variety of different factors have led to the decline in empty blocks mined on the Bitcoin network. “It's a question of which things have improved block propagation where, and I think there are a lot of things,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “FIBRE has made a difference, certainly, but also individual pools optimizing their own stacks makes a big difference.”\n\nEmpty Blocks Will Continue to Decline\n\nOf course, there are still more relay improvements on the way, so there is no reason to think the number of empty blocks mined on a monthly basis won’t continue to decline in 2017.\n\n“We're making massive strides in relay in Bitcoin Core in 0.13 [and] 0.14, and were miners to upgrade to some of the last-minute improvements going into 0.14 and use FIBRE, we'd see [empty blocks] once a month purely because the time between when one pool finds a block and when the rest have validated it is so short,” said Corallo.\n\nCorallo is currently working with others on a system similar to weak blocks that is point-to-point rather than across the whole network.\n\nFor some pools, it takes less than 500 milliseconds to validate a newly mined block. To this point, Corallo stated, “I'm working on decreasing that 500 milliseconds for everyone so even those who do mine empty blocks only do them for shorter periods of time.”\n\nOne final point worth mentioning is that the incentive to mine empty blocks declines as transaction fees take over the block reward as the main source of revenue for miners. A miner will only want to mine a block with transactions in it if the fees associated with those transactions are the source of revenue."", 'In August, a group of hackers called, ""51 Crew"" attacked blockchain clones Shift and Krypton. The group took control of more than 51% of the network. Then there was the online theft of $65 million of the digital currency bitcoin from Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinx. Perhaps the most critical hacking incident was in May 2016, when the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), was attacked by a hacker exploiting a vulnerability in its smart contract code, dealing a blow of around $60 million. It led to a forking of the Ethereum blockchain into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. This was followed by a DNS attack on blockchain.info, which led to compromised passwords for bitcoin users.\n\nSoftware is written by humans, and is always subject to human error.\n\nAll these incidents have raised doubts about the safety of blockchain, a technology known for its impenetrable information storage and sharing features.\n\nLet us examine where the ""secure"" claim of blockchain technology comes from. In the diagram below, each block is stored with a link to the Secure Hash Encryption (SHA) of the previous block. Countless blocks, each with thousands of transactions, are thus linked to form a blockchain.\n\nIf any of these blocks change, the corresponding hash would change, and the change would be traced. Basis this, such a block would be rejected by the network.\n\nSo, what makes such a network vulnerable to hacks? Broadly, there are three ways to all the blockchain hacking implementations. Below is a discussion in these, along with the corresponding mitigation strategies:\n\nStealing private key\n\nThis is the most direct way to hack into a blockchain network. Every user has a private key with which they sign transactions, and everyone on the network verifies the transaction using their public key, to assess if the original user signed it. If a private key is stolen, all the digital currency associated with it can be compromised. The thief can sign a transaction to simply transfer all the bitcoins to his address.\n\nTo mitigate this, there are a lot of bitcoin wallets such as Blockchain.info. These wallets have security features to protect a user\'s private key and can be accessed from multiple devices, including cloud-based one. These also provide a range of services including distributing public keys, signing transactions, and broadcasting your transactions to peer-to-peer networks.\n\nAcquiring/hacking into computing power in proof of work\n\nIn typical ""proof of work"" networks like bitcoin, a lot of computing power is spent to prove that a transaction is genuine. If more than 50% of the bitcoin network participants agree to a block, it is deemed as accepted. In this situation, anyone who can hack into machines and divert the computing power to his own account can control large pieces of the network. This would allow the hacker to create a chain longer than the authentic chain, essentially allowing a dual transaction.\n\nTo mitigate this, many platforms are moving towards ""proof of stake"" consensus. That ensures that instead of computing power, the ability to ratify a transaction is dependent on the stake the participants have in the network. Clearly, people who are invested in a currency will not want its value crashing by ratifying rogue transactions.\n\nFor permissioned blockchains, since addition of nodes is a controlled activity, it would be difficult for a hacker to take over the network. Most enterprise applications are likely to use permissioned blockchains with some level of oversight from a governing body or participants themselves.\n\nSoftware vulnerability\n\nAs the DAO example showed us, software is written by humans, and is always subject to human error. While most of the blockchain implementations done for bitcoin have been tested over the years and numerous vulnerabilities have been addressed, we cannot guarantee that there will be no more. Further, most enterprises like the Ethereum platform, use it as a base and further customise it. They also give flexibility to developers to write their own smart contracts, thus opening more avenues for possible bugs.\n\nDespite following all the precautions, a network can still be hacked.\n\nTo mitigate this, the software development and testing process needs to be a lot more robust. While a lot of attention is paid to functional testing, white-box security testing needs more emphasis.\n\nWe expect that many early platforms will provide limited functionality (such as asset issuance), limiting the scope for such attacks due to programmer errors.\n\nIntegration risks\n\nOne area in blockchain systems that has not attracted much attention so far is external system integration. These complex systems are built on blockchains requiring integration with external systems; these integration points are a weak link that hackers can target. Many current solutions rely on ""oracles"", where an oracle is a particular agent trusted by blockchain participants. Such reliance on an external agent poses many questions around system reliability and security.\n\nWe see development towards ""smart oracles"" that use a federation of external systems that would help reduce some of these risks.\n\nHandling hacks\n\nBelow is a summary of the possible threats and mitigation strategies\n\nDespite following all the precautions, a network can still be hacked. The DAO hack shows one way hacks can be handled—by doing a hard fork of network and having participants ratify that fork instead of the longest chain prevailing. This puts into question the principle that ""blockchains are immutable"", and businesses need to have clear plans for handling situations where their network is compromised.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, the blockchain technology is based on strong, simple and effective security principles. A key component of technology maturity cycle is discovery of software defects, attempts to hack, leading to further robustness in the technology and maturity of best practices. As blockchain evolves, law enforcement will need to have better skills and guidelines to investigate and prosecute security breaches. This should not deter firms and developers to adopt the technology and realise its benefits. A key element of the adoption of any new technology is also the evolution of best practices around security management. We expect such best practices around private key management, data sharing, etc. will evolve over the next few years.']"
01/24/2017,"[""Bitcoin prices have remained largely unchanged so far today, fluctuating around the $900 mark despite the adoption of trading fees by three of the ecosystem's largest exchanges.\n\nAs previously announced, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin implemented 0.2% trading fees for both buy and sell trades today, a policy change that, coupled with their recent decision to end margin trading at the request of China's central bank, seems to be making for a different market.\n\nMarket data suggests that all three bitcoin exchanges have seen a drop in volume after instituting the new pricing policy. The fees, they say, were put in place in a bid to stop market manipulation and lessen the effects of price volatility. The exchanges announced the move over the weekend.\n\nInitiated today, the trading fees do seem to be having an impact on trading volumes, if not prices.\n\nAccording to data from Bitcoinity, for example, there were roughly 4,800 trades on OKCoin between the hours of 11pm and midnight EST. In the following hour, the exchange registered just over 1,000 trades, denominated in CNY – a fall of more than 80%.\n\nData pulled from Bitcoinity for BTCChina also demonstrates the apparent effect the new trading fees have had on volume.\n\nAfter registering more than 37,000 trades between the hours of 7 and 8pm EST, that amount had fallen to less than 1,000 between the hours of midnight and 1am EST.\n\nBitcoinity data wasn’t available for Huobi past 22nd January. However, according to CryptoWatch, another exchange data provider, declines in Huobi’s volume can also be seen.\n\nDaily trade volume has fluctuated between 120k and 150k bitcoins for the past few days, yet as of press time, Huobi has reported less than 38,000 BTC in trading volume since the start of the session.\n\nEven so, the price of bitcoin seems to have taken the fee additions in stride.\n\nAccording to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the current average price is $905.35, down just 0.8% from the day’s open. CNY-denominated markets, by contrast, are up more than 6% today, trading at an average of ¥6,272, BPI data shows.\n\nNo surprises\n\nGiven that the fee change had been anticipated, traders, even those based in China, struck a mostly optimistic tone on the news.\n\nKong Gao, marketing manager at OTC trading firm Richfund, for example, called the new volume figures “more organic”. He framed the development as good for the bitcoin market in the long term, even if the market has to adapt to new constraints.\n\nLikewise, trader Zhao Dong said that the new numbers were a reflection of the decline in high-frequency traders, which would impact speculators, a group he called the digital currency’s largest market.\n\n“The real volume (people who need to use bitcoin) is 10,000 to 20,000,” he said. “Short term speculation is 10 times that.”\n\nGiven this, he predicted that China’s exchanges would soon be compelled to make further changes.\n\nZhao added:\n\n“Believe me, they will lower down the rate before long.”\n\nStan Higgins co-authored this report.\n\nImages via Bitcoinity, Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""Bitcoin is a high-growing, volatile asset class. In some ways, it’s a very ripe opportunity for day trading to make money.""\n\nSwings of 5% or more in a single day for bitcoin are not unusual, representing an opportunity for speculators to make a quick buck on the currency — or of course stomach a sizeable loss.\n\nA love of investing — or often, simply speculating on stocks — was highlighted by China\'s ""Black Monday"" stock market crash in the summer of 2015. Markets fell as much as 10% in a single day after being pushed higher in the months before by huge amounts of retail investors ploughing money into stocks.\n\nLee, who was raised in the US and worked for Yahoo for many years, said: ""As with probably many countries, there’s a lot of greed and a lot of acceptance of new technologies. Bitcoin is uniquely poised to be well accepted in society.""\n\nHowever, this speculation has led to recent volatility and concerns that a bitcoin price bubble could be emerging. The People\'s Bank of China (PBoC) has recently taken action to curb this and Lee believes regulation of the market is inevitable.\n\nThe second reason for bitcoin\'s popularity, Lee believes, is ""bitcoin mining is very popular in China, relatively speaking to other countries.""\n\nMining is the process by which bitcoin is created. Computers solve complex cryptographic problems that are generated by the buying and selling of the digital currency itself, which allows the decentralized network to function. In return for this work, the computers — or rather their owners — are rewarded with newly created bitcoins.\n\nTo control the pace of the process, the amount of cryptographic work required to earn a bitcoin gets harder and harder every time, requiring hugely powerful computers (take a look inside an Icelandic bitcoin mine to get an idea of what we\'re talking about.)\n\nThe BBC estimated last year that as much of 70% of bitcoin mining is now done in China. Lee says: ""Because of that, a healthy ecosystem grows on top of each other: the miners, the people who trade, buy, sell.""\n\nHowever, one thing that has notably not contributed to bitcoin\'s popularity in China is its use as actual currency. Lee, speaking to BI during London Blockchain Week, says: ""Bitcoin, unfortunately, has not taken off in China as a form of payment. I know in European countries, people use bitcoin to buy coffee, buy things. In China that hasn’t happened yet.\n\n""I think the reason is a little bit cultural. Firstly, the Chinese government insists that the renminbi is the only circulating currency in China. There’s a sort of stigma to try to use bitcoin for payment.\n\n""The second reason is China actually has very competitive online payment forms — Alipay and WeChat Pay. These are the two dominant payment systems. For these reasons, bitcoin has not made any dents. Plus, the PBoC is watching closely.""\n\nThis poses a slight problem for Lee. BTCC\'s view is that ""bitcoin’s killer use case is as money,"" he says. The company, which also develops blockchain and bitcoin mining technology alongside its popular exchange, recently launched Mobi, a mobile wallet that uses bitcoin as a backbone for a ""global wallet.""\n\n""Essentially this wallet has all currencies on it, you can choose from over 50 global currencies,"" Lee says. ""You can sign up with just a mobile phone number. It allows you to send money to anyone in the world, just with mobile phone number. You don’t need to know their bitcoin wallet number or bank account number.""\n\nLaunched at the start of January, Mobi has been downloaded 20,000 times across 90 countries, Lee says.\n\n""BTCC has always been global in outlook but it started out in China with the exchange,"" he says. ""Our mission is to bring these digital currency services to the world.""', 'A new Bitcoin ETF provider has entered the competition alongside Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and SolidX.\n\nGrayscale Investments, the child company of Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, filed an S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list its Bitcoin Investment Trust on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSince 2013, Grayscale Investment’s Bitcoin Investment Trust has been providing a unique method for investors and traders to purchase Bitcoin in a more regulated ecosystem by selling the shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust, hereinafter GBTC, on a public stock market. Each share represents one-tenth of Bitcoin price.\n\nGBTC always shows a significantly large premium in comparison to the trading price of Bitcoin on global Bitcoin exchanges such as Kraken or Bitfinex. Currently, one share of GBTC is being traded at $117, effectively selling one Bitcoin for $1170, at a premium of $255 or nearly 22 percent.\n\nHigh profile investors and traders are willing to purchase Bitcoin even with such a premium because with GBTC, they don’t have to be concerned about the security of a Bitcoin wallet service provider or the status of their Bitcoin. Investors can simply rely on GBTC to manage and handle their Bitcoins.\n\nFor some, it is not permitted to purchase assets like Bitcoin without going through a heavily regulated channel like the stock market. For these traders, regulated channels are the only practical way to obtain the digital currency.\n\nGBTC Files With SEC to Offer Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe goal of Grayscale Investments is to treat GBTC like a traditional Bitcoin ETF instead of a publicly traded stock market asset. For the company to transform GBTC to an ETF it has to undergo the same approval process the Winklevoss Twins and SolidX have gone through, which is a multi-year procedure involving hefty capital and resources.\n\nTo optimize or fasten the approval process Grayscale Investments is set to bring in two Wall Street firms KCG Holdings and Wedbush Securities, to oversee the proposal and serve as authorized participants. The S-1 filing also stated that Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the transfer agent.\n\nThe S-1 filing read:\n\n“The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the value of a Bitcoin as represented by the Index, less the Trust’s liabilities and expenses. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in Bitcoin. Grayscale Investments LLC is the sponsor of the Trust, Delaware Trust Company is the trustee of the Trust, The Bank of New York Mellon is the transfer agent of the Trust and the administrator of the Trust and Xapo Inc. is the custodian of the Trust.”', 'You may have heard the term ‘blockchain’ and dismissed it as a fad, a buzzword, or even technical jargon. But I believe blockchain is a technological advance that will have wide-reaching implications that will not just transform the financial services but many other businesses and industries.\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database, meaning that the storage devices for the database are not all connected to a common processor. It maintains a growing list of ordered records, called blocks. Each block has a timestamp and a link to a previous block.\n\nCryptography ensures that users can only edit the parts of the blockchain that they “own” by possessing the private keys necessary to write to the file. It also ensures that everyone’s copy of the distributed blockchain is kept in synch.\n\nImagine a digital medical record: each entry is a block. It has a timestamp, the date and time when the record was created. And by design, that entry cannot be changed retroactively, because we want the record of diagnosis, treatment, etc. to be clear and unmodified. Only the doctor, who has one private key, and the patient, who has the other, can access the information, and then information is only shared when one of those users shares his or her private key with a third party — say, a hospital or specialist. This describes a blockchain for that medical database.\n\nBlockchains are secure databases by design. The concept was introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, and then implemented for the first time in 2009 as part of the digital bitcoin currency; the blockchain serves as the public ledger for all bitcoin transactions. By using a blockchain system, bitcoin was the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem (unlike physical coins or tokens, electronic files can be duplicated and spent twice) without the use of an authoritative body or central server.\n\nThe security is built into a blockchain system through the distributed timestamping server and peer-to-peer network, and the result is a database that is managed autonomously in a decentralized way. This makes blockchains excellent for recording events — like medical records — transactions, identity management, and proving provenance. It is, essentially, offering the potential of mass disintermediation of trade and transaction processing.\n\nHow does blockchain really work?', 'These are the show notes for the Unchained podcast, sponsored by OnRamp. Listen to my whole interview with Daniel and Jeff here or on Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio.\n\nSince its beginnings eight years ago, bitcoin was seen as a way to spend digital money while enjoying many of the features of cash, including, to some extent, privacy.\n\nA new attempt by the Internal Revenue Service to collect data on a large group of bitcoin users — customers of Coinbase, the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in the United States — threatens that privacy, but the players involved aren’t giving up without a fight.\n\nIn November, the IRS, with approval from a federal court, served a subpoena to Coinbase, requesting information on its users from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. The purported reason? To catch individuals using cryptocurrency to evade taxes.\n\nThis so-called John Doe summons, which doesn’t target an individual, but a group or class of people, would affect millions of Coinbase customers.\n\nThe company initially responded, “In its current form, we will oppose the government’s petition in court,” and chief executive officer Brian Armstrong has since published a Medium post calling the subpoena “overly broad” and saying it “unfairly punishes Coinbase,"" which, as I described in my magazine feature on the company, has a track record of prioritizing compliance and working with regulators and law enforcement. Armstrong then proposed an alternate solution: that the company file 1099-B reports, which brokerage firms use to report customers’ gains and losses.\n\nJeff Berns, managing partner at Berns Weiss LLP and cofounder of its virtual currency practice group, and Global Tax Accountants’ Daniel Winters, an accountant specializing in cryptocurrency, have a lively discussion about the case — and make bets in how they think it will turn out — in the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio).\n\n“This is unprecedented. I’ve never seen a fishing expedition come like this from the IRS,” says Berns, who is also gotten personally involved in the case. In order to represent the interests of Coinbase’s users, he filed a motion to intervene asking the court to stop the procedure.\n\nHe says the subpoena’s strategy is to “ask for everything and eventually, they’ll find something” — to get records on a couple million people in order to find a few customers and companies who did use bitcoin to evade taxes.\n\nComparing the amount of information requested in the case to that required for a criminal proceeding, he says, “They want every scrap of email. Every scrap of transaction history. They want to know the devices that accessed your account and how. They want the password that access your account and, as I read it, access to the virtual currency. I don’t know how many people understand that. Once you have private keys, it’s the password that controls your virtual currency, [the money] can be sent out anywhere and never recovered again.”\n\nTune in to the episode to find out why Berns called the IRS’s response to his motion to intervene “fantastical” and why he says it shows that the agency has requested more information than it needs.\n\nWinters believes that the John Doe summons indicates that the IRS has “a fundamental misunderstanding of bitcoin and blockchain technology.” Noting that bitcoin is a legitimate way to transfer value and do business — Coinbase alone processes payments for more than 45,000 merchants — Winters says, “With this really broad John Doe summons to Coinbase, it seems their only focus is that bitcoin can be used for tax evasion and money laundering.”\n\nHowever, Winters and Berns say that there have been previous John Doe summons that were justified. For instance, in a John Doe summons served to UBS, the IRS had obtained a statement from a former UBS banker that the bank assisted U.S. clients in hiding assets offshore. UBS eventually turned over information on its U.S. account holders.\n\nHowever, the John Doe summons on Coinbase is built on shakier ground, says Winters. The IRS only has evidence of three entities having broken the law — only one of which is an individual — and the Coinbase connection is simply that the two businesses had Coinbase accounts.\n\n“It’s a huge difference of degree,” says Winters. The John Doe summons on UBS had “evidence of criminal activity on a broad scale,” he says, referring to the statement by the former UBS employee. In contrast, the summons to Coinbase is more “we know that three users broke the law, and therefore we’re now going to treat the other 99.99% of users as criminals,” he says.\n\nTune in to this energetic discussion (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio, web) to find out what Winters and Berns say would be a more appropriate kind of request from the IRS, why the IRS chose Coinbase out of all the cryptocurrency exchanges, and what fundamental mistake Berns says the IRS made long before even issuing this summons.\n\nPlus, as it’s tax time, in this episode, Winters describes how users can best track their bitcoin transactions for tax reporting purposes.\n\nThese are the show notes for the Unchained podcast, sponsored by OnRamp.

Focus within the industry has always shifted between Bitcoin and Blockchain in a repetitive cycle.\n\nWe are in the midst of a Bitcoin price rally that also has an impact on many altcoins and sparks a new level of awareness and intrigue within the general public. The media plays its role in this cycle and eventually, governments and the businesses take notice and get involved at a deeper level.\n\nThe recent increase in awareness has spread to new territories and countries like Nigeria which has hitherto appeared unconcerned about happenings within the crypto industry and has begun to show visible interest.\n\nGovernment has been cornered\n\nAyodeji Odusote, the data architect at the Central Bank of Nigeria, thinks that the sudden awakening in Nigeria reveals an irrefutable support drawn from a mixture of fear, anxiety, politics and hope.\n\nAccording to Odusote, nothing has really challenged the powers and authorities of financial regulators like this before. At one turn or the other, they have always found ways out of financial competitions in the past. Either by policy or by fiat, financial regulators have always found a way out.\n\nThis time around, unfortunately, they are in a cul de sac and naturally they must be afraid of losing all they had guarded - their authority and power.\n\nHowever, Odusote notes that the political appeal to protect the interest of the government is not out of place, as this is obtainable with all financial regulators around the world.\n\nOdusote says:\n\n“There is nothing peculiar about the actions and/or reactions of the CBN. We have seen similar things play out across the globe. Just as other financial regulators explore to see the benefits they can derive in times like this, it is also not out of place that the CBN would do the same. It is timely and appropriate as well. You don't want to be left behind and alone should the world decide to go full-fledged cryptocurrency.”\n\nPendulum\n\nJason Cassidy, president of Crypto Consultant, tells Cointelegraph that governments and financial institutions focusing on the currency aspect of this new, emerging asset class are to be expected right now.\n\n\n\nHe says that when Bitcoin's price is lower, so tends to be the interest level from an investment perspective. Analytics like Google tend to bear this out, as is the same story with altcoins, to a lesser extent.\n\n\n\nHowever, Cassidy points out that once the price action dissipates and Bitcoin goes into a period of stability or a downturn, public interest tapers off. Governments and businesses do not stop paying attention, however, the narrative switches back to the underlying technology - Blockchain.\n\nCassidy concludes by saying:"", 'In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms and conditions:\n\nThe following terminology applies to these Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: ""Client"", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Company’s terms and conditions.

First, Bitcoin requires the use of a separate wallet or managing service in order to act as a mediator of sorts for purchases made; and second, many of the most popular online retailers do not accept Bitcoin payments. Amazon.com (AMZN), the online commerce titan, has long been one of the sites that has yet to incorporate Bitcoin functionality into its payment systems. Now, though, a new version of the famous Purse.io app, which acts to facilitate Bitcoin transactions of many kinds, will help a customer base in the billions be able to utilize Bitcoin for Amazon.com purchases for the first time ever.\n\nHow it Works\n\nPurse.io acts as a mediator in Bitcoin transactions. The app works to connect customers holding Bitcoin with gift card holders, and in so doing allows Bitcoin users without a bank account, credit card, or other items typically required to be able to shop online to do so. When a customer browsing on the Purse app makes a purchase, Purse acts as an escrow until the transaction has been completed, saving both the buyers and sellers from weighty transaction or conversion fees. This has often been done in the past on Purse's own marketplace, which allows for direct interactions between merchants and customers.\n\nPurse also facilitates similar transactions on Amazon by matching up buyers with prior gift card holders. The shopper selects the products he or she wants from Amazon, saving them to a Purse wishlist and viewing a series of discounts. Gift card holders view the orders and use their cards to purchase them. Because many gift cards are unredeemable for many items, gift card holders are often looking for ways to unload their gift cards for other forms of currency. In this case, the gift card holder will receive the customer's Bitcoin, and the buyer will receive the item.\n\nBenefits of Purse\n\nBeyond the opportunity to rid oneself of gift cards that are otherwise unusable, Purse offers a number of potential benefits. There is the limitation on transaction and conversion fees, but there is also the incentive to incorporate Purse discounts into the transaction process, saving buyers money off of the listed Amazon price for many items.\n\nWhile Amazon does not yet incorporate Bitcoin into its regular platform, Purse will no doubt offer Bitcoin users some optimism as to the digital currency's usefulness in the broader public market. Many other retailers have experimented with Bitcoin successfully, including Overstock.com, OpenBazaar, and more. Amazon has resisted Bitcoin because of volatility and difficulties with refunding Bitcoin purchases."", 'Trust Bloomberg BNA\'s Premier International Tax offering for the news and guidance to navigate the complex tax treaty networks and business regulations.\n\nBy Jenny David\n\nTransactions conducted in bitcoin, litecoin and other virtual currencies would be subject to Israeli capital gains, income and sales tax under the terms of a recent draft decision of the Israel Tax Authority.\n\nThe document represents Israel’s first legal recognition of virtual currency use. If finalized in its current form, however, practitioners say the policy could spell a “death blow” for bitcoin trading. The draft “imposes almost insurmountable restrictions on the use of virtual currencies in Israel, due to the liabilities and costs involved, "" Harel Perlmutter, head of tax at Tel Aviv-Based Barnea & Co. Law, told Bloomberg BNA in a Jan. 22 telephone interview.\n\nThe ITA decision must still undergo a public hearing and legislative process before taking effect. But, three years in the making, few changes to the draft are expected, a Tax Authority official told Bloomberg BNA Jan. 23.\n\nAsset, Not Currency\n\nThe ITA said it would classify virtual currency as an “asset” under Israel’s Tax Ordinance, whether used for barter or investment, rather than as a “currency” or “foreign currency.”\n\nRevenue from its sale would thus be considered capital income for individuals and companies alike, subject to Israel’s 25 percent capital gains tax. Although not recognized by the Bank of Israel, had the ITA recognized bitcoin as a currency, individuals would not have been taxed on the exchange-rate differentials inherent in its trade.\n\nStandard linkage and earnings will be tax exempt for individuals, the circular said.\n\nBusiness Income\n\nWhen the transaction is of a “business nature,” the difference in the virtual currency exchange rate will also be subject to tax as business income, the ITA held.\n\n“Should a person’s income from virtual currencies reach a commercial level, as established in case law,” that income will be considered “productive” for purposes of income tax, it also stated.\n\n“To clarify, all income of an entity selling and marketing virtual currencies will be considered productive” for tax purposes, it continued.\n\nMoreover, even though not considered a currency, transactions in virtual currencies are still goods, according to the circular, and as such will be subject to value added tax insofar as they are commercial in nature, or conducted through a virtual currency trading business.\n\nThe existence of “mining” activities—in which a virtual coin is created electronically, or a computerized system for trade in virtual currencies—can indicate the existence of a virtual currency business, it added.\n\nThe document also details means of payment and applicable clauses of Israel’s tax code by type of transaction and trader, and subjects all profits from the sale of virtual currencies to the same rules as any other asset, including reporting requirements and withholding taxes.\n\nHammer To The Head\n\n“On the one hand, the authority is caressing the community” by recognizing bitcoin, said “The True Economy” blogger Eran Hildesheim.\n\n“On the other, it is hitting it with a 10-kilogram hammer because it wants to apply every possible tax to Bitcoin activity,” he said. “It could be a death blow to the community,” he added.\n\n“I understand the tax loss hurts the authority, but it could have reached a different decision. This will dissolve the profits for individual trading in Bitcoin,” Perlmutter said.\n\nHe also questioned how enforcement would be achieved. “Virtual currencies are traded through electronic wallets, which are much harder to monitor than the banks. Enforcement will be a big problem,” he said.\n\nA lack of clear definitions poses another problem, Hildesheim said. “What amounts to activity of a business nature? Is it one transaction, 10, a hundred? Every interpretation can determine the fate of a Bitcoin trader in Israel, and send them to the black market,” he said.\n\nHis advice? “Sit on the fence until this becomes clear and only then decide whether to get into the market or not.”\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jenny David in Jerusalem at correspondents@bna.com@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Penny Sukhraj at psukhraj@bna.com\n\nFor More Information The ITA circular, in Hebrew, is at https://taxes.gov.il/IncomeTax/Documents/Hozrim/hoz_X_2017_tyota.pdf.\n\nCopyright © 2017 The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. All Rights Reserved.', 'Money transfer exchange, Western Union, recently announced a $184 million settlement with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for violating the Bank Secrecy Act’s anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Specifically, FinCEN determined that Western Union failed to (1) implement and maintain effective AML compliance oversight of certain agents and sub-agents; and, (2) failed to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nThere are several takeaways from the experience of this legacy organization for money transfers that their counterparts in the Bitcoin space would be wise to note. In an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Joe Ciccolo, Founder of the U.S.-based BitAML, agreed to explore the findings and offer his thoughts on the potential implications for Bitcoin money transmitters. BitAML provides regulatory compliance solutions for digital currency startups.\n\nFor starters, Ciccolo who has an extensive background in bank regulatory compliance, said that FinCEN made the determination that Western Union failed to adequately perform due diligence on several of its agents and sub-agents, thereby preventing the monitoring of these agents and any subsequent corrective actions.\n\nDue diligence, he says, is a vital component of onboarding company agents. Routine background checks, the collection of agent information, and onsite visits are instrumental to the vetting process. In addition to the obvious AML compliance benefits, these actions, he notes, are just good business practices.\n\nSays Ciccolo: “Money transmitters should strive to build and maintain a strong class of agents to properly and ethically represent their brand. This is especially true for Bitcoin money transmitters whose relatively small size — coupled with larger, more rapid growth potential — may increase the likelihood of overlooking prudent and proper agent due diligence. AML programs, policies and procedures should ideally be designed to scale along with the money transmitter, whether legacy or Bitcoin.”\n\nCiccolo also noted that as a principal money transmitter, Western Union is responsible for understanding and appropriately accounting for the risks associated with its agents. He asserted that this should be of no surprise to anyone in the industry. In fact, FinCEN just recently reminded principal money transmitters of their responsibilities when it reiterated existing agent monitoring compliance obligations in March 2016.\n\nReturning to the settlement agreement, FinCEN went on to state that the failure to perform adequate due diligence prevented Western Union from ensuring agents were compliant with recordkeeping and reporting requirements. What’s more, FinCEN determined that Western Union failed to take sufficient corrective action when it suspected certain agents were involved in fraud and money laundering activities.\n\nSays Ciccolo: “The cumulative impact of ineffective agent monitoring policies and procedures is clear. Bitcoin money transmitters with principal-agent arrangements are advised to establish and constantly review and update, as necessary, comprehensive agent onboarding and monitoring policies and procedures.”\n\nSecondly, according to Ciccolo, FinCEN determined that Western Union failed to develop and implement policies and procedures that could detect and lead to the reporting of suspicious activity.\n\n“While Bitcoin money transmitters are familiar with their obligation to report suspicious or unusual customer activity to FinCEN via Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR), many may be unaware that this obligation extends to “insiders,” such as employees or agents.”\n\nFinCEN, says Ciccolo, found that Western Union rarely filed SARs on agents found to be complicit in business practices of concern. Further, in many cases, Western Union took over 90 days to file a SAR, well-north of the statutory requirement of 30 days. “It’s important that Bitcoin money transmitters establish policies and procedures for thoroughly completing SARs, and filing them in a timely manner.”\n\nFinCEN Deputy Director Jamal El-Hindi remarked that the settlement agreement reflects “recognition of past shortcomings and the damage that can be done when there’s a failure of a culture of compliance.”\n\nMaking it clear that AML obligations and enforcement actions are not just for the large multinational financial services providers, El-Hindi concluded by remarking that “money transmitters, large and small, play a critical role in the movement of legitimate funds around that world, and they also are of vital assistance to FinCEN and law enforcement in thwarting illicit activity.”\n\nIn a press release, Western Union was quick to note that the settlement was mainly related to activity occurring prior to 2012, and that the company has since increased compliance funding by 200 percent over the last five years.\n\n“While this is admirable and suggests a commitment to reform,” said Ciccolo, “I’m not sure the budgets of most Bitcoin money transmitters could afford such an increase, to say nothing of the monetary fine and the reputational risks of an enforcement action.”']"
01/25/2017,"[""Bitcoin prices fell below $900 during late-night trading, continuing that trend as the day progresses.\n\nThe digital currency’s price tumbled yesterday after major exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin began imposing trading fees following guidance from China's central bank. That move triggered a broad decline in volume at these exchanges.\n\nThis development, combined with the previous announcement that those exchanges would halt margin trading, seems to have placed some downward pressure on prices. Bitcoin fell to as little as $885.72 on 24th January, roughly 2.5% below their daily high of $908.39, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nAt the start of 25th January, prices averaged $885.65, additional BPI figures reveal. Bitcoin prices rose to as much as $902.73 at 02:45 UTC, before quickly dropping below $900 once again.\n\nAt press time, the price of bitcoin is at an average of $895.46, an increase of just over 1% from the day's open.\n\nCNY-denominated markets are up more than 5% today. After opening the day at ¥5,868.13, CNY-denominated markets climbed to as high as ¥6,307.26. Prices are currently averaging ¥6,237.62, BPI data shows.\n\nBitcoin prices have experienced a period of relative stability, according to the BPI, fluctuating between roughly $880 and $940 since 19th January. This market state sharply contrasts with earlier this month, when bitcoin prices experienced sharp gyrations, rising to a three-year high and falling close to $200 within a single hour.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, scaling, or the means by which the open-source technology\'s rules could be altered to accommodate more users, was high on the agenda.\n\nThough short on conclusions (perhaps owing to issues with this approach in last year), the discussion was notable for its range of approaches to the topic.\n\nFar from just a technical problem, though, there seems to be a sense among bitcoin\'s avid supporters that the current challenges are more philosophical and social, made worse by entrenched interests who have an economic incentive for their opinions.\n\nChief among the topics up for discussion was the state of industry dialogue itself, with advocates from bitcoin\'s main technological camps – those in favor of solutions such as Segregated Witness as well as so-called \'on-chain\' scaling initiatives – agreeing perhaps only that the issue is now almost completely mired in disagreement.\n\nYet, opinions on the state of industry discussion are evolving in unexpected ways.\n\nFor example, one acknowledged area of disconnect is increasingly the question of whether or not bitcoin even has a problem. Even without scaling, the reasoning goes, the price is high and interest in the platform and its security remains strong.\n\nAs put forward by BitGo software engineer Jameson Lopp, perhaps bitcoin\'s biggest issue isn\'t really one at all.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Some people see problems around transaction fees and usage, others see problems around scalability and other people see no problems at all. Some see a robust and secure system that is in fact so secure, it can\'t even be changed, even if that is potentially for the better.""\n\nAt stake here is which version is likely to contribute to a stronger platform, and which one adheres more to its original espoused values – some of which many network participants have devoted years of their life to achieve.\n\n""You have \'decentralized and secure\', and then you have \'buy a coffee\',"" one participant said.\n\n\'Mired in politics\'?\n\nEqually notable were the attempts by discussion participants to understand the motivations on either side of the aisle.\n\nMuch thought, for instance, was put into SegWit (a proposal authored by bitcoin\'s main technological working group) and why it has yet to be adopted by the network\'s miners.\n\nIn attendance was one representative of China\'s mining community who framed the problem as one that was nearly all political, suggesting that miners were blocking the proposal purely out of a distrust of its technical working group, Bitcoin Core.\n\nOf note is that major miners, he said, have enough stake in the network to block advancements of the proposal – in almost any form.\n\nOne idea – that SegWit first be tested on the alternative blockchain platform litecoin as means to showcase its benefits – was met with similar obstacles. While some argued litecoin has perhaps a better chance of adopting the measure, many of its miners are also bitcoin miners who could just as easily impede progress there.\n\nAlso discussed was whether China\'s miners even perceived there to be any problems with the network itself, and if their continued receipt of rewards would incentivize this group not to pursue any action out of a lack of obvious need.\n\n\'Misguided dialogue\'\n\nYet, there was a minority view that bitcoin\'s inability to achieve any technical consensus on a change was perhaps a \'feature not a bug\', to use an industry analogy.\n\nJohn Carvalho, a marketing manager at bitcoin livestreaming platform Xotika.tv, for example, argued that the dialogue itself is perhaps misguided, and that bitcoin is simply proving itself at defending complex social and political attacks.\n\n""Everybody here is projecting their own commercial interests onto bitcoin saying that it\'s stagnating or failing,"" he said, adding:\n\n""All along, bitcoin is just sitting there, the fees are very affordable and they will continue to be affordable.""\n\nLopp argued that BitGo, for example, is onboarding more users, and that it is ultimately this growth that should define the conversation.\n\nHowever, Justin Newton, CEO of digital identity startup Netki, offered a different take.\n\nA veteran of the dot-com days, he argued that the view that bitcoin\'s inability to achieve any bottom-up decision-making isn\'t one that should be necessarily lauded.\n\n""Saying you don\'t have a governance model, doesn\'t mean you don\'t,"" he said. ""It may not be a transparent process that is auditable and repeatable, but the process exists.""\n\nCompromise and no compromise\n\nElsewhere, there were signs that there was an increasing appetite for a discussion that would break the months of indecision on how bitcoin could be improved.\n\nThere appeared some interest in bridging the gap between the two camps with a compromise that would find bitcoin\'s developers committing to increase the network\'s block size, a long-contentious technical attribute that mitigates transaction volume, to 2MB, a change that would accompany the approval of SegWit.\n\nStill, there was not broad agreement that consensus could be achieved.\n\nAmidst a backdrop of egos battling egos, others cautioned that even the idea that the \'scaling debate\' was a finite issue to be solved is impeding progress.\n\nAs reasoned by Kraken employee Yifu Guo, all scaling solutions are temporary fixes for battles that will continue on until the technology goes mainstream.\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Maybe scaling is a good problem to have.""\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com.', 'Following the re-adjustment of bitcoin’s network difficulty after a sudden increase, a massive transaction backlog began developing yesterday, leading to a torrent of complaints.\n\nAn incredible sum of 278,872.21 bitcoins, worth around a quarter of a billion dollars, is currently in limbo, stuck in the ether, unable to move. In response, angry users have littered public spaces to vent their frustration at the situation. One of them is a representative from Vaultoro, a bitcoin and gold exchange, who publicly stated:\n\n“[W]e paid 0.0005 fee (45 cents) to get a client their withdrawal and it took 17 hours to clear and actually only cleared because I put it into the Viabtc transaction accelerator.”\n\nAs a bitcoin only (maximalists if you will) business, we are starting to find it very hard. Clients get pissed off when we charge more for withdrawals, they get pissed off when it takes ages to deposit and the company gets the blame. If we raise fees, we get complaints and it totally cuts out the developing world because some people live on 5 bucks a day so a 50 cent fee is too much for them to bother.”\n\nAnother user could not contain himself. After stating he mistakenly entered a lower fee, the lack of any remedy made him feel the bitcoin network had told him to **** off:\n\n“Obviously this is my fault. I should have set a higher fee… But I didn’t. I made a newbie mistake. And now I’m *****ed. My money is there but I can’t touch it until some random undetermined future date when the tx drops out of the mem pool. Bitcoin just told me to go **** myself, essentially.”\n\nThe New Normal?\n\nOne highly important mechanism of bitcoin’s system design is network difficulty, a sort of calculator who measures the total network hashpower and increases or decreases the difficulty of finding a block reward of 12.5 btc based on whether the hashpower increased or decreased. Accordingly, it adjusts every two weeks.\n\nWhen hashpower does increase, as has often been the case, the bitcoin network is operating at speed and can handle more transactions as blocks are found faster than the usual average of 10 minutes. Once difficulty re-adjusts in two weeks, transaction processing returns to normal operations. With full blocks, that creates a sudden massive backlog as the temporary and somewhat artificial added transaction capacity instantly vanishes.\n\nIn the past two months, there have been three serious backlogs and many smaller ones. If one transacts during this period, although you may have paid a decent fee and perhaps even a higher than usual fee, you may still need to wait as transaction capacity is suddenly lowered.\n\nIf the sum is considerable or time sensitive, particularly as transacting in bitcoin is still a fairly new and unfamiliar experience, this denial of service can be extremely frustrating and somewhat scary with users wondering whether they will receive their bitcoin back. Usually, it leads to angry complaints that fill inboxes of bitcoin businesses as well as public discussion spaces. Price, too, tends to react by falling lower as has been the case since yesterday.\n\nIs Bitcoin at Risk of Being Replaced?\n\nThe experience might be excused once, perhaps twice, but as it repeats, the frustration and anger may turn to desperation with users eventually beginning to dread transacting in bitcoin and perhaps give up entirely, but there are two important aspects that keep bitcoin at the front. One is brand recognition, the other is investors’ loyalty.\n\nBitcoin is, by all accounts, a brilliant name and a fairly widely recognized brand. It has now further developed to mean or symbolize many things, such as digital gold, internet money, freedom, the future of currency, a response to the banking crisis, part of the internet culture, etc, etc. That may help to delay the advancement of any competitor, but a new brand can build on it, take its symbolism, and further add “better” to its name recognition. On the other hand, persuading current investors to move may be more difficult, but their loyalty might quickly change if it appears the new brand has a real chance of overtaking the currency.\n\nIt is unlikely the process would be sudden, with investors probably at first diversifying a small amount, just in case, then more, until in effect they have moved, but would bitcoin respond if it became clear the currency is at serious risk of being replaced?\n\nThe Intractable Debate\n\nWe used to often argue that no other currency would overtake bitcoin as it would simply incorporate any new feature that appears desirable. That, however, has not actually happened. Although, for example, it has been proven (PDF) that Ethereum’s confirmation times of as low as 17 seconds do work with zero problems and provide in 10 minutes (1 block confirmation on average for bitcoin) the same security as 6 block confirmations for bitcoin (which takes, on average, around one hour), there has been no serious discussion to lower confirmation times.\n\nThere are many other examples, such as Litecoin’s 4MB blocks which allow the network to operate with no problem whatever. They are currently using on average only 1 or 2KB per block, with around 1,000x more space available, yet no one seems to care to create big blocks so as to gain some sort of advantage as has been suggested would happen if bitcoin’s blocksize was increased. Ethereum operates on a dynamic blocksize, yet again no one has played the system to create bigger blocks as some have argued miners might.\n\nThis suggests that bitcoin might not currently be able to respond to the advances of a new currency in a constructive way by itself becoming more competitive, not least because the community is seemingly unable to act on solving the current transaction problem through a fairly simple upgrade, let alone reach any agreement on adding nicer things.\n\nThe Problem?\n\nOpen source development has one fundamental problem. It relies on unaccountable volunteers that go through no vetting process so randomly contributing and then gradually taking influential positions in a fairly subjective and arbitrary manner. They, so being just volunteers who are freely giving their work, have no requirements to perform at a satisfactory level nor any requirement to have the currency’s best interest at heart. That means they may have their own agendas, whether political or economical, which may or may not align with what impartially could be said would be best for the network.\n\nUsually, it’s not a great problem because the project’s founder – who naturally we should think must want the best for the network – takes a leadership role and sort of keeps everyone in check with Linus Torvalds a prominent example. Nakamoto, however, left. His chosen project leader, Gavin Andresen, who publicly raised the capacity problem we are still facing more than two years ago, had his commits arbitrarily removed without any wide public discussion last year.\n\nBusiness and miners now depend on the voluntary, non-paid, actions of developers with varied work quality and interests that just happened to contribute either purely altruistically or with the intention of steering the project for economical or intellectual reasons.\n\nThe Solution?\n\nBusinesses, early adopters and, in particular, miners, have failed to provide developers. They have further failed to create a structure where the priorities, speed and quality of work can have some sort of accountability, similar to the Linux Foundation.\n\nAndresen tried to do so through the Bitcoin Foundation, but at a time when the ecosystem was still far too immature and courted much genuine and artificial controversy. It thus failed and in doing so created a vacuum which gave Blockstream the opportunity to hire many developers, gaining great influence in the direction of bitcoin. Unfortunately, Blockstream is a for profit company which owes a primary legal duty to their own shareholders and investors, above bitcoin and the wider bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTheir interests may often align, but, at times, they might not as Blockstream’s primary business is to sell private blockchains (sidechains) to banks and other companies, with the core bitcoin protocol probably a secondary consideration and likely only of relevance as far as they retain influence and as far as they can modify it in whatever way their business requires.\n\nSpecifically, whether a limited transaction capacity directly benefits their business interest in the short term or in the long run we do not know as their presentations to investors have not been published nor has any concrete business plan been released. We are therefore left to read their actions.\n\nIn particular, Blockstream employees and companies that do business with Blockstream tend to be the most vocal in arguing for a limited transaction capacity. Moreover, suggestions by some Blockstream employees that they will quit bitcoin development if the maxblocksize is increased does indicate that a limited transaction capacity is of a fundamental consideration, but it is not clear whether that is on a personal or company level nor whether it is for economical or intellectual reasons.\n\nIn any event, the way bitcoin currently operates, as far as development of the Bitcoin Core client is concerned, appears to very much depend on trusting Blockstream and its steering direction of Bitcoin Core as there is no longer any counterbalancing influence in Bitcoin Core development with Andresen, Garzik and Hearn seemingly pushed out.\n\nThat means that the interests of other businesses, miners and the wider ecosystem currently has no voice in Bitcoin Core development. That is primarily due to a failure by miners, businesses and the wider ecosystem to organize in such a way as to ensure the very important work of bitcoin development is undertaken in a way that impartially can be said benefits the entire ecosystem.\n\nUntil they do so, the increase or, the opposite, a lack of action on transaction capacity, might soon be replaced by some other steering action that may come at the expense of some other parts of the ecosystem. To address and solve this imbalance, development needs to be incentivized by all ecosystem participants in an accountable way both to ensure that actions, which impartially can be said are in the best interest of the ecosystem, are undertaken and to ensure the speed, quality and priority of development is accountable and incentivized.\n\nAs such, it may well be the case that the 1MB limit was placed there less for technical reasons and more to firstly see whether bitcoin can be hijacked and, if not, to incentivize ecosystem participants, especially miners, whom the system design trusts the most due to its design incentives, to contribute towards bitcoin development so as to ensure they operate in the best interest of the entire network.\n\n[democracy id=”6″]\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin Unlimited, one of the Bitcoin Core software forks introduced in late 2015, garnered much attention in recent months. The project gained hash power support from several new Bitcoin mining pools, including ViaBTC, GBMiners and BTC.TOP, while node adoption appears to be on the rise as well.\n\n\n\nThe central idea behind Bitcoin Unlimited — specified in “Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal 001” (BUIP001) — is to hand control of Bitcoin’s block size limit to users and miners. Or perhaps more accurately: to make this control more explicit and easier to handle.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nThe Proposal\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol, as enforced by economically relevant nodes, currently includes a one-megabyte block size limit. If a miner were to create a block larger than one megabyte, that block would be considered invalid. It would not become part of Bitcoin’s blockchain, and the miner that mined it would have wasted its resources producing it.\n\nBUIP001 — drafted by Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone — disposes of the one-megabyte block size limit protocol rule entirely, and replaces it with three configurable options. Two of these are configurable by all node operators, which include regular users as well as miners. And a third option is only for miners.\n\nThese configurations are signaled to the Bitcoin network. Regular users broadcast their preferences to other nodes, and miners embed their preferences in the blocks they mine.\n\nOption 1: Maximum Generation Size, or “MG”\n\nFirst, there is the Maximum Generation Size, also referred to as “MG.” This option is for miners only and is fairly straightforward: it lets miners set the size of blocks they produce. The default setting is one megabyte: It doesn’t automatically diverge from the current Bitcoin protocol. But if a miner wants to create a two-megabyte block, it’s as simple as “flipping a switch” in Bitcoin Unlimited’s user interface. If a miner wants to produce an eight-megabyte block, it’s the same switch.\n\n(The only limits left are limits on message length, which Bitcoin Unlimited set at 160 megabytes. And eventually data type limits or machine resource limits.)\n\nMG gives miners full control over the size of blocks they produce. But of course, as explained above, a two-megabyte block would be rejected by the network right now.\n\nThat’s where the second configurable option comes in.\n\nOption 2: Excessive Block Size, or “EB”\n\nThe Excessive Block Size, typically referred to as “EB,” determines the size of blocks that nodes and miners accept. If a miner produces a two-megabyte block, that block will be accepted by all nodes and miners that set EB to at least two megabytes.\n\nEB is set at sixteen megabytes by default and is configurable by both normal users and miners. But it is an especially important configuration for miners: miners only mine on top of blocks they accept. A miner that maintains Bitcoin’s current one-megabyte block size limit will reject a two-megabyte block, to instead keep mining on the last one-megabyte block. A miner that sets EB to two megabytes, however, will immediately mine on top of that same two-megabyte block, regardless of what the rest of the network does.\n\nOf course, this also presents a problem.\n\nIf a minority of miners sets EB to one megabyte, and a majority of miners sets EB to, say, two megabytes, the network could split in two. As soon as anyone mines a two-megabyte block, a minority of miners will ignore it, and instead continue to extend the one-megabyte chain. The majority of miners, however, will accept the chain with the two-megabyte block, and extend that chain.\n\nDifferent groups of miners would consider different chains valid, and mine on top of their “own” chain while ignoring the other chain. This split could technically last forever without the two chains ever converging, in effect splitting Bitcoin into two different networks and currencies.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve this, Bitcoin Unlimited introduces the third configurable option.\n\nOption 3: Excessive Acceptance Depth, or “AD”\n\nExcessive Acceptance Depth, or “AD,” essentially overrules EB. More specifically, AD determines the number of added confirmations a block requires, before nodes and miners accept it regardless of that block’s size. The default is four.\n\nSo, let’s say a node sets EB to two megabytes, and AD to four added confirmations. If that node receives a three-megabyte block, it will initially ignore that block since it exceeds its two-megabyte EB. But if a majority of miners does not ignore that block, and mines four new blocks on top of it, the node’s two-megabyte EB is overruled by its four AD confirmations. The three-megabyte block is retroactively accepted as valid.\n\nAs such, different miners (and nodes) should — eventually — converge on a single valid chain, even if they have different MG and EB settings.\n\nLast, it’s worth briefly mentioning the “sticky gate.” If a node’s AD is hit, that node will accept subsequent blocks of any size for about 24 hours (144 blocks). This sticky gate ensures that miners immediately build on the chain with the newly accepted bigger blocks, and not continuously lag behind on the rest of the network, while waiting for each block to reach sufficient AD.\n\nThe next article will take a closer look at some of the weaknesses of BUIP001.\n\n“Jonny1000” contributed to this article.', 'Federal police in Venezuela today arrested four bitcoin miners in the town of Charallave. Three men and one women were accused of ""electricity theft"" and ""internet fraud."" The news, which was reported earlier today by Venezuela\'s leading bitcoin news site, CriptoNoticias, was first announced on the Instagram feed of Douglas Rico, who\'s the director of the Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas Penales y Criminalisticas (CICPC), a federal police agency.\n\nThe arrested miners were identified as Néstor Rafael Amundaray Precilla (57), Ana Cecilia Farias Villanueva (25), Kevin David Ojeda Díaz (26), and Alberto José Zapata Orta (23).\n\nIn a statement attached to his Instagram post, Rico said that they were running ""more than 300"" bitcoin mining computers and selling them in Cúcuta, a Colombian town near the Venezuelan border, which is known as a place where Venezuelans go to freely trade bolivars and dollars without abiding by the government\'s strict currency controls.\n\nRico also claimed that the miners\' actions had affected ""the consumption and the stability"" of electricity service in Charallave.\n\nThese four individuals aren\'t the first Venezuelans bitcoin miners to be arrested. In 2015, José Perales, 46, and Joel Padrón, 31, were arrested by the Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional (SEBIN), which is the country\'s secret police force, and held for three and a half months.\n\nAs I argued in a January 2017 feature story, bitcoin mining is turning Venezuelan ""socialism against itself:""\n\n[T]he main factor driving Venezuelans to take up bitcoin mining is a price control put in place by the socialist government: Electricity is virtually free. Bitcoin mining requires a lot of computer processing power, which in turn requires a lot of electricity. In most of the world, utility bills eat into the cost of mining. In places where energy prices are high, it can even be a losing proposition. But in Venezuela, the government has turned bitcoin mining into something akin to owning a home mint. Price controls, of course, invariably lead to shortages, and the country\'s frequent electricity outages create constant headaches for bitcoin miners. But they\'ve also come up with workarounds, such as locating their operations in industrial zones, where electricity service is generally uninterrupted. Since bitcoin mining is a process, in effect, of converting the value of electricity into currency, Venezuelan miners are engaging in a form of arbitrage: They\'re buying an underpriced commodity and turning it into bitcoin to make a profit. The miners have turned socialism against itself.\n\nRead the whole thing.', 'On January 20, Grayscale Investments, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its Bitcoin Investment Trust to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the intention of launching the first listed Bitcoin ETF in the U.S.\n\n\n\nGrayscale Investments seeks to launch its ETF with an initial $500 million public offering according to the filing. This is the third Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. that has been filed with the SEC for approval.\n\nBitcoin pioneers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed the first Bitcoin ETF back in 2013 with the intention to bring mainstream investors to Bitcoin. The ETF, which is intended for listing on the Bats exchange, has been waiting for SEC approval for over three years now. The Winklevosses’ Bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, intends to list 1 million shares at $65 each and will have the ticker “COIN” according to its most recent SEC filing. A decision of whether the ETF will be approved or not by the SEC is expected in March 2017.\n\nThe second Bitcoin ETF was filed by SolidX Partners Inc. in July of last year. SolidX also wants to list its insured Bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. The SolidX Bitcoin Trust, if approved, will be a passively managed exchange-traded fund with the ticker “XBTC” that provides shareholders with exposure to the daily change in the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin. A final decision on the ETF’s approval is also expected in March 2017.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would be an excellent vehicle for both institutional and private investors to gain exposure to bitcoin as an asset class without the hassle of having to purchase and securely store the digital currency itself.\n\nShould a Bitcoin ETF receive SEC approval and should investor demand for such an ETF increase, then the inflows into the ETF would have a profound impact on the price of bitcoin in order to keep up with the demand for the ETF.\n\nWill the SEC Approve Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nGiven bitcoin’s extreme volatility and China’s influence on the digital currency, the chances of getting a Bitcoin ETF approved, however, are currently rather low.\n\nOne of the key reasons ETFs require SEC approval is to protect investors from potential financial harm. Given that the price of bitcoin has been known to drop by 25 percent in a matter of days on the back of negative headlines, such as potential regulatory changes in China or the hacking of bitcoin exchanges, it is unlikely the SEC will consider a Bitcoin ETF a smart investment for retail investors.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that China is the largest market for the digital currency will not be looked upon favorably by the SEC. Reportedly over 90 percent of bitcoin trading activities occur on Chinese shores, which means they are taking place on exchanges that have a regulatory framework different from those in the U.S. Moreover, the SEC will be very wary of approving a new financial product whose price is indirectly controlled by China, as we were able to witness at the beginning of January. Then, the price of bitcoin collapsed after the Yuan strengthened and the People’s Bank of China issued a warning about the riskiness of investing in the digital currency, followed by on-site inspections on China’s three largest exchanges.', 'Pražská kavárna Bitcoin Coffee v prostorách Paralelní Polis už v prosinci deklarovala, že odmítá zavést elektronickou evidenci tržeb (EET). Kontroloři k nim do pražských Holešovic dorazili včera ráno.

Kavárníci jsou přesvědčení, že zákon o EET se nakonec zruší.\n\nKontroloři provedli v Bitcoin Coffee běžný kontrolní nákup. Objednali si dvě cappuccina a s pomocí obsluhy zaplatili bitcoinovou peněženkou, účtenku nejprve nepožadovali. ""Kasa samozřejmě žádnou nevydala,"" uvedla ve svém prohlášení kavárna. Následně se úředníci legitimizovali a spolu s kavárníky sepsali protokol. Pokutu zatím podnik nedostal, věc bude předána příslušnému oddělení finanční správy.\n\nPodle Šípa je kavárna ochotná jít do skutečného střetu. ""Jestli budeme platit nebo nebudeme, to záleží.

Pak už budeme reagovat na konkrétní situaci,"" dodal Šíp. Soudní spor potvrdil jako jednu z možností.\n\n""Nemůžeme dopředu reagovat na všechny eventuality. Obě strany mají nějakou akční sílu. Stát ji má pochopitelně větší, ale musí všechno dělat legálně, podle určených postupů. Nemá úplnou libovůli dělat cokoli,"" upozorňuje Šíp.\n\nPro Bitcoin Coffee je podstatná pozornost, kterou svým odmítavým postojem k EET vzbudí. ""Pro nás není tolik důležité to, že jsou s tím spojené nějaké zvýšené náklady, ale co to znamená v dlouhodobém běhu a kontextu všech ostatních věcí,"" popisuje Martin Šíp. Vadí mu větší kontrola toho, co lidé dělají a jestli odvádějí to, co by měli. ""Sledujeme dlouhodobou tendenci státu kontrolovat občany.

Především jde ale o drastický zásah do soukromí všech občanů,"" píše se v prohlášení. Z těchto důvodů se Bitcoin Coffee rozhodlo EET nepřijmout.', 'The action we saw in the bitcoin price overnight was in contrast to that which we expected based on yesterday’s intraday action. We thought we might see some degree of medium-term value add, or in other words an increase in value, as volume picked up, and volatility followed. As it turned out, price traded relatively flat throughout the early period, but then declined pretty sharply late night and into early morning Europe. Right now, price is currently trading somewhere around the base of this decline, and very close to long-term psychological support around the 900 level.\n\nThe question now, is, what is next? Can price stabilize, and avoid breaking into the 800s longer-term, or are we going to see a return to the downside momentum as we head into the European afternoon? Let’s try and figure it out. As ever, take a quick look at the chart below to get an idea of what is on, and where we’re looking to trade during today’s session. It is a five-minute candlestick chart, and it has our range overlaid in green.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range in focus for today is defined to the downside by the above-mentioned 900 level as support, and to the upside at 916 for resistance. This is just about wide enough for us to go at price intrarange, so long at support and short at resistance, with a stop loss is just the other side of the entry to define risk.\n\nIf we see price break above resistance, we will enter long towards an immediate upside target of 930. A stop loss on the trade at 912 defines risk nicely. Conversely, a close below support will put us short towards 890. Again we need a stop us on this one, and somewhere in the region of 906 is pretty aggressive, but works well.\n\nLet’s see how things play out. With any luck, we won’t have to enter short, and 900 will hold longer-term.\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The authors demanded $35,000 to decrypt the system, which is vital for the operation of the library and includes such things as who currently has which book and the public Internet service.\n\nIn the past, nationwide, several government agencies have given in to the demands of ransomware. (See Hacked’s posts on the subject.) But St. Louis library officials allowed their IT people to work overnight, and by morning they had “regained control of the server,” which has nothing to do with accessing the files.\n\nRebuilding Over Relenting\n\n$35,000 is a lot of money to already cash-strapped government departments such as the library systems; perhaps it is no coincidence that the police typically simply pay their way out. Necessity being the mother of innovation, the library system has opted instead to rebuild its system from scratch. One can only hope that this time around they will include an encrypted nightly backup. Open source tools for this very purpose have existed so long that it hardly rates noting that, in the end, this ransomware attack, like all of them, is actually the fault of the person in charge of securing the system.\n\nSince regaining control of the server, the system has opened its locations as of Monday and patrons are free to use WiFi and read books in the library itself, although checking out materials is not possible. Some downloadable materials (which are normally provided by third-parties to public libraries) are still accessible. Public Internet terminals (of which the city has 700) will be coming back online after the priority issue of restoring the borrowing system.\n\nThe DNA of the attack has not been discussed much in public, but these things almost always happen as a result of employee activity. When settings are done appropriately, it’s more difficult than ever to escalate from a single machine in a network to such things as the database. Going full circumspect speculation here, it seems likely that the attacker actually compromised a user with access to the database itself.\n\nLibrary executive director Waller McGuire said in a released statement:\n\nAn attempt to hold information and access to the world for ransom is deeply frightening and offensive to any public library, and we will make every effort to keep that world available to our patrons.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""In the quest for a reliable proof of stake algorithm, IOHK CEO and Ethereum Classic developer Charles Hoskinson believes his company has made a breakthrough.\n\n\n\nCharles Hoskinson was one of the original founders and the initial CEO of Ethereum, but left the project before Ethereum's official launch in 2015. Along with another Ethereum veteran, Jeremy Wood, Hoskinson went on to Input/Output, or IOHK, a research and development company dedicated to cryptographic research and the architecture of digital currencies.\n\nSince Ethereum Classic split from Ethereum, Hoskinson became involved with the former. He recently announced “the Grothendieck Team,” a new development team dedicated to the digital currency and smart platform project.\n\nMeanwhile, IOHK, collaborating closely with university academics, has been working on a proof of stake algorithm dubbed “Ouroboros.” Whereas most digital currencies — including bitcoin — rely on proof of work by miners to reach consensus over the state of the ledger, proof of stake systems reach a consensus voted on by coin holders.\n\nProof of stake has been considered and experimented on for several years now, as some believe it may be superior to proof of work.\n\n“The obvious benefit of proof of stake over proof of work is that it doesn’t require miners to burn energy, which makes it much more efficient,” Hoskinson told Bitcoin Magazine. “But there are more advantages to it. It also allows for next-generation governance systems, for example, allowing stakeholders to indicate their preference on hard or soft forks.”\n\nOuroboros\n\nOuroboros was developed by professors Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russel and Roman Olynykov, as well as Bernardo David.\n\nIn Ouroboros, new blocks are produced by randomly selected coin holders, based on a probability proportional to their stake. This is realized through a sort of lottery, which places the coin holders in dedicated timeslots that indicate their turn to produce a new block to update the blockchain. If a coin holder does not produce a block within their designated timeslot, their turn is simply skipped.\n\nThe main challenge of any proof of stake system is know as the “nothing at stake problem.” If the blockchain forks to two or more competing chains, the optimal strategy for any coin holder is to extend every fork. That way, it gets its block reward no matter which fork wins or multiple block rewards if several chains continue to exist.\n\nBut this is also at odds with a central design goal of blockchains: the incentive for everyone to converge onto a single chain.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Kiayias said this is to a large extent solved by a novel solution to achieve randomness for the lotteries. This should make the probability of stakeholders successfully forking the chain negligible.\n\n“Imagine that you have an initial population of stakeholders,” Kiayias said, explaining how this randomness is achieved. “Shortly prior to the system initialization, an initial lottery is conducted to choose a committee. All of this information becomes part of the genesis block and the protocol starts. The initial committee is responsible for advancing the blockchain the first time around and running a secure multiparty computation protocol that realizes a publicly observable ‘beacon.’ It’s this beacon that generates the randomness for the lottery.”\n\nOnce this lottery has selected an initial round of winners, and the blockchain is in motion, this process is repeated. This is called a new “epoch.”\n\n“At the end of the first epoch, the seed for the second epoch is computed and a new ‘genesis’ information is calculated,” Kiayias said. “This includes the multi-party computation protocol computed seed, and a stakeholder distribution reflecting stake shifts from the initial stakeholder set. The protocol continues in the same fashion moving from epoch to epoch.”\n\nWhile noting that Ouroboros is provably secure — a mathematical method of proving a protocol works as intended — Hoskinson did add that this does not mean all challenges pertaining proof of stake are completely solved.\n\nScaling Ouroboros to a global user base will require additional research and engineering, he said, while it's also not always possible to drop out of the consensus process to securely rejoin later.\n\nEthereum Classic\n\nEthereum has always planned to switch to proof of stake at some point in the future, using a yet-to-be-finalized protocol dubbed “Casper.”\n\nAlthough the initial plan for Ethereum Classic was to copy Ethereum in every step of the development process, it soon became clear that many in the community preferred for the project to take on its own path. The preferred consensus algorithm, whether it be proof of stake or proof of work, has always been a central topic in that debate.\n\nFor now, it seems the Ethereum Classic community is generally in favor of proof of work, and will most likely stick to that proven and tested consensus algorithm for the foreseeable future. The project recently even hard forked to diffuse the so-called “difficulty bomb,” which ensured sticking to a proof of work consensus algorithm remains an option.\n\nDespite Hoskinson’s involvement with Ethereum Classic, it seems unlikely the project will adopt IOHK’s Ouroboros.\n\n“And that’s fine. We shouldn’t fall in love with one idea,” Hoskinson said. “While I do think Ethereum Classic’s consensus algorithm, ‘Ghost,’ needs to be removed or improved, sticking to proof of work will help us differentiate from Ethereum, so the two projects can complement each other instead of competing. This could also help Ethereum, as miners will have a place to go when they make the switch, which should make their transition easier.”\n\nFor more information on Ouroboros, visit the IOHK website and white paper and its GitHub page.""]"
01/26/2017,"['CHBTC has become the world’s largest bitcoin exchange when measured by volume in the aftermath of other China-based exchanges removing their no-fee trading policies. At this time, CHBTC has not implemented fees for trading the Chinese Yuan/bitcoin (CNY/XBT) pair. According to cnLedger, the exchange plans to implement trading fees at an as-of-yet undetermined time in the future.\n\n\n\nBTCC, Huobi, OKCoin and YUNBI Implement Trading Fees\n\nEarlier this week, four of China’s largest bitcoin exchanges added trading fees to their platforms following reviews from regulators at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). According to statements released by bitcoin exchanges BTCC, Huobi, OKCoin and YUNBI, the move is an attempt to limit market manipulation and exchange-rate volatility.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the addition of trading fees was not a direct order from the PBOC. Instead, it was an attempt by the exchanges to help align with the PBOC’s desire to see the bitcoin market cool down.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the no-fee trading policy on China-based bitcoin exchanges had been attractive for those who developed bots to do their trading for them.\n\nCHBTC Still Has a No-Fee Policy — For Now\n\nFor the time being, CHBTC has decided to continue with their current fee policy until a new fee policy is decided on and implemented. For this reason, the volume at the exchange has not experienced the massive declines seen at the big three exchanges in China.\n\nCHBTC is now doing about as much CNY-based bitcoin trading in volume as BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin combined.\n\nIn addition to CHBTC, London-based exchange Coinfloor also offers no-fee bitcoin trading. Ironically, Coinfloor implemented the no-fee trading policy last week.\n\nCHBTC charges fees on withdrawals, and the fee for a withdrawal is based on a user’s trading volume. In other words, users are incentivized to trade more and inflate the total trading volume of the exchange before a withdrawal is made.\n\nAlthough CHBTC does not charge any fees on bitcoin trades, the exchange does charge a 0.05 percent fee on ether classic trades.\n\nChina’s Role in Bitcoin Trading Not as Big as Previously Thought\n\nSevere declines in bitcoin trading volume have been seen on the China-based bitcoin exchanges that have recently added fees to the trading process. For example, bitcoin trading volume on BTCC has declined more than 90 percent over the past few days.\n\nIt’s likely that CHBTC will see a similar decline in trading volume when they follow the lead of the other China-based bitcoin exchanges and implement trading fees.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, China still has the three largest bitcoin exchanges by volume among exchanges that charge fees on trades.', 'A new two-part deal valued at $30m will see BitFury expand its footprint in China.\n\nThe full-service blockchain technology company has announced a deal with Credit China Fintech, a firm that provides consumer-facing financial products, according to FT. The $30m deal has two components: an investment in BitFury directly and plans to establish a joint venture in China.\n\nIn statements, Credit China Fintech said that it would seek to adopt the technology for its services, looking at applications of both the bitcoin blockchain and private ledgers.\n\nPhang Yew Kiat, Vice-Chairman and CEO of Credit China Fintech, said in a statement:\n\n“Blockchain is a fast emerging technology allowing effective secured value transfer over the internet. Our collaboration with BitFury will further cement our leadership position in the use of Blockchain technologies across our FinTech platforms, taking Credit China Fintech to a new level of competitiveness.”\n\nThe deal comes on the heels of the launch of a new international blockchain-focused group, dubbed the Global Business Blockchain Council, formally unveiled at the Davos conference in Switzerland earlier this month. Yesterday, the group announced its list of founding members, which includes representatives from BitFury, law firm Covington and the World Bank, among others.\n\nIn pushing to expand more significantly into China, BitFury enters the largest ecosystem for bitcoin miners – mining is a competitive, energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain – as well as traders.\n\n“China is a visionary country and we are honored to have the opportunity to expand the work of our company to this significant part of the world,” BitFury founder and CEO Valery Vavilov said.\n\nChinese city and traffic image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The accused included three men and one woman, all between the ages of 23 and 57.\n\nAccording to an Instagram post by Douglas Rico, the director of the Computer Crime Division of the Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigations Corps (CICPC), the four were operating more than 300 Antminer units and selling the bitcoins “on a commercial website.” As per Bitcoin-focused blog Bitcoinist, the Corps director went on to say that the accused sold the bitcoins ""on the Colombian Venezuelan border in Cúcuta, affecting the consumption and stability of electricity services in the area.”\n\nReason magazine published an article a few months ago detailing how, amid the collapse of Venezuela’s economy, people are turning to Bitcoin mining as a way to stay afloat. The country’s government heavily subsidizes electricity to the point where it costs about $0.02/kWh according to research project ClimateScope, so electricity-intensive Bitcoin mining sees a better return on investment in Venezuela than it might in a country with more expensive electricity.\n\nTo add a wrinkle to the situation, the country experienced frequent blackouts throughout 2016. The New Yorker explains that the country gets an inordinate amount of its electricity from hydroelectric plants, which have recently suffered dearly from drought. (Despite Venezuela’s reputation as an oil-rich nation, it actually saves a lot of its oil resources for export.) Reason notes that Bitcoin miners in the country have “come up with workarounds” to avoid the blackouts, “such as locating their operations in industrial zones, where electricity service is generally uninterrupted.”\n\nCurrently, one Venezuelan bolívar is equivalent to $0.10. One Bitcoin is exchanged for $915 (The New York Times notes that Bitcoin\'s price has been buoyed by the fall of the bolívar as many Venezuelans look to Bitcoin as an alternative). In interviews with Reason, Venezuelan Bitcoin miners reported that they purchase Walmart or Amazon gift cards online with their bitcoins and use those gift cards to import food and other goods.\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining isn’t illegal in Venezuela, Reason writes that 31-year-old miner Joel Padrón was arrested and jailed for more than three months at the beginning of 2016 on charges of electricity theft.', 'You have heard the buzz about bitcoin, the global currency that only exists online. What you might not have heard is that bitcoin is just one part of a larger cryptocurrency movement that has the potential to change the financial industry.\n\nIn 2009, Bitcoin v0.1, the network over which bitcoin currency is traded was released by Satoshi Nakamoto, an online pseudonym for an anonymous individual or group. In the release notes, Nakamoto described the Bitcoin network as a new form of digital currency that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent duplicate uses of currency and has no central server or authority.\n\nIn effect, bitcoin was released as a new form of currency without central regulation, even by Nakamoto. For a change to be made to the central ledger of transactions known as the “blockchain,” a significant number of nodes — participants in the network — must agree on what that change is.\n\nOnly a small number of transaction reversals, known as “hard forks,” have occurred in the world of cryptocurrency, and none have been exacted for bitcoin. Historically, hard forks have been used to undo the damage done by hackers who have exploited early software vulnerabilities.\n\nAt its release, bitcoin traded at a rate of 1,309.03 bitcoin to $1. One bitcoin was equivalent to less than .08 of a penny. At the time, bitcoin lacked the credibility and renown to draw the attention of regulators and financial institutions; however, when bitcoin’s price surged and eventually peaked at over $1,200 per unit in early 2014, these groups took a keen interest in the digital currency.\n\nAlthough the Bitcoin network’s market cap sits at approximately $15 billion, a drop in the proverbial bucket of global commerce, some regulators have taken to sweeping reform or blacklisted the currency entirely. In late 2013, the People’s Bank of China announced that financial institutions operating within China were prohibited from exchanging the currency at all. This announcement coincided with a large drop in the price of bitcoin, as wealthy Chinese citizens had been using the currency to sidestep legal measures that prevented them from expatriating any significant amount of money.\n\nThis price fluctuation, and the story behind it demonstrate some of the challenges that bitcoin faces as a form of currency.\n\nFirst, bitcoin is not backed by the credit of any government. As a result, bitcoin is far more volatile than most other currencies on the foreign exchange.Second, China’s stance on bitcoin is endemic of a larger problem within the sphere of cryptocurrency. China’s unilateral decision to ban the exchange of bitcoin was a major influence that devalued the currency by nearly 20 percent. Therefore, its status as a stable carrier of value is questionable at best.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin provides a complete ledger of every transaction that has been performed, domestic and international regulators do not have experience dealing with this type of shared digital ledger. Thus, the adoption of blockchain technology into the mass market could bear high start-up costs for taxpayers.\n\nDespite these problems, large financial institutions have looked to blockchain technologies like the Bitcoin network as a path to the future. These institutions hope to capitalize on features of blockchain to help eliminate some of their back-office cost centers.\n\nAmong these new features are “smart contracts,” which effectively act like legal or financial contracts in code but have the added benefit of automated enforcement, payments and more. For example, if Jack has a lending agreement with Jane that mandates her debt-to-equity ratio remain below a threshold, they can include a conditional penalty that would be paid automatically should that term be violated. These contracts could slash salary expense for firms across the financial sector.\n\nTo make this a reality, Wall Street banks and financial technology firms, such as CapitalOne, Visa and Chain, have collaborated to solve the problems of early cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Participants hope to adapt existing blockchain technology to allow for administration and oversight by creating a consortium of reputable institutions that would maintain the blockchain ledger and legitimize the medium of exchange. It looks like these firms are creating the technology that will invalidate their own business models, but, instead, these firms view this investment as critical to their future relevance.\n\nIronically, the Bitcoin network’s first block, a file in which transaction data is stored, contained a set parameter referencing a Times article about an upcoming bank bailout. As a result, the bitcoin has, at times, been viewed as an anti-establishment currency that operates both by the people and for the people. Given the challenges that bitcoin has faced, reputable institutions may be needed to lend credibility in the global market.\n\nKevin Murphy is a Junior in the McDonough School of Business.

This is a joint initiative of Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union; Interpol, an intergovernmental organization facilitating international police cooperation; and the Basel Institute on Governance, an independent not-for-profit competence center specializing in financial crime.\n\nAccording to the Basel Institute on Governance, the conference “aimed to provide law enforcement agencies and the private sector with the tools and understanding necessary to detect, counter and investigate criminal uses of virtual currencies.”\n\nAs a concrete result, attendees agreed on a list of shared recommendations.\n\nCracking Down on Bitcoin\n\nSeveral of the recommendations specifically refer to Bitcoin and digital currencies, while others concern money laundering in general. If the recommendations are followed, they would significantly increase regulation of the digital currency space worldwide and make anonymous use of the digital currency much more difficult.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the recommendations suggest that bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers should be regulated in much the same way as the financial sector. While the digital currency space is still not officially regulated in many countries, background and identity checks through Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation could become mandatory for anyone who wants to buy, sell or store bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoin mixing services — which exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins to break the path to any particular piece of currency — are subject to several recommendations.\n\n“All countries are advised to take action against Digital Currencies Mixers/Tumblers,” per a release from the Basel Institute on Governance. “Such services are designed exclusively to anonymize transactions and to make it impossible for Law Enforcement Agencies to detect and trace suspicious transactions. The existence of such companies should not continue to be tolerated.”\n\nThe recommendations also suggest that law enforcement agencies should cooperate across borders in identifying “suspicious Bitcoin addresses that threaten economic stability” and even that “unexplained wealth” should be considered a crime.\n\nConnection to Cybercrime\n\nThe Working Group on Virtual Currencies was established in September of last year, in response to the popularity of digital currencies like bitcoin for illegal purposes.\n\nIn a 2015 report, Europol wrote that bitcoin was becoming the “common currency” for cybercriminals, accounting for over 40 percent of all identified criminal-to-criminal payments.\n\n“Bitcoin is no longer used preferentially within Darknet marketplaces but is increasingly being adopted for other types of cybercrime as well,” the agency noted.\n\nExamples include cryptoware like CryptoLocker and Curve-Tor-Bitcoin (malware that locks computers and demands a ransom to unlock it), DDoS extortion, commercial distribution of child abuse, credit card fraud and more.\n\nSee the full list of recommendations from the Working Group on Virtual Currencies here.', 'One of the main issues with bitcoin from a mainstream adoption perspective is price volatility, but a man in California recently benefited from short-term bitcoin price volatility in a major way.\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg Markets, Bitpay CCO Sonny Singh told the story of how the bitcoin payment processor helped a man purchase a house with bitcoin and how this individual unintentionally made $1 million on the exchange from bitcoin to U.S. dollars.\n\nSomeone Wants to Buy a House With Bitcoin\n\n“We got approached last month by a real estate developer,” Singh told Bloomberg Markets. “He had an offer to buy a house, and the purchaser wanted to pay in bitcoin. And they weren’t really sure what that was, so they contacted us.”\n\nSingh noted that Bitpay has helped facilitate these sorts of transactions several times over the past few years. “We walked him through how it works and the process,” said Singh.\n\nThe purchase price of the home in question was roughly $4 million.\n\nAccidentally Making $1 Million\n\nSingh went on to explain that the bitcoin price was at $750 when the transaction to purchase the house was initiated. By the end of the transaction, the bitcoin price was $1000. “So the buyer actually ended up making about 25 percent in the currency exchange rate, essentially, in the appreciation,” said Singh.\n\nAccording to the numbers provided by Singh, the buyer of the home was left with an extra $1.3 million after the purchase of the home.\n\n“With that extra money, he went and bought a Lamborghini at Newport Beach, Orange County, which also accepts bitcoin with Bitpay,” added Singh. “He got a house for pretty much 25 percent cheaper, as well as a free Lamborghini essentially.”\n\nIs Bitcoin Just for Wealthy Americans?\n\nAfter Singh told this story, Bloomberg Markets co-host Carol Massar stated, “This is why more people are going to hate wealthy Americans.”\n\nMassar was pointing to the fact that the home buyer was able to make over a million dollars in a day due to nothing more than dumb luck.\n\nWhen this point was brought up, Singh was also asked if bitcoin will essentially just be a tool for the wealthy in situations like this. Singh disagreed with that notion, pointing out multiple use cases for the digital bearer asset, such as B2B payments or money transfers between China and Korea with extremely low fees.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

We didn\'t come up with any perfect answers, but we\'d like to heal the rifts.""\n\nStill, in the day\'s earlier sessions, older tensions seemed to flare as past debates resurfaced.\n\nFor example, there remains a division among the technology\'s supporters and entrepreneurs on how to evaluate the developments on ethereum, an alternative blockchain for smart contracts that experienced a controversial split last year.\n\nElsewhere, there remained an advocacy among developers for prioritizing ways to keep the core bitcoin software unchanged, despite pressures for more aggressive problem solving.\n\n""I think the philosophy of bitcoin people has been, bitcoin is much like the Internet. How many people would say the Internet hasn\'t innovated? When you look at the protocol, it hasn\'t innovated much at all. We do it in layers,"" another attendee said.\n\nThe discussions in some ways served to reinforce divides between businesses (drawn to ethereum\'s aggressive problem solving) and developers (who have shown a preference for approaches that emphasize conservatism and security).\n\nUs vs them\n\nIn the face of technical disagreement, though, unity was often found in rhetoric that positioned bitcoin as a vehicle capable of checking potentially hostile world powers.\n\nOne executive of one of the industry\'s largest incumbent supporters, for example, gave a keynote address in which he talked at length about his discussions with other enterprise firms. ""You have people so nervous,"" he said.\n\nThere was also humor to be found in barbs aimed at some of the institutions that have gone so far as to announce trials and proofs-of-concept using the blockchain technology.\n\n""They have not internalized how much they have to change. You\'ve shown up with a Ferrari and they\'re insisting on putting a lawnmower in it,"" he said.\n\nYet, there were also pleas for bitcoin\'s enthusiasts to commit to certain core values, an argument that was made under the assumption that pressures from outside influencers will only continue as the technology continues to grow.\n\nOne guest remarked:\n\n""If there is a war or another 9/11, there will be prominent people in this space, there will be serious people in this room who will turn.""\n\n\'Trimming the list\'\n\nThis argument later saw additional color in a more technical session aimed at revisiting the value that each of bitcoin\'s features provides.\n\nOn the list, sketched out on a marker board, were topics including fraud management, transaction finality, opt-in transparency and permissionlessness.\n\nNotable in the discussion was that attendees displayed a willingness to prioritize features that were perhaps less likely to be obvious to users, an assumption carried out under the premise that such design decisions are being made in the greater good.\n\n""I think the majority people wouldn\'t care if it ended up as all the bad things in one spot. Someone would find that worst case acceptable, because as long as you\'re playing by the rules, you\'re getting rich,"" one attendee argued.\n\nThe discussion went on to envision scenarios in which bitcoin could plausibly exist, but in ways that diminish the features those in attendance believe would make it more valuable.\n\nYet, the conversation often felt like a return to square one in the way it sought to envision how bitcoin might best be described in a way that incorporates new understanding of the science that supports its distributed digital transactions.\n\nAn attendee said:\n\n""We\'re not trying to redefine bitcoin, we\'re trying to discover the definition.""\n\nSidechains considered\n\nThat\'s not to say that the discussion didn\'t provide advances.\n\nIn conversation, prominent technologists seemed increasingly interested in testing scenarios in which a sidechain, or a blockchain featuring bitcoins pegged to the main blockchain, would be used as a way to extend the tech\'s functionality while preserving its core.\n\nUnder this scenario, the bitcoin blockchain could theoretically support a separate blockchain that would have different features, such as say, an 8MB block limit as proposed by those in the community who favor more aggressive scaling tactics.\n\nThe discussion focused on two particular sidechains proposals introduced in recent months, though which had not been broadly been considered as potential ways to achieve scaling.\n\nHowever, there was acknowledgement that other factors needed to be refined (such as how the sidechains would be secured). Also notable is that the idea would require the addition of new code to the bitcoin protocol by way of a soft fork, meaning miners would still have to signal support for the upgrade.\n\nConceptually, however, the idea seemed to have support, and a potentially broad appeal.\n\nOne attendee summed up the idea:\n\n""The people who want things to stay the same can keep everything. For people who want large blocks, you don\'t have to schedule a hard fork.""\n\nImage via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But now, amid the throes of global economic and political unrest, new questions have emerged as to whether “cash is still king” in both developed and developing nations.\n\n\n\nThe root of this discourse is being played out with great significance worldwide. India, one of the world’s fastest growing nations, is struggling with the effects of a demonetization crisis that threatens to cripple its promising economic advancements. In China, currency speculators are facing a weakening yuan. Venezuelans are under siege due to a government cash crisis and soaring inflation. And in Mexico, the peso has declined precipitously on the heels of the U.S. election of President Donald Trump.\n\nThis assault on fiat is impacted by unsound policy decisions on the part of governments across the world. Cash is an open form of exchange, widely accepted and codified by central authorities. It also freely flows into the hands of nefarious actors, which, due to terrorist and other concerns, makes governments uneasy.\n\nAs economic disruption continues to have a chilling effect on cash economies, digital currencies, which enable secure, peer-to-peer payments without the interference of central governments or banks, are gaining increased attention. Bitcoin, the oldest and most recognized digital currency, had a major rise in value in 2016. Some attribute this rise to increasing demand in countries most affected by currency volatility and economic uncertainty.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Steven J. Ehrlich, associate at the New York–based Spitzberg Partners LLC, weighed in on changes taking place within the prevailing global order and cash economy. Spitzberg Partners is a consultancy firm that helps clients to develop and execute market entry and M&A strategies for Europe, North America, and beyond.\n\nFor starters, Ehrlich says that he is hesitant to characterize these developments as a “war on cash,” as some media outlets have suggested, since that, he says, would imply “a concerted and coordinated effort.” At the same time, he states that our global economy is in the middle of a tenuous recovery; thus, growth is not evenly distributed.\n\nCorruption still exists, Ehrlich laments, saying that at times, “monetary policy in a given country is primarily intended to support the political aims of a government rather than the economy as a whole.”\n\nSays Ehrlich: “People want to feel in control of their holdings to the greatest extent possible, and at the very least would like stability and clear headings within their respective political climates. The peso moving up and down with every tweet sent by then-candidate and now-President Trump is the quintessential example of how that is not always the case.”\n\nWill Bitcoin Emerge?\n\nEhrlich says that given shifting global dynamics, it’s no secret that bitcoin is being increasingly seen by many as a safe harbor or even a hedge for users in distressed economies (Venezuela, Argentina) as well as those with very strict currency controls (China).\n\nNevertheless, he is still skeptical of bitcoin’s potential as an alternative form of currency for a couple of reasons. First, the pain point, he says, for the majority of people wanting to use cash or credit cards is not deep enough to force them to change their habits. “If we use Geoffrey Moore’s ‘Crossing the Chasm’ example, I find it difficult to see how bitcoin moves from innovators and early adopters to an early majority of users.”\n\nContinues Ehrlich: “If it is ever to become a widely used currency, the [bitcoin] fungibility issue would still need to be solved. I believe that every bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) would have to be indistinguishable from any other, or else people may be hesitant to accept those coins as remuneration. It could also lead to different prices for different bitcoins depending on their past.”\n\nHe does admit that it’s impossible to ignore bitcoin’s performance over the course of 2016, and that its current positioning as a largely uncorrelated asset is very enticing.\n\nCautionary Tales\n\nFor Ehrlich, the first point of caution is government regulation:\n\n“Chinese officials have outsize influence on the market, but right now they largely aim to maintain ‘strategic ambiguity’ as it relates to regulating the market. While they themselves cannot shut down Bitcoin, if they moved aggressively against the infrastructure there, it would be very damaging to the ecosystem. Additionally, in my opinion, Bitcoin regulations throughout other parts of the world — particularly as they pertain to commerce — have still been relatively light due to its comparatively small market capitalization. But should there be an uptick in use, I’d expect governments to become much more engaged.”\n\nA second potential hurdle that Ehrlich notes is the possibility of another major hack of a central player, though the industry has been able to weather Mt. Gox, Bitfinex and Bitstamp so far. And he concedes that if it is ever proven that Bitcoin was used to facilitate a terrorist attack, he would expect governments to move very hard and swiftly against exchanges and money service businesses.\n\nAdditionally, he suggests that a damaging “High Impact/Low Probability” event such as a potential DAO/hard fork incident with Bitcoin could occur. “While I do not expect this to happen, especially in the near future, scalability and governance issues will likely not go away even if today’s hurdles are cleared. There also may come an issue or time when participants decide to create or even accidentally fall into competing Bitcoin networks. This is one issue that gold hasn’t had to deal with.”\n\nWhen asked for his prognostication regarding the future of cash, Ehrlich responded:\n\n“I do feel like cash is becoming a bit of an antiquated institution. I carry no more than a couple of dollars on me at any given time. The real question is whether or not our virtual currency future will be decentralized. In either circumstance, I would still hope that the currency would be fungible because on privacy grounds alone people would be hesitant to accept anything to the contrary. Governments could still benefit from ensuring that money does not simply disappear into thin air, which will assist with AML/KYC investigations and tax collection.”\n\nConcludes Ehrlich: “In my opinion the likeliest scenario is one where central banks issue digital versions of their currencies, as the prosecution of monetary policy remains a core government function and is not something that they want to cede.”', 'Cryptosteel is a device that allows bitcoin holders to back up their private keys in a fireproof, waterproof and shockproof manner. The idea is that the Cryptosteel will be able to act as a backup for any type of Bitcoin address for long periods of time, and many people see it as a useful companion to a hardware wallet.\n\nCryptosteel recently sent me one of their devices, and I opened it up to see how the whole process works.\n\n\n\nSetting Up a Cryptosteel\n\nIt’s easy to get started with the Cryptosteel MNEMONIC in a matter of minutes. The packaging is nice enough, and the artwork by contributing artist Rafael Akahira gives it a special, unique appearance.\n\nOnce the actual Cryptosteel device is out of the packaging, the product’s usefulness is immediately apparent. Although the Cryptosteel’s size is somewhere between that of a credit card and an old iPhone, it feels sturdier than a brick; a good bit of weight is packed into its small stature.\n\n\n\nAfter twisting the product open like some kind of Swiss Army knife, the frame where the stainless steel numbers, letters and other characters should be placed can be seen.\n\n\n\nThe steel characters that come with the device are separated into different sections, so it’s easy to find the ones you need. There’s even a chart similar to what you would find in a box of chocolates that tells you where each character can be found. Each piece of steel has a letter, number or other symbol on both the front and the back.\n\n\n\nTo begin placing characters into the device, a small lock must be turned counterclockwise and a safety pawl must be bent open (not at the same time). I used a butter knife to complete both of these steps.\n\nThere is a small gate that needs to be opened before placing the steel piecesletters into the frame. Although it seemed difficult to get the characters into the frame at first, I soon realized that the gate can also act as a hammer to knock them into place.\n\n\n\nI didn’t take the time to put in a 24-word mnemonic phrase, but I got a handle on how the Cryptosteel works by putting my name into the frame before closing it back up. This took a few minutes to complete. I imagine a full 24-word phrase could be completed in less than 30 minutes.\n\n\n\nHow Cryptosteel Could Be Improved\n\nUsing the Cryptosteel was a rather straightforward process, but I do have a few suggestions.\n\nThe first one isn’t much of a complaint, but it would be nice if there was a YouTube video that showed the user exactly how to set up and use his or her Cryptosteel. There are a few videos on the Cryptosteel YouTube page, but they appear to be based on old prototypes. Something like this is likely already in the works, but in the future, a message on the packaging that tells the user to go to a specific website to watch a setup video may be a good idea.\n\n\n\nThe only real issue I see with the Cryptosteel is the packaging of the steel character pieces with the characters on them. They are separated into different pockets in the packaging, but each section could be sealed off better. Having the characters get mixed together during the shipping process didn’t seem to be a serious issue, but it’s unclear what a user is supposed to do with the set of characters after they’re done using them.\n\n\n\nMost people will likely put all of the letters in a bag and put them to the side, but this will dramatically increase the amount of time it takes to enter a new series of characters into the frame of the Cryptosteel in the future. This is an unlikely scenario given that the point of the Cryptosteel is to use it once, but it’s worth mentioning. Someone could also run into this issue if they decide to stop entering characters into the frame and need to finish the process later.\n\n\n\nCreating more separation between the sets of characters for long-term storage would be a nice improvement.\n\n\n\nWhen to Use a Cryptosteel\n\nThis is an awesome device. I can’t imagine using anything else to back up private keys to a Bitcoin address.\n\nTrezor Architect Marek “Slush” Palatinus has said it’s the perfect way to back up the seed of a Trezor hardware wallet. It would obviously work well as a backup for a hardware device from Ledger or KeepKey as well.\n\n\n\nFor added security, multiple Cryptosteel devices could be placed in different locations as a backup for a multisig address. Alternatively, a user could separate his or her savings into multiple Cryptosteel devices to weaken the impact of one of them being lost or stolen. Some combination of these two options is also worth considering.\n\n\n\nThe Cryptosteel is basically a paper wallet on steroids.

01/27/2017,"['The father of a Florida man who prosecutors said operated an illegal bitcoin exchange avoided prison on Friday after pleading guilty in a case that stemmed from an investigation into a cyber breach at JPMorgan Chase.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan had sought up to 16 months in prison for Michael Murgio, a former Palm Beach County School Board member who pleaded guilty in October to obstructing an examination of a credit union linked to the bitcoin exchange.\n\nU.S. District Judge Alison Nathan instead sentenced Murgio, 66, to one year of probation, a $12,000 fine and 200 hours of community service, saying he was “far less” culpable than his co-defendants and had shown remorse.\n\n“None of us are the worst thing we have done in life,” Nathan said in court.\n\nProsecutors said bitcoin exchange Coin.mx was operated by one of Murgio’s sons, Anthony Murgio, and was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of overseeing a hacking scheme that resulted in information being stolen for more than 100 million people.\n\nThe companies that were hacked included JPMorgan, which in 2014 disclosed a breach involving records for more than 83 million accounts.\n\nThe Murgios were not charged in the hacking case.\n\nBut they and four other men were charged in connection with Coin.mx, which prosecutors said exchanged, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin and was run through a front called “Collectables Club.”\n\nTo evade scrutiny of Florida-based Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, 33, and others in 2014 acquired control of now-defunct Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, by bribing its chairman, Pastor Trevon Gross, prosecutors said.\n\nAfter the National Credit Union Administration in 2014 deemed Anthony Murgio’s board picks ineligible due to their residency, Michael Murgio drafted a letter falsely claiming Collectables Club was based in New Jersey, court papers said.\n\n“I wish there was a way to take it back, but there isn’t,” Michael Murgio said in court on Friday.\n\nFor more about Bitcoin, watch:\n\nAnthony Murgio, who cried during his father’s sentencing, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to charges stemming from Coin.mx’s operation. Gross and Yuri Lebedev, who prosecutors say worked on Coin.mx, are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6.\n\nShalon, who prosecutors said was also involved in stock manipulation schemes and online gambling businesses, has pleaded not guilty.', 'ZURICH (Reuters) - Bitcoin wallet provider Xapo said it has received conditional approval from Switzerland’s financial market watchdog to operate in the country in a regulatory breakthrough for companies that provide safekeeping for the virtual currency.\n\n“After almost two years of substantial effort and investment, Xapo has received conditional approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to operate in Switzerland,” Xapo CEO Wences Casares said in a blog on the company’s website.\n\nThe approval depended on several factors, including membership of a “self-regulatory organization”, Casares said, but added that the company was optimistic of meeting the conditions and being able to serve non-U.S. customers from Switzerland.\n\nFINMA declined to comment on an individual company’s status.\n\nOlga Feldmeier, a former managing partner of Xapo who coordinated the Swiss licensing process for the company, told Reuters that Xapo had been designated a financial intermediary, meaning it will not require a costly banking license.\n\nWallet providers like Xapo, which was founded in Silicon Valley, store the private keys that allow clients to access their digital currency funds.\n\nWhile other crypto-currency firms already operate in Switzerland, Xapo’s operation as a bitcoin wallet provider had raised questions over whether it required a banking license.\n\nA burgeoning industry surrounding bitcoin - a web-based “crypto-currency” that has no central authority, relying instead on a global network of computers that validate transactions and add new bitcoins to the system - has posed questions for lawmakers and regulators.\n\nXapo argued it did not accept deposits.\n\nSwiss authorities are eager to secure a leading role for Switzerland while playing catch-up in a rapidly changing financial technology (fintech) landscape.\n\nBitcoin Suisse operates a network of bitcoin ATMs across the country, as well as an online and in-person brokerage for buying and selling bitcoins. But it does not itself store the private access keys that led to questions about whether Xapo was taking deposits.\n\nSwitzerland’s cabinet in November proposed new light-touch regulations for fintech companies aimed at bolstering business and competitiveness.\n\nThe proposals include a fintech license, granted by FINMA, for institutions which are restricted to taking deposits of up to 100 million Swiss francs ($99.9 million) and do not lend.\n\nXapo is now in the process of joining a self-regulatory organization required under Swiss anti-money laundering regulations to begin operations, Feldmeier said.', ""A note to our readers: As per your request we have developed a set of features that allow you to reduce the noise, while not losing sight of anything that is important.

IEEE Software offers solid, peer-reviewed information about today's strategic technology issues. To meet the challenges of running reliable, flexible enterprises, IT managers and technical leads rely on IT Pro for state-of-the-art solutions.\n\nCrypto-currency remains controversial. Bitcoin, a leading open source initiative to create an alternative form of currency, swirls at the center of this controversy. Bitcoin uses a brilliantly designed distributed ledger system, known as a blockchain. Validating blockchain transactions involves an eloquent mathematical hashing process, popularly called mining.\n\nWhere Does CryptoCurrency Stand?\n\nThis website tracks crypto-currency market capitalizations and market trends:\n\nOn 17 November 2013, the value of a Bitcoin peaked at US$1,216.73 at the Mt. Gox exchange in Japan. According to coinmarketcap.com, on 14 August 2015, a single Bitcoin was valued at $267.37; but by 21 January 2016, Bitcoin value climbed to $416.93. By 5 February 2016, it was valued at $388.59.\n\nOn 14 August 2015, the website listed some 665 various types of available crypto-currencies, often called altcoins, for a total market capitalization of $4,640,592,043. On that date, Bitcoin commanded 84 percent of this market capitalization and dominated with 89 percent in trade volume.\n\nOn 21 January 2016, the market capitalization for the 658 listed altcoins had grown to $6,945,858,793. Bitcoin had jumped to a 91 percent command of market capitalization, but trade volume had slipped to 86 percent.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the market capitalization for the 675 listed altcoins had shrunk by 3 percent to $6,720,425,289. Bitcoin had a fallen to an 84 percent command on market valuation and maintained 92 percent by trade value.\n\nOf all of the altcoin offerings, 41 percent were not mineable by count, and 4 percent were not mineable by market capitalization value in January 2016.\n\nAt the moment, it appears that Bitcoin still has the edge in the crypto-currency field. In other terms, however, its viability teeters precipitously.\n\nBlockchain advocates praise the lack of need for central governance, much less government regulation. Events, however, suggest that, lacking oversight, the quasi-anonymous bitcoin can and does breed illicit behavior:\n\nThe former CEO of the thentroubled and now defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange, Mark Karpeles, was arrested in Japan in August 2015, accused of $387 million of theft in bitcoin valuation.\n\nRoss Ulbrict, the Silk Road dark Web Bitcoin drug lord, was convicted in 2015. As soon as Silk Road was shut down, other bitcoin-based sites arose to sell illegal merchandise online.\n\nTwo federal agents who tried to skim Bitcoin profits after Ulbright’s arrest were also indicted. 1\n\nExtortionists demanded Bitcoin payment from the hapless victims of the Ashley Madison infidelity site hack.\n\nJP Morgan and Bloomberg remain opposed to the very notion of crypto-currency. Nonetheless, a number of corporations began to embrace its use for business transactions during 2015:\n\nFirms such as Citi Corp, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Overstock, and IBM have all announced initiatives surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\nUniversal Air Travel Plan (UATP), an airline-owned payment network accepted by thousands of merchants for air, rail, hotel, and travel agencies, recently began accepting Bitcoin in payment for travel.\n\nPayPal and Apple began accepting Bitcoin in 2015.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the reviews remain mixed, but lawmakers seemed to err on the side of caution in 2015. For example, the state of New York enacted legislation to open up the crypto-currency market for Bitcoin banking licensure. Unfortunately, the bill attached draconian requirements, including a separate license for each exchange service offered and complicated registration requirements. These rules forced many cryptocurrency exchange entrepreneurs to suspended business in the state or to flee to other states. By some estimates, the state’s rather modest $5,000 registration fee could easily be offset by more than $100,000 in requisite legal fees, depending on the size and scope of the firm.2\n\nThe international picture regarding Bitcoin regulation remained mixed in 2015:\n\nRussia is considering a total ban on Bitcoin.\n\nChina and Brazil have defined rules on how crypto-currency, particularly Bitcoin, shall be treated. At the same time, Bitcoin mining has become a growth industry in China.\n\nAustralia is moving toward adopting Bitcoin as a currency.\n\nOther countries appear to be in a wait-and-see mode.\n\nMany countries, including the US, have declared Bitcoin taxable, while still not declaring it a currency per se.\n\nBased on strong entrepreneurial movements fueled by aggressive venture capitalists, some speculate that the G7 nations will tend to eventually pave the regulatory way for digital crypto-currencies. If not, others speculate that developing nations in Africa, Latin America, and Asia will benefit, if the more developed nations exact too much restriction. Clearly, many of the world’s regulatory bodies still remain in deliberation with regard to managing crypto-currency.3\n\nIs Bitcoin Under Stress?\n\nLeading Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn sold all of his Bitcoins in early 2016. In what has become a rift with fellow developers, he elected to move on, joining R3, a startup that exploits blockchain technology for business transactions. As he left, Hearn expressed serious concern over Bitcoin’s long-term lack of efficiency and utility.4\n\nMonopoly?\n\nLike Bitcoin itself, the technology underlying it remains the subject of vigorous debate. The blockchain that chronicles all bitcoin transactions remains the heart of Bitcoin technology. A decentralized process known as mining establishes the veracity of all new blockchain links. This process uses a rigorous mathematical hash derived by competing miners, who use sophisticated computers to verify the content of the new links before they are formally added to the blockchain.5\n\nThe ability to mine the blockchain is subject to inequities that favor monopolistic activities. Theoretically, the belief is that selfish miners will tend to band together in collusion and, through sheer force, will overtake the conventional miners who would need to join the selfish miner camp to survive. In such a scenario, monopolistic control is more likely. It was already the case that one mining node approached 51 percent of Bitcoin mining activity, which was prevented as a number of ethically minded miners left the group to get it back to size and prevent a monopolistic situation from occurring.6\n\nWhile increasingly more powerful, some mining equipment can now be purchased via Walmart. Most mining equipment, however, falls into the corporate investment category for its sophistication. As Hearn alleged, miners in China have invested heavily in Bitcoin mining capability and now have the computational horsepower to monopolize Bitcoin.4\n\nTransaction Rate\n\nDuring 2015, Hearn led an initiative to change the size of the block as a way to hasten the verification process. The current block is limited to 1 Mbyte, allowing some rather anemic 300,000 transactions per day. In contrast, Pay Pal handles some 10 million transactions per day, while Visa handles 20,000 transactions per second. Hearn developed Bitcoin XT software as a way to increase block size and thus hasten processing speed to 24 transactions per second. By late 2015, 13 percent of the mining nodes had adopted Bitcoin XT. Once Bitcoin XT processes 75 percent of the links, the block size increases to 8 Mbytes and doubles every two years thereafter. Old-style miners would be pushed aside. This sparked fears that the validation process could grind to a halt, blocks would take far longer to resolve, the maximum bitcoin production could be reached way ahead of schedule, and the decrease in nodes could lead to more traditional and undesirable centrality of control. Hearn’s critics warned of a failed initiative should enough bitcoin miners switch to Bitcoin XT.7 This disruptive fork, which represents a digression from the initial Bitcoin architecture, could wind up in a compromise that other developers have introduced—a more gradual approach known as Bitcoin Classic.4\n\nFigure 1. Potential range of blockchain utility.\n\nQuasi Anonymous\n\nOther critics note that the blockchain is, at best, semi-anonymous, in that the blockchain itself might be used mathematically to reveal the identity of the parties in any transaction. Others have established that, without specific protection, it is possible to link user pseudonyms to the IP address where the transaction is generated for purposes of tracking parties involved in bitcoin transactions.8\n\nEnd of the Line\n\nIn 2014, a successful miner earned 25 new bitcoins for each new 1-Mbyte block, averaging some 350 transactions successfully added to the blockchain. As the blockchain grows over time, the hashing algorithm, calibrated for 10-minute intervals from transaction time to the establishment of a new verified block, becomes more difficult. Finally, by design, bitcoin rewards diminish to zero after some 21 million bitcoins have been minted. This gives rise to the question of incentives to maintain the blockchain after the maximum number of bitcoins is attained, given that no new bitcoins will be minted. Ultimately, it could depend on the use of some form of transaction fees.9 Depending on how they’re negotiated, such fees could suggest eventual centralization of this currently decentralized crypto-currency.\n\nWhere Might It All Lead?\n\nBitcoin as a crypto-currency clearly has both challengers and challenges. To truly appreciate the contribution of Bitcoin technology, however, perhaps one need look beyond the transactions that underlie crypto-currency. The blockchain, a means of accurately tracking any form of transaction, has significant value beyond the realm of monetary transfer. Some venture-backed firms are already working with transactions surrounding derivatives, bonds, loans, and contracts.10 Other startups are experimenting with many other types of transaction. In fact, blockchain utility can be traced to one or more startup firms working in each of the taxonomical elements shown in Figure 1. The figure defines four arbitrary areas of general endeavor with subdivisions within each.\n\nSome have gone so far as to note that the Internet of Things (IoT)—or, perhaps better, the Internet of Anything (IoA)—would benefit the most from applied transaction blockchains. Comprising all manner of hardwarebased sensors and their related actuators, the IoA was estimated to connect to some 9.8 billion devices in 2013, already exceeding the number of people residing on the planet (see Figure 2). It is envisioned that it will have connected 50 billion sensors by 2015. The IoA extends from wearable technology to vehicles, to homes, to public resources such as cities, roads, and shared infrastructure, to commerce, and even to broader industrial endeavors.11\n\nAs sensors continue to multiply, the criticality of their interaction becomes increasingly important to preserve safety and security. Consider two autonomous vehicles approaching one another. It would be desirable to have a record of the transactions between these vehicles as they safely pass one another or one stops to allow the other to pass. In another instance, the blockchain could also build a secure relationship between a car owner’s key fob, the dealership, and the car itself. IBM is experimenting with a system called Adept that permits exchange among billions of interconnected devices using a blockchain approach.12\n\nUnfortunately, new technology brings new challenges, and the adapted blockchain is a case in point. It is likely that services might be tracked by some specialized variations of the blockchain. An incentive for maintaining a decentralized pool of miners, however, represents a challenge. Miners would still need to be rewarded for their efforts, likely in some form of crypto-currency, even if the blockchain is not oriented around crypto-currency per se.13 Once again, the advantages of decentralization must be weighed against monopolistic behaviors in terms of efficiency and fairness.\n\nFinally, the blockchain is not immune from malicious attack. Game-theoretic modeling establishes when mining pools are incentivized to attack other mining pools, thus significantly disrupting both shortand longterm equilibrium among miners.14 Before blockchains become a commonplace replacement for traditional transaction databases, strict standards, including acceptable behavioral guidelines, must be laid out. This more neatly fits a successful open source model in which infrastructure is served by a structured solution that has been thought through.\n\nFigure 2.

At the time, primary sponsor Sen. Ann Rivers said that the measure was intended to boost financial transparency to the state’s cannabis sector as part of an effort to “help move it out of the shadows”.\n\nThe move sparked headlines and at least one petition aimed at stopping the measure in its tracks. Yet before the bill can become law, it has to move through the legislature, setting the stage for events like Wednesday’s hearing before the Washington Senate Commerce, Labor & Sports Committee.\n\nThe hearing drew a mixture of support and opposition for the bill, during which lawmakers asked a number of questions about the tech. Also appearing were representatives for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, which has called for businesses in the state to shift toward electronic payments.\n\nAmong those speaking against the measure were representatives from Posabit, a bitcoin point-of-sale developer based in Seattle.\n\nIn remarks, co-founder and CEO Ryan Hamlin spoke about the concerns among cannabis business owners who face the risk of robbery – a trend in the US affecting marijuana shops that rely on cash because they’re effectively locked out of the banking system owing to the nature of their business.\n\nHamlin told committee members:\n\n""Anyone can Google about the robberies that are happening. Cash in this environment is a problem.""\n\nHamlin reiterated the focus on store owner safety, arguing that ""we are removing cash from the system which is helping our customers become safer"".\n\nYet another payments company servicing marijuana firms in the industry expressed strong support for the bill. PayQwick offers payment services to businesses and consumers in the space, as well as cash handling services.\n\nKenneth Burke, the firm’s CEO, invoked the newly-minted Trump administration and the as-yet-unconfirmed US Attorney General nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions in his statements. Sessions, who according to Politico has called marijuana legal reform a ""tragic mistake"", is likely to enforce the federal ban on marijuana more decidedly than the Obama administration.\n\n""I think allowing bitcoin in consumer transactions in Washington is just going to invite extra scrutiny from Sessions and the federal government,"" Burke told the panel.\n\nOn traceability\n\nOne point of contention during the hearings was the question of whether bitcoin transactions are traceable.\n\nAmong those was Burke, who argued that ""with bitcoin, there’s just no traceability to it"".\n\nBut on the contrary, every bitcoin transaction is published to the public blockchain. Instead of being attached to a particular identity though, bitcoins are attributed to pseudonymous addresses. Actual identification of a user happens outside of the bitcoin system itself, as in the case of an exchange conducting a know-your-customer process.\n\nJoseph Cutler, a partner for the law firm Perkins Coie who is based in the Seattle area, disputed the notion that bitcoin transactions can’t be traced.\n\n“This idea that it’s untraceable is simply false. People also say bitcoin is anonymous,” he told the panel. “This is also false. We like to call it pseudonymous, which is better than cash.”\n\nCutler went on to invoke once again the problematic use of cash in cannabis businesses.\n\n“In the marijuana space, for example, cash is king,” he said, adding:\n\n“And there is no traceability to the customers for the cash they’re using in those stores.”\n\nA video of the hearing can be found below:\n\nImage via TVW\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The two companies have accurately assessed the rising demand for mining equipment in China, especially from existing non-mining companies such as electricity providers that are actively engaging in the mining industry.\n\nIn late 2016, Bitcoin angel investor and miner Chandler Guo stated that Chinese electricity companies are purchasing mining equipment from local miners to mine Bitcoin. It is an efficient method of utilizing surplus energy as a for-profit operation.\n\n“Today, the energy companies are jumping on the Bitcoin mining business. Before that, we miners bought electricity from them, the energy companies, to mine Bitcoin. Today, the seller who is selling electricity to us, they are mining Bitcoin by themselves. Energy companies don’t sell electricity to us, they buy mining equipment from us. A lot of energy companies are becoming Bitcoin miners. Even small energy companies can buy at least 1 to 2 Petahashes,” said Guo."", ""Another in our occasional series of gobsmacked reports from the land of Bolivarian socialism--Venezuela, the place that sensible economics went to die. The latest is that the authorities there have arrested some bitcoin miners. The charge is apparently that the miners were stealing electricity. But the only reason that people are doing bitcoin mining there, in that land of Bolivarian plenty, is because economic idiocy has made electricity, to all intents and purposes, free. And electricity is the major cost in bitcoin mining.\n\nSo, think it through, we've an energy hungry process, the government makes energy really cheap, people do the process, government arrests them for stealing the cheap energy.\n\nIf it weren't that these fools are dragging an entire nation down into abject penury this would be funny. Certainly not even Dario Fo could have made this sort of absurdity believable in a story. But Maduro and his chums are doing it for real. Sigh.\n\nAnd apologies, but they really are:\n\nRecently, the law enforcement agencies in Venezuela cracked down on Bitcoin miners. The arrests were announced by the director of Cuerpo de Investigaciones Cientificas, Penales y Criminalisticas (CICPC) — the country’s largest police agency. Among the arrested were three men and a woman, in the city of Charallave, Miranda state. These people were accused of committing cyber fraud and power theft.\n\nPower theft, Uhuhn.\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining isn’t illegal in Venezuela, Reason writes that 31-year-old miner Joel Padrón was arrested and jailed for more than three months at the beginning of 2016 on charges of electricity theft.\n\nWell, OK, perhaps it's true that running 300 mining units (what is alleged) does have an effect upon the electricity supply to others:\n\nIn 2016, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro briefly enforced a strict electricity rationing program in 2016 as a severe drought diminished its ability to produce hydroelectric power.\n\nAnd that's where the abject stupidity comes in. For every mere fool knows that if you have to ration something then rationing by price is the best way to do this. Thus only those things which produce more than the value of the scarce resource being consumed get done. Is this what Venezuela is doing? No, of course not, it's not what they're doing at all:\n\nThat’s our old friend of freezing prices again. As when they froze the price of toilet paper and the country ran out of it. And at least according to this the price of electricity is, at the black market (and thus real) exchange rate something like $0.2 or $0.1 cents per kilwatt hour. That’s not two or one cents US, that’s one tenth of one US cent. Or some one hundredth of the price in California, or one two hundredth of that in Germany (rough estimates only). All of which sounds great for the people but of course it isn’t. Because price fixing kills things.\n\nSo that really is, I am not joking above, what Bolivarian socialism is doing. It has made electricity artificially cheap at which point people do things which thrive on cheap electricity. So then they come along and arrest the people doing what they've just encouraged them to do by making electricity cheap.\n\nNo, this is beyond Fo--it's at the outer edges of Vaslav Havel, possibly Tom Stoppard but even the absurdists haven't tried to make us believe people would do this sort of thing.\n\nAnd just for any who still think that Venezuela has something that even approximates to an economic policy, a reminder. Price systems have a purpose. They balance supply and demand--they are not just inventions of those who would deprive the workers of their rightful. And any economy which doesn't use the price system to allocate resources will fail, just as the Bolivarian economy there in Venezuela is failing. We can have socialism, sure we can, we can have social democracy, we can have capitalism even, but what we can't have is the duo of an economy that functions and the absence of markets and prices."", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Bitcoin Unlimited, one of the Bitcoin Core software forks introduced in late 2015, garnered much attention in recent months. The project gained hash power support from several new Bitcoin mining pools, including ViaBTC, GBMiners and BTC.TOP, while node adoption appears to be on the rise as well.\n\n\n\nThe central idea behind Bitcoin Unlimited — specified in “Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal 001” (BUIP001) — is to hand control of Bitcoin’s block size limit to users and miners. Or perhaps, more accurately, to make this control more explicit and easier to handle.\n\nHowever, this control does come at the expense of Bitcoin’s strong and automated consensus mechanism. With BUIP001, there is a number of scenarios in which different users end up on different chains — either temporarily or permanently.\n\nHere’s a (probably incomplete) overview.\n\n(Note: If you are not sure how Bitcoin Unlimited works, do make sure to first read “A Closer Look at Bitcoin Unlimited’s Configurable Block Size Proposal.”)\n\nIf Not Everyone Switches to Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nThe first example is also the most obvious one.\n\nIt currently seems very unlikely that different Bitcoin implementations — like Bitcoin Core, Libbitcoin, BTCD or Bcoin — will adopt BUIP001, or something compatible. This is especially true because the Bitcoin Unlimited team has not submitted BUIP001 to the cross-implementation Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process; most implementations therefore don’t even have the proposal under consideration.\n\nBut if not all significant Bitcoin implementations adopt BUIP001 or a compatible solution, the blockchain cannot converge in the way Bitcoin Unlimited proponents envisage. Instead, if a majority of miners (by hash power) increases Maximum Generation Size (MG) and Excessive Block Size (EB) to produce blocks bigger than one megabyte, Bitcoin would split into two incompatible networks and currencies, not unlike Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nHowever, because this split would not be coordinated or include safety precautions, the consequences could be much worse than the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nOne megabyte users would experience inconveniences, and even more so if their hash power initially represents a smaller minority. This would include (much) slower block confirmations, perhaps even to the point where their chain becomes almost unusable (at least temporarily). Additionally, they are at risk of replay attacks if they want to use the “Bitcoin Unlimited chain” as well.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited users would suffer similar inconveniences, though their initial block confirmations wouldn’t be as slow, as they’d have support from the hash-power majority.\n\nTo counter that, however, Bitcoin Unlimited users would be unsure as to whether “their” chain would continue to exist at all. If the one megabyte chain should ever overtake the “Bitcoin Unlimited chain” in length (really: total proof of work), Bitcoin Unlimited nodes would automatically switch back to the one megabyte chain. Accordingly, they would dispose of (“orphan”) the entire “Bitcoin Unlimited chain” since the split, even if that chain is thousands of blocks deep. All “their” transactions would be forgotten, perhaps costing lots of people lots of money.\n\nIf a group of hardcore one-megabyte supporters and speculators can make this scenario seem even slightly plausible, self-fulfilling prophecy dynamics can pose an existential threat to the “Bitcoin Unlimited chain”: no one wants to hold value on the chain that may be discarded.\n\nIf Everyone Does Switch to Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nBut let’s assume the switch to BUIP001 goes smoothly. All significant Bitcoin implementations adopt the new configurable options, and all users and miners update their software accordingly.\n\nOnce again — even in this scenario — there is no technical reason that all users will converge on a single chain in a meaningful way. Different users can configure their nodes to remain out of consensus for the rest of their lives.\n\nAs a simple example, a minority of miners can configure both MG and EB to one megabyte, while they set Excessive Acceptance Depth (AD) to 10,000,000. In other words, these nodes will mimic the current one-megabyte block size limit for about two centuries — regardless of what the rest of the network does.\n\nMeanwhile, a majority of miners can set MG and EB to create and accept blocks up to two megabytes.\n\nNow, as soon as one miner mines a two-megabyte block, the majority of miners will build on this block and extend this chain. The minority of miners, however, ignores this chain practically forever: exactly as described in the previous section of this article.\n\nAnd it would include the same risks as previously described as well. If the one-megabyte chain ever overtakes the two-megabyte chain in length, the two-megabyte chain is completely discarded. Even after thousands of blocks.\n\nIf Everyone Limits AD to Four Confirmations\n\nBitcoin Unlimited users can have a stronger degree of convergence on a single chain by technical means, if they keep their AD setting relatively low. The default setting in Bitcoin Unlimited is four: An excessive block requires four blocks mined on top of it to be considered valid.\n\nBut this presents problems as well.\n\nThe first problem is that even with this low default, any transaction with less than five confirmations is much less secure than it is now. Say a transaction shows three confirmations in a user’s wallet. That user has no way of knowing whether an alternative blockchain is being mined with a competing (double-spent) transaction, that already has four confirmations. This could happen at any time.\n\nIf that alternative chain reaches its fifth confirmation first, the user’s chain is discarded, and his incoming transaction lost — even though it had three confirmations.\n\nOf course, “orphaned blocks” do already exist, and users that require more security should wait for more confirmations.\n\nBut barring exotic and expensive types of malicious attacks, three orphaned blocks can currently really only result from freak coincidence. Different groups of miners must coincidentally find three blocks at almost exactly the same time, three separate and subsequent coincidences, in order for the network to experience that many orphans.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, throws a new factor into the mix, adding a reason for the network to experience three orphaned blocks. Miners not only race to extend the longest valid chain, but also vote on protocol rules between chains. This process would also be visible and quite predictable for attackers, and therefore easily exploitable.\n\nThe second problem is that having to keep AD at the default of four confirmations for security reasons essentially defeats the purpose of BUIP001. While Bitcoin Unlimited is supposed to hand control of the block size limit over to both users and (all) miners, low AD levels ensure that even the slightest majority of miners can always overrule local block size settings by simply mining a series of bigger blocks. This makes MG and EB meaningless for everyone else: “placebo controls.”\n\nIndeed, AD proposes an odd choice: Either nodes and miners set a high AD for relative autonomy, but risk splitting the network with potentially harmful consequences; or these nodes and miners pick a low AD to improve the level of convergence — but only because they effectively give up control to a majority of miners. (And if the intention is to give up control to a majority of miners, there are more straightforward solutions available.)\n\nUnder Adversarial Conditions\n\nThings get worse under adversarial conditions.\n\nIf not everyone wants what’s best for Bitcoin, and instead some entities — for whatever reason — would rather see Bitcoin fail, the security assumptions of BUIP001 degrade further. And the more funds an adversary has at its disposal to cause turmoil, the worse Bitcoin Unlimited’s convergence mechanism would perform.\n\nFirst off, node signaling is trivially spoofed. Anyone with the resources to spin up “fake” (economically irrelevant) nodes could pretend that there is widespread user support for a certain block size limit level, while in reality there is not. If miners go by these signals, they may fork the chain with less user support than expected.\n\nAdditionally, a malicious miner can often split the network. Such a miner could monitor the EB levels signaled by other miners (which is not as easily spoofed), and intentionally mine a block that falls right in between what these miners will accept. If some 50 percent of hash power accepts blocks up to two megabytes, and the other 50 percent supports bigger blocks, a 2.01 megabyte block would be ignored by the first 50 percent, and accepted by the other 50 percent.\n\nAssuming the default AD of four is maintained, the chain could split for more than an hour. As explained in the previous section, the Bitcoin network(s) would be very unreliable during this period, as the chain on either side of the split may be discarded.\n\nAn adversary controlling only 0.7 percent of global hash power could cause this level of turmoil about once every day. And unless the overwhelming majority of miners already agree on their EB anyways, that sweet spot to abuse the network should always exist.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of this attack, half of all miners would reach their AD thresholds, opening their “sticky gates."" This may allow for a second wave of attacks. Now, the malicious miner has about 24 hours to mine an even larger block, that — ironically — only the initially smaller-block side of the chain would accept because their sticky gates are open, and the initially larger-block side of the chain would reject. This would create another split.\n\nLast, if and when this new ""sticky gate chain"" reaches the AD thresholds of the remaining nodes, all sticky gates are open, and there is no block size limit at all. An adversary can now mine blocks that are so big they may fragment the chain as not all nodes can keep up — perhaps due to bandwidth constraints, latency or other machine limits.\n\nEmergent Consensus\n\nWhile Bitcoin Unlimited arguably offers more personal autonomy to users, it does not ensure technical blockchain convergence. But this is not new. To some extent, it is even touched on in Bitcoin Unlimited’s FAQ.\n\nYet, Bitcoin Unlimited proponents do expect users to converge on a single blockchain. This is explained by what is perhaps best considered Bitcoin Unlimited’s underlying philosophy: “Emergent Consensus.”\n\nRather than a purely technical mechanism, Emergent Consensus is a conviction that all participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have a strong enough (economic) incentive to find consensus on a single blockchain, even if their software does not do this automatically.\n\nThe next article will take a closer look at this Emergent Consensus philosophy.\n\nAuthor’s note: This article is not a complete overview of all the problems that could result from BUIP001. Most importantly, it ignores trade-offs and weaknesses that derive from an oversized (or floating) block size limit itself, like node centralization, miner centralization, or fee economics, to instead focus on (a lack of) blockchain convergence.\n\n“Jonny1000” contributed to this article.', 'The Bitcoin market today is getting more stable than before. Could it help the three United States companies presently seeking to run Bitcoin Exchange and Traded Funds (ETF) get approved?\n\nThe Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF will see a final decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission by March 11 while SolidX expects its decision on March 17. A firm run by technology entrepreneur Barry Silbert recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list its Bitcoin Investment Trust on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThough there has been a growing view that the listing of a Bitcoin ETF would have “a profoundly positive effect on Bitcoin price” the chances of any one of them being approved is dicey.\n\nThere are several good sides to having an ETF. It would create an ease of use to the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling instant transfer between fiat and Bitcoin through a system that is generally known to many thus improving the level of acceptance. It could be seen as a form of legitimacy for Bitcoin and probably draw those who are already into stocks into the digital currency.\n\nFear, uncertainty and doubt\n\nThe fear of losing their coins, in the event of a hack or other technical mishap, could also be making the idea of an ETF attractive to some since there would be some form of assurance of safety unlike with exchanges.\n\nAccording to analyst Needham & Company, any expected positive effect of an ETF will not only come because of the resulting asset inflow but also for the “concurrent shifts in perception and regulatory risk.” It also projects in its Bitcoin ETF in 2017. A Look at Potential Impact and Probability that a Bitcoin ETF could bring as much as $300 mln in assets in the first week alone.\n\nHowever, on the probability of a Bitcoin ETF being approved in 2017, Needham & Company’s report states that it is very low giving it a sub-25 percent chance of approval. It cites the “confluence of fear, uncertainty and doubt coupled with basic incentives at the SEC” as factors that could work against the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF approval, for instance.\n\nFake volume claims\n\nThese elements have been noticed in the market prior to the onsite inspection conducted by China’s top bank on major Bitcoin exchanges in the country accounting for over 90 percent of global trading transactions. Fake volume claims were also unraveled.\n\nThough they may constitute a concern to the SEC which is saddled with preventing investment options that may create some form of instability in the financial sector, things have changed after the PBoC’s monitoring started. The price of Bitcoin has been relatively stable in the past weeks and the level of volume trade in China has dropped drastically to what seems to be a realistic point. To an extent, the Chinese players have been stripped of their monopoly on Bitcoin trading in many years.\n\nData from Bitcoinity show that transactions in the US dollar have risen beyond the 50 percent average of the market, while those in yuan have dropped below - a massive low from its usual over 90 percent grip. It is not immediately clear yet to what extent the Chinese New Year celebration is going to contribute to this development.\n\nIf this is sustained in addition to other considerations there is a likelihood that this point could play a role in SEC’s decision as the ETFs look forward to launching into a large segment of the public that trusts more in such a system that is relatively close to a Wall Street-style.']"
01/28/2017,"['Romantik Seehotel JäegerwirtJäegerwirt\n\nThe Romantik Seehotel Jäegerwirt, Jäegerwirt, a luxury hotel in Austria, has gone public with the news that it was recently the victim of an attack during which hackers took control of the electronic key card system that prevented guests from being able to enter or leave their rooms.\n\nIn addition to the electronic key system, those responsilble also had complete control over the general computer system - meaning that the reservation and cash desk systems were also out of commission. The hotel\'s management explained that this is the third time the hotel has been hit with such an attack, but this is the first time they had managed to take down the key card system.\n\nIn order to keep things running, the hotel yielded to the demands and paid the ransom of €1,500 (£1,275/$1,600) in Bbitcoin. After making payment, the system was completely restored allowing the hotel staff to gain access to the system and guests to enter and exit their rooms. While the payment allowed business to run like usual, those causing the problem left a back door to the system and attempted a fourth attack later, which was thwarted because security standards had been improved and critical networks had been separated.\n\nThe hotel has gone public to warn others about the dangers of cyber crime, Managing Director Christoph Brandstaetter said:\n\n""The house was totally booked with 180 guests, we had no other choice. Neither police nor insurance help you in this case."" ""The restoration of our system after the first attack in summer has cost us several thousand Euros. We did not get any money from the insurance so far because none of those to blame could be found."" ""Every euro that is paid to blackmailers hurts us. We know that other colleagues have been attacked, who have done similarly.""\n\nAfter the hack, the hotel plans on removing the electronic door locks from guest rooms entirely and is going back to a traditional lock and key system like when the hotel first opened nearly 111 years ago.\n\nSource: The Local | Image: Seehotel Jägerwirt', 'Jameson Lopp is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of and founder of .\n\nIn this guest review, Lopp puts the recently released Ledger Blue hardware cryptocurrency wallet through its paces to see if its high price is matched by its utility.\n\nName: Ledger Blue\n\nWhat it is: A handheld cryptocurrency hardware wallet device architected around a secure element, featuring a touchscreen and USB/NFC/BLE connectivity for PC and smartphone compatibility. It runs multiple apps such as bitcoin, ethereum, FIDO U2F, SSH, and GPG, and can be used with a number of digital currencies including bitcoin, dash, Zcash, litecoin and dogecoin.\n\nWho’s behind it: Ledger, a French startup that builds personal security devices for end users, hardware security modules for servers, and hardware oracles for the IoT.\n\nCost: €229 + shipping\n\nDate launched: December 2016\n\nSummary: The Ledger Blue is the next step in the evolution of cryptocurrency hardware wallets. It combines high-end security with ease of use. The biggest downside for early adopters is that the full capabilities of the device are not yet available.\n\nWhere to buy: Directly from Ledger\n\n\n\nThe basics\n\nAt €229, the Ledger Blue is the most expensive bitcoin hardware security device on the market. The last time I paid this much for a hardware wallet ($200 for a Case Wallet), I was mostly disappointed. Let’s dig into the details to see if the Blue’s utility matches its price.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe Blue comes with an impressive array of cryptographic and security features that you can read about in their announcement article and on the product page itself. Since most of them are honestly outside the range of my expertise to test, I won’t be performing a hardware teardown or deep technical dive because it wouldn’t be particularly informative.\n\nI’m confident in the security functionality offered by Ledger and will instead focus on user experience for this review.\n\nWhen I received my Blue, it arrived well packaged with tamper-evident tape along all edges.\n\nUpon opening the shrink-wrapped box, you’ll find a note that mentions that the device doesn’t actually need tamper-evident seals.\n\nTurning on the device for the first time and configuring it was a breeze.\n\nI generated my backup seed phrase, wrote it down, confirmed that I had it written down, and the Blue was ready to use!\n\nUser experience\n\nInside the box, a note directs you to Ledger\'s site for configuration instructions. Ledger has also released a series of tutorial videos that make it very straightforward to learn how to set up and use the device.\n\nWhile I personally did not find the need to make use of these resources, I\'m sure plenty of users will appreciate them.\n\nI decided to use my Blue to test BitGo’s Ledger integration that we were developing and have just released. You can read more about how to use the Ledger Blue or Ledger Nano S with BitGo in this guide.\n\nThe Blue works well with BitGo’s web client, though there is one outstanding issue that Ledger needs to fix with their bitcoin app in order to better support P2SH transactions.\n\nAt the moment, the transaction details are not displayed on the device, which only displays \'P2SH\'. Ledger said it expects to release a new app to fix this in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nPros\n\nThe Ledger Blue is a lightweight device, the size of a small smartphone. At a mere 90g, it’s only half the heft of my Nexus 6.\n\nWith the Blue, there is almost no risk to the user in case of device theft or loss. An attacker will find the device rendered unusable after three failed login attempts, while a lost device can simply be replaced and a new one reinitialized from the 24-word seed phrase.\n\nThe large touchscreen that supports a QWERTY keyboard for input is superior to the Ledger Nano S’s two buttons, which can be a pain to click many times while navigating around the device.\n\nIncidentally, if you’re setting up a Ledger hardware device that doesn’t have a screen, such as the HW.1 or Nano, you should go through the hassle of setting up a secure computer to generate the seed – this is unnecessary with the Nano S and Ledger Blue.\n\nAlong a similar vein, Ledger devices without screens could potentially be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if used with a compromised computer and thus require an additional layer of security that requires the user to either pair the device with a smartphone or enter a code from a separate security card – an added inconvenience.\n\nLedger says the Blue has a “strong and durable casing, anti-scratch glass”, though I was slightly worried about screen scratches. Upon receiving my Ledger Blue, I threw it in my laptop satchel with lots of other loose electronics and took a weeklong trip from America to Europe. Thus far, the Blue’s screen hasn’t taken any visible damage.\n\nI tested the device\'s battery life by turning the auto-sleep settings to the maximum period and leaving the device powered on at the default 75% screen brightness, waking it every time the screen turned off. The device lasted for over three hours continuously, which ought to allow you to make quite a few transactions between charges.\n\nCons\n\nWhen writing down the 24-word seed phrase while initializing the device, it’s a slight annoyance (and potential cause of user error) that the entries on the provided card alternate left and right while on screen they are listed top to bottom.\n\nAlso, the default screen timeout is 30 seconds and you find yourself having to turn it back on every time you want to display the next page of recovery words. I was surprised when the confirmation at the end only checks two random words – I would feel more comfortable if it checked that I correctly wrote down all 24.\n\n\n\nAnother minor annoyance is that when pressing the power button to turn on the device, the screen flickers, which was slightly disconcerting at first because I thought something was wrong. In order to actually turn on the Blue, you must hold down the power button for three seconds – ignore the initial screen flash.\n\nYou can see on this YouTube video that Kenneth Bosak experienced the same flicker with his early batch Blue. Ledger tells me that this issue has since been fixed. My replacement did not have the flicker at first, though several weeks later I noticed that it also started experiencing the flicker upon pressing the power button.\n\nLedger has several nice wallets that are Chrome apps, though anyone who intends to use these should be aware that Google is discontinuing Chrome App support in 2018. Ledger says it\'s already working on a replacement platform – details of which are still not announced.\n\nIt also wasn’t clear to me how to set the \'plausible deniability\' alternate PIN that was touted in this blog post. Upon reaching out to Ledger, I was told that the Blue currently only supports the passphrase option using the same setup method as the Nano S which uses Python scripts. Unfortunately there is a bug in setting the alternate PIN, so right now it can be used only with a dynamic passphrase. They hope to fix this with a firmware update in Q1 2017.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the few areas where Ledger could improve the usability of the device, by enabling users to activate this feature either on the device or via a management app.\n\nI also wanted to test the Ledger Blue against a Mycelium wallet on my phone, but I wasn’t aware that I’d need an OTG adapter to do so. I was hoping I’d be able to add it wirelessly because the Blue has bluetooth support, but it appears that Mycelium hasn’t added it yet.\n\nThe Blue also has the capability to support NFC, but the current version of firmware doesn’t support it. After contacting Ledger about this feature, they responded that they are planning to release the NFC firmware update around the end of Q2 2017.\n\nSince I ended up with some downtime while waiting to receive a replacement Blue (see below for why I needed one), I bought this OTG adapter from Amazon and later successfully tested that the Blue works with Mycelium in this configuration.\n\nOn a related note, a quirk I noticed (that only developers will care about) is that when using the Ledger Blue on testnet, it still displays mainnet addresses on the device for confirmation.\n\nLedger told me the address format bug is expected – they need to build a bitcoin app compiled for testnet on the device to support it. The testnet bitcoin app is not yet offered in the Ledger app manager.\n\n\n\nI then decided to also test GreenAddress’ GreenBits mobile wallet to see how it fared. One thing I noticed off the bat was that there’s no point opening GreenBits without the Blue connected – it would just load my default wallet.\n\nInstead, upon connecting the Blue and entering my PIN, my Android phone would prompt me to “Login” with the Blue, at which point GreenBits would open my Ledger-based wallet.\n\n\n\nThe wallet worked fine for sending, though since GreenAddress is a 2-of-2 multisignature wallet, the P2SH display issue also presented itself as it did with BitGo’s wallet.\n\nI later realized that since there is no way to open a GreenBits Ledger wallet without the device present, this means that it’s not possible to receive transactions to your wallet without the Blue plugged in and unlocked. It turns out the solution to this to create a watch-only login while you have the Ledger Blue wallet open. You can set up a watch-only login by going to Settings => Info & Settings => Watch only login.\n\n\n\nAfter showcasing the Blue to some of the members at my local bitcoin meetup group, they asked me if I thought it was robust against everyday wear and tear. My Blue had already been subjected to rattling around inside my laptop bag for several weeks, so we decided to perform a simple drop test.\n\nI dropped it (face up) from a height of less than six inches onto a nearby table. Upon picking up the device and trying to turn it on, I noticed that the power button was missing and when I shook the Blue there was a rattle that was clearly the power button. My Blue was now perfectly secure – even I was unable to access its contents!\n\nI sent an email to Ledger support and they promptly responded, noting that it was a known build-quality issue and they were replacing the first batch of units. One week later, I had my replacement in hand, along with an assurance that the assembly process for the button had been modified so it doesn\'t get dislodged. I\'ve performed the same drop test upon the replacement several times and it\'s undamaged.\n\nUpon powering up my replacement unit, I immediately noticed that it emits an extremely high pitch whine reminiscent of some older TVs and CRT monitors. I found this to be odd given that the first Blue didn’t make any sounds. After contacting Ledger, they explained that this comes from an inductance that vibrates at a frequency audible by human ears and it’s a known issue that will be fixed with a firmware update.\n\nAs you can see, the Blue has a number of minor software and hardware issues that need to be worked out. I expect that they’ll all be rectified in time to be applied to the next batch produced.\n\nCompetitors\n\nThe closest competitors for this level of hardware security and usability are TREZOR, KeepKey, and Ledger’s own Nano S. They all seem to have good reviews and you probably can’t go wrong by using any of them.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile I ran into some quality issues, this is somewhat to be expected with a first run of completely new hardware. I see no reason for users to be concerned about hardware issues because I received excellent support and Ledger’s CEO, Eric Larchevêque, told me via email:\n\n""Ledger is highly committed to deliver the best customer support possible, and we assume 100% of our mistakes. Our policy is to refund or exchange any device with even the slightest issue.""\n\nThe Ledger Blue is by far the most user-friendly Ledger product I’ve used. In comparison to the HW.1, Nano, and Nano S, the Blue is more versatile and easy to use.\n\nIf you’re a technical user or early adopter of new technology then it should be fine for you to buy a Blue today. If you’re less technical and want a more battle-tested and full-featured product, you may want to wait a few months for the hardware and software kinks to be ironed out.\n\nReview images via the author', 'With the Chinese New Year almost upon us, now is an excellent time to spread the word about Bitcoin. Using the red envelope tradition, this is a perfect day to educate the Chinese people all over the world on what Bitcoin is and how it works. One Reddit user has taken up the idea of printed specific Bitcoin-themed red envelopes, all of which contain US$1 in BTC. An intriguing concept, to say the least.\n\nBitcoin Red Envelopes Can Make An Impact\n\nThe concept of using paper Bitcoin wallets is anything but new. Most of these wallets come with custom themes and designs, allowing people to use this powerful tool to give the gift of Bitcoin whenever the need arises. In some cases, paper wallets can also be used for educational purposes, particularly during special events.\n\nThe Chinese New Year, for example, is a century-old tradition in this regard. Chinese residents exchange red envelopes which contain money. Due to the growing digitization of financial services, digital red envelopes have become far more common these days. In a way, this presents an excellent scenario to promote the usage of cryptocurrency in general. Look at it as a mini-Bitcoin airdrop, if you will.\n\nOne Reddit user printed a few dozen of these Bitcoin-themed red envelopes for his co-workers. Quite an intriguing plan, as the red envelopes act as a functional paper wallet at the same time. All cards are loaded with a balance of US$1 worth of BTC. The bigger question is whether or not these co-workers will appreciate the gesture, or throw the wallets away after a while.\n\nAt the same time, it would be in the best interest of the recipients to hold on to this Bitcoin red envelope for quite some time. With the value going up nearly every year, there is no reason to “spend” it all right now.It is a nice gesture, after all, and events like these should be embraced to promote the viability of Bitcoin as a currency and asset.\n\nThe only downside to loading up these Bitcoin red envelopes with a US$1 balance is how a portion of the money will get lost in transaction fees. It is certainly possible to transfer the funds without paying a fee, yet those transfers can take days or even weeks to confirm. Roughly 10% of the entire transaction will be spent as a fee to get quick confirmations right now, which is a shame. Nevertheless, it is a great effort.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Although buying a property would be far out of reach for most current Bitcoin enthusiasts, early adopters are presented with a golden opportunity to cash out some of their investments.\n\nPeople who invested in Bitcoin at an opportune time now have a chance to reap some of the rewards. Although not every person buying Bitcoin has seen a successful return so far, things have definitely improved over the past 6 months. One Bitcoin user in California managed to buy a house with Bitcoin profits. In the end, this real estate transaction resulted in a US$1.3m profit. It goes to show it is never being too late to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nThere have been some correlations between Bitcoin and real estate in the past. Tenants involved in cryptocurrency would like nothing more than to pay their rent with Bitcoin. In some cases, people even buy a new property with Bitcoin, either directly or with the profits obtained from selling it. In most cases, users still have to convert Bitcoin to fiat currency, though, but that situation may come to change in the coming years.\n\nBuying Real Estate With Bitcoin Can Be Profitable\n\nOne California man used his Bitcoin earnings to buy a property not too long ago. Although the real estate agent was not too sure about using Bitcoin for this purchase, both parties came to an agreement in the end. At that time, the property was valued at US$4m, which is quite a significant sum to pay in Bitcoin. Then again, with the help of BitPay, it became somewhat easier to settle the transaction in Bitcoin directly.\n\nAt the time of the transaction being initiated, one Bitcoin was worth around US$750. However, once the deal was completed, one BTC shot up to US$1,000. This allowed the buyer to spend far less Bitcoin than originally needed, resulting in a US$1.3m “profit”. Quite a significant amount while getting what you want, yet that is the power of Bitcoin after all.\n\nFor the real estate agent, this did not result in a lower commission by any means. BitPay converted the funds to fiat currency, and the deal was still settled for US$4m. Thankfully for the buyer, he spent roughly 1,330 Bitcoin less on the purchase than was originally needed. A good outcome for all parties involved, and an excellent example of why Bitcoin can be such a powerful asset. Had the buyer relied on US Dollar for this entire purchase, there would have been no gains whatsoever.\n\nAlthough buying a property would be far out of reach for most current Bitcoin enthusiasts, early adopters are presented with a golden opportunity to cash out some of their investments. Then again, the vast majority of early adopters continues to hold on to their Bitcoin balance for now. It would not be entirely surprising to see more users convert a part of their holdings to real estate in the future.', 'Western Union shares have plunged following the Mexican president’s cancellation of a meeting with Donald Trump, underscoring the need for less nationally vulnerable payment systems like Bitcoin.\n\nFollowing an announcement by the American president that he intended to begin construction on a southern border wall immediately, funded by a 20 percent tariff on imports from Mexico, Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a planned meeting between the two. This conflict between the two nations, who are significant trading partners, caused economic shock waves including a sharp hit to popular remittance payment company Western Union.\n\nMarco Montes Neri, founder of cross-border payments company Saldo.mx believes that temporary market fluctuations based on presidential statements will lessen when the reality of government action must first go through the legislature:\n\n“I think talk is easy and it’s all that Trump has been doing, signing and saying things expecting markets to react. The truth is that the majority of those words will have to go through other filters so it is likely to start seeing markets not reacting as much as we start seeing congressional disapproval.”\n\nRobert Genito, CEO of Genitrust, which operates the peer-to-peer cash for crypto exchange Wall of Coins, quipped that while Trump intends to fund a border wall, “...he\'ll be funding Wall....of Coins.” He believes that no matter the short term effects long term political moves like these will have drastically reduced effects on the economy: ""I don\'t follow up with politics. All I care about is crypto: cryptocurrency will render politics--as we know it today--irrelevant.""\n\nBitcoin as a safe haven from a devaluing peso\n\nFollowing Peña Nieto’s decision to cancel a meeting with Trump because of the tariff announcement, the peso plunged over one percent against the dollar. Investment in currencies such as Bitcoin can help alleviate these ill-effects.\n\nNeri sees tech adoption to still be too immature at this point but points out the value of finding a non-governmental basis for economic development: “The reality is that adoption hasn\'t grown to a point where even regulators provide clarity or that companies can store value in any alternative currency. This really can show how important it is to think about cluster economies as a replacement to nation based economies that will always unjustly threaten some companies’ existence.”\n\nJose Rodriguez, head of payments and business development at Mexican cryptocurrency exchange Bitso, sees Bitcoin as a way for Mexicans to escape the devaluation effects of their national currency: “These measures, in case they are imposed, would make most of the population look for other options like Bitcoin and other crypto. Around the world Bitcoin, for example, has been a relief for economical and political problems, bank runs and bad policies. It\'s giving the people back the freedom to use and operate their money in the most convenient way.”\n\nCryptocurrency interest in Mexico surges\n\nAs a reaction to economic woes affecting Mexico, as well as potential future problems as a result of US policy, alternative currencies like Bitcoin go up, according to Rodriguez:\n\n“Mexicans are seeing Bitcoin as an option to preserve value. The Mexican peso has lost almost 50 percent of its value against the US dollar in the last two years. Each time Trump makes an announcement that could harm income and international trade with Mexico, the dollar and Bitcoin value goes up against the Mexican peso.”\n\nThis interest in preserving the value of their savings can be seen reflected in Bitcoin trading volume. Buying and selling of Bitcoin on peer-to-peer trading platform LocalBitcoins has seen dramatic increases since the United States election and Rodriguez has seen similar interest in Bitso powered by Trump-related fears:', 'Bitcoin trading volume is shifting to new exchanges, data shows.\n\nFollowing the decision by major China-based exchanges to end the practice of no-fee trading (at the request of the country\'s central bank), their lesser-known competitors have begun to claim the top spots in terms of transaction activity.\n\nIn the aftermath of the big exchanges adding trading fees – BTC100 and CHBTC – two China-based marketplaces, have climbed to the number one and number two spots in trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap figures and the companies\' websites.\n\nBTC100, which came out on top, enjoyed more than 36,000 BTC in volume over the last 24 hours, and CHBTC, the runner up, saw roughly 29,000 BTC of transaction activity in this time.\n\nThis screenshot shows the volume that these two exchanges commanded at the time:\n\nIn contrast, Poloniex, Bitfinex and BTCC, the three largest fee-charging exchanges when ranked by no-fee trading volume, saw more than 20,000 BTC, 9,000 BTC and 8,000 BTC, respectively, during that period.\n\n\'Big five\'\n\nWhile it might be too early to draw conclusions, it does seem that traders are beginning to consider alternatives to BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, exchanges formerly known as China\'s \'Big Three\' for their commanding volumes.\n\nSo far, we know the transaction volume on all three exchanges has continued to track lower over the last few sessions amid reports that traders are moving elsewhere.\n\nZhou Shouji, the operator of bitcoin hedge fund and incubator FinTech Blockchain Group, said he has already seen traders adopt CHBTC and rival firm BTCTrade to sidestep fees.\n\nBTCTrade saw volumes of 12,333 BTC in the past 24 hours, less than reported by CHBTC and BTC100, but higher than major international firms.\n\nAsked if traders were on the move, Shouji responded:\n\n""They already are. It\'s the \'Big five\' without fees right now.""\n\nStill, it remains uncertain just how many traders are switching, and unlikely that most of this volume represents \'real-world trading\' given how the \'Big Three\' responded to the news.\n\nShort-term trend\n\nSeeing as how both BTC100 and CHBTC have refrained from charging fees (even after BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin opted to implement such a policy), any market observer would question how much longer this disparity will continue.\n\nAnalysts predicted that the exchanges will probably draw the interest of the People\'s Bank of China, which would likely prompt these marketplaces to begin imposing trading fees of their own.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, described such a chain of events as inevitable. ""It\'s the price of success,"" he said.\n\nA similar view was articulated by Adamant Research director Tuur Demeester. As long as Chinese government authorities can locate the exchanges, they\'ll soon get a visit from regulators, he predicted.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, also forecast that Chinese exchanges which have been generating robust trading volume will likely adopt such fees.\n\n""All Chinese exchanges that want a viable business medium long-term will follow the lead of the \'Big Three\',"" he said, adding:\n\n""If they don\'t, then they are too small to matter, or are behaving recklessly and risk the wrath of the regulators.""\n\nPete Rizzo contributed reporting.\n\nMigrating birds image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'FILE PHOTO: An illustration photo of Bitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris\n\nJohannesburg - Promises of 30 percent returns and a new world order - it’s MMM reloaded with a new currency that will make it even harder for law enforcement to catch the kingpins and fight cyber-crime.\n\nNine months after the global pyramid scheme collapsed in South Africa and Nigeria, it announced earlier this month on its Facebook site that it would introduce a new cyber-currency linked to Bitcoin called the Mavro-BTC.\n\n“Due to the recent sharp price fluctuations of Bitcoin, MAVRO-BTC is being introduced in the System,” read a January 8 post on its Facebook page. Ten days later, in an updated post, its programmers announced they were introducing the New Model, and this was why members were battling to log on.\n\n“Now, you have a chance to have 30 percent growth of the Bitcoin amount, not the rand amount.\n\n“So, acquire MAVRO-BTC, which will be credited in your PO and will grow at a 30 percent monthly growth rate. In a month, not only 30 percent will be added (sic) to your initial amount, but it can increase itself (sic) due to the Bitcoin price growth.”\n\nBut it’s the use of Bitcoin, which has become the currency of choice for international cyber-criminals, that has investigators worried.\n\n“They’re using it because it is very difficult to trace. You try and follow the money trail and it disappears into cyberspace,” says Danny Myburgh, a cyber-crime investigator.\n\nThe scheme could further launder the money by moving it from one Bitcoin wallet to the next, he says.\n\nBitcoin, which is known as a cryptocurrency, is not regulated by any bank. Transactions take place between individuals without an intermediary.\n\n“You combine this with the Dark Web and it’s impossible to trace.”\n\nMyburgh, however, adds that while it might be preferred by international criminals, Bitcoins are traded by legitimate users and accepted by more and more retailers.\n\nFellow cyber-investigator Jacques van Heerden says he also noticed more criminals using Bitcoins, pointing out this was the currency used on the infamous drug website, The Silk Road.\n\n“Virtual currencies do make it slightly more complicated to follow the money, but there are processes you can follow,” said Brigadier Piet Pieterse, the section head of the Hawks cyber-crime unit.\n\nThe Hawks, he said, have had successes in catching cyber-criminals using virtual currencies.\n\nCollapsed\n\nBy watching what criminals overseas were up too, they could predict modus operandi in South Africa.\n\nMMM has its origins in Russia where it was launched in the 1990s by its founder Sergei Mavrodi. When it collapsed, it’s believed investors lost billions of dollars, though the exact amount is unclear.\n\nIn 2011 MMM Global was launched, and began targeting third world countries, in particular.\n\nMaya Fisher-French, a financial journalist who has studied MMM, says the scheme’s success lies in its ability to reinvent itself.\n\nThose who invest in the scheme are often aware that it is a pyramid scheme and that they can lose their money, she points out.\n\n“The more astute investors know that if they get in early they are able to generate good money, but it is important to keep the story going so more people join.”\n\nThis is why they are opposed to the media, resorting to writing fake news stories.\n\nMMM claims that its goal is not just to make money but to fight the unjust financial system.\n\nBut Fisher-French says: “The big concern is money laundering. Someone is making money. How do you know that those investor bank accounts you are given to make deposits in, that one of them does not belong to the individual behind the MMM system? It’s also a way for cash obtained through illegal activities to be ‘washed’ through the system.”\n\nThe Hawks are investigating MMM after the National Consumer Commission conducted its own investigation, and passed its findings on to the police.\n\nBut the problem, say police, is that participants in the MMM scheme are unwilling to come forward. “An enquiry was opened and efforts to get statements from affected investors drew a blank,” explains Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi.\n\n“The enquiry is yet to be closed and for the record no case docket was registered.”\n\nParticipants in the scheme have broken the law and are reluctant to approach the police even after they have lost money.\n\n“The only way you can tackle this is through international co-operation and the new Cyber Crimes and Cybersecurity Bill will help with this,” said Myburgh.\n\nThe Department of Justice published the Bill this week.\n\nMeanwhile, as MMM continues its relaunch, some of its members are demanding payment on the old currency the scheme used.\n\nMavros, the old currency accounts, were frozen and media and banking institutions were blamed.\n\n“Why (are) the remaining outstanding balances of R100s still not allocated? At first it was Old Mavros, now it’s New mavros (still frozen bcoz of remaining balances),” wrote Monica Nospho Nojiwa in a Facebook post a week ago.\n\nThis week an alleged “MMM number 1 guider” in Nigeria, Chuddy Ugorji, and his wife, Amaka, reportedly fled the country after he released new conditions for payment to about three million investors.\n\nINDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY', ""ShapeShift has recently announced that Michael Perklin has joined the team as Chief Information Security Officer.\n\nCointelegraph has caught up Michael Perklin and Erik Voorhees, CEO and Founder of ShapeShift, on their way from Satoshi Roundtable and asked to elaborate on some key security concerns that come with Blockchain technology.\n\nComing back stronger\n\nUnfortunately, hacks are still inevitable, and ShapeShift suffered a breach in April 2016. A significant sum from the company’s hot wallet was stolen but not a cent of customer funds was lost, stated Erik Voorhees, the company’s CEO the day following the breach.\n\nMichael Perklin was the one who conducted the digital investigation and authored the subsequent postmortem report. His successful investigation allowed ShapeShift to establish cause and secure the platform, enabling the instant exchange service to relaunch the following month. Voorhees says:\n\n“When ShapeShift was hacked in Spring of 2016, we worked with Michael to audit and investigate,” says Voorhees:\n\n“His expertise was matched only by our enthusiasm for working alongside him. Following the investigation, he decided to invest in ShapeShift and we are thrilled to bring him on board full-time as CISO.”\n\nPerklin has over a decade of experience in performing digital forensic examinations, cyber investigations and incident response postmortems. He is well-known in the Bitcoin and Blockchain sector for co-authoring the CryptoCurrency Security Standard which secured hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, Ether and other digital assets. Now he takes over ShapeShift’s information security architecture to ensure that all of the company’s services are operating with the best practices in Blockchain operational security.\n\nBlockchain can remove the ‘God mode’\n\nAs the digital currency movement continues to gain in scope and speed, this particular breach signified an important learning moment. It certainly allowed reconsidering models for improvement of security and preventing criminal acts making a significant contribution to the advancement of digital currency.\n\nSo, how can we secure operations and transactions over a Blockchain technology? Michael Perklin says:\n\n“The key security measures that must be implemented in any system that uses a Blockchain all revolve around the private keys for the accounts. A lot of work needs to be done to ensure these private keys are created securely, stored securely, accessed securely, used securely and by personnel who are thoroughly vetted. These points are spelled out in the CCSS, our Industry’s own security standard that is akin to the PCI standard for credit cards or HIPAA for patient information.”\n\nBlockchain is often considered as a game-changer having the potential to bring benefits to a variety of industries and achieve technology value outcomes that we couldn't achieve before. A number of sectors are taking advantages of Blockchain’s transparency, immutability, ability to cut out the middleman and security to develop effective solutions for sectors’ operations and processes.\n\nVoorhees believes that Blockchain technology can fit into general discussions about security in other industries. “Security in other industries is generally achieved by someone having “god mode” or the ability to reverse transactions, change databases,” he explains. “This is what any bank or government can do with their fiat currency. Unfortunately, though entirely predictable, they abuse this power and have institutionalized theft through inflation/debasement. Both the governments and banks are complicit in this crime. To solve this problem, Blockchains remove the “god mode” such that nobody has ultimate power.”\n\nIn his opinion, however, this can create other problems, which society and technology are just now starting to solve. Thus, removing the overseer would mean that the rule-making needs to exist on a code level, which is a challenge but one which the Blockchain industry is proving can be done.\n\n“Blockchains guarantee the integrity of data within an information system by preventing edits by other parties,” Perklin elaborates:\n\n“Every change is tracked in a fully auditable way that ensures every change to a system’s data is atomic. This is incredibly useful for auditors and compliance officers of any type as well as accountants and investigators. Those with access to data can no longer edit it without consequence.”\n\nBlockchain is still maturing\n\nMany banks, financial institutions and public authorities have been exploring the potential of Blockchains for a few years now. The majority of them playing around with Blockchain and taking advantage of some of its characteristics have been very cautious using this type of ecosystem, therefore we still haven't seen any working application.\n\nCertainly, the daunting scenarios when several exchange platforms have faced breaches and hacks might have taken at least one feather from Blockchain’s cap. Is it what is hindering a more confident adoption of the technology?\n\n“Banks and financial institutions, as well as government agencies, move slowly,” says Voorhees. “They are just now understanding the power of Blockchains, and are beginning to work with prototypes and proof of concepts. It will take them one to five years before any of this work starts to be seen publicly. Meanwhile, a thousand fast-moving Bitcoin startups are innovating and releasing products rapidly.”\n\nMichael Perklin argues that security is definitely one factor that can slow down the adoption of technology. However, in his opinion, it is more of a symptom than a cause.\n\nHe concludes:\n\n“The fact is, Blockchain technology is very new and is still maturing. The first databases did not have proper security either but now each of them has entire suites of security features to lock down their data. Blockchains are being better understood by developers and software engineers which will eventually lead to more products with embedded Blockchains but these things take time. It took 20 years before companies realized that databases could be used to improve their business. The same is happening now with Blockchains.”\n\nHow to make digital assets unstealable\n\nTo this day, Bitcoin Blockchain, despite being open source has been running steadily with no major security problems. However, there are several components in this chain, each and every one of them deserves a special attention. Holding cryptocurrency in a digital wallet is just the same as holding a cash in a physical wallet, therefore it implies the same security concerns.\n\nErik Voorhees says:\n\n“The biggest security concern is of course just the ability to make assets “unstealable” or as close as possible. Multisig technology and hardware wallets have helped immensely. We at ShapeShift are also trying to pioneer better security by simply not holding customer assets in the first place and as other companies find ways to replicate that principle the industry as a whole gets safer.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchanges or digital wallets are where major security breaches are most likely to happen. They manage large amounts of money on behalf of their customers so the risk here largely depends on the ability of a platform to securely hold and manage these large amounts.\n\nBesides, you are protecting your crypto fortune with a password and it has to be secure. There is no way to reverse the fraudulent transaction to recover your savings. Is it even possible to create the most-secure-password ever?\n\nPerhaps the better option is indeed to eliminate the need to have one. In this sense ShapeShift is a truly revolutionary platform in the Bitcoin space. As exchanging Blockchain tokens does not require creating an account, sign-up processes, emails and passwords."", 'Peer-to-peer lending services can benefit a lot from embracing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, this also attracts a lot of negative attention. Companies such as BTCJam have been getting a bad reputation because most people will never repay their loan over time. One Reddit user posted his results from using the service for quite some time, which goes to show the company is doing very little to force people tor pay their Bitcoin debt.\n\nBTCJam Is Not What You Think it Is\n\nOn paper, the service provided by companies such as BTCJam is an excellent way to use Bitcoin. Extending loans to people from all over the world is a great solution to promote Bitcoin usage. Unfortunately, this concept still needs a lot of work, as there are a lot of caveats to using services such as BTCJam right now. In most cases, a lot of the loans are never repaid in full.\n\nTo put this into perspective, a Reddit user posted his BTCJam results to date. Although the loans extended are very small, it goes to show there are virtually no repercussions for people who do not repay their loan in the first place. Even though BTCJam collects a lot of user information, they are not using these details to prosecute users who fail to repay the money to the rightful owner. Every loan is subject to a predetermined duration, yet users are capable of bypassing this limitation without suffering the consequences.\n\nIt is evident a lot of BTCJam users are losing money unless they are the borrowers for a specific amount of Bitcoin. In fact, some Reddit users argue the only people who benefit from using BTCJam are the ones who borrow money, and everyone else is losing money left, right, and center. BTCJam has been dealing with these issues for quite some time, yet it seems very little has changed over the past year or so.\n\nAlthough the concept of extending Bitcoin loans may sound appealing to a lot of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, it is a scenario that should be avoided for the time being. The better option is to hold the Bitcoin balance and just watch the price go up.There is no point in losing Bitcoin due to some scammers who cannot repay their loans and get away with it without facing any repercussions.\n\nPeer-to-peer lending is an intriguing market that continues to gain traction all over the world. Without middlemen in place, the costs for extending such a loan are brought down to a minimum. However, it requires a lot of trust between both parties to ensure the money is repaid in full. Unfortunately, even companies such as BTCJam, who act as a middleman, cannot guarantee that will be the case.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'A new malware that steals passwords and bitcoin from cryptocurrency wallets has been discovered by Cyren, an Internet security service provider, according to the company’s blog. The malware targets banking customers, and according to Cyren, is carrying out a massive campaign.\n\nThe emails inform the recipient of a deposit. The emails originate mainly from bots in the United States and Singapore, and are branded as being from various banks, including Emirates, NDB and DBS.\n\nThe malware is a keylogger that is carried as an attachment to emails for fake bank transfers. Once the victim opens the attachment, the malware can record everything the victim types on their keyboard and every place they place their mouse.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe malware queries the victim’s registry for passwords and other information related to various types of software. The subject line usually has financial details like an online wire transfer payment notification. The attachments have a SWIFT variation, making the emails look legitimate. SWIFT codes identify financial institutions for fund transfers.\n\nFiles that appear to be PDF are really executable files, according to Cyren. Once executed, the file deletes itself and opens a new one called “filename.vbs” in the Windows startup folder. When the computer boots, the software executes itself.\n\nThe malware collects passwords and other information, focusing on web browsing software and FTP software. It gathers usernames, passwords, cookies, browsing history and more.\n\nAlso read: malware turns servers into cryptocurrency mining engines\n\nCryptocurrencies Targeted\n\nThe malware looks for cryptocurrency wallets and targets a long list of currencies, including bitcoin, Namecoin, Litecoin, Anoncoin, BBQcoin, Bytecoin, Craftcoin, Devcoin, Digitalcoin, Fastcoin, Feathercoin, Florincoin, Freicoin, I0coin, Infinitecoin, Ixcoin, Junkcoin, Litecoin, Luckycoin, Megacoin, Mincoin, Phoenixcoin, Primecoin, Quarkcoin, Tagcoin, Terracoin, Worldcoin, Yacoin and Zetacoin.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
01/29/2017,"['A luxury hotel in Austria paid a bitcoin ransom to unlock the rooms of hundreds of guests who could not get in or get out, according to The Local. The hotel was unable to reprogram new electronic key cards until the hackers restored the system.\n\nThe hackers restored the system in exchange for 1,500 EUR worth of bitcoin.\n\nWhile the hotel has since replaced its computers and installed new security standards, it plans to install old-fashioned door locks with keys in the future to prevent such incidents.\n\nManagers at the Seehotel Jaegerwirt, a four-star hotel on the Alpine Turracher Hoehe Pass, wanted to publicize the incident to warn others of the possibility. The managers also want more done to prevent cybercrime before the problem worsens. The hotel has a modern IT system with electronic room key cards.\n\nThe management said it was the third time cybercriminals attacked the hotel. This was the first time they were able to immobilize the entire system.\n\nThe hotel was fully booked, with 180 guests, said Christoph Brandstaetter, hotel managing director. He said they had no choice but to pay the ransom. Neither the police nor insurance can help in such a situation, he said. There was no reimbursement from insurance because the responsible party could not be found.\n\nAlso read: U.S. government: Ransomware attacks have quadrupled this year\n\nNo Option But To Pay Ransom\n\nPaying the bitcoin was the least expensive and fastest way to resolve the problem.\n\nEvery Euro paid to blackmailers hurts, Brandstaetter said.

But they could not attack again since the computers had been replaced and new standards implemented. Some of the networks were decoupled.\n\nBrandstaetter said the hotel will install old-fashioned door locks with keys the next time it refurbishes rooms.\n\nFeatured image from Seehotel Jaegerwirt.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""Xapo was likely helped by its insistence that it doesn't take deposits.

Nonetheless, the legal footing granted here is important. It opens the door to other wallet businesses that want to use Switzerland as a home base, and could set an example for other countries to follow."", 'LONDON — Cryptocurrency bitcoin could be the new gold.\n\nGold has traditionally been seen as a ""safe haven"" asset by investors — when uncertainty and risk is high, gold seems like a safe bet. (For a good explanation of why people think this, read our interview with ""Made in Chelsea"" start-turned-gold miner Francis Boulle.)\n\nBitcoin, likewise, has attracted investor attention when uncertainty and risk is high. The currency spiked on Donald Trump\'s shock victory in the US election and bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain had a record month as a result.\n\n""I think the world is starting to realise that, just like gold is a good hedge, bitcoin is a great hedge against the system because it’s outside the system,"" says Bobby Lee, the CEO and cofounder of BTCC, one of China\'s three biggest bitcoin exchanges.\n\n""Gold is sort of the hedge against the system, the status quo. Our society is ingrained with the current monetary system of fiat money, where governments issue it, they can put out as much of it as they want. Today’s money system, in a very rude way, it’s no different to airline miles or hotel reward points.""\n\nLike gold, cryptocurrency is not controlled by any one central bank or country. The network is instead run by a distributed and dispersed network of computers who do the back office work required to run the system in return for bitcoins. However, the work to earn 1 bitcoin gets harder and harder, requiring more and more computing power.\n\n""The philosophy of bitcoin is that it’s a limited digital asset,"" Lee says. ""There’s only 21 million bitcoin. The smallest amount you can get is not one bitcoin, you can get fractions of bitcoin. But if you own 1 bitcoin or 0.1 bitcoin you’ll forever have that percentage of the world’s supply. No one can dilute you. In that sense it’s very attractive, it’s very unique.""\n\n\'A much higher percentage of drug trades are done in US dollars\'\n\nHowever, one thing standing in the way of bitcoin becoming a mainstream investment product is its reputation. The cryptocurrency, originally championed by hacking cliques who flew close to anarchism, has an association with the ""dark web"" and shady forums where drugs, sex, and other illegal products and services are bought and sold.\n\nLee retorts: ""Pay for drugs, hitmen, all the illegal illicit activities — sounds like you’re describing the US dollar. The US dollar is also associated with drugs, drug money, cartels. Sure bitcoin can be used for that, but it can also be used for a lot of good things. I think it\'s a meta-narrative that’s not factually based.\n\n""I think it\'s a meta-narrative that’s not factually based. If you want to look at facts, a much higher percentage of drug trades are done in US dollars — both in the number of instances and in the raw amounts. It’s a matter of a narrative.""\n\nHe turns to metaphor to support his point: ""A knife can be used for good things — I’m using it to eat my breakfast — but it can be also used for potentially nefarious activities. It’s how you choose it. You can try to eliminate all knifes and guns but it doesn’t solve the problem of murder.\n\n""Bitcoin — the question is about the causal relationship. Bitcoin itself does not cause drugs trades, just as the US dollar doesn’t. I think it’s more important we focus on the correct narrative — how bitcoin brings value to society. I’m not concerned. I think the truth will prevail. I truly bitcoin has great functionality and great features and it will be recognised for the value it brings to society, rather than any nefarious uses.""\n\nChina currently dominates the global trade in bitcoin and the price has been hit in recent weeks by a government-led prove on bitcoin exchanges in the country. Lee is confident that the currency can overcome these issues and is confident about the outlook for 2017.\n\n""Four years ago bitcoin was very much used as trading in China,"" he says. ""Going forward, I think bitcoin is getting worldwide attention with demonetization events in India — they just cancelled 84% of their bank notes — and in Venezuela, with hyperinflation.""', 'In a world barreling onward in the name of efficiency, bitcoin stands out for the purposeful way it\'s anything but.\n\nThis \'deficiency\' was the focus of many talks at day two of Stanford’s security conference, Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2017, this week. For all its benefits, the system that secures bitcoin, proof of work (PoW), is estimated to require as much electricity as all of Denmark by 2020, and many researchers see this as a prize problem to solve.\n\nBut, the bad news is that, so far, it\'s proven difficult to find an alternative that provides as much security as bitcoin\'s massive collection of global computers, all brute-forcing the network in an effort to win its rewards.\n\nAt least, no alternative of has been successfully deployed on a large scale.\n\nNonetheless, the race to invent a blockchain security system that\'s less resource intensive, and that could still thwart double spending in open blockchain networks, continues, and attendees see the experimentation as a good sign.\n\nFounder and CEO of Protocol Labs Juan Benet perhaps best summed up the sentiment that something else will eventually be discovered if enough bright minds attack the idea from all angles.\n\nBenet told CoinDesk:\n\n""Proof-of-work is a really good system, but there’s probably going to be something better.""\n\nProof of blank\n\nPerhaps the more experimental ideas presented were \'proof-of-space\' and \'proof-of-time\', described by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen.\n\nThe idea is to rely on proof that you have space, (such as free hard-drive space on your laptop, for example) and conventional time, which he believes could serve as more democratic resources that could help decentralized economic systems prove ownership.\n\nThe idea is in the early stages, and Cohen walked through a lot of variations of the proposal, each with some unsolved problems, or ways it can be attacked. It’s all theoretical right now, and there isn’t any code.\n\nAgain, the reasoning behind the proposals is that it could serve as an energy-efficient alternative to proof of work.\n\n""Blockchains fundamentally require waste,"" Cohen said.\n\nElsewhere, ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir gave an update on Casper, the proof-of-stake protocol that ethereum plans to one day switch to, and that aims to replace its existing proof-of-work protocol.\n\nStill, his talk provided a window into the game theoretic challenges that the ethereum team is still struggling against as it strives to ensure the right balance between competition and cooperation in its network.\n\nAhead of science\n\nYet, despite experimentation with new protocols, others are taking a step back.\n\nCornell associate professor Elaine Shi\'s research, for example, has focused on gaining a deeper understanding of why PoW actually works so well.\n\n""The protocol\'s success is ahead of the scientific understanding,"" she said.\n\nAlthough it works and there has been some progress in understanding the security benefits, she believes right now people often rely on intuition to describe why it works.\n\nShe noted, as others did, that ""the biggest elephant is power consumption"". But, she also mentioned that throughput is relatively low, and that there might be other downsides.\n\nMaybe a more formal understanding of how bitcoin works would make it easier to understand if another consensus protocol could take its place.\n\n""It would be interesting to understand, are some of these constraints inherent or are there ways to do better? It would be great to understand theoretically what is possible and what is not possible,"" she said.\n\nSkeptical rumblings\n\nStill, not everyone believes that the work to rethink proof of work is advancing enough to offer a viable alternative.\n\nETH Zürich PhD student Arthur Gervais noted that most of the proposals are quite theoretical right now, and that it won’t be possible to know how successful they might be until there are deeper specifications to facilitate better analyses.\n\nStill, Benet believes that this is only a matter of time and study.\n\n""There’s a lot of belief in proof-of-work that is more based on agreement rather than rational, proof-oriented understanding,"" he said.\n\nHe noted, for example, that miners will have an incentive to push for the continued use of proof-of-work, given that the business of collecting rewards in blockchain-based systems is still lucrative.\n\nUltimately, he concluded:\n\n""The reliance on proof of work will continue for a while.""\n\nFeatured bitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Over the past few weeks, authorities have been cracking down on exchanges and clients, leading some firms to introduce restrictions on their products in order to make traders more aware about the risks involved and to dampen activity to some extent.\n\nFurther action from Chinese officials could weigh on bitcoin volumes in the country, which could exert additional downside pressure on prices. After all, investors have been gradually booking profits from their long positions from late last year and early this year for fear of being subject to government investigation.\n\nStill, traders are also shying away from the dollar due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration. With that, more consolidation could be expected in the coming days ahead of market catalysts such as the FOMC statement and US NFP release later this week.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The attack prevented guests from accessing their rooms and prevented the issuance of new key cards, highlighting the potential fragility of systems in the so-called “internet of things.” Lacking other options, the four-star Seehotel Jägerwirt paid the hackers a modest ransom in Bitcoin to reactivate their systems.\n\nIn a followup statement to Bleeping Computer, the hotel’s Managing Director Christoph Brandstätter emphasized that no guests were locked into their rooms, because international fire codes mandate that electronic hotel locks must open from the inside even in the event of system failure.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAccording to the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF), the key system compromise occurred at the beginning of the current ski season, while the hotel was fully booked. A smaller attack, the fourth that has hit the hotel, occurred earlier this month.\n\nDuring the larger attack, which also compromised the hotel’s reservation systems, the hijackers demanded a ransom of 1,500 Euros in Bitcoin before re-activating the compromised systems. Another prior attack, over the summer, was also resolved with the payment of a ransom of “several thousand Euros.”\n\nPolice were not able to uncover clues as to the culprits in the hacks.\n\nBrandstätter told ORF that he was aware of other hotels being the target of similar attacks. Add electronic locks, then, to a target-rich environment that includes the poorly secured webcams and DVRs that powered widespread denial of service attacks in October, and, at least in theory, hackable connected cars.\n\nThe lakeside hotel has already spent a reported 10,000 Euros on digital security to try and stop hackers. But it also plans to take an unconventional step back in time. According to Brandstätter, the hotel’s next remodeling will include a return to room locks with standard mechanical keys.', 'This essay is an updated chapter from Luis Buenaventura’s Reinventing Remittances with Bitcoin, available for free in e-book and print form now.\n\nOne of the most common questions asked at industry conferences is why Western Union or Moneygram don’t just use Bitcoin themselves. If they did, they could eliminate the potential threat posed by the young Bitcoin remittance start-ups who are out there trying to eat their lunch.\n\nTheoretically, Western Union could just throw R&D resources at the problem and come up with a large-scale version of what companies like Bitspark in Hong Kong, Payphil in South Korea, or BitPesa in Kenya have been working on for the last three years.\n\nThe short answer is that Western Union doesn’t need Bitcoin in its current infantile state. Conversely, if and when Bitcoin reaches adulthood the world would no longer need Western Union.\n\nPrehistoric animals\n\nThe Colorado-based giant is often compared with prehistoric animals by the Bitcoin community and although a little harsh, it’s not an altogether unfair characterization when you consider how long it’s been around.\n\nThe Western Union empire is all of 165 years old and has been transferring money domestically within the United States since the 1870s. Their early dominance involved leveraging their nationwide telegraph monopoly to send remittance instructions from city to city in much the same way we use payment APIs today.\n\nToday their network includes over 500,000 physical outlets spread across 200 countries, which facilitated over 261 mln consumer-to-consumer transactions in 2015. On the technology front, the $10 bln company was the first to launch its own set of geostationary satellites, dubbed Westar, as far back as the mid-1970s to facilitate its own internal communications.\n\nMore recently, its WUConnect platform allows social media and mobile messaging users to send money from within the user interfaces of their favorite apps, including Viber and WeChat.\n\nWestern Union on Viber\n\nIn a one-off experiment, the author requested $20 from a friend in San Francisco using the Viber app.\n\nUnfortunately, there was both a $4 service fee plus a 4 percent forex hidden fee in the currency conversion to Philippine pesos. By the time the author had actually received the pesos from a local Western Union agent in Metro Manila, $24 had been reduced to less than $19.15, a loss of nearly $5.\n\nThe Western Union interface within Viber allows senders to go through the entire remittance process without leaving the messenger app, but unfortunately, costs $4 plus 4 percent.\n\nThe global average remittance transaction amounts to $200, so this pricing structure implies a cost impact of $12 or 6 percent in total. It seems clear that Western Union is aiming for convenience and not cost-reduction with this service.\n\nImmobile money transfer\n\nThe most practical way to use Bitcoin today is a settlement mechanism between remote remittance companies. The companies on both ends of the transaction need to handle the BTC conversions on behalf of their customers.\n\nThis is the strategy employed by partner companies like Bitspark in Hong Kong and BloomSolutions in the Philippines. The company at the origin point handles the senders, while the company at the destination interacts with the beneficiaries. Splitting up the tasks this way allows both companies to specialize in their home locales and using Bitcoin makes settlement risk immaterial.\n\nIn the case of Western Union, both the sending and receiving sides are owned by the same company meaning that settlement doesn’t need to take place over a transparent public network like the Blockchain. Western Union is massive enough that it can benefit from its own internal “network effect,” balancing large cash reserves between all the countries that it has a presence in.\n\nWhen facilitating a remittance from San Francisco to London, the dollars paid by the sender never have to leave the United States. Western Union only needs to draw down from its Great Britain Pound reserves in the United Kingdom to pay the receiver, which can be done instantly and with no costs. Likewise, when a Londoner wants to send cash to the United States, Western Union only needs to draw from its dollar reserves there; the pound sterling stays in the country.\n\nIn this manner, money is not actually moving between one nation and another, Western Union only needs to adjust its balances in each territory. This “net-balancing” strategy is coincidentally what another well-known fintech startup Transferwise employs for its own remittance service and can be even cheaper than Bitcoin.\n\nThe disadvantage is that it’s tremendously capital-intensive and difficult to pull off in corridors where cash flows are more uni-directional. For example, balancing between the United Kingdom and the Philippines would be a challenging proposition, since there are over 100,000 Filipinos sending cash home from the United Kingdom every month but there is only a handful of British expats doing the same from Manila.\n\nConsequently, Transferwise’s UK-to-Philippines remittance service takes two days and sports an unpredictable exchange rate. It would appear that even a remittance start-up with over $50 mln in funding has difficulty making these types of corridors efficient.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty\n\nEven if Western Union had any interest in employing Bitcoin, perhaps as a programmatic way to instantly fine-tune their cash reserves across their 200 territories, the current unregulated status of cryptocurrencies make it a risky proposition for a publicly-traded company, especially one based in the United States.\n\nWith every customer transaction being scrutinized by multiple government agencies in multiple countries, it’s hard to imagine that a money transfer business would want to add to their compliance headaches by using Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t stop them from keeping a close eye on the space. In April 2016, prominent Blockchain investor Digital Currency Group announced that Western Union had joined its latest round both as investors and advisors. For now, at least, that seems to be the extent of their participation.\n\nDisclosure: The author is one of the founders of BloomSolutions, a Bitcoin remittance start-up based in the Philippines.', 'Sometimes, making a payment results in a big payday — for you. At least, if you’re making that payment with a volatile cryptocurrency that has a tendency to undergo rather large swings in worth. One bitcoin enthusiast managed to luck into not only a new house, but a $1.3 million profit as a result of his payment choices. Rather than taking out a mortgage, cutting a check, or arriving with a suitcase of cash, a recent California homebuyer decided to purchase a $4 million estate with the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs Bitpay CCO Sonny Singh told Speaking to Bloomberg Markets, a real estate developer approached Signh and his company to discuss an offer for an expensive property made using bitcoin. Singh helped the developer understand the logistics of the payment method, and after some negotiations, the final asking price of $4 million was settled upon.\n\nBut while the developer was deciding on the price, bitcoin was experiencing some major movement of its own. When the transaction was initiated, bitcoin was worth just $750. But by the time it was time to make the cryptocurrency payment, the value of the tender had actually increased to over $1,000 (for the first time since 2013, actually). That meant that the buyer ultimately made about $1 million on his $4 million purchase.\n\n“The buyer actually ended up making about 25 percent in the currency exchange rate, essentially, in the appreciation,” Singh said. “He got a house for pretty much 25 percent cheaper.”\n\nSuch stories, though not apocryphal, are certainly rare, so we’re not necessarily suggesting that you make all your future purchases with bitcoin with the hopes that a good exchange rate will end up benefiting you. But all the same, it looks as though bitcoin is becoming an increasingly accepted manner of payment, which may just spell opportunity for the savvy buyer.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

01/30/2017,"[""Guests had already complained that their electronic room keys were not working, and receptionists’ efforts to create new ones had proved futile. Bashing down the doors was not an option.\n\nThe reservation system for the hotel in the village of Turracherhöhe, about 90 minutes by car from Salzburg, was paralyzed.\n\n“We were at maximum capacity with 180 guests and decided that it was better to give in,” he said. “The hackers were very pushy.”\n\nSecurity experts said the attack on the hotel appeared to be a novel example of an increasingly malicious and prevalent type of modern-day piracy.\n\nThe weapon? A type of software known as ransomware.\n\nThe crime is as simple as it is mendacious. Victims typically receive an email with a link or attachment that contains software that encrypts files on their computer and holds them hostage until they pay a ransom. Many of the hackers who carry out such attacks operate in Russia and Eastern Europe, according to the police, and often demand a ransom in Bitcoin, a digital currency that is hard to trace.\n\n“Ransomware is becoming a pandemic,” said Tony Neate, a former British police officer who investigated cybercrime for 15 years. “With the internet, anything can be switched on and off, from computers to cameras to baby monitors.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nStill, he added, “hacking a hotel and locking people out of their rooms is a new line of attack.”\n\nMr. Neate, now chief executive of Get Safe Online, a government-backed security charity in Britain, said that demands in ransomware schemes were usually low enough that victims would acquiesce. As a result, however, hackers waged dozens of attacks a day to make them financially viable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe nevertheless counseled victims not to pay, arguing that that would only further encourage more attacks and that the funds used to pay the ransom would bankroll nefarious activity, including possibly terrorism. Hotels, he warned, should also guard against copycat crimes by reinforcing their digital security.\n\nAccording to the United States Justice Department, ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 to an average of 4,000 a day. The F.B.I. said the costs to victims of such attacks rose to $209 million in the first three months of 2016, compared with $24 million throughout 2015.\n\nIt is a sign of the crime’s sinister proliferation that it has also entered popular culture.\n\nIn an episode of the legal drama “The Good Wife,” a Russian hacker attacked a law firm in the middle of a prominent case, encrypting its files and demanding a $50,000 ransom. The hacker eventually relented after the firm turned the tables by infecting the extortionist’s computer with propaganda criticizing Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nIn the real world, however, many have been forced to pay up.\n\nLast year, hospitals in California and Kentucky were targeted in ransomware attacks. In one case, a Los Angeles hospital paid more than $17,000 to hackers to restore its computer network, and all of its digital medical files. Other victims in Europe and the United States have included a municipal utility, companies, schools, law firms and police departments.\n\nA recent study by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, a Washington-based organization focusing on cybersecurity, noted that ransomware threatened to “wreak havoc on America’s critical infrastructure community” and called it the digital equivalent of a “centuries old criminal tactic.”\n\nMr. Brandstaetter said he had decided to go public with the attack at his hotel so that others would be more vigilant.\n\nTo guard against future attacks, however, he said the Romantik Seehotel Jaegerwirt was considering replacing its electronic keys with old-fashioned door locks and real keys of the type used when his great-grandfather founded the hotel.\n\n“The securest way not to get hacked,” he said, “is to be offline and to use keys.”"", 'Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk\'s product team.\n\nThe following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.\n\nThe financial world saw history made last week when, for the first time ever, a Chinese head of state took the podium at the World Economic Forum\'s famed Davos conference in Switzerland.\n\nIssued on 17th January, Xi Jinping\'s speech has since been interpreted as a response to rising protectionism – and an attempt to consolidate China’s position on the world stage.\n\nBut, it\'s worth examining in another light.\n\nIt is also likely to be indicative of the path Chinese authorities will take regarding the country\'s bitcoin exchanges.\n\nA recap\n\nWhile we\'ve been focusing on the central bank\'s scrutiny (and its potential impact on bitcoin\'s network and price), this view masks the bigger picture.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. Over the past weeks, we’ve seen clear evidence of China\'s weight in global bitcoin markets.\n\nNews of meetings between the People\'s Bank of China (PBoC) and leading exchanges sent prices tumbling.\n\nThe subsequent suspension of margin lending and the introduction of trading fees had dramatic effects on volumes, and many feared that the resulting dent in Chinese demand would dampen price growth.\n\nSome interpreted the moves as an impending crackdown on bitcoin.\n\nChina needs to stem capital outflows, the reasoning went, and since bitcoin is an attractive vehicle for that, it needs to be stopped.\n\nFeet wet\n\nOn the surface, this might make sense. Traditionally, the US has been the world’s champion of free trade while China has dragged its feet.\n\nBut now, the tables seem to be turning, China appears eager to position itself as a \'modern\' economy with a flourishing FinTech ecosystem.\n\nPart of that is seen in its interest in blockchain technology.\n\nEarlier this week, local news sources reported that the PBoC had tested a blockchain-based digital currency and is establishing a related research institute. Furthermore, banks, startups, academia and consortia are working with international institutions to foster a bustling blockchain environment.\n\nWhile interest in permissioned ledgers is not the same as support for digitized assets like bitcoin, a desire to participate in foundational change bodes well for the acceptance of alternatives.\n\nAnd an understanding of how the technology works should prevent impractical measures. (The PBoC has not, to our knowledge, indicated an interest in banning bitcoin, nor is it likely to).\n\nMost pronouncements have expressed a cautious interest, and trading restrictions are less an indictment than they are part of the central bank’s job.\n\nEbb and flow\n\nCapital outflows, on the other hand, are a concern, but local experts downplay the threat to monetary policy. While most of the world’s bitcoin mining and trading takes place in China, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization is minute compared to the overall size of the Chinese economy.\n\nMore broadly, the recent interest in bitcoin exchanges could well be part of a larger attempt to deflate asset bubbles.\n\nThis week, the PBoC asked banks to curb lending, ahead of what is traditionally the strongest quarter for growth in loans. The request stressed the importance of reducing mortgage allocations, with the hope of curtailing runaway real estate prices.\n\nThe central bank also raised interest rates for the first time in years, which some analysts interpreted as part of its objective to curtail speculation.\n\nWhile the bitcoin-related moves do seem to inch towards regulation, few believe that would be bad for the sector. Most appear to focus on the legitimacy it would bestow and the confidence it would give the ecosystem.\n\nLooking ahead, political and economic troubles could complicate things.\n\nThe possibility of a trade war or even a military conflict in the South China Sea could send the exchange rate lower, drive the BTC price higher and put increasing pressure on China\'s government to appear strong, especially in the run-up to its 19th party conference later this year.\n\nTables turned\n\nYet, as China heads into its week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year, the approach seems to be one of dialogue and further investigation.\n\nIn his Davos speech, President Xi quoted a Chinese proverb:\n\n""Honey melons grow on bitter vines, sweet dates grow on thistles and thorns.""\n\nThis not only is a fitting metaphor for China’s internal conflict between wanting to participate in (or even lead) global progress and at the same time keep things calm at home, it also seems to sum up bitcoin’s struggles to become an accepted medium of exchange in a world of shifting priorities.\n\nAnd it should reassure us that, in China, bitcoin is not a target.\n\nClick Here to Never Miss a Weekly Email Again\n\nChina passport image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

This followed the decision of the People’s Bank of China to conduct on-site inspections. The decision of the Chinese exchanges to impose fees was clearly a move to stay in business and compliant with the demands of the central bank. While these exchanges may now be on the ‘right side of the law’ in China, the long-term effects of this move will be felt for some time to come.\n\nTrading slows down to a trickle\n\nThe immediate effect of the imposition of the fee by the exchanges in China such as Huobi, BTCC and OkCoin has been the fall in trading volumes. On the day the ban was imposed, Bloomberg reported:\n\n“One-hour volume at OkCoin fell 89 percent to 1,026 Bitcoins at 1 p.m. local time, from 10,062 during the same period on Monday, according to the venue’s website. Huobi and BTC China saw declines of 92 percent and 82 percent respectively. Prices were little changed at around 6,350 yuan per Bitcoin.”\n\nIt would appear then that moves like cross-exchange arbitrage have ended for good in China. We are now entering a new era where speculative trading may not be a thing at least for the near future.\n\nThe only worry being that other markets such as Japan still have zero fee trading, which is leading to spikes in volumes there.\n\nLack of Volatility is a good thing\n\nThe lack of volatility in Bitcoin even amidst declining volumes is a good thing. One it proves that Bitcoin is able to weather the storm in China and the second thing is that it is apparent that China is still a market leader when it comes to volumes despite the fall in numbers. The chart below shows fall in volumes dramatically after the fee was levied. As you can see even though the volumes have declined sharply, the Chinese exchanges have maintained their leadership in volumes.\n\n- Source Bitcoinity.org\n\n\u200b\n\n- Source: Bitcoinity.org\n\nBitcoin prices in the meanwhile have remained fairly stable. In fact, they have even shown appreciation. If markets have spoken, they have said that this lack of volatility is a good thing.\n\nMarkets have factored in China\n\nBitcoin price movements due to China are something that the markets have taken into consideration. We can say then that the action of the Chinese regulator has put a smaller dent into Bitcoin price then it could have. Bitcoin media including Cointelegraph have been in part responsible for this. We have covered the China story from the beginning and informed our readership about the PBOC story as it developed. While some may have argued that there was no story surrounding PBOC other than ‘routine inspections’, the fact remains that the volatility in Bitcoin price stemmed from the Chinese exchanges and if we have come to an era where wild fluctuations in Bitcoin are a thing of the past, we should welcome in that era. A more stable Bitcoin increases its functionality as a currency and inspires more confidence.

Now CoinDesk is making its own acquisition, its first ever: CoinDesk has bought Lawnmower, for an undisclosed price.\n\nLawnmower first launched in 2015 as a roundup app (a popular format these days for finance-related apps) for buying bitcoin. You would connect the app to a credit card, and it would round up the spare change on your transactions and use it to buy bitcoin. The purchases were made through a plug-in to Coinbase, the No. 1 US bitcoin wallet.\n\nLast summer, Lawnmower shifted its buying model, ditching the roundup structure and instead allowing users to buy bitcoin any time they wish, and to have the app make a monthly purchase of a pre-set amount. “We viewed the spare change roundups as more of a limitation,” said cofounder and CFO Alex Sunnarborg at the time. “If you want a serious investment platform, spare change is going to be inherently low-volume.”\n\nBut the real value of Lawnmower was its data.\n\nAs the app evolved, its bitcoin price chart got better and better for users: visually clean, easy to adjust, updating in real time. (In my opinion, as a reporter who has covered bitcoin and blockchain since 2011, Lawnmower is the best mobile app for price data, while CoinDesk has the best desktop price charts.) Along the way, Lawnmower added price charts and data for additional digital currencies Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. It also created its own Lawnmower Blockchain Index, a fund with different digital currencies, weighted by market cap. Tracking the performance of Lawnmower’s index provided a useful gauge of how these assets were performing overall.\n\nLawnmower’s data (on each coin’s price fluctuation, market cap, total supply, and trading volume) is why CoinDesk came calling. CoinDesk will roll Lawnmower’s data into its own desktop site and mobile app, and into its paid research reports, a business it is looking to expand. “Pretty much everything CoinDesk is doing is right in our skill set,” says Sunnarborg. (Lawnmower had even added news headlines to its app, so a sale to a news outlet makes some sense.) Lawnmower cofounders Pieter Gorsira and Patrick Archambeau will lead CoinDesk’s engineering team, while Sunnarborg will join CoinDesk’s research team as an analyst.\n\nLawnmower mobile app More\n\n“While we were excited about Lawnmower’s buy/sell functionality and the traction they had made, we were much more intrigued by the data and market research elements,” says Ryan Selkis, who moved over from DCG to run CoinDesk’s business after DCG acquired it last year. DCG, led by Barry Silbert (who founded SecondMarket in 2004 and sold it to Nasdaq in 2015), has invested in 80 digital currency startups.\n\nLawnmower’s app will shut down soon, and CoinDesk will take the data elements, but not the bitcoin-buying functionality—specifically to avoid any ethical conflicts. “Since we did ultimately see a conflict with owning an app that facilitated the purchase of digital currencies, buy/sell functionality will not be included in the new CoinDesk app,” says Selkis.\n\nIndeed, it would raise ethical red flags if a web site objectively covering bitcoin companies also offered users the ability to buy bitcoin. CoinDesk being owned by a bitcoin startup investment firm also might raise similar alarms, but at the time of purchase, DCG vowed to assemble strict walls between the CoinDesk editorial team and the CoinDesk business side. At the CoinDesk office, there is a literal wall between the editorial team and the business team.\n\n“I think the divide with the new research department will be about figuring out where the research product makes sense,” says Sunnarborg, “and what the wall is between a long editorial feature piece, versus a paid research piece. It’s exciting stuff but definitely there’s a divide we will navigate.”', 'BITCOIN\n\nVirtual currency wallets often face the legal question of whether they have to operate as a bank or not. Well, not in Switzerland.\n\nXapo, a bitcoin wallet provider, announced that it has received “conditional approval” from the Swiss financial market watchdog to operate in the country.\n\n“After almost two years of substantial effort and investment, Xapo has received conditional approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to operate in Switzerland,” Xapo founder and CEO Wences Casares said in a blog post.\n\nThe approval hinges on several factors, including the company participating in a self-regulatory organization, among other things. Xapo, however, no longer needs to secure a banking license because FINMA has designated the bitcoin wallet as a “financial intermediary,” according to a Reuters report.\n\nSwitzerland already plays host to a number of cryptocurrency companies, but Xapo’s operation as a bitcoin wallet provider had raised questions whether it required a banking license. The company was likely helped by its argument that it does not accept deposits and it won’t serve American customers, citing the legal uncertainty surrounding the digital currency.\n\nSwiss authorities have been vocal in their intent to catch up with the rapidly changing financial technology landscape.\n\nIn November, Switzerland’s Federal Department of Finance (FDF) outlined a plan that included a license specifically for fintech companies as well as a regulatory “sandbox” or an innovation area for experimental firms. At the time, FDF said it plans to delve deeper into bitcoin and other digital currencies, as well as other applications for blockchain.\n\nWhile not coming completely out of the blue, Switzerland’s decision to approve Xapo is a legal foothold that opens the door to other virtual currency wallets that may be eyeing to set up shop in the country, not to mention it could also set an example for other countries to follow.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin is once again back on the $900 mark, trading at $917.69 early Monday morning.\n\nComments', ""Bitcoin payments startup BitPesa has raised $2.5m in a new Series A funding round.\n\nThe round was led by Draper VC, and included support from Greycroft Partners, Blockchain Capital, BnkToTheFuture, Digital Currency Group, Pantera Capital Future\\Perfect Ventures and Zephyr Acorn.

Any restrictions, the roadmap states, “would be a mean to fight criminal activities entailing large payment transactions in cash by organised criminal networks” – with a similar impact on terrorist financing as well.\n\nOn the same foot, such efforts could be used to target digital currencies like bitcoin as well. The European Commission has already moved to extend anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules to bitcoin exchanges in the economic bloc, bringing those firms under the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering Directive.\n\nAccording to the impact assessment, restrictions on the amount of cash people can pay with could be applied to digital currencies, which notes:\n\n“In view of the development of cryptocurrencies and the existence of other means of payments ensuring anonymity, an option could be to extend the restrictions to cash payments to all payments ensuring anonymity (cryptocurrencies, payment in kinds, etc.).”\n\nThat said, actually implementing the strategy may not be so easy – it might even prove to be counterproductive, the assessment goes on to state.\n\n“On the other hand, restrictions on cash payments could promote the development of alternative payments technologies compatible with the non-anonymity objective pursued,” it reads.\n\nAs finance blog Wolf Street notes, the proposal may run into resistance from EU citizens as well, citing a backlash early last year against a bid to cap cash transactions in Germany, the bloc’s largest economy.\n\nWhile no specific limits are cited in the assessment, it does highlight that different EU countries have adopted different approaches and that any final amount would need to take those strategies into consideration.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

01/31/2017,"[""Bitcoin first became prominent in 2013, when the price started at $13 and peaked at over $1,100. The People's Bank of China, their equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve, sensitive to the potential that it was a Ponzi scheme or otherwise fraudulent, banned Chinese financial institutions from handling Bitcoin directly in December of 2013. This set off an eighteen month long downward trend, with the price bottoming at $177 in 2015.\n\nThe price began to recover and in the next eighteen months it again climbed to over $1,100. Again the PBOC made a policy change, the price slid to $800, and then quickly rebounded to about $900. The shape of the Bitcoin price graph is very similar to the last PBOC intervention, but the fundamentals are very different this time.\n\nI made time to talk to major exchanges in the U.S., South America, China, and to Ark Investment Management, the first public fund manager to invest in Bitcoin. I asked the same questions of all four: What caused the price growth over the last eighteen months? What caused the recent price spike and following volatility? Do you think the price is stable where it is now? How has it affected your company?\n\nLet’s start with the steady growth over the last eighteen months.\n\nEveryone seems to agree that the price rise is based on Bitcoin's fundamental value proposition. The world has agreed the coins are worth something, and that is based on a combination of Bitcoin's utility as a means of transferring payments, as well as serving as a store of value. Despite the lack of a central authority guaranteeing the coin in the same way a fiat currency is created, there were $128 million in transactions the day I wrote this article, and there has been in excess of a billion dollars invested in blockchain technology companies, many of which I’ve covered here."", 'Photo: Seehotel Jaegerwirt\n\nAn Austrian hotel manager who went public with the fact that he had been blackmailed four times into paying a Bitcoin ransom to cybercriminals has been praised for speaking out.\n\nThe story of how hackers took control of the hotel\'s room locks ended up being reported all over the world from CNN and Newsweek through to The Times, CNBC, Yahoo News UK, The Verge, Gizmodo, IB Times, The Register, PC Magazine, Softpedia News, Forbes, Daily Star, the Huffington Post and The Sun to name but a few.\n\nWith relatively small amounts of money involved for most businesses that fall victim to the criminals, it is believed that thousands of firms are falling prey to the cyber criminals, but that they prefer to stay silent rather than suffer public embarrassment.\n\nBut after the manager of the Romantik Seehotel Jaegerwirt, a luxurious four-star hotel with a beautiful lakeside setting on the Alpine Turracher Hoehe Pass in Austria, was hit a fourth time by the blackmailers he decided to go public with what happened to warn others of the dangers of cybercrime.\n\nManaging Director Christoph Brandstaetter said he was speaking out because he wanted to see more done to tackle cybercriminals, as this sort of activity is set to get worse.\n\nHis hotel, like many others, has a modern IT system which includes key cards for hotel doors and in the latest incident cybercriminals had again hacked into his system and managed to take down the entire key system. The guests could no longer get into their hotel rooms and new key cards could not be programmed.\n\nThe attack, which coincided with the opening weekend of the winter season, was allegedly so massive that it even shut down all hotel computers, including the reservation system and the cash desk system.\n\nThe hackers promised to restore the system quickly if just 1,500 EUR (1,272 GBP) in the largely untraceable electronic currency known as Bitcoin was paid to them.\n\nBrandstaetter said: ""The house was totally booked with 180 guests, we had no other choice. Neither police nor insurance help you in this case.""\n\n""The restoration of our system after the first attack in summer cost us several thousand Euros. We did not get any money from the insurance so far because none of those to blame could be found.""\n\nThe manager said it was cheaper and faster for the hotel to just pay the Bitcoin.\n\nBrandstaetter said: ""Every euro that is paid to blackmailers hurts us. We know that other colleagues have been attacked, who have done similarly.""\n\nWhen the hackers got the money, they unlocked the key registry system and all other computers, making them all run as normal again.\n\nThe Seehotel Jaegerwirt, which has existed for 111 years, also has another, innovative, trick in store to keep the hackers out for good.\n\nBrandstaetter said: ""We are planning at the next room refurbishment for old-fashioned door locks with real keys. Just like 111 years ago at the time of our great-grandfathers.""\n\nUsing Bitcoin for cybercriminal activities is becoming increasingly commonplace, as tracing payments is much harder due to the way the cryptocurrency works.', 'A former employee of the US central banking system, the Federal Reserve, was issued a fine of $5,000 and sentenced to 12 months’ probation for mining bitcoin on a Fed-owned server.\n\nNicholas Berthaume was employed as a communications analyst with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. According to an announcement by the Fed’s Inspector’s Office yesterday, Berthaume installed unauthorized software on a Board server, enabling him to connect to an online bitcoin network to mine the cryptocurrency. Court documents have revealed that the software was installed between March 2012 and June 2014.\n\nBerthaume entered a plea agreement after an investigation by the Board’s Inspector General. Prior to receiving the fine and sentence on Friday, Berthaume plead guilty to one charge of misdemeanor for unlawful use of government property. The charge can carry a sentence of a year in jail with a fine up to $100,000.\n\nThe IG’s office also stated that it wasn’t clear how many bitcoins were mined by the former employee. An excerpt from Inspector General Mark Bailek’s statement read:\n\nWe were unable to conclusively determine the amount of bitcoins earned through the Board’s server due to the anonymity of the Bitcoin network.\n\nAccording to the IG statement, Berthaume, who had remote access to the server from his home, denied any involvement with the bitcoin mining software initially when confronted with the accusation. Later, Berthaume proceeded to wipe all evidence of his mining activity by remotely removing the software from the Board server. A forensic analysis was able to confirm his involvement, leading to his firing from the Board. An admission of guilt followed soon after.\n\n“Berthaume’s voluntary admission of guilt and his full cooperation were critical to the timely closure of this matter,” the IG added.\n\nThe board has since “implemented security enhancements” following Berthaume’s actions. Other details of the case of bitcoins mined using the central bank’s infrastructure remain scarce.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Not a single day passes when President Trump is not in the news. He is a great waller, a banisher of the Muslims or simply a raving lunatic. It basically all depends on who you ask. Will Trump’s moves benefit Bitcoin and Blockchain?\n\nOne particular move- immigration and restriction on movements may have immediate effects on Blockchain’s future but other Trump’s policies will put their mark on the crypto world as well.\n\nThe stupid f**king wall\n\nVicente Fox, former president of Mexico described President Trump’s wall just in those straight terms. If the wall comes up and U.S.-Mexico relations hit a sour note, it will immediately affect border towns on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. Then it will go beyond.\n\nThe Financial Times, for example, highlighted the Trump impact on real estate purchases in California and Florida, they cited the National Association of Realtors as saying, “the percentage of Mexicans buying homes in the U.S. fell from 7.9 percent of international sales in 2012 to 4.6 percent last year.”\n\nMexico is the United States\' second largest export market and the third-largest supplier of imports. In 2016, the United States recorded a $59 bln trade deficit with Mexico. If Trump were to tax Mexican goods in order to recover the cost of the wall, Texas alone would be hit hard. As the Republican Politician from Texas Rube O. Villareal tweeted:\n\n“A 20 percent tax on Mex.imports to pay 4 the #BorderWall wud hav the same impact as a category 5 hurricane on the #RGV~catastrophic&hard 2 overcome”\n\nThe dollar’s status in doubt\n\nPresident Trump’s Muslim ban or rather what is being marketed as one but in reality may not be the one technically is also raising questions.\n\nWhile none of the countries that have been shortlisted for the “ban” are significant contributors of terrorist activities in the United States, countries that have been left out have posed a bigger threat in the past. What is more worrying is the impact that this ban will have in terms of ramifications. One of the countries on this travel ban list is Iran, which happens to produce 5.1 percent of the world’s oil. The Central Bank of Iran has decided to ditch the dollar in a separate development. Iran’s Financial newspaper the Financial Tribune reported the central bank governor Valiollah Sief as saying, ""Iran\'s difficulties in dealing with the dollar were in place from the time of the primary sanctions and this trend is continuing but we face no limitations regarding other currencies.""\n\nShould Trump significantly anger the Muslim world, then the U.S. dollar’s status as the reserve currency of the world would come under a cloud of doubt. In fact, his “Muslim Ban” has already sent the dollar into a tailspin especially against the Yen, which acts as a sort of security blanket traditionally.\n\nChina is ditching the dollar\n\nPresident Trump has been hard on China. He has called the Asian giant as a currency manipulator and has also decided to be more proactive in the matters related to the South China Sea.\n\nThis has lead to considerable stirring in Beijing, which also happens to own a large part of the United States debt.\n\nThe Chinese have been dumping these U.S. bonds in the wake of President Trump’s statements. A lot of the dumping of the U.S. debt has been to shore up the flailing Yuan. CNN Money observed:\n\n“Since May, the value of China\'s Treasury holdings has dropped by nearly $195 bln. Japan passed China in October to become the largest foreign owner of U.S. debt.”\n\nInterestingly Japan too has been jettisoning the United States debt while Russia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom have been piling it on. Trump’s policies, indeed will push the United States further into debt and as the U.S. Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget observed the U.S. debt would rise to 129 percent of the GDP by 2026.\n\nAdd to this the seeming end of the bond bubble as major economies ditch the United States debt and Trump’s treasury buyback plans. Chances of the dollar coming under pressure in the future are quite high.\n\nIndia immigration concerns\n\nIn India, the greatest worry about Trump is his stance on immigration especially U.S. H1B visas. These visas are crucial to India’s Information Technology industry. In an interview with the Economic Times, R Chandrashekhar, the President of Nasscom, India’s IT public policy body outlined his views on Trump’s visa plans:\n\n“If any of this materializes then certainly companies will have to deal with that. We do believe that the U.S. economy as a whole has a skill shortage in the stem area and in particular skill shortage in the IT related area. It is a reality given that by 2018 that shortage is only going to increase and there will be at least one million unfilled jobs because there are no people with those skills available.”\n\nTrump effect on Bitcoin and Blockchain\n\nTrump will have both a positive and negative effect on both Bitcoin and Blockchain. Bitcoin may actually stand to gain as Trump systematically destroys the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump’s actions on China and the Muslim world will have significant economic reprisals and the end of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency may be hastened. Many will advocate the adoption of Bitcoin and other currencies as reserve currencies instead.\n\nThe impact of immigration curbs may be negative as Silicon Valley and other border areas of the United States are significant IT hubs. The lack of labor will have immediate effects on the development of new projects, particularly by start-ups. The effect may moderate with the passage of time as domestic talent is developed.\n\nAlternatively, the immigration ban may be even more a part of the industry abroad where the visa restrictions maybe fewer. As we have seen in the first few days of the Trump presidency, his habit of issuing decrees causes significant upheavals and upsets.\n\nBitcoin in these times may act as digital gold and can be a storehouse of value and stability as it is unaffected by government policy and action.\n\nOverall, it is a not a bad time to be in Bitcoin but Trump is good for Bitcoin and Blockchain in the same way the eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera is.', 'This is a paid press release.

The second round, scheduled for the next full moon, i.e. February 11, 2017, at 00:33 (UTC) follows the first free bytes token offering held on Christmas Day 2016. Like the earlier launch-day giveaway, the Bitcoin community along with existing bytes holders stand to benefit from the upcoming distribution round.\n\nDuring the platform’s launch on December 25, 2016, Byteball offered bytes (native currency) and blackbytes (an untraceable private currency) for free to the Bitcoin community, proportional to their BTC holdings. The exercise saw over 70,000 BTCs linked to the distribution. Similarly, the second round of free distribution will be proportional to bytes and bitcoin holdings of the cryptocurrency community. The platform will be offering 0.1 gigabytes (GB) for every GB, and 0.0625 GB for each BTC held by the eligible community members.\n\n“In the new distribution, 1 GB holding receives the same share as 1.6 BTC. 1 GB is currently traded at 0.05 BTC.”\n\nByteball stands apart from other cryptocurrency offerings by adopting Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), an alternative to blockchain technology. It allows the platform to avoid scalability issues like the ones currently faced by the Bitcoin network.\n\nByteball is a cryptocurrency platform that aims to give people greater control over their funds through ease of use and user readable smart contracts. The ecosystem includes cryptocurrency wallets, a bot supported marketplace, a private untraceable currency, and more. It also integrates payments with an encrypted chat e.g. a recently launched trading chatbot allows people to exchange BTC to bytes and vice versa.\n\nByteball has a maximum cap of 10^15 bytes, out of which 99% are to be distributed in multiple rounds.\n\nAbout Byteball\n\nByteball is an initiative of a Moscow, Russia-based development team. The innovative cryptocurrency uses DAG protocol instead of the conventional blockchain, eliminating scaling issues. Byteball is a complete cryptocurrency ecosystem launched on Christmas day, 2016.\n\nLearn more about Byteball at - https://byteball.org\n\nByteball on BitconTalk - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1608859.0\n\nFollow Byteball on Twitter - https://twitter.com/ByteballOrg\n\nByteball’s Slack channel - http://slack.byteball.org\n\nMedia Contact\n\nContact Name: Anton Churyumov\n\nCompany Name: Byteball\n\nContact Email: byteball@byteball.org\n\nLocation: Moscow, Russia\n\nByteball is the source of this content.

At last, a $4 mln price tag was agreed upon to be fully paid in Bitcoin.\n\nThe buyer went on to purchase millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to initiate the transaction. At the time, Bitcoin was worth around $750 in the global Bitcoin exchange market. Once the buyer secured $4 mln worth of Bitcoin, he initiated the transaction and sent the payment to the real estate developer to close the deal.\n\n25 percent cheaper\n\nWhen the buyer initiated the final payment and sent the transaction to the real estate developer, Bitcoin drastically increased in value, surpassing the $1,000 mark to reach its all-time high market cap and price at $1,160.\n\nIn the end, the buyer profited $1.3 mln in the currency exchange rate, as Bitcoin rapidly rose in value due to economic uncertainty in China and the United States, triggered by the devaluation of yuan and increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nSingh said:\n\n“The buyer actually ended up making about 25 percent in the currency exchange rate, essentially, in the appreciation. He got a house for pretty much 25 percent cheaper.”\n\nBitcoin’s safe haven\n\nOver the past two years, Bitcoin has served the global financial industry as a safe haven asset and wealth protection tool against financial instability. While assets, bonds, stocks, and reserve currencies declined in value, the price of Bitcoin continuously surged due to the rising demand for the digital currency in major markets including China and the United States.\n\nSince the Indian government began to impose harsh regulations on gold, restricting its import and export and trading, Bitcoin has been perceived as digital gold or a virtual safe haven asset for investors and traders.\n\nThese unique and rare cases prove the efficiency and practicality of Bitcoin as a store of value and safe haven asset, which can be used to initiate large-scale transactions at ease and as a hedge against financial instability and economic uncertainty.', 'BitPesa, a prominent bitcoin payments startup that initially launched in Kenya in November 2013 before expanding its presence in countries in Africa and beyond, has announced a $2.5 million Series A round of funding.\n\nThe Series A round was led by noted US-based industry investor Draper VC, alongside participation from existing investors including the Digital Currency Group, Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital Management, BnkToTheFuture, Zephyr Acorn and FuturePerfectVC. US venture capital firm Greycroft LLC joins as a new shareholder and investor.\n\nBitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rosielleo revealed that the funds will be used to focus on customer acquisition and the company’s growth with a focus in Nigeria, BitPesa’s largest market. The company also sells bitcoin in Nigeria, alongside Kenya and Uganda.\n\nThe executive added:\n\nWe are well on our way to achieving our goal of becoming the largest licensed payment company in the UK, Europe and Africa that offers real-time settlement at wholesale FX rates to frontier and emerging markets, with best in class compliance and customer service.\n\nThe funding round also sees BitPesa’s Group Holdings move to Luxembourg. In Europe, the bitcoin payments company is licensed as an authorized payment institution in the UK by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority).\n\nFurthering Footprint\n\nBitPesa enables African users to buy and sell local African currencies through bitcoin, with settlements directly transacting to and from bank and mobile money accounts in Africa. As a payments processor, BitPesa’s services facilitates quick and cheap payments between East, Central and West African countries without the need for dated, time-consuming bank wire transfers. On an international scale, BitPesa uses bitcoin to exchange African currencies with other global currencies, negating the need to use the US dollar as the benchmark currency during a foreign exchange.\n\nThe latest funding round follows a ‘strategic investment’ by bitcoin mining giant BitFury in the company in early 2016. In February 2015, BitPesa received $1 million in new funding, having ended its first of operations in late 2014 with over $.17 million in equity. Altogether, it is estimated that BitPesa has raised over $5 million in funding since late 2013.\n\nLead investor Tim Draper offers an explanation for the ongoing success of the standout African bitcoin company. He stated:\n\nBitPesa is well positioned to dominate the huge market opportunity for digital payments across Africa and beyond. It takes a locally-based team to work in the evolving landscape of frontier market financial services, and BitPesa’s approach to investing in teams, infrastructure, and compliance from Lagos to London gives them a strong advantage.\n\nFeatured image from BitPesa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'By Alex Lielacher\n\nBitcoin’s rally above the $1,000 mark alerted not just the mass media, which was flooded with reports about the digital currency, but also sparked renewed interest among investors looking for new ways to generate high returns in the current low interest-rate environment.\n\nWhen bitcoin is viewed from an investment perspective, it is more often compared to gold than it is to other currencies. That is because bitcoin and gold have a lot in common as assets. Both are limited in supply, have functional use and are considered by many, despite their volatility, to be good stores of value. When gold and bitcoin were compared as investments over the last five years, bitcoin greatly outperformed the precious metal, generating an annualized return of 155 percent compared to gold’s annualized loss of 6 percent during the same period. These exuberant returns indicate that bitcoin is getting investors excited about the prospect of placing funds into a brand new asset class.\n\nBitcoin’s soaring value and its proven investor performance compared to the gold standard, are indicators that it is high time to weigh the opportunities and risks that come with investing in the world’s leading digital currency.\n\nOpportunities\n\nMany argue that bitcoin, like other currencies, has value only because people perceive it to have value. It is for this reason that many critics view bitcoin’s price development as nothing more than a bubble. However, there are drivers behind bitcoin’s excellent returns that have nothing to do with hype or speculative opportunism.\n\nMove Toward a Cashless Society\n\nIt is no secret that we are moving toward a cashless society as electronic payment services, such as debit and credit cards, mobile payments and mobile money are increasingly prevalent. This isn’t just a phenomenon in the U.S. and the U.K., where mobile payment systems Apple Pay and Android Pay are experiencing an increase in use, but also in developing nations such as India, where Prime Minister Modi has recently reduced the circulation of cash notes to push the country toward electronic payment adoption.\n\nIn an increasingly cashless society, bitcoin fits nicely into the equation as it can be used to make payments and international money transfers from any smartphone across the world. This is one of the reasons why the digital currency has seen such strong increase in demand in India over the last few months.\n\nIncreased Demand Out of Emerging Markets\n\nAs mentioned above, there is an increased demand for the bitcoin in developing countries. That demand comes in a large part from countries that are experiencing economic distress and weakening currencies. Countries such as Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Turkey have all witnessed a spike in demand for the digital currency as an alternative store of value and as a means to make digital payments as their sovereign currencies have lost substantial value.\n\nThere is real demand for a truly international currency that anyone with an internet connection can access.\n\nSimilar to gold, whenever there is large-scale economic distress or uncertainty, the price of bitcoin has the tendency to rally. That rally, then, is at least partly driven by genuine demand and not purely by price speculation.\n\nIndividuals Want to Handle Their Money Without Need for a Bank\n\nAnother reason for the increase in global Bitcoin demand is a desire for individuals to be their own bank. By storing part or all of one’s capital in a bitcoin wallet and using it to make payments for goods and services, anyone can become their own bank without the need for traditional banking intermediaries to conduct financial transactions. This development has been amplified by the growth of the Bitcoin economy, which now includes Bitcoin savings accounts, prepaid Bitcoin debit cards, Bitcoin peer-to-peer lending and a range of other services.\n\nRisks\n\nDespite Bitcoin’s impressive annualized returns since its inception in 2009, the reality is that the currency is still in its infancy and no one knows whether it will really become globally accepted or whether it will eventually disappear. This uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin’s future is reflected in its price volatility.\n\nWhen it comes to investing in Bitcoin, there are a few risks investors need to be aware of:\n\nRegulatory Risk\n\nProbably the biggest risk to the future success of Bitcoin as both a currency and as an investment class is regulatory risk. If China, for example, decides to ban its citizens from holding bitcoin, the price of the digital currency would crash. China is by far the largest market for bitcoin trading, with over 90 percent of trading occurring in the People’s Republic. Hence, any negative regulatory changes would have a direct impact on the world’s bitcoin investment.\n\nThe same goes for leading Bitcoin startup hubs like the U.S. and the U.K. Should any large economy ban Bitcoin the price will collapse and struggle to recover.\n\nBitcoin Scalability\n\nAnother risk to Bitcoin is the failure of the network’s participants to come to an agreement on how to handle scalability issues. For Bitcoin to succeed, the blockchain needs to be able to handle much higher transaction volumes than it is currently processing and it must be able to do so within a shorter period of time. Currently, Bitcoin transactions usually take 20 to 40 minutes, which is fantastic when making international money transfers but not so great when trying to pay for coffee.\n\nIdeas on how to scale Bitcoin have been presented by the Bitcoin Core development team and are currently under consideration for implementation. However, the vast majority of Bitcoin miners that support the blockchain need to agree with these changes before any significant implementation can be done. If no agreement is made, Bitcoin’s scalability challenges may lead to bitcoin struggling as a transactional currency in the long run.\n\nLarge-Scale Hacks on Bitcoin Companies\n\nThe potential of large Bitcoin companies and digital currency exchanges suffering losses from cyber attacks are a viable risk that has proven to have a strong impact on the price of bitcoin in the past. The hack of Mt. Gox in 2014 and the Bitfinex hack in August 2016 have both pushed down the price of the digital currency.\n\nResearch has shown that since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, about one-third of bitcoin exchanges have been hacked. Despite efforts to improve cyber security at exchanges and Bitcoin startups, the risk of large-scale hacks is real and one that will most likely occur again in the future. However, high profile hacks should only have short term effects on the price of bitcoin and should not really affect its long term price development.\n\nAltcoins Taking Over\n\nAnother risk often cited is that one or more superior digital currencies could overtake bitcoin and become the leading investment option. Bitcoin has some challenges, such as its scalability issue, which could be improved or alleviated by a new digital currency that could then go on to take bitcoin’s place. However, bitcoin’s first-mover advantage and the growth of its ecosystem have positioned it so firmly as the leading digital currency that this possibility seems rather unlikely.\n\nFurthermore, research has shown that the price of bitcoin has actually outperformed a basket of the most popular altcoins so even from an investment point of view, holding bitcoins might be better than betting on altcoins overtaking bitcoin.\n\n51 Percent Attack\n\nOne risk that not every investor is aware of is the potential for a so-called 51 percent attack. A 51 percent attack refers to one centralized Bitcoin mining operation gaining over 50 percent control of the blockchain, at which point it could reverse transactions, which would make the entire blockchain unusable as no trust would be left in the network. At this point in time, mining operations are spread out across the world and the Bitcoin network is fully decentralized. However, should one mining operation gain a significant amount of control over the blockchain close to 50 percent, the future of Bitcoin’s existence could be at stake.\n\nShould You Invest in Bitcoin Now?\n\nIn the first week of this year, we witnessed the price of bitcoin shoot past the $1,000 mark and inch close to its all-time high. However, shortly after peaking at $1,153.38 the price dropped by over 20 percent in only 24 hours after the People’s Bank of China issued a warning to its citizens about the riskiness of investing in Bitcoin and urged caution when investing. As China is the biggest market for Bitcoin, any announcements or action by Chinese authorities will have a strong impact on the global price. This correction spooked quite a few investors who had just jumped onto the bandwagon.\n\nThe abrupt 20 percent correction acted as an excellent reminder that bitcoin is still a very volatile asset and is only something for risk-loving investors. If you are looking for a stable store of value or a steady price increase over the course of a specific time period, then bitcoin is not for you. If you are looking, however, for the potential to double or triple your investment and are able to take potentially steep losses, then investing part of your portfolio in bitcoin might be the right move.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

There is no clarity yet about what parts of PayCash’s cryptocurrency businesses will be affected or whether they would still continue to operate.\n\nThe press release by Daimler mainly shows interest in the e-wallet and the e-payment side of the businesses operated by PayCash. It would be interesting though if by the acquisition of PayCash, there would be a possibility soon of buying a car directly from Mercedes and paying for it in Bitcoin.\n\nHowever Bitcoin can still help you drive your favourite car as some dealerships already accept the virtual currency. Of course you can always use Bitcoin and the neat profit that you earned holding it to buy yourself a brand new set of wheels.']"
