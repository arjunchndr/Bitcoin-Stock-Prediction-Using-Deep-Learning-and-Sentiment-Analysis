03/01/2017,"[""Bitcoin price has experienced a lot of volatility since the beginning of 2017. This is as a result of the combination of increased rate of adoption and the actions of governments in an attempt to regulate the Bitcoin environment.\n\nThe China effect\n\nChina has seen a lot of activities surrounding its peculiar Bitcoin community, most recent of which is the suspension of withdrawals by two of the biggest exchanges within the ecosystem due to regulation concerns. Despite the frequency of activities and news that has made the Bitcoin and altcoins market very volatile, players insist that there is a lot more to be seen within the space even as the year goes by.\n\nDirector at BitLox, Dana Coe, notes that so far in 2017 the regulatory tightening with respect to Bitcoin exchanges in China has been significant. However, he explains that the phenomenon is a bit of a conundrum, saying that governments have no reason to fear Bitcoin as a capital flight path.\n\nCoe says:\n\n“Truly, if someone takes RMB and buys Bitcoin, does this have any influence whatsoever on the RMB? The money stays in the country, no capital reserves of foreign currency are depleted and the velocity of currency use is increased (this is acknowledged by all economists as a good thing).”\n\nCoe notes that most of the regulatory action is in cracking down on what they perceive as overextending credit for speculative behavior, which in the real sense, is a thing that will correct itself.\n\nHe explains that as long as the governments make clear that losses are individual traders' responsibilities and that the markets are transparent, regulation will not be a permanent threat to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price trend remains upwards\n\nBitcoin Investor and technical analyst Jonathan Millet believes that there will be a significant upward pressure on the Bitcoin price in March 2017. His prediction is based on the perception of the public towards the resumption of Bitcoin withdrawals at the Chinese exchanges and the ETF decision.\n\nMillet also thinks that many more countries will become involved with Bitcoin regulation as the year continues. He notes that this is a positive development which reveals that Bitcoin is becoming more legitimate and welcome into the mainstream.\n\nHowever, Millet envisages yet more significant increases in Bitcoin price by the end of 2017.\n\nHe says:"", 'Kraken, which runs an exchange for trading bitcoin and other digital assets, has acquired Cryptowatch, a charting and trading platform.\n\nWith the acquisition, Kraken released an upgraded trading interface on Wednesday, too. Cryptowatch is used by thousands of traders to chart more than 150 markets in real time and trade as many as 22 digital assets. Terms were not disclosed.\n\nThe deal comes as bitcoin\'s exchange rate with the dollar is hitting all-time highs, partly on expectations that a proposed exchange-traded fund will receive SEC approval. The digital currency, controlled by no central bank or authority, is also seen by some investors as a gold-like haven from instability and capital controls.\n\nKraken founder and CEO Jesse Powell Bloomberg News\n\nArtur Sapek, Cryptowatch\'s founder, is joining Kraken to continue developing Cryptowatch and lead the development of Kraken’s interface, the buyer said.\n\n“I’m thrilled to welcome the Cryptowatch trading platform and its founder into the Kraken family,” said Kraken CEO Jesse Powell. “We plan to devote more resources and talent to further enhance its offering.""\n\nThe acquisition of Cryptowatch is the most recent in a series of deals struck by Kraken in the last year as it looks to leverage it global client base, add services and recrruit talent to its team.\n\nKraken previously acquired bitcoin exchanges Coinsetter, Cavirtex and CleverCoin, as well as wallet funding service Glidera. That firm will soon be rebranded as Kraken Direct.', 'OKCoin, one of the two Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, is demonstrating progress in sorting out user fund withdrawals. On Feb. 9, it was requested by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to halt Bitcoin and Litecoin withdrawals.\n\nOn March 1, OKCoin told their users that the exchange is approving the transfer of user funds stored on the global OKCoin trading platform to their Chinese site because the company’s .CN platform is nearly ready for approval by the PBoC and relaunch.\n\nEarlier in January, the PBoC asked OKCoin and Huobi, two of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in China, to suspend trading until their Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems are overhauled. The abrupt termination of OKCoin Bitcoin withdrawals stemmed from the PBoC’s initial warning sent out to Huobi and OKCoin on Jan. 18.\n\nAt the time, OKCoin operators announced a time frame of one month for the completion of their KYC and AML system update, which meant that users would not be able to withdraw their funds in Bitcoin or Litecoin for 31 days.\n\nHowever, OKCoin emphasized that the one month period could be either shortened or delayed depending on the development of their new industry-compliant AML and KYC systems. Since an AML and KYC update essentially led to the renovation of the entire platform, OKCoin and Huobi weren’t capable of providing a fixed date of withdrawal approval.\n\nOKCoin seeing progress\n\nOn March 1, OKCoin representatives told their users on WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging platform with over 700 mln users, that the exchange is approving the transfer of Bitcoin and Litecoin from their .com to .cn site.\n\nBasically, OKCoin is approving users transferring their user funds stored on the global OKCoin trading platform to their Chinese site because the company’s .CN platform is nearly ready for approval by the PBoC and relaunch.\n\nAn OKCoin representative stated:\n\n“Transferring Bitcoin from our domestic site to international site is not supported. But, transferring Bitcoin from international to domestic site is allowed.”\n\nAt the time of writing, it is difficult to conclude whether this means that OKCoin users will soon be able to withdraw their funds in Bitcoin and Litecoin. It is likely that these updates are being released within the Chinese community as the one-month deadline is approaching. According to their original roadmap, users should be able to withdraw funds on both Huobi and OKCoin in less than eight days.\n\nIncreasing demand\n\nOptimistic announcements from OKCoin and Huobi have coincided with the Chinese government’s decision to initiate quantitative easing or printing cash to inject into their economy. Financial analysts including Reuters have reported that the PBoC is eying a 12 percent increase in money supply in 2017, which means that the government intends to increase its money supply by trillions of yuan throughout this year.\n\n""It\'s not necessary to maintain last year\'s high money supply growth. A money supply rise of 11 percent should be enough for supporting growth, but we probably need to have some extra space, considering risks in the process of deleveraging,” a government insider told Reuters.\n\nThe demand for Bitcoin will most likely rise if the Chinese yuan continues to devalue as a result of inflation. If the Chinese government opts to match its 12 percent cash injection plan as reported by Reuters and local financial companies, the value of yuan is expected to decrease and the demand for safe haven assets or decentralized currencies like gold and Bitcoin will most likely increase.\n\nChina also recently lowered its projected economic growth, decreasing its forecasted growth rate from 7 to 6.5 percent.', 'Bitcoin mining pools are a mechanism for Bitcoin mining nodes to combine resources, share hashing power and split rewards on a pro-rata basis. With Bitcoin valued at all-time highs, and consumer adoption reaching an inflection point, transaction numbers are expected to grow significantly. The growth in daily commerce using Bitcoin will increase the importance of aggregated mining pools to verify and report transactions to the Blockchain.\n\nJohn McAfee, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of MGT stated, ""Our mining pool is a natural outgrowth of our investment in Blockchain technology as a foundation for future cybersecurity products. Large and respected Bitcoin mining operators will rapidly take over the enormous transaction processing requirements necessary for all companies to secure themselves in the near future. As a publicly-traded company, MGT leverages our unique opportunity to provide investors with a suitable proxy to participate in the profitable bitcoin mining space.""\n\nAbout MGT Capital Investments, Inc.\n\nMGT Capital Investments, Inc.

The release does not include many exciting features from an end user’s perspective; however, there are plenty of optimizations and tweaks that should help the software run better on any hardware.\n\nCleaning Up the Code and Improving Performance\n\nAccording to Schnelli, the main focus of Bitcoin Core 0.14 was to optimize the codebase and improve overall performance. “What we have done mainly is what you can never do in normal software projects, which is mainly refactoring [and improving] performance,” said Schnelli. “This was the main focus for [Bitcoin Core] 0.14. [It’s] a bit boring if you’re looking for new features.”\n\nAs a software contractor with roughly 20 years of experience, Schnelli noted that these sorts of performance improvements never happen in traditional, corporate software development because companies do not wish to spend resources on this type of work.\n\n“This is important if you want to survive the next years, but [there are] no features coming out of it directly,” Schnelli added.\n\nIn terms of the details of what was technically improved in terms of performance in Bitcoin Core 0.14, Schnelli pointed to the new signature cache, an extensive network refractor, and other various optimizations and cleanups.\n\nBetter Fee Estimation\n\nWith Bitcoin blocks more full than ever before, transaction fees are becoming a critical component of network. Miners are now receiving over 1 BTC in transaction fees in blocks on a regular basis, in addition to the 12.5 BTC block reward.\n\nAccording to Schnelli, Bitcoin Core is the most used resource when it comes to fee estimation. Many of the wallet providers in the Bitcoin ecosystem use the fee estimation model found in Bitcoin Core in some way.\n\nBitcoin Core 0.14 includes improvements to the ways fees are estimated, and the default confirmations target in the GUI has been lowered from 25 to 6. Schnelli did not provide specific details on the improved methodology found in Bitcoin Core’s new fee estimation algorithm in his talk.\n\nUsers can also now opt to have all of their transactions sent with replace-by-fee (RBF) support at startup, but this option is not enabled by default. A bumpfee RPC command was also added, although it requires RBF to be enabled.\n\nRelated to transactions, there is also now a persisted mempool, which means the mempool is stored even after a node is shut down.\n\nManually Pruning the Blockchain\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain has continued to grow much larger over the years, which increases the the amount of time involved in an initial sync. The good news is that, according to Schnelli, many old blocks are not needed and can be pruned.\n\n“Once you have built the UTXO set, which is the set of coins that are not spent right now, you can throw away the old blocks,” explained Schnelli. “You only need them for other nodes who want to become full nodes.”\n\nInstead of storing the entire blockchain, which is now over 100GB, users can store a pruned version of 550MB or more.\n\nAlthough pruning was originally introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.11, version 0.14 introduces manual pruning, which means users can manually prune the blockchain on their hard drive with an RPC command.\n\nAs Schnelli said, pruned nodes will perform all of the normal functions of a full node with the exception of transmitting old blocks to new nodes that are syncing with the blockchain for the first time.\n\nOther Improvements and User Warnings\n\nIn addition to the improvements mentioned above, there are also many other, smaller changes made in Bitcoin Core 0.14.\n\nUsers now have the ability to toggle network activity on and off as a way to save bandwidth, and a more efficient method of importing multiple keys or watch only addresses at once was also added.\n\nSome warning and activity messages were also added to better inform users about how to properly use the software. For example, a message has been added to warn users about typing certain commands into the console under the guidance of other individuals who are trying to scam them.', 'CoinDesk, the leading trade publication covering bitcoin and blockchain news, has a new CEO, its first: Kevin Worth, former CFO of Bloomberg Digital Media.\n\nWhile digital currency may be a non-traditional coverage area, the job otherwise looks like an obvious fit with Worth’s background in managing digital content businesses.\n\nIn the late 90s, Worth worked in corporate strategic planning at the New York Times. Then he was founding CEO of The Deal, the financial data and news site funded by investment banker Bruce Wasserstein. Worth stayed on for a year after The Deal sold to The Street. He spent the past couple of years as CFO of Bloomberg’s digital and television businesses.\n\nMany recent changes at CoinDesk\n\nJust over 12 months ago, in January 2016, CoinDesk sold to Digital Currency Group, the biggest investment firm in bitcoin and blockchain startups (with investments in over 90), led by Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket. DCG placed its own Ryan Selkis in charge of CoinDesk on the business side, but pledged that Selkis and DCG would have no involvement in editorial decisions at the site.\n\nSelkis was never CoinDesk’s CEO; Worth is its first. He will run business and editorial, the way that a typical magazine publisher would; the site’s editor is Pete Rizzo.\n\nKevin Worth, new CEO of CoinDesk More\n\nCoinDesk has 13 full-time employees. Last month, the site made its first acquisition: the bitcoin data app Lawnmower. Lawnmower’s historical price data and charts, as well as its staff, got folded into CoinDesk’s in-house research arm (which produces reports such as a new one on blockchains for insurance), a sign it is serious about the information-selling side of its business.\n\nDCG’s main interest in CoinDesk was always for Consensus, its live bitcoin conference in May, first held in 2015. Last year, the event attracted 1,5000 attendees. Worth, from his time at Bloomberg, has seen the growth of live events as a money-maker for publishers. These days, live programming is a vital arm of the business for news organizations like Time Inc, Business Insider, and Re/code.\n\nUnder Worth, expect CoinDesk to place further emphasis on two pillars: live events like Consensus, and research reports for a fee. “To me, if you look at where the value in the content marketplace is being created,” Worth says, “it’s live events and business information products. I see an opportunity for CoinDesk to gain a pole position in becoming the must-have, go-to resource for the industry.”\n\nWorth sounds more fired up about events and information than the news side, which is what CoinDesk is for many of its readers: a vital news outlet. He confirms that Consensus, for now, is his “main focus.”\n\nSo, moving forward, will CoinDesk look more like a data resource, or a news blog?\n\n“I think it’s a little all-of-the-above,” Worth says. “I can tell you that the playbooks I have had in the past think about having many different audiences, and how to serve all of them. What got me so excited about coming is that it’s pretty much a whiteboard.”\n\nA look at CoinDesk’s homepage on Feb. 28, 2017 More\n\nStory Continues', 'Dash has suddenly risen to the third position in digital currency ranking, increasing from around $8 to a stratospheric $37 in two months. It’s market cap now stands just above a quarter of a billion dollars, but is still far away from Ethereum, which has also risen to a total value of $1.4 billion.\n\nThe stratospheric rise appears to coincide with the release of a new software upgrade which, on the surface, seems to offer no significant new innovation. Why, therefore, has this currency suddenly risen so quickly and so high?\n\nOne cynical reason might be marketing. The digital currency is somewhat unique as it allocates around 10% of its monthly block rewards towards funding projects. One of them is Amanda B Johnson, the former presenter of The Daily Decrypt, who rebranded to “Dash Detailed” after being funded by the Dash network. Another one is Dashforce, which has received around $7,000 to promote the currency on social media.\n\nThe Dash network has also given the green light to fund integration with BlockCypher, a hot-wallet service, at a cost of nearly $100,000. Ryan Taylor, Director of Finance for Dash, has further asked the network to “cover the costs of integrating Dash into a major cryptocurrency exchange” in the sum of almost $80,000.\n\nBlockPay and the General Bytes ATM recently integrated Dash, but it is not clear whether either received any payment.\n\nThe Curious Story of Dash\n\nEvan Duffield, the founder of what now is known as Dash, sent an e-mail to the bitcoin mailing list on December the 29th 2013, advertising a position for “1 or 2 really good C++ programmer… to help with a for-profit startup.”\n\nAs you read the e-mail, you’ll notice some grammatical mistakes, such as “the work you’re done.” It’s not an exception. Such mistakes appear to be far too common and, overall, his writing is awkward at best. For example, in a post explaining the shambolic manner of Dash’s inception, Duffield uses such words as “I’ve have [sic] a rewarding career.”\n\nDash began on the 19th of January 2014, just weeks after that e-mail. Then, it was called XCoin. Almost two million of them were mined in just 48 hours after a launch that did not even include a windows client. Now, more than three years later, just over seven million coins have been mined in total. Explaining the event, Duffield pleads ignorance:\n\n“We launched later and immediately got stuck on block 42, I was new to the Bitcoin codebase and wasn’t sure what I missed so I announced we’d relaunch later.\n\nWhen we relaunched we had a rush of miners join causing a huge spike of coin production without it being able to adjust the difficulty quick enough, we just ended up spilling out coins. Retargeting happened every 576 blocks and could only increase the difficulty by four times, so it took about six retargets to get to a difficulty that was near 2.5 minutes per block.\n\nLater on, after the difficulty evened out we realized that there was a serious problem with the block reward calculation… I soon fixed this issue at block 4500, but none of us realized the amount of coins that had been issued at the time. At that point we didn’t even have a block explorer yet.”\n\nAs we all know, block explorers work by magic (they don’t), but even assuming he is not aware of how to run node commands and even taking him fully on his words, he appears to admit incompetence. Which is probably why he rebranded to Darkcoin.\n\nAs some of you may remember, DRK was constantly hyped in all corners, with the currency rising to new heights in 2014, to then come crashing down following a breakdown in network consensus. Duffield stated back then:\n\n“Since launching masternode payments the network has kept randomly forking. We’re not exactly sure what is the cause, but to stop this and restore stability we are going to fork to remove masternode payments.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether he ever found the cause, but this led to the currency being largely dismissed as its so called anonymous payments were not really that anonymous and its masternodes layer had problems. It kept dwindling in market cap with most forgetting about it, until recently.\n\nWho Needs Innovation?\n\nThe currency rebranded again from Darkcoin to Dash, presumably because the former had too much baggage and the later could perhaps swipe it under the carpet. It boasts two main features. Instapayments and a governance layer, with anonymity – which was taunted front and center in 2014 – now seemingly very much in the background.\n\nOn instapayments, the currency appears to mainly apply bitcoin’s first seen mechanism which used to work perfectly well until recently. That is, a transaction first seen by a node is highly likely to be confirmed as it propagates exponentially. A delay of even miliseconds is sufficient for the first transaction to be successful. This can be gamed, but in practice, it worked perfectly well for bitcoin until full blocks.\n\nDash’s governance model is interesting, but not binding. Masternodes – which are actually limited peer nodes despite the name’s implication – act as mixers and vote.\n\nOn voting, there are two aspects. Firstly, they vote to fund projects with 10% of monthly reward, which, if approved, is automatically sent to the proposer’s address. That is interesting on the surface, but what happens once the funds are approved? No one can sue the proposer for not delivering or for being incompetent, therefore, why should they deliver or do so competently?\n\nMoreover, these funds are paid by all token holders, yet only a small part of them are able to afford the $30,000 required for a masternode, and thus have a vote.\n\nCurrently, their votes are mostly approving proposals by Taylor and Duffield who receive some 88% of the funds. Those funds, together with the almost 2 million dash mined in the first 48 hours, can be used to run a masternode and thus “vote,” since the system is in no way Sybil resistant.\n\nMoreover, although masternodes barely provide any security, with their main service being a Coinjoin-like mixer, they nonetheless receive 45% of each block, paid by the coin holders. That translates to almost $40,000 a day.\n\nConsidering that actual miners, who secure the network, have to pay for hardware and electricity, logically, it doesn’t make sense to pay some mixers $40,000 a day, but, looked from a different perspective, it is a fairly smart design if you have a lot of coins.\n\nThe second function of these masternodes – to vote on protocol proposals – is fairly redundant. Duffield put forward a suggestion to increase the blocksize from 1MB to 2MB, even though their blocks are usually just ten transactions or less.\n\nIt was approved within 48 hours – a fairly amazing feat if these nodes are individuals. However, although Duffield is a Dash core developer, he hasn’t actually put forward a bigger block client for approval by miners whose vote actually matters.\n\nIn other words, there is no way of enforcing votes by masternodes since they hardly perform any other real function but to act as mixers – a service which is available for free rather than at a cost of $40,000 per day.\n\nThe Vacant Third Place\n\nThat means Dash will probably go back where it came from since it offers little, if anything, interesting. There is hardly any real innovation and the way it was launched can’t just be dismissed. Nor the potential, if not likelihood, that much of those almost two million coins might be running the vast majority of masternodes.\n\nThe third place, therefore, remains vacant. There is space for it, but so far, no currency fits the bill. Zec comes close, but bitcoin fills that niche fairly well. Moreover, ethereum plans to add much of Zec’s anonymity offers. Monero is a contender, but again it’s a niche already served.\n\nYou could say that due to bitcoin’s high fees and transaction backlogs, a bitcoin clone with some minor improvements might take the third place, but a more rational bet in those circumstances would be to go with the second biggest currency due to network effects and use eth which has retained the second place for quite some time.\n\nThe third place needs to be something innovative, something new, with a competent development team that radiates professionalism and thoroughness. Something substantial and different from bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nPerhaps a token, who know. It’ll be obvious when we see it. For now, personally, I don’t think it’s here and, in my view, it’s certainly not Dash.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It is intriguing to see bitcoin exchange companies grow their customer base over time. One of the service providers being transparent about their user growth is the Coinbase exchange. The company surpassed the 6 million users mark earlier this year, indicating the demand for bitcoin is still growing. Do keep in mind this number does not reflect the number of active users on Coinbase by any means.\n\nIt is always interesting to see how Coinbase grows their user base. Although it is unclear how they get so many users to sign up over time, it is impossible to deny the company’s success. According to the latest statistics, Coinbase has over 6 million users, which is a significant milestone. Albeit not all of these users are still active on the platform, getting 6 million people to sign up for a bitcoin exchange is no easy feat.\n\nOne thing that makes Coinbase appealing to users is how it is not just an exchange. The company offers a wallet service as well. In fact, one could argue the platform is a one-stop shop for everything bitcoin-related. Although not everyone may agree with this train of thought, Coinbase is more than a bitcoin exchange, that much is certain. However, it remains a centralized platform that only facilitates entry into the cryptocurrency world. Their wallet service should never be used to store funds long-term.\n\nA Big Milestone For The Coinbase Platform\n\nThe bigger question is whether or not it is good to see so many people rely on Coinbase. Multiple exchanges exist all over the world, yet Coinbase seems to be one of the frontrunners in this regard. The fact this company has come under scrutiny by the IRS goes to show they are attracting attention from the US government. Although Coinbase opposes this summons, some users are concerned about this development. Then again, the increase in users goes to show the company still enjoys a very solid reputation.\n\nSome Reddit users are quick to point out this number also includes people who have not even verified their account yet. It also contains the number of accounts with a balance of zero. While not everyone who signs up for Coinbase will continue to use it, it is still quite an impressive number. Using the platform to buy bitcoin in a somewhat convenient manner seems to be the primary use case, though.\n\nOne thing that surprises a lot of people is how 2 million new users signed up for Coinbase in the past six months. It is unclear if bitcoin’s price surge through the second half of 2016 has anything to do with this trend. It seems plausible the price surge sparked more interest in bitcoin and ways to buy cryptocurrency. Coinbase and other exchanges can reap the benefits from such trends, though, that much is certain.', 'Our global financial system moves trillions of dollars a day and serves billions of people. But the system is rife with problems, adding cost through fees and delays, creating friction through redundant and onerous paperwork, and opening up opportunities for fraud and crime. To wit, 45% of financial intermediaries, such as payment networks, stock exchanges, and money transfer services, suffer from economic crime every year; the number is 37% for the entire economy, and only 20% and 27% for the professional services and technology sectors, respectively. It’s no small wonder that regulatory costs continue to climb and remain a top concern for bankers. This all adds cost, with consumers ultimately bearing the burden.\n\nIt begs the question: Why is our financial system so inefficient? First, because it’s antiquated, a kludge of industrial technologies and paper-based processes dressed up in a digital wrapper. Second, because it’s centralized, which makes it resistant to change and vulnerable to systems failures and attacks. Third, it’s exclusionary, denying billions of people access to basic financial tools. Bankers have largely dodged the sort of creative destruction that, while messy, is critical to economic vitality and progress. But the solution to this innovation logjam has emerged: blockchain.\n\nHow Blockchain Works Here are five basic principles underlying the technology. 1. Distributed Database Each party on a blockchain has access to the entire database and its complete history. No single party controls the data or the information. Every party can verify the records of its transaction partners directly, without an intermediary. 2. Peer-to-Peer Transmission Communication occurs directly between peers instead of through a central node. Each node stores and forwards information to all other nodes. 3. Transparency with Pseudonymity Every transaction and its associated value are visible to anyone with access to the system. Each node, or user, on a blockchain has a unique 30-plus-character alphanumeric address that identifies it. Users can choose to remain anonymous or provide proof of their identity to others. Transactions occur between blockchain addresses. 4. Irreversibility of Records Once a transaction is entered in the database and the accounts are updated, the records cannot be altered, because they’re linked to every transaction record that came before them (hence the term “chain”). Various computational algorithms and approaches are deployed to ensure that the recording on the database is permanent, chronologically ordered, and available to all others on the network. 5. Computational Logic The digital nature of the ledger means that blockchain transactions can be tied to computational logic and in essence programmed. So users can set up algorithms and rules that automatically trigger transactions between nodes.\n\nBlockchain was originally developed as the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A vast, globally distributed ledger running on millions of devices, it is capable of recording anything of value. Money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be moved and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established not by powerful intermediaries like banks and governments, but by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and clever code. For the first time in human history, two or more parties, be they businesses or individuals who may not even know each other, can forge agreements, make transactions, and build value without relying on intermediaries (such as banks, rating agencies, and government bodies such as the U.S. Department of State) to verify their identities, establish trust, or perform the critical business logic — contracting, clearing, settling, and record-keeping tasks that are foundational to all forms of commerce.\n\nGiven the promise and peril of such a disruptive technology, many firms in the financial industry, from banks and insurers to audit and professional service firms, are investing in blockchain solutions. What is driving this deluge of money and interest? Most firms cite opportunities to reduce friction and costs. After all, most financial intermediaries themselves rely on a dizzying, complex, and costly array of intermediaries to run their own operations. Santander, a European bank, put the potential savings at $20 billion a year. Capgemini, a consultancy, estimates that consumers could save up to $16 billion in banking and insurance fees each year through blockchain-based applications.\n\nInsight Center Business in the Era of Blockchain Sponsored by Accenture How technology is transforming transactions.\n\nTo be sure, blockchain may enable incumbents such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Credit Suisse, all of which are currently investing in the technology, to do more with less, streamline their businesses, and reduce risk in the process. But while an opportunistic viewpoint is advantageous and often necessary, it is rarely sufficient. After all, how do you cut cost from a business or market whose structure has fundamentally changed? Here, blockchain is a real game changer. By reducing transaction costs among all participants in the economy, blockchain supports models of peer-to-peer mass collaboration that could make many of our existing organizational forms redundant.\n\nFor example, consider how new business ventures access growth capital. Traditionally, companies target angel investors in the early stages of a new business, and later look to venture capitalists, eventually culminating in an initial public offering (IPO) on a stock exchange. This industry supports a number of intermediaries, such as investment bankers, exchange operators, auditors, lawyers, and crowd-funding platforms (such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo). Blockchain changes the equation by enabling companies of any size to raise money in a peer-to-peer way, through global distributed share offerings. This new funding mechanism is already transforming the blockchain industry. In 2016 blockchain companies raised $400 million from traditional venture investors and nearly $200 million through what we call initial coin offerings (ICO rather than IPO). These ICOs aren’t just new cryptocurrencies masquerading as companies. They represent content and digital rights management platforms (such as SingularDTV), distributed venture funds (such as the the DAO, for decentralized autonomous organization), and even new platforms to make investing in ICOs and managing digital assets easy (such as ICONOMI). There is already a deep pipeline of ICOs this year, such as Cosmos, a unifying technology that will connect every blockchain in the world, which is why it’s been dubbed the “internet of blockchains.” Others are sure to follow suit. In 2017 we expect that blockchain startups will raise more funds through ICO than any other means — a historic inflection point.\n\nIncumbents are taking notice. The New York–based venture capital firm Union Square Ventures (USV) broadened its investment strategy so that it could buy ICOs directly. Menlo Park venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz joined USV in investing in Polychain Capital, a hedge fund that only buys tokens. Blockchain Capital, one of the industry’s largest investors, recently announced that it would be raising money for its new fund by issuing tokens by ICO, a first for the industry. And, of course, companies such as Goldman Sachs, NASDAQ, Inc., and Intercontinental Exchange, the American holding company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, which dominate the IPO and listing business, have been among the largest investors in blockchain ventures.\n\nAs with any radically new business model, ICOs have risks. There is little to no regulatory oversight. Due diligence and disclosures can be scant, and some companies that have issued ICOs have gone bust. Caveat emptor is the watchword, and many of the early backers are more punters than funders. But the genie has been unleashed from the bottle. Done right, ICOs can not only improve the efficiency of raising money, lowering the cost of capital for entrepreneurs and investors, but also democratize participation in global capital markets.\n\nIf the world of venture capital can change radically in one year, what else can we transform? Blockchain could upend a number of complex intermediate functions in the industry: identity and reputation, moving value (payments and remittances), storing value (savings), lending and borrowing (credit), trading value (marketplaces like stock exchanges), insurance and risk management, and audit and tax functions.\n\nIs this the end of banking as we know it? That depends on how incumbents react. Blockchain is not an existential threat to those who embrace the new technology paradigm and disrupt from within. The question is, who in the financial services industry will lead the revolution? Throughout history, leaders of old paradigms have struggled to embrace the new. Why didn’t AT&T launch Skype, or Visa create Paypal? CNN could have built Twitter, since it is all about the sound bite. GM or Hertz could have launched Uber; Marriott could have invented Airbnb. The unstoppable force of blockchain technology is barreling down on the infrastructure of modern finance. As with prior paradigm shifts, blockchain will create winners and losers. Personally, we would like the inevitable collision to transform the old money machine into a prosperity platform for all.']"
03/02/2017,"['Bitcoin price surpassed $1,228 earlier today on major Bitcoin exchanges including Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken and bitFlyer due to the industry’s optimism towards the Winklevoss twin’s Bitcoin ETF approval on March 11.\n\nDigital currency exchanges in Asian markets including Japan and South Korea, which control over 52 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market, have been facilitating Bitcoin trades in the range of $1,260 to $1,270, with a $50 premium in contrast to the global market.\n\nTraders on bitFlyer in particular, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange that processes 60 percent of trades of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market amounting to 94,520 Bitcoins per day, is still trading Bitcoin at $1,262, a value nearly $39 higher than Bitfinex and Bitstamp.\n\nSpeculation on Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nThe strong performance of Bitcoin price is a result of the speculation of the Bitcoin industry towards the approval of the Winklevoss twin’s Bitcoin ETF COIN, which is awaiting its final decision by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to be made public on March 11.\n\nPrior to the release of a memorandum on Feb. 22 by SEC Attorney and Adviser Neel Maitra, many analysts including Needham & Co Vice President of Equity Research Spencer Bogart noted the low probability of the COIN ETF being approved by the SEC.\n\nThe reason behind the prediction of Bogart was that if a Bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC and it does well in the public market, SEC officials or whoever that made the final decision to make the ETF public will not receive any form of incentive out of the deal. However, if the ETF fails and controversy emerges as a result, SEC officials will be responsible for their actions.\n\n“We have pegged the odds at less than 25 percent. That is because the very first thing the SEC lists in its own mission statement is protecting the investing public. When you think about the game theory aspect of this, if I work at the SEC and I approve this ETF. and it goes well, nobody is probably going to come around and pat me on the back and give me a promotion. But if I approve it and a lot of money flows into it, and something goes wrong, I am likely to lose my job,” said Bogart.\n\nIn other words, Bogart explained that it is a go-to decision for SEC officials to turn down any risky funds like the COIN ETF as they don’t benefit from the strong performance of the ETF but are still wholly responsible for the outcome of the ETF.\n\nSpeculations began to change in favor of the Winklevoss twins and the Bitcoin industry when the Feb. 14 SEC-Winklevoss twins roundtable discussion memorandum was released. In the memo, the SEC revealed that its Division of Trading and Markets, Division of Corporate Finance, State Street representatives, KCG Holdings, Susquehanna International, ConvergEx and BATs participated in the meeting to discuss the future of the ETF and its performance when approved.\n\nThe SEC brought in outside advisors in KCG Holdings and Susquehanna International to offer unbiased insights into how the Winklevoss twin’s Bitcoin ETF could perform in the near future.\n\nBased on the current Bitcoin price trend, it could go both ways. The Bitcoin ETF approval process on March 11 could either allow Bitcoin to achieve new highs again or lead to a short-term decline.', '', 'A bill that would have enabled North Dakota lawmakers to more closely study the issue of whether to regulate digital currencies failed to pass a vote yesterday.\n\nAt the second reading of the bill in the state\'s House of Representatives, the motion suffered a strong rejection, with 84 lawmakers voting against the bill, four approving and six abstaining.\n\nThe decision follows speculation by the legislature\'s Business and Labor Committee, which was reported earlier this month to be critical of the bill, according to local news sources.\n\nFirst introduced in the state senate in January, the bill eventually passed in a unanimous 46-0 vote, eventually moving on to the House of Representatives on 13th January.

The digital currency\'s price, billed as a faster, more user-oriented bitcoin, is up more than 100% in the past week, reaching a high of close to $60 today, according to CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nRising as much as 40% yesterday alone, market observers, traders, advocates and critics have taken to social media to give their take on the recent price ramp in a subject that has become a dominating discussion among traders and investors on Twitter.\n\nFor those who are new to the subject, dash – originally known as darkcoin prior to its rebranding – has earned its share of supporters and critics in the years since it launched.\n\nDuring that time, the digital currency’s public-facing image has shifted from one centered more squarely on financial privacy toward one that seeks to highlight its ease of use in online commerce.\n\nBut why is this price ramp happening now?\n\nSome have argued that a mixture of exchange integrations and plans for a user experience upgrade (among other technical updates) are behind the speculation that has led to the price increases. In their view, the increase is the culmination of years of development and expansion.\n\nOthers are alleging that the price increase is merely the front-end of the kind of pump-and-dump market scheme commonly seen in cryptocurrency markets with lower volumes. Further, some argue that ""whales"" – traders with large holdings – are effectively in control of the market.\n\nAllegations that the digital currency was the subject of an ""instamine"" scam – in which large amounts of coins were generated early on in its existence – have also resurfaced in light of the price rise, though the team behind dash has denied that the situation was as portrayed.\n\nStill, the rise could be a mix of trends in both areas – a combination of long-term enthusiasts and short-term traders who, eager to see gains and ride the momentum, are also throwing their hats in the ring.\n\nAt press time, the price of dash is up 12.5% on the day.\n\nWhat is dash?\n\nTo begin, dash is described by some as a two-tier network, one that relies on both miners and masternodes.\n\nThe network is secured by proof-of-work mining (the consensus mechanism bitcoin uses), while its X11 algorithm is based on eleven different hashing functions.\n\nThe masternode is a kind of proof-of-service layer. These nodes act as both transaction mixers and boosters, as well as voting mechanisms for the digital currency’s governance system.\n\nBlock rewards are divided between these two layers.\n\nMiners receive 45% of rewards, masternodes receive 45%, and the other 10% is allocated to the decentralized budgeting system that dash utilizes. That system enables users to vote to allocate resources for development, marketing and other purposes.\n\nScarcity factor\n\nOne factor that seems to be having a concrete impact on the price rise is the relative scarcity of coins available for trade on major exchanges relative to the total supply of dash.\n\nPoloniex data, for example, shows roughly 40,000 coins is available on the sell-side, with about 1,500 coins worth of buy orders.\n\nThis scarcity is further fueled by the use of masternodes.\n\nA masternode requires a deposit of 1,000 DASH, the network\'s cryptocurrency, funds that then generate income by receiving a portion of each mining block reward. Available data suggests that around 4,000 masternodes are being run today, meaning that more than half of the total coins in existence – about 7.1m – are locked up.\n\nChris Burninske, blockchain products lead for ARK Investment, has been tweeting his analysis of the market ramp-up, positing that the mix of an illiquid market and trading momentum is behind the push.\n\nBurninske had previously published a twitter analysis of the digital currency, asserting that, in his view, the only key metric that shows upward growth is that of trade volume. Others, including market analyst Willy Woo, have also taken a critical tack.\n\nIn a statement to CoinDesk, Dash director of finance Ryan Taylor said that dash is ""proving itself in a highly competitive field"", citing the project\'s approach to governance and functionality.\n\n“I believe that we are witnessing the market recognition of Dash as a true challenger to Bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency market. In a way that Bitcoin cannot, Dash is focusing on the user experience and applying payments industry best-practices into our product,"" he said.\n\nCorrection time\n\nThe analyses above raise the question of whether this price ramp will last in the long-term.\n\nData from Poloniex shows a big drop amidst today\'s trading, with the price hovering between $42 and $43 at press time.\n\nMany speculators on social media, including the official dash subreddit, seem to back the notion that the price is in the midst of a significant bubble.\n\nThat said, it\'s anyone\'s best guess as to whether the price will rise, fall or maintain a kind of status-quo from here.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin\'s price has seen significant momentum in recent days as well, hitting new all-time highs and even surpassing the per-ounce spot price of gold.\n\nGarrett Keirns co-authored this report.\n\nImages via Poloniex, Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'The deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India stated that Bitcoin is never going to replace fiat currency. Read more...\n\nThe strengthening Bitcoin community in the Indian market has elicited a response from the country’s central bank — the Reserve Bank of India. The Reserve Bank which was started exploring the cryptocurrency technology has responded like any other bank when it comes to Bitcoin usage.\n\nThe deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, R Gandhi was quoted in a leading Indian media outlet saying,\n\n“The emergence of bitcoins has led to some quarters predicting the end of the currency system itself. In my mind, it may remain a pipe dream that blockchain will eliminate currency.”\n\nGandhi was speaking at a technology summit organized by the Indian Banks Association. In the same speech, he is said to have mentioned the two characteristics of currency which is necessary for widespread adoption. According to Gandhi, currency should instill confidence among the users, and it shouldn’t be anonymous forever. He believes that the usage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are limited to a closed circle, filled with early adopters, adventurists, and risk-takers.\n\nHowever, Gandhi’s statement misses a couple of the main points. The confidence in money, especially the Indian Rupee hasn’t stayed the same since last year’s demonetization move. At the same time, cash transactions are more anonymous than Bitcoin transactions as the blockchain maintains a record of all the transactions happening over the network. Also, Bitcoin transactions can be tracked back to the user, which is probably much easier than tracking the cash movement throughout the economy.\n\nThe Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India also mentioned that most of the countries are currently in the process of printing more currency, with Nordic economies as an exception. In Gandhi’s view, the virtual currencies can’t be “mass used” as it is not backed by any underlying assets and the financial, legal, security and consumer protection risk is more. The possibility of hacking incidents was also mentioned during the session.\n\nThe points put forth by Gandhi, regarding Bitcoin adoption has few holes in it. Even though he is right about the challenges currently being faced by the digital currency when it comes to widespread adoption, it doesn’t make fiat a perfect currency. Also, the government and the central bank should work together to create favorable regulations to promote the use of Bitcoin and blockchain technology instead of finding ways to downplay the invention and its disruptive nature.\n\nRef: DNA India | Image: Shutterstock', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Leading global Bitcoin exchange Kraken finalized its acquisition of yet another Bitcoin company in Cryptowatch this week, to offer a variety of advanced and high-performance tools for the company’s international user base.\n\nOver the past two years, Kraken has transformed itself into a global Bitcoin powerhouse, establishing its strong presence in both the US and European Bitcoin markets. Kraken is the largest Bitcoin exchange in the European Bitcoin exchange market with over 46 percent market share and is also a strong contender in the US market, with around three percent market share.\n\nTo serve its global user base, expand its service into the US market and optimize platform efficiency, Kraken acquired various Bitcoin exchanges including Chicago-based non-custodial Bitcoin buying and selling service Glidera and Dutch Bitcoin exchange CleverCoin in the past.\n\nThe integration of Cryptowatch\n\nKraken’s most recent acquisition of Cryptowatch is slightly different to the company’s past acquisitions, as it is the company’s first acquisition of a Bitcoin data service provider.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell explained that the integration of Cryptowatch is important for Kraken as it allows both beginner and advanced users to benefit from a custom-designed visualization platform for their trading needs.\n\nPowell told Cointelegraph:\n\n“We acquired a market data company that has developed great charting tools and a fantastic trading interface. Market data, charting tools and trade interface are essential elements of a good exchange. So the technology and insight Cryptowatch brings to the table is a natural fit for our core exchange business.”\n\nOne of the key strategies the Kraken team aimed to implement by integrating Cryptowatch into its trading platform was to meet the demands and the needs of its rapidly evolving user base. As the exchange started to grow in size and the levels of traders varied significantly, the Kraken development team firmly believed that it needed to offer unique yet reliable service to serve its sizable user base.\n\nIn fact, Powell told Cointelegraph that consistent improvements of its trading platform and recognizing the needs of the company’s clients have been the two key factors behind the explosive and exponential growth of Kraken as an exchange.\n\nNewly improved trading platform\n\nIt was with this vision that Kraken very recently launched a newly improved trading platform with significant advancements in its user interface and operations.\n\n“Addressing the varied and evolving needs of Kraken clients by giving them the tools and resources they need has been key to retaining clients and attracting new ones,” said Powell.\n\nWith Cryptowatch embedded into the trading platform of Kraken, Cryptowatch founder Artur Sapek plans on continuing collaborating with Kraken to ensure the trading platform constantly delivers the best trading software in the global Bitcoin industry.\n\nIn its official press release, Kraken also announced that Sapek will join the Kraken team as the development lead of Kraken’s interface.\n\n“In just two years Cryptowatch grew into one of the pillars of the digital asset trading community. Teaming up with an exchange was the natural next step and Kraken was my first choice. The Kraken team has built a very mature and reliable exchange and I look forward to working with them to deliver the best trading software in the industry,” said Sapek.\n\nFull Interview:\n\nJoseph Young: Over the past few years, Kraken has transformed into a global trading platform for both average and high profile traders. Does the integration of Cryptowatch benefit regular traders? Or is it more for advanced trading?\n\nJesse Powell: By offering more customizable features through the Cryptowatch platform, both beginner and advanced traders will benefit by being able to tailor the experience to fit their respective trading needs.\n\nJY: Traders often look for visualization tools due to the unpredictability of Bitcoin price. How will Cryptowatch help users make better decisions?\n\nJP: Kraken is utilizing the central interface that grew to be so popular among Cryptowatch users, which offers the visualization tools traders need to take advantage of changing market conditions.\n\nJY: The Bitcoin community hasn't seen many exchanges acquiring data companies. Why did Kraken decide to acquire a data company in Cryptowatch and is this the direction Kraken wants to go? Also, do you think the acquisition of companies like Cryptowatch plays a factor in international expansion?\n\nJP: We acquired a market data company that has developed great charting tools and a fantastic trading interface. Market data, charting tools and trade interface are essential elements of a good exchange. So the technology and insight Cryptowatch brings to the table is a natural fit for our core exchange business.\n\nJY: Lastly, I’d really love to learn a little bit of the user growth of Kraken. It seems like Kraken is trying to provide a wide range of features to users to ensure Kraken's rapidly growing user base can benefit from a variety of services. Is this a fair assessment?\n\nJP: Absolutely. Addressing the varied and evolving needs of Kraken clients by giving them the tools and resources they need has been key to retaining clients and attracting new ones."", 'As businesses go, the music industry has witnessed significant changes over the years. First there were vinyl records, then there were cassette tapes. This was followed by CDs, and with the rise of Napster in the 1990s, we saw the advent of digital downloads. Now, of course, most of us stream the music we listen to.\n\n\n\nDespite this, though, the music industry is going through turmoil. According to a report from Forbes, the music industry has experienced a steady decline in profits. Yet, while it was reported that one trillion songs had been streamed in 2015, the people streaming aren’t paying huge amounts of money for the songs. English singer-songwriter James Blunt famously tweeted that thanks to Spotify, he gets paid only £0.0004499368 ($0.0005517475) per stream.\n\nTwo projects in the digital currency and blockchain space, Tatiana Coin and Musicoin, are creating ways for artists and audiences to connect with and support each other.\n\nTatiana Coin\n\nTatiana Moroz, singer-songwriter and a pioneer in the Bitcoin community, told Bitcoin Magazine that musicians earn, on average, less than a penny per stream in today’s music landscape.\n\nIn 2014, Moroz introduced Tatiana Coin (TATIANACOIN), a new way for musicians and fans to have a closer relationship while allowing the artist to earn a living at the same time. As the first-ever musical-artist coin built on top of Bitcoin (via Counterparty), it’s supported by Tokenly’s upcoming media ownership platform, token.fm, due to launch in Q2 of ’17.\n\nOwners of Tatiana Coin will have the opportunity to stream Moroz’s music, as well as lend, collect, sell or trade tokens. They will also have the chance to chat directly with Moroz, access unique multimedia content, buy personalized fan gear and have VIP experiences during her upcoming world tour, recording studio sessions and private concerts.\n\nIn February, Moroz launched the full band version of her single “Bitcoin Jingle.” She will be releasing her first studio album in five years on March 31 called Keep The Faith. As a friend and supporter of Ross Ulbricht, the album cover was originally drawn by him as a birthday present for Moroz.\n\n“After experiencing firsthand the troubles artists face trying to make a name for themselves, I sought a revolutionary way for artists and fans to help each other through incentivized financial support and social connectivity,” she said. “The only way to achieve this is through the power of the blockchain: a technology that presents countless opportunities for artists and musicians.”\n\nFor Moroz, Bitcoin was something that could help equalize the playing field, solving the problems of income, media distribution and fan relations within the music industry.\n\n“Imagine artists being able to organically grow and directly reach their fan base without the influence of third-party vendors that may not have the artists’ best interests in mind,” she said.\n\nMoroz is keen, though, to use her music to reach as many non-Bitcoiners and get them interested in digital currency. Moroz said that through a mix of song performances and storytelling with her talks, she illustrates the benefits of digital currencies to make it more engaging for her audience.\n\n“I want to enlighten artists and musicians on a transformative technology that allows for true artistic freedom and creates a fair, transparent economy,” she said. “At the same time, I want to create greater access to and rewards for fans who believe in the work of artists.”\n\nSince the launch of Tatiana Coin, artists have been very receptive of the technology, said Moroz. In her opinion, musicians have been the “slave class in the industry,” so the time has come for disruption. In her home base of New York, Moroz wants to spearhead a grassroots effort to engage artists. However, she believes this technology can help streamline and power all aspects of the industry to benefit everyone.\n\n“I am excited to see this platform begin to connect communities directly with creatives, and keep the middleman services as optional and transparent,” she adds.\n\nMusicoin\n\nMusicoin, which was created by Brian Byrne, Isaac Mao and Dan Phifer, is a decentralized system for the publication and consumption of music, combining a cutting-edge digital currency with a peer-to-peer file sharing network, which aims to bring a level of transparency and fairness to the music industry. It does this by allowing musicians to license their content via a “coded contract” directly to the blockchain. With the contract, they automate the collection and distribution of royalty payments, which remain in the control of the artists themselves.\n\nEach time an artist’s track is played, the “pay per play” contract is executed by the system, resulting in a payment using the Musicoin currency. This is sent directly from the listener to the musician, who has granted the listener access to a specific piece of work.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Byrne said Musicoin is solving the problem that musicians face by keeping artists connected to their music.\n\n“They know that by using Musicoin, without fail or question, that when someone hits play on our platform that payment goes directly to them,” he said. “A real transaction that is transparent with no intermediary.”\n\nAs someone who has been a recording and touring artist, Byrne said that he understands what it’s like to try and navigate contracts with record labels and managers while watching the misuse of funds and the failed answers to royalty payments.\n\n“When I was first introduced to this idea by Isaac and Dan, I knew without a doubt that this was something I would fight for, to see it come to fruition and let every artist know about it,” he said.\n\nAccording to Musicoin, over 80 percent of royalty fees are kept by intermediaries, which, prior to the digital age, helped musicians to organize, plan, record, produce and distribute their music. Since then, that role has expanded and it is for that reason musicians can’t make a living.\n\nHowever, through Musicoin’s theory of the Sharism Model, each playback represents an exchange between the musician and the listener.\n\nAs a project that is self-funded with no ICO, no pre-allocation to the founders and no pre-mining, Byrne states that their aim is about leveling the playing field, putting the artist first and figuring out the problem.\n\nByrne says that even though there will be those who don’t think the platform will work, the feedback so far has been positive.\n\n“Everyone seems to be really thrilled with the idea, how it works, the support in the community and the potential it has,” he said.', 'BITCOIN\n\nOne of China’s “Big 3” digital currency exchanges has removed trading fees—temporarily—on U.S. dollar-based bitcoin trades.\n\nBTCC announced that effective March 1, the “BTCC USD Exchange will temporarily remove all trading fees, meaning 0% fees for both maker and taker orders. This promotion will continue until March 31st, 2017.”\n\nThe promotion, however, applies only to the company’s international exchange site. Fees will remain in place at the company’s Chinese exchange platform, BTCChina.com.\n\nTendai Musakwa, a representative for the digital currency exchange, told CoinDesk that the surprise promotion was a “tactical move” to outmaneuver rivals by focusing on the company’s international reach.\n\n“We’re now focusing on growing more. Part of that includes learning from experiences operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange,” Musakwa told the news outlet.\n\nBTCC’s promotion comes amid the changes in China’s bitcoin sector following the recent crackdown on domestic digital currency exchanges. If you recall, People’s Bank of China warned bitcoin companies to enforce anti-money laundering and foreign exchange regulations.\n\nThe warnings prompted domestic bitcoin-related businesses, including leading exchanges Huobi, OKCoin and BTC China, to halt bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals on their platforms while they undergo an upgrade to fight “money laundering, exchange, pyramid schemes and other illegal activities.” BTC China extended the hold on withdrawals until March 15, while the company continues to audit its system.\n\nWith the withdrawal freeze, existing BTC China clients are unable to get their digital currency deposits out, but the company said withdrawals in Chinese yuan are still allowed, “if customers want to withdraw funds within a shorter period, they can first trade their bitcoins and litecoins for CNY on the exchange and then withdraw the CNY.”\n\nThe three bitcoin exchange operators started charging 0.2 percent trading fees per transaction to all their users after PBoC officials said they discovered the three were offering a loan feature, which the central bank said not only violates the country’s rules but also caused bitcoin’s volatility.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin has surpassed that $1,200 level, trading at $1,226.8 early Thursday morning.\n\nComments', ""Cointelegraph is thrilled to announce that the first part of our awesome Blockchain Oscar starts today.\n\nDuring the upcoming three days our expert board of judges will be scrutinizing project proposals submitted by our participants.

03/03/2017,"['Bitcoin jumped to a new high Friday, a day after soaring past the price of an ounce of gold for the first time.\n\nOne unit of the virtual currency was trading above $1,292.71 at 7:30 a.m. in New York, compared with $1,226.89 for an ounce of gold. The metal’s had a terrible week, declining for the fourth time in five days.\n\nThe latest surge in bitcoin’s value has been attributed to tighter currency restrictions in countries such as China, India and Venezuela, as well as speculation about prospects under the Trump administration.\n\nBitcoin still has a lot to prove, John Butler, head of wealth services for GoldMoney, said in an interview.\n\n“We’re a long way from bitcoin establishing its properties as anything that could be considered to be a reasonably stable store of value,” Butler said. “The fact that it’s passing through gold is just arbitrary.”\n\nChina’s three biggest Bitcoin exchanges suspended withdrawals last month after pressure from the People’s Bank of China, which was concerned people were using bitcoin to move money out of the country, sidestepping official efforts to shore up the yuan.\n\nInvestors may also be betting on a more relaxed regulatory environment under U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to rule on a proposal for an exchange-traded fund based on the digital currency by March 11.\n\nQuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain\n\n“Some people may be frontrunning what they see as the ETF demand down the road,” Butler said.\n\nIn January, the volatile cryptocurrency passed its 2013 peak of $1,137. After the previous peak, it fell 53 percent in less than a month.\n\nCommerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch noted “the small size of the [bitcoin] market” and “low level of distribution, the lack of general understanding of the concept, the short history of bitcoins, their extreme price volatility and the high proportion of speculators.”\n\n—With assistance from Eddie Van Der Walt.', 'Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor Rama Gandhi has implied confidence in virtual currency can only come about if authorities endorse it.\n\nIn cautionary remarks on Bitcoin and Blockchain on Wednesday, the central bank senior also said decentralized technology overtaking traditional forms of tender is a “pipe dream.”\n\n“It may remain a pipe dream that Blockchain will eliminate currency by ushering in virtual currency,” he commented, further adding that “it is unlikely.”\n\nGandhi’s remarks come amid fervent trading in Bitcoin and altcoins Ethereum and Dash, in particular, pushing all three to test or exceed all-time high price points.\n\nIn Bitcoin’s case, he says, this could nonetheless be simple early-stage hype.\n\n“The initial round is always filled with adventurists and risk seekers. The moment masses gets in, the risk avoiders get in and they will need greater confidence for its acceptance and continuance,” he continued.\n\nThis “confidence,” allegedly, can only come from authorities like the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nIndians meanwhile continue to feel the effects of Narendra Modi’s shock currency reforms in November last year. In the latest headache for lay consumers, the government and central bank appeared to contradict each otherwithin 24 hours on the status of printing new banknotes.', 'Blockchain: More Than Bitcoin\n\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency are relatively new. Most people might even think that Bitcoin — invented just in 2009 and probably the most popular blockchain-based cryptocurrency out there — is the only one of its kind. But blockchain is more than just Bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain is a digital ledger of transactions. It’s public and is not governed by a central body. As such, there’s a relative level of transparency coupled with security through cryptography. In other words, it’s safe and reliable, and monitored by hundreds of miners who keep these ledgers. It’s quickly becoming of interest to not just existing financial markets, but humanitarian and sustainability efforts.\n\nAt the moment, blockchains are most frequently used for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But it has other uses — like what distributed public blockchain network Ethereum does. Instead of focusing on just digital money like Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain runs the programming code of decentralized applications, allowing for enterprise use. Transactions in the Ethereum network rely on a crypto-token (also known as security tokens) called Ether.\n\nThe Future of Blockchain\n\nNow, Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency research and development company IOHK wants to open new doors in blockchain research. IOHK was established in 2015 by Jeremy Wood and Charles Hoskinson, one of the founders of Ethereum. They’re planning to invest up to $1 million in two facilities for research: one at the University of Edinburgh, and the other Tokyo Institute of Technology.\n\nThe labs will cover topics such as cryptography, smart contracts, and how to upgrade cryptocurrency systems. Best of all, their research will be open source and accessible to everyone. “This is commonly not done in the startup setting,” Hoskinson told Business Insider. “Usually, this is something you do if you’re a company like Microsoft — Microsoft has research campuses at many major universities.”\n\nHoskinson also said that setting up these research labs can provide perspective and better understanding of the growing blockchain technology. “After having discussions, they [the experts] said, actually we don’t have answers to a lot of these fundamental questions,” explained Hoskinson. “We said, how do we get those answers? And they said, we need to write some papers, we need to do some basic research. Over time we started moving into the university research space.”\n\nWe already know that blockchain is more than Bitcoin, but now that there will be research labs dedicated to understanding its potential, the future of the technology is bound to develop rapidly. The days of digital cash becoming globally dominant could arrive sooner than we think.', 'Exchange Bitfinex platform has added new markets for dash, the digital currency that has seen big price moves this week.\n\nThe addition is actually the second time the exchange has listed the currency, formerly known as darkcoin. It was added in June 2014, only to be removed in August 2015 due to ""persistently low trading demand"". That original listing, too, came during darkcoin\'s 2014 market ramp, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitfinex said today that it is launching new trading pairs for the currency, denominated in USD and bitcoin.\n\nThis week\'s price rise around dash – which originally focused on financial privacy as darkcoin before a rebranding and shift toward broader consumer use – has raised questions among some market observers as to what exactly is underpinning the market moves.\n\nWhile advocates say that the digital currency is drawing in serious investors, others contend that a mixture of illiquid order books and action by traders with big holdings – known more commonly as ""whales"" – are driving the price ramp.\n\n“The partnership is recognition of the way the market has been responding to Dash’s vision and roadmap,"" Daniel Diaz, VP of business development for the project, said in a statement.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Canada’s Bodog founder and entrepreneur, Calvin Ayre, is teaming up with the self-proclaimed creator of bitcoin to file international patents on the digital currency that relies on blockchain technology.\n\nAccording to news wire Reuters, the online gambling entrepreneur is working with Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who says he’s the man responsible for bitcoin. The duo reportedly plan to file numerous patents in Britain that would provide them with exclusive rights on specific elements of digital currency.\n\nThe patents, according to the news outlet, “range from the storage of medical documents to WiFi security.” Wright has filed over 70 patents in the UK to date, though none have yet been approved.\n\nNeither Ayre nor Wright spoke to Reuters for the news outlet’s lengthy special report, but on his Facebook page, the internet gambling businessman took a line out of President Donald Trump’s playbook in denouncing the article.\n\n“Interesting read but it’s amazing what passes for reporting in the age of fake news,” Ayre posted. “I think Reuters has been hacked by relying on fake documents.”\n\nBit of Confusion\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital monetary unit, meaning no bank or financial institution oversees or regulates its transactions. Instead, blockchains are maintained by peer-to-peer computer programmers who work on a public ledger. The virtual currency is used anonymously, making it an attractive payment method for black market activities.\n\nAyre has made a fortune off Bodog, his online gambling website that he operates from Antigua. The State of Maryland indicted Ayre on charges of operating an illegal internet gambling company in 2012, but he’s refuted the charges and remains outside the jurisdiction of US federal agents.\n\nReuters seems to hint that Wright’s holding company, which is also based out of Antigua, is directly related to Ayre.\n\nIn documents published by the Australian Tax Office, an agency that is investigating Wright, the computer programmer said in 2014 that he was producing online casino software when he developed the code for bitcoin. One source even says Wright worked directly for Bodog.\n\nLast May, Wright made a public revelation that he was in fact “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the mysterious person who was alleged to have designed bitcoin. But plenty of skeptics remain.\n\nBitcoin Bubble\n\nLike the US stock market, bitcoin is on a roll. The currency is trading at its all-time highest levels, with each coin going for nearly $1,300. On January 1, it was just $434. The current valuation even puts bitcoin ahead of an ounce of gold ($1,226).\n\nOne bitcoin expert predicts the price will reach $11,000 in the next two years.\n\nHowever, bitcoin remains a highly vulnerable investment asset, as governments and banks around the globe, continue to look at its legality and how it can be used for illicit purposes, such as money laundering.\n\nBut Ayre remains bullish, and he isn’t alone. But with so much uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency’s potential future, the online address Bitcoin.casino was recently sold for just $28,000 to a Florida-based company.\n\nChina is trying to outlaw the use of the digital monetary source until a regulated system can be put in place to monitor the flow of money and restrict assets from moving out from under the government’s control. In the US, bitcoin has been classified as a commodity by federal authorities, and last fall a district court judge ruled that bitcoin indeed qualifies as real money.', 'Blocks on the Bitcoin network have been increasingly full lately, except for some of the ones mined by AntPool, which is the largest mining pool on the network. In the past 24 hours from the time this article was written, every non-empty block mined by someone other than AntPool was practically full of transactions, nearly up to the 1 MB limit.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the details regarding these smaller blocks.\n\nLeaving Some Transactions Behind\n\nRecently, AntPool has been mining a number of blocks with sizes of around 99 KB, 369 KB and 860 KB. There were dozens of blocks mined around these specific sizes during the month of February. During the times these blocks were mined, everyone else on the network was filling blocks with transactions up to the 1 MB capacity limit.\n\nIn addition to the non-full blocks mined by AntPool, the mining pool also created 16 empty blocks in the month of February. The total amount of transaction capacity lost by the network during this time as a result of AntPool’s small blocks is not difficult to estimate. Numbers shared by BitFury’s Alex Petrov show AntPool’s average mined block size in February was around 100 KB less than other mining pools of comparable size.\n\nThe number of transactions in a block can vary, but at an average transaction size of 500 bytes, 100 KB would amount to roughly 200 transactions. With 768 blocks mined, AntPool essentially included 153,600 less transactions in February than other large mining pools, such as BitFury or F2Pool, which would have mined with a similar share of the network. This is roughly half of the total number of transactions that are mined on the entire Bitcoin network per day.\n\nAccording to data available on Blockchair.com, AntPool’s 99 KB and 369 KB blocks became more frequent on February 2, while the 860 KB blocks did not become more frequent until February 23.\n\nThis Is Not the First Time\n\nThis is not the first time AntPool has mined small blocks with transactions readily available in the mempool. The issue of small blocks also popped up late last year.\n\n“AntPool is designed to be decentralized, and we have mining nodes distributed around the world, each with its own Bitcoin client, so that when one pool node [finds a] new block, the synchronization of [that] block will [take] a certain time, and we will construct [an] empty block or small block using only the block header,” an AntPool representative told Bitcoin Magazine in an unpublished comment at the time.\n\n“And in order to solve this problem, we developed a new block broadcast system. Blocks can be broadcast to the world in 1 to 3 seconds through this system. The recent system is the final testing, and now there will be some empty or small blocks, but after we finished the test, the probability of empty block[s] appears to [be] a minimum, and we will open source system.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the recent string of small blocks has also been caused by testing mining-related software.\n\nIn addition to these issues with small blocks, AntPool has a preference for mining empty blocks, presumably because the pool engages in spy mining or other optimization strategies. “Sorry, we will continue mining empty blocks,” Bitmain Co-CEO Jihan Wu tweeted a little over a year ago. “This is the freedom given by the Bitcoin protocol.”\n\nBitmain is an ASIC mining hardware manufacturer and also runs the AntPool mining pool.\n\nThe number of empty blocks mined by AntPool and other mining pools has massively declined over the past year or so.\n\nWhen asked for specifics on why AntPool is not mining full blocks whenever possible, an Antpool representative did not have any comments to share with Bitcoin Magazine.', 'If you\'ve been watching bitcoin prices lately, you already know they\'ve made a record-setting run. As of this writing, a single bitcoin is valued at almost $1,300, more than an ounce of gold. To put things in perspective, bitcoin values were in the $300 -- $400 range for much of 2015.\n\nSEE ALSO: Betting on Bitcoin\n\nThose who invested in bitcoins years ago are likely rejoicing. But, should you join them? Continue reading to learn more about bitcoin, how the currency works, and why this investment might be one to skip despite its high returns.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nGenerally speaking, bitcoin is a crypto-currency used by online firms and big businesses worldwide. One of the biggest advantages of bitcoins is that the currency can cross borders easily -- facilitating international trade.\n\nFor the purposes of investing, bitcoins are similar to any other currency (or commodity) investment. This means, when it comes to your investment return, bitcoins face the same uphill battle as investing in:\n\ngold\n\nagricultural products\n\nfine art\n\noil\n\nIn other words, at any given time, bitcoins are worth whatever the market says they\'re worth. While this isn\'t a problem in itself, investing in bitcoins does pose some specific challenges. As sexy as investing in bitcoins sounds -- and despite the recent run-up in price -- there are at least two fundamental problems with investing in bitcoins right now:\n\nPROBLEM #1: YOU LOSE MONEY AFTER INFLATION (NEGATIVE REAL RETURNS)\n\nWhen you invest in bitcoins (or gold, or oil, or other commodities, or any other currency, or fine art), you are betting the farm on price appreciation alone. Or rather, you\'re betting that the price of bitcoins will go up compared with the U.S. dollar. What this means is, bitcoins are different from more conventional investments like stocks, bonds and real estate. That\'s because conventional investments offer the chance to generate cash.\n\nAs an example, stocks are a slice of business ownership. Businesses exist to earn a profit. As an owner of that business, you are entitled to a slice of that profit.\n\nThat profit can either be re-invested into the business (to increase the value of the business) or paid to investors as dividends. Either way, a stock generates cash -- ultimately enriching those who own shares.\n\nThe same is true for bonds. Bonds spit out cash (usually twice a year). With a bond, you (usually) get back your original investment, plus interest.\n\nThe same applies to real estate. Rental property can appreciate (or depreciate) in price. But, either way, rental property exists with the goal of generating cash for the investors -- cash above and beyond the costs to maintain the property.\n\nUnfortunately, that\'s not the case for bitcoins, gold, ""Forex,"" commodities or fine art. These sorts of investments do not generate cash. Instead, investors can only hope they rise in value with the price of inflation.\n\nDespite their volatility, commodities do not outpace inflation. And that\'s before fees!\n\nUnfortunately, you are likely looking at a negative real return after expenses with an investment like bitcoins. Why? Because it costs money to get into bitcoins. You must ""buy"" them, and you won\'t be able to buy bitcoins at their value. You\'ll have to pay a little extra; otherwise, the person selling you the bitcoins (or gold, etc.) has no incentive to do so.\n\nStory Continues', 'Stratis, a powerful and flexible Blockchain development platform, has announced the Breeze Wallet which is said to redefine transactional privacy in the Bitcoin space and introduce new privacy features.\n\nChris Trew, founder and CEO at Stratis, chatted with Cointelegraph about the project explaining what makes it so innovative.\n\nAccording to Trew, privacy protection is a huge issue in the cryptocurrency space:\n\n“The security and the integrity of the system is backed by cryptography, much in the same way that Bitcoin is. The Breeze Wallet will offer its users a level of privacy not available in any existing Bitcoin wallet. It provides an end-to-end privacy solution for Bitcoin and Stratis users, that works with today’s Bitcoin protocol and does not require any forks.”\n\nMoving privacy protection to the next level\n\nBreeze Wallet is indeed a quite ambitious Blockchain project. It is a result of several years of development on various components and features that aim to build a cryptocurrency wallet moving privacy protection to a whole new level, and not only when it comes to making transactions but also when connecting to the network and downloading Blockchain data.\n\nBreeze Wallet combines the innovative TumbleBit solution and privacy enhancements introduced by the Full Block Secure Payment Validation System. Stratis aims to offer a truly trustless and decentralized privacy protocol on the Stratis Blockchain and its private chains while working with financial services regulators to ensure full compliance.\n\nWhy TumbleBit?\n\nTrew explained that the TumbleBit solution is indeed the perfect fit for Breeze Wallet. Here’s why. First of all, TumbleBit transactions are truly private and unlinkable, meaning that no participants, including the tumbler, can steal coins. Moreover, no one, including the tumbler, can deanonymize user transactions.\n\n\n\nTumbleBit addresses the Bitcoin privacy issue by utilizing off-chain transactions, which cannot be linked by any participant or the Tumble itself. These off-chain transactions do not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol.\n\n\n\nBesides, TumbleBit allows thousands of users to set up payment channels with the same intermediary. Allowing all participants to send Bitcoins to one another through an intermediary. These payment channels between the intermediary and all participants are replaced by sophisticated cryptographic puzzles.\n\nTrew explains:\n\n“If User A can provide the solution to the puzzles, he can claim a Bitcoin. The trick with TumbleBit is that User B buys the answers to these puzzles from the intermediary for a Bitcoin. User A then sends the answer to User B as payment, which User B will accept as one Bitcoin can be claimed. Most importantly, this process is completed utilizing several layers of cryptography. This ensures that the intermediary does not know which solution he sold to which User A, nor do the User A know which puzzle solution they gave to User B. As such, once the users claim their Bitcoins, the intermediary sees that puzzles are solved. But due to the anonymity in numbers, the intermediary cannot link any of the participants to each other.”\n\nDisrupting Bitcoin space\n\nTumbleBit is compatible with the Bitcoin protocol, which makes it the only viable choice for this particular purpose. The Stratis team is hopeful that the deployment of TumbleBit will bring additional benefits for building Bitcoin-to-Stratis exchange protocol making Stratis available to millions of BTC users globally.\n\nBesides, TumbleBit provides significant benefits when it comes to addressing scaling issues, however, the Stratis team preferred not to reveal any details on that matter at this time.\n\nAdam Ficsor, one of the contributors to the TumbleBit research paper and the official implementation of TumbleBit NTumbleBit, is assisting in the development of full block SPV wallet in C#.\n\nFicsor commented:\n\n“Everyone who is not using Bitcoin Core has already had all their addresses linked together by third parties. This is not a theoretical ""assume the worst case"" strategy, this is a reality. The third parties are either the central servers your wallet relies on or in the case of SPV wallets, all Blockchain surveillance companies. Bitcoin Core retrieves all the information the Bitcoin network has, thus defeating network analysis attacks. Of course, running Bitcoin Core is not a walk in the park, a full-block downloading SPV wallet would be a much lighter solution. This is why Bitcoin Core has it in the pipeline and why we are also developing one. Even if you are not interested in using TumbleBit, but you care about your privacy, you should consider changing wallets.""\n\nNicolas Dorier, the developer of NTumbleBit, the official implementation of the TumbleBit protocol, is among the project contributors. Stratis has recently expanded a team of developers to work on this project and to accelerate its development. The first release of the Breeze Wallet is expected within two months.\n\nOnce again, Breeze Wallet is an ambitious project but is believed to revolutionize the Bitcoin space and certainly increase the competition on the market of Bitcoin wallets. When released, it will become the first wallet which addresses privacy issues without the need for soft or hard forks.', 'From Goldman Sachs to Visa to Accenture, major firms across the financial services landscape have invested in Bitcoin and blockchain startups. So far, over $1.4 billion has been injected globally into blockchain ventures, highlighting the craze surrounding the technology.\n\n\n\nIn the financial services industry, the blockchain is perceived by many as a revolutionary technology that could help banks save billions in costs, increase efficiency and reduce risk.\n\nAccenture estimates that blockchain technology could allow financial institutions to save between $8 billion and $12 billion in annual infrastructure costs. Capgemini, a French consulting firm, claims that consumers could save up to $16 billion in banking and insurance fees annually through blockchain-based applications.\n\nThere has been plenty of noise, no doubt, but deep down, is there any substance? Where are we currently standing in terms of development and implementation? And what should we be expecting for the year to come?\n\nAccording to Benjamin Jessel, managing principal at Capco and a blockchain expert, 2018 will be the year blockchain technology comes into production. He names lending, CDS swap trade and post-trade lifecycle, trade finance and business-to-business payments as some of the areas that would first benefit from blockchain technology.\n\nJessel has 12 years of experience in managing technology change within large-scale business transformation programs. Over the last two years, he has been focusing on blockchain technology.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Jessel shares his views on the state of blockchain technology and the journey ahead toward widespread adoption.\n\nBitcoin Magazine (BM): Which stage of the innovation cycle are we currently at with blockchain technology?\n\nBenjamin Jessel (B.J.): There has been extensive news flow about blockchain, and fintech more broadly, which is why we saw record investment in this area in 2015.\n\nHowever, despite venture capital investment, for consultancies, the actual flow of work has been muted, which led many earlier in 2016 into Gartner’s “trough of despair,” which typifies the capitulation of expectations after a year of overhyping.\n\nI see this market as the classic S-curve: periods of little news flow, followed by a significant market-moving announcement, a significant uptick in activity followed by another plateau.\n\nThe key events that significantly heralded that this market was beginning to come of age were the DTCC announcement to move $14 trillion notional of CDS swaps in partnership with Axoni [and IBM and R3], as well as Axoni’s numerous proof of concepts in FX swaps, CDS and equities swaps, and [Digital Asset and] the DTCC’s project to create a blockchain repo system.\n\nAlso, the announcement of the state of Delaware to move company documentation onto the blockchain was significant, as well as the various announcements of the “re-platforming” of exchanges onto [the] blockchain of the likes of Australian Securities Exchange and the Japan Exchange Group.\n\nWith these announcements, we have moved from small proof of concepts relatively under-investmented within innovation centers of financial institutions that were not getting leadership attention, to C-level mandated proof of concepts supported by actual business cases and a roadmap into production. This is why we are calling 2018 as the year of production for blockchain [technology].\n\nBM: What should we be expecting in the space this year, and in which areas do you see blockchain technology being implemented first?\n\nB.J: The nature of blockchain [technology] is that there is an element of secrecy because of the first-mover advantage, so there is an element of piecing together some of the clues.\n\nI see leveraged loans as something that could transition into an initial production environment (albeit few parties initially), the major players being Ipreo, Synapse and Credit Suisse, as well as Digital Asset Holdings with JPMorgan. This is a red-hot market that represents $762 billion and which is still being done primarily manually.\n\nAlso, the Chain–Visa deal, which is about implementing a new network for Visa (their first new one [in] 60 years), will result in Visa entering the business-to-business lending space.\n\nWe know that the Australian stock exchange has spent $20 million so far on implementing a blockchain solution to replace its CHESS system, so we may see some additional news flow about this as well.\n\nSettlement is an interesting area. Financial institutions are working on mechanisms to settle vast amounts of money between each other without having to settle in actual currency, which is costly. However, to be really effective, they need central banks to get behind it and either enable financial institutions to treat this digital settlement as if it were as good as cash, or to actually underwrite the digital settlement as if it was fiat currency. The Bank of Canada has been making moves in this area, and the R3 project Jasper was a great example of a proof of concept in this area.\n\nIn terms of consortia, I do see R3 continuing to go from strength to strength. It’s possible that they may have challenges in retaining some members as what happened early this year, but I see that as a natural churn as parties with more capabilities have less to gain from a consortium than other members.\n\nAlso, the recent announcement of a European consortium in blockchain trade finance is noteworthy, so I will be keeping a close eye on that.\n\nBM: Will blockchain technology become a standard in the financial services industry?\n\nB.J: We need to be a little careful about using the word “standard” with blockchain [technology].\n\nFirst of all, we’re actually now seeing a move away from blockchain [technology], which is about all transactions chained together for everyone to see, and a move toward a distributed ledger, one place for all transactions but only the ones that organizations are contractually able to access.\n\nSecondly, there will not be a single standard. Just as in the handling of data, we moved from flat file in the ’70s to relational databases in the ’80s with a whole ecosystem of ways to access and manipulate the data.\n\nSo what we’re going to see are the principles of the technology: provenance of information, immutability of records, single source of truth accessible to those that are permissioned to do so, the ability to build business process logic on top to automate operational functions based on that data.\n\nIn terms of areas I see moving first, I see the first wave being: lending, CDS swap trade and post-trade lifecycle, trade finance, business-to-business payments and reference data.\n\nBM: Besides financial services, what other industries could benefit from blockchain technology?\n\nB.J: The provenance aspect is very powerful when it comes to supply chain. Walmart, for example, is looking into provenance for meat. In Europe, there was a big scandal with horsemeat entering the food chain. Knowing exactly where your food is coming from is something blockchain [technology] could do very well.\n\nSimilarly with any kind of product that has been created using constituent parts. Particularly in electronics, where security of what country manufactured a certain part is becoming more important.\n\nDubai has recently announced an initiative where they are integrating blockchain [technology] into their smart cities and has recently selected an organization we worked closely with, Loyyal, to integrate blockchain-based loyalty into the city.', ""Bitcoin continues to gain ground on gold after climbing above it for the first time on Thursday. The cryptocurrency trades up 2.6% at 1271 a coin while the yellow metal is down 0.6% at $1227 per ounce, as of 7:25 a.m. ET.\n\nBoth currencies have seen a solid start to 2017, but bitcoin's has been a bit better. It has gained about 35% so far this year after rallying 120% in 2016 and finishing as the top performing currency in each of the last two years. In recent weeks, bitcoin has managed to shrug off news that China's biggest exchanges were going to start charging clients a flat fee of 0.2% per transaction and that they were going to block withdrawals.\n\nAs for gold, it bottomed out at $1123 shortly after the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate back in December. Its 2017 gains have come despite a rally in risk assets and a Fed that says it expects to raise rates three times in 2017. Friday's speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to move the precious metal as she will give her economic outlook and could provide clues as to when the next rate hike could occur. Currently, World Interest Rate Probability data provided by Bloomberg shows an 88% chance of a 25 basis point hike at the upcoming meeting on March 14/15.""]"
03/04/2017,"['—Bitcoin certainly doesn’t glitter, but that isn’t stopping it from catching the eye of traders around the world.\n\nWorth less than a tenth of a cent in 2009, the value of a single bitcoin reached a high of about $1,293 on Friday, surpassing the value of an ounce of gold for the first time. The surge of interest hinges on optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the first US bitcoin exchange-traded fund this coming week, lending an unprecedented level of credibility to the crypotocurrency.\n\n""There\'s one catalyst at the moment and that is the expectation that the Winklevoss Trust will be approved on the 11th of March. That\'s the only game in town,"" Daniel Masters, portfolio manager of Jersey-based Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Program, told Reuters.\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed an application with the SEC for a bitcoin ""exchange-traded fund"" four years ago. Approval would lend a certain level of liquidity to the cryptocurrency, and with it, a new degree of credibility that investors expect to drive further interest in Bitcoin.\n\nBut this week\'s historic level of interest could quickly disappear if the SEC opts not to approve the Winklevoss\'s application, because, unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn\'t tied to any tangible value marker. And while Bitcoin surpassing the value of gold makes for good headlines, comparing troy ounces of gold to bitcoin makes about as much sense as comparing apples to oranges.\n\n“We’re a long way from bitcoin establishing its properties as anything that could be considered to be a reasonably stable store of value,” John Butler, head of wealth services for GoldMoney, told Bloomberg in an interview. “The fact that it’s passing through gold is just arbitrary.”\n\nThe small total value of the entire Bitcoin market, along with other characteristics, makes the value of the currency prone to dramatic leaps and falls, sometimes more than 20 percent in a matter of hours.\n\n“One bitcoin eclipsing one ounce of gold is an interesting psychological signal, but it itself is more of a curiosity than a harbinger of anything to come,” writes Andrew Hinkes, an attorney with expertise in virtual currencies, in an email to The Christian Science Monitor. “Bitcoin is significantly more volatile in its pricing than gold, but is also significantly more useful for transactional purposes than gold... It is rare that you can engage in day to day transactions using gold.”\n\nRepresented as 0s and 1s, bitcoin couldn’t differ more from the weighty yellow metal, but as carriers of value they both share some important similarities. Any currency has to have two features: rarity and owner confidence.\n\nIn the case of gold, rarity is a natural characteristic of the material itself, which leads owners to trust that there will always be a market should they decide to sell. Aspiring alchemists all failed at producing gold and no one expects a giant deposit to suddenly double the supply, so confidence is high.\n\nBitcoin, however, is at some level just a digitally printed list. But while the US government regulates money, and punishes counterfeiters, no analogous entity controls Bitcoin. How does it maintain its scarcity, and entice users to trust the system’s integrity?\n\nAn innovation known as the “blockchain” lies at the heart of bitcoin. This list, which Mr. Hinkes says measured more than 60 gigabytes as of January, tells the story of the currency from its very first transaction. Every purchase, every sale, and every trade all end up in this ever growing ledger.\n\nBuying something using Bitcoin involves adding a line to this universal ledger, but what’s to stop a digital alchemist from trying to cheat the system by falsifying the blockchain? There is no official document locked up behind firewalls in some fortified server, waiting to be hacked. Rather, it’s a public document open for all to see and edit.\n\nIts security lies precisely in this openness. Copies of the blockchain exist on every bitcoin-mining computer worldwide, and for a hacker to give themselves free bitcoins, or use a bitcoin twice, they’d have to commandeer enough computing power to overwhelm more than half of that international network and trick a majority into accepting their counterfeit version.\n\nWhat’s more, every block of transactions is mathematically linked to the previous block, so changing a single character anywhere in the list would have a cascading effect that would make the hacking attempt obvious.\n\nThe scarcity springs from the same source. The distributed network of computers is constantly trying to add new transactions to the list to keep the bitcoin economy humming, but doing so involves checking the validity of the whole blockchain, a computationally intensive task akin to repeatedly trying to guess a password. The computer (or batch of computers) that succeeds in solving the puzzle gets a bitcoin reward, but as the system grows that task gets harder. The reward also halves periodically.\n\nMany refer to this process of puzzle solving to add transactions to the ledger as “mining,” and the people who do it as “miners.”\n\nA rigorous mathematical framework based on the science of encryption and code breaking underlies the whole system, ensuring a controlled influx of new currency expected to continue for over a century before reaching the cap of nearly 21 million bitcoins, after which small transaction fees will incentivize miners to keep maintaining the transaction list.\n\n""Bitcoin has been linked to gold as a store of value and a flight to safety – the truth is that bitcoin is its own asset class in its own right and does fairly well in times of uncertainty – however it is also subject to its own internal forces too, such as its governance or lack of to be more accurate,"" Charles Hayter, the founder of digital currency comparison website CryptoCompare, told CNBC via email.\n\nBut that’s not to say the system isn’t without its risks. Multiple security breaches have resulted in the loss of millions of dollars of Bitcoin value. Access to the impenetrable blockchain depends on a unique code called a private key that identifies each user. If this code is lost or stolen, any bitcoins associated with it are lost forever.\n\nHinkes previously suggested that the cryptocurrency equivalent of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or future regulation could help lend an air of credibility to the new technology.\n\n“[Insurance] is an important frontier to be resolved in order for the industry to offer up custodial exchanges as something consumers can rely upon,” Hinkes told The Christian Science Monitor in August.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\nRegulators have struggled to settle on uniform treatment of the technology in the past, but Friday’s milestone suggests that the technology could take off especially with any extension of credibility from the federal government. But some worry that if the SEC approval doesn\'t come through, the value will crash.\n\nAfter its previous peak of $1,137 in 2013, the currency fell 53 percent in a matter of weeks.', 'Bitcoin has left gold in the dust in recent months.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares have almost tripled in value in the last twelve months, gaining more than 30 percent in the last three months alone. Meanwhile, SPDR Gold shares are down 3.78 percent in the last twelve months and up 4.49 percent in the last three months.\n\nFund 12-month performance 3-month performance SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) -3.78% 4.49% Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares (GBTC) 141.83 30.81\n\nSource: Finance.yahoo.com 3/3/2017\n\nApparently, Bitcoin is more popular than gold among investors.\n\nIs it just hype or something fundamental about the digital currency. It’s hard to say. What’s not hard to say is that there’s a growing mistrust of national currencies, following dubious government policies, which has pushed people into Bitcoin.\n\nThe last three months in the digital currency rally, for instance, has coincided with India and Venezuela’s efforts to get rid of old currency notes.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and President Maduro have very little in common -- except they have pursued policies late last year that replace large notes in circulation with new notes (India) or with coins (Venezuela).\n\nFor different reasons, of course. Prime Minister Modi has been trying to fight corruption, a widespread problem in India. And President Maduro has been trying to fend off capital flight from the ailing Venezuelan economy.\n\nThen there are a couple of advantages that make Bitcoin better than gold, at least for the millennial generation, which understands the digital currency better than the baby-boomer generation.\n\nUnlike gold, for instance, Bitcoin is a convenient medium of payments around the globe, though for a limited number of transactions.\n\nThen, there’s scarcity. Bitcoin supply is expected to be limited to 21 million. The supply of gold, on the other hand, is expected to increase anytime its price rises, as it provides an incentive for gold miners to mine for gold.\n\nTo be fair, gold has its own advantages, too. It can be used as an outright gift, to make jewelry, and in manufacturing of certain products.\n\nThat’s why investors shouldn’t rush to substitute the yellow metal for the digital currency in their portfolio.\n\nEspecially if they don’t quite understand the nature of the digital currency.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'As evidenced by a Google search for \'bitcoin casino\', bitcoins and gambling go together like two pedals on the same bike.\n\nBitcoin’s appeal as a cheap, efficient and low-key means of transmitting money has made it a hit among both online bettors and operators seeking reduced fees, lower chargeback risk and a way around legacy payment systems.\n\nBut as of now, these benefits mainly apply to online casinos operating in jurisdictions with little or no regulatory oversight.\n\nWhile there has been some movement in Curacao, the UK and Malta recently, the use of cryptocurrencies in a legal and strongly-regulated gambling environment like the US still remains largely at the conceptual stage.\n\nBecause of heavy regulation and a desire among the gaming industry and its regulators to protect the industry\'s slowly improving public image, bitcoin appears to be years away from earning approval for use in either physical or online casinos in the US.\n\n""We have looked at digital currencies and do not find them appropriate for use in casino gaming at this time,"" AG Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, told CoinDesk.\n\nAs Nevada is by far the country\'s largest gambling market, its regulators have an outsize influence on policymaking nationwide.\n\nBurnett continued:\n\n""I think for us to consider allowing operators to use digital currency in gaming operations, there would have to be a high level of demand amongst operators, coupled with a clear demonstration of the safety and accountability that regulators could utilize in their duties.""\n\nAsked why he maintains this position, Burnett stressed that the US dollar remains the backbone of Nevada\'s regulatory apparatus, and that any rethink of that must meet a high standard of merit.\n\n""Our regulations and statutes are all based on monetary units that are standard, such as the US dollar,"" he said. ""In fact, I think most of our regulatory foundation, from audit to enforcement and accounting standards, are all based upon normal US currency being used in a gaming operation.""\n\nBurnett added that too much ambiguity surrounds bitcoin and its contemporaries, while questions of consumer demand still remain.\n\n""There are multiple types of digital currencies, whereas there is only one US dollar,"" he said.\n\nOpportunity\'s knock\n\nBut none of this is to say that there isn’t enormous opportunity for the use of bitcoin in a legal and regulated gaming context.\n\n""It\'s a billion-dollar question,"" said Stu Hoegner, a cryptocurrency attorney with Gaming Counsel in Toronto. ""The potential is huge.""\n\nFor the land-based industry, bitcoin offers a potential remedy to casinos that are simultaneously seeking new ways of appealing to more tech-savvy young players, while reducing the amount of cash that shuffles around gaming floors.\n\nMuch like other industries, gaming is bending head-over-foot to attract millennial patrons to replenish its customer base. But younger players who grew up in the world of Xboxes and iPhones have a much higher threshold for being thrilled than do players in their 50s and 60s, many of whom are perfectly fine in front of a slot machine.\n\nSlots remain the key revenue drivers for the industry, so figuring out how to replace or augment any declines is a critical task.\n\nOpening doors\n\nTo this end, Burnett explained that the NGCB allows its licensees to operate bitcoin kiosks on their properties as long as the funds are used for non-gaming purposes.\n\nAt least two Las Vegas properties have embraced this opportunity. The D Las Vegas Casino and Hotel and the Golden Gate Casino and Hotel made a splash in early 2014 by announcing a move to accept bitcoin payments for hotel rooms, restaurants and other on-site vendors.\n\nWhile this can be construed to some extent as a marketing gimmick, it is worth noting that Las Vegas has significantly diversified away from slot machines and table games towards hospitality and entertainment more broadly.\n\nNon-gaming revenues now comprise roughly two-thirds of revenue generated at Las Vegas Strip properties, and this revenue stream is a core component to any property’s business model.\n\nThe other major issue facing casinos that digital currencies could potentially remedy is that they are heavily dependent on cash compared to other industries. Some experts estimate as much as 95% of casino floor transactions are conducted in cash.\n\nThis has become problematic in recent years as federal law enforcement agencies, led by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), have begun putting pressure on casinos – which offer banking-type services like lines of credit and are regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act – to tighten up their anti-money laundering efforts.\n\nThis has spawned a mini-wave of innovation within the space with regards to how payments are accepted, with companies like Sightline, Vantiv and others jostling for pole position in the race to rescue casinos from an overdependence on cash.\n\nLooking abroad\n\nAt the 2016 Global Gaming Expo, the industry’s premier trade show in Las Vegas, one of the prevailing themes of the breakout sessions and vendor exhibits was the amount of work that remains to be done in this realm.\n\nBut the strict regulatory framework in which US casinos operate again comes into play. The industry claims that it is the most heavily-regulated industry in the world.\n\nWhile casinos sometimes wear this as a badge of honor, the practical implication is that they often need regulatory approval for even the smallest of changes – such as moving a slot machine 10 feet on the gaming floor in some jurisdictions – with the end result being a throttling effect on outside-the-box innovation.\n\nSara Slane, senior vice president of public affairs at the American Gaming Association – the trade body that represents casinos – said that the industry is still probably five years behind where it would like to be with regards to non-cash payments.\n\nPutting it all together, industry observers are confident that the US won’t be doing much trailblazing at the intersection of bitcoin and gambling in the coming years.\n\n""It could be another way they\'ll evolve with moving currency around,” said David G Schwartz, director of the Centre for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.\n\nHe added:\n\n""I don’t really see casinos pushing the boundary on this.""\n\nOthers reckon that regulators in the US will likely take a follow-the-leader approach of their own and look for other countries to set the bar before deciding to dive in themselves.\n\n""The leadership of a place like the Isle of Man might be constructive. Maybe an outfit like Malta pushing it forward,"" he said, concluding:\n\n""I don’t think it’s going to be a regulator in the US that leads off.""\n\nCasino image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Can it hold?\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price remained in an uptrend against the US Dollar and moved above $1200.\n\nOut long followed bullish trend line on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD is still acting as a major support near $1170.\n\nHowever, the price is losing the steam, and remains at a risk of a downside move.\n\nBitcoin price traded above $1220 against the US Dollar this past week, and now BTC/USD is trading near a major support area. Can it hold?\n\nBitcoin Price Important Bullish Trend Line Support\n\nIt was a good week for Bitcoin against the US Dollar, as the price traded above $1200. The BTC/USD pair remained in an uptrend and gained heavy bids. However, the Bitcoin was seen struggling against the Ethereum, as ETH/BTC traded above the 0.0150BTC resistance area. So, the market sentiment for BTC/USD was not that aggressive, as it should have been. The BTC/USD pair maintained a slow and steady pace for an uptrend for a move above $1200.\n\nThe most important thing was our long followed bullish trend line on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD. It is currently positioned near $1170 as a support. We can see how many times the price bounced, and traded higher. However, during the recent times, it lost pace, which puts the price at a risk below $1170. If there is a break below the monster trend line support at $1170, there can be more losses.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price keeps holding the support trend line, it may bounce. On the upside, there is a resistance trend line at $1225, acting as a hurdle for further gains. A break above it might push the price further higher. Overall, the price is bullish as long as above the highlighted trend line support at $1170.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is currently in the bullish zone, but slowly reducing the slope.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is heading towards the 50 level, which might play an important role.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1170\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1225\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

As a result, Bitcoin price is also likely to increase, as the value of reserve currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan falls.\n\nWhen the Fed increases its rates, the value of the US dollar naturally increases. Even with a speculation or a forecast from the Federal Reserve, the value of the yen, yuan and the Korean won would fluctuate.\n\nYellen announced:\n\n“We currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect. Indeed at our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations. In which case, a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.”\n\nAlready the Fed announcement is starting to affect the value of the Japanese yen, a currency which has shown more resilience to the increasing Fed rates in comparison to other currencies.\n\nThe year-to-date (YTD) return of the Japanese yen against the USD is -2.5 percent and is likely to increase in the upcoming weeks as the Fed prepares to increase interest rates.\n\nWhy currency devaluation in Japan, China & Europe is important\n\nCurrently, the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market controls over 52 percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market. China, Europe and South Korea make up the top five largest Bitcoin exchange markets, right below the US.\n\nWhen the Fed decides to increase rates again later this month, it will lead to the devaluation of the yen, yuan and euro as the dollar strengthens. If these currencies begin to devalue, high profile investors and traders will seek for alternative safe haven assets and stores of value such as Bitcoin or gold that are detached from the general monetary system.\n\nTraders who consider Bitcoin as a wealth protection and management product, which is the vast majority of Bitcoin users as of current, will move onto Bitcoin in order to protect their assets from devaluation.\n\nBased on the current Bitcoin price trend, it is likely that Bitcoin price could reach $1,300, especially as it nears the final approval date of the Winklevoss Twin’s Bitcoin ETF COIN.\n\nAnalysts also predict that Bitcoin price will reach new highs if the rising Fed rates and the March 11 approval of the COIN ETF coincide.\n\nIn particular, the approval of the COIN ETF will immediately open the Bitcoin market to mainstream investors and investment funds, which are expected to exponentially increase the market size of Bitcoin by hundreds of millions and even up to billions of dollars.\n\nPreviously, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin price hit its all-time high with $1,228 in average markets. Bitcoin price is currently over $1,280 and new highs formed by the launch of ETF and Fed’s rising interest rates will likely form new resistance levels.', 'Bitcoin’s market capitalization has exceeded $20 bln, and the daily volume of trade continues to rise. The cryptocurrency has reached an all-time high in price, climbing above gold, revealing an upward trend that as technical analysts forecast will continue.\n\nA typical characteristic of investors and adopters of any given innovation is the desire to be able to predict what both the short and long-term future holds.\n\nIn order to predict the future of Bitcoin, certain factors must be considered and properly analyzed. These factors include historical events that may have prompted the prevailing atmosphere within the ecosystem and the promise of new innovations that could introduce a more effective system as it concerns the Bitcoin community.\n\nBitcoin price as driver\n\nCTO at EC District, Nikola Cvijovic, tells Cointelegraph that the increased interest in Bitcoin in the last few months is mostly driven by price. Cvijovic also notes that as user base increases, Bitcoin scaling becomes a huge bottleneck for the next level of Bitcoin adoption. However, he is of the opinion that SegWit could be a good start in solving this problem.\n\nAnother phenomenon observed by Cvijovic is the continued resilience of Bitcoin price, despite what could be perceived as attacks by governments and regulatory agencies. This he attributes to improved services and emerging markets within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nCvijovic says:\n\n“Bitcoin is much more price resilient as the ecosystem grows, we have better exchanges, better wallets and overall better services for users. In 2017 I expect more improvements in this area that would lead to even more new users. Emerging markets like India, South America and Africa as well as a potential positive regulatory stance on Bitcoin ETFs could have a positive influence on Bitcoin usage and price in 2017. All in all, interesting times ahead.”\n\nWho will make Bitcoin advance\n\nPresident at Bitcoin Users Group (BUG), John Verdon, is of the opinion that the persons who determine the Bitcoin development can be split into five different categories. According to Verdon, these categories are software developers, technology enthusiasts, speculators, libertarian and criminals - none of which he considers as the mainstream public today.\n\n\n\nVerdon says that software developers are motivated by working in a team or a community creating excellent software code which they can be very proud of.\n\nThe technology enthusiasts are those that are curious of the new and shiny things around them such as mining, so they will begin the mining for Bitcoin.\n\nSpeculators are the ones looking for opportunities to create wealth by taking the risk of buying Bitcoin at a low price and selling at a higher price in the future.\n\nLibertarians see Bitcoin as a way to democratize society and give power to the people by eliminating the ""man"" and executing peer-to-peer transactions in their wallets, and the criminals are leveraging Bitcoin for anonymity they can achieve (ransomware, silk road, etc.).\n\nSixth person’s X factor: The key to widespread adoption\n\nFor Bitcoin to reach widespread adoption Verdon insists that it will need to support a sixth person in the community - the everyday user. This person’s involvement, he says, will require two things; safety and ease-of-use.\n\nVerdon says: “Think of this situation in regards to the current credit cards, people pull them out of their pocket and use them on a daily and hourly basis because they are very easy to use. But there is a security issue with credit cards as well and that will be one of the motivating factors for the general public to adopt Bitcoin. Bitcoin will have to demonstrate its secure nature over time, the general public needs to see it in action and not just hear about the security built into the Blockchain. Services that are now available for wallets and exchanges must make it easy to buy and use Bitcoin before any widespread adoption will occur.”\n\nAs for emerging markets, he thinks that the sixth person requirements need to be solved before there will be a notable uptake. However, there are already existing markets that are driven to Bitcoin out of fear of losing personal wealth.\n\nThese are sometimes confused as being motivated to change because of a better currency of Bitcoin rather than the real fact of being driven to Bitcoin by their own governments in most cases.', ""But while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin’s underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into “blocks,” and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction — a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM.\n\n“I was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,” said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM.\n\nBut a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM’s central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology.\n\nThey explained that this was about more than just a currency — it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it.\n\n“That was the ‘aha’ for me,” Mr. Krishna said. “This was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.” He called it “a technology that can change the world.”\n\nThere are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers.\n\nBut blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information.\n\nA few months after Mr. Krishna’s aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM’s top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities — or threats — to IBM’s business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, gave the green light to.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, “You run with this,” he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months.\n\nHer hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM’s eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers.\n\nIBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, “The first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.”\n\nAfter getting Ms. Rometty’s push on the blockchain, the IBM team’s first move was to make its software “open source,” meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM’s bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe.\n\nFor Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships — instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities.\n\nWhile the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world.\n\nWhat’s more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMaersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved — including Maersk and government authorities — could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged.\n\nThe first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California.\n\nThe difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it’s unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system.\n\n“You need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,” said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. “That’s the difficult part.”\n\nPhoto\n\nIBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark.\n\nA Question of Control\n\nNot everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach.\n\nMany technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains — like the one being built by IBM — are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin’s success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM’s.\n\nThat could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, “it still concentrates power in a handful of entities,” said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems.\n\nThe companies working with IBM have been less worried about these security issues. Almost all of them demanded that the system not be open like Bitcoin. While they are giving up some security benefits, the private blockchains can move faster than Bitcoin, which has been plagued by delays.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come.\n\nIBM tried to fend off this line of attack when it made its software open source in 2015. The foundation that is now in charge of the computer code, the Hyperledger Foundation, has attracted many other companies that are now working on the project alongside IBM. Just in the past week, the Bank of England, Kaiser Permanente and nine other new members joined.\n\nBut the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project.\n\n“They have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,” Mr. Behlendorf said. “We are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.”\n\nMicrosoft has fended off this sort of problem by focusing most of its efforts on a blockchain that it had nothing to do with building, the blockchain behind the virtual currency known as Ethereum. This has already helped Microsoft move in on some clients that IBM is also pursuing. Bank of America, for instance, is building a system with Microsoft that will track the flows of money around trade deals.\n\nBut IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. “This is the most well-thought-out project in the space,” said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor.\n\nNow all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work.\n\nAt Maersk, Mr. Stausholm said it could take five or even 10 years for that to happen, given all the partners — manufacturers, customs officials and farmers — that need to come together. “I really do believe in it,” he said, “but I don’t know how fast it will be able to take off.”\n\nAt Walmart, Mr. Yiannas is more optimistic. His company has already completed two pilots with IBM — moving pork from Chinese farms to Chinese stores, and produce from Latin America to the United States — and he is confident a finished version can be put together within a few years. “I think this is our one best hope for getting it right,” he said."", 'The new Hungarian criminal process law will make it possible to confiscate Bitcoins and other virtual currencies from suspects even in the early stages of the criminal process.\n\nExperts say the new rule proposal, which was made available for reading in February is in accordance with the international AML (anti-money laundering) regulations, even in the field of cryptocurrencies.\n\nMass surveillance\n\nAccording to experts, the passing of the bill will fundamentally change the face of the criminal process and will make mass surveillance legal in Hungary.\n\nThe authorities will be able to use secret surveillance, mass data surveillance, phone and computer hacking when “reasonable suspicion” arises against a suspect.\n\nThe Hungarian Ministry of Justice’s proposal was sent to the Hungarian Parliament earlier in February. The new draft law, if passed, will make it possible for the authorities to confiscate electronic data, electronic and virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe Speaker of the House designated the governmental proposal for debate in the Committee of Legislation. Thus the National Assembly is under obligation to debate bills submitted by the Government. In turn the designated committee decides whether it will be debated by the National Assembly at all.\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph’s sources, the Committee of Legislation will pass the bill to plenary reading. It is rare for the Parliament to overrule the position taken by a committee.\n\nAccording to sources of Cointelegraph, the new proposal of the code of criminal process law will be passed by the House in June.\n\nUp until now, six different Criminal Procedure Codes existed in Hungary. The first Criminal Procedure Code was in force for more than 50 years. This was followed by the first socialist Criminal Procedure Act III of 1951. There were other two consecutive acts during socialism, Law Decree 8 of 1962 and Act I of 1973, as well as the Criminal Procedure Act XIX of 1998.\n\nThe new code will make it possible – if there is a reasonable suspicion – to confiscate the suspect’s virtual currencies, as well as electronic data, such as digital keys, wallet addresses and the digital wallet seed.\n\nMore liberal than British surveillance state\n\nFrom the proposal, it’s not clear how it will be realized in practice. Though the new proposal mentions the rights of the suspect, the authorities will have much more possibilities to collect digital evidence secretly. However, according to legal experts, the new draft law is far more liberal and legally elaborated than the Investigatory Powers Act in Great Britain.\n\nThe secret collection of digital evidence, made by the Hungarian secret services and legal authorities, will be possible to implement against cyber criminals, money launderers, hackers and also carders, in the early stages of the criminal process.\n\nAccording to the sources of Cointelegraph, the key category in these cases is “reasonable suspicion.” This means, that if a suspect raises criminal evidence digitally and it becomes known to the authorities, the investigation phase of the criminal process begins.\n\nUnder investigation, the suspect can be electronically monitored.\n\nThis means, that under strictly regulated legal conditions, enormous surveillance powers will be available to the intelligence services and the police. The proposal, if passes, legalizes hacking by the security agencies into the suspect’s computers and mobile phones and allows them access to masses of stored personal data.\n\nAnd, if there is enough evidence, the virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even Dash can be seized by the police.\n\nWritten by Tamas Csizmadia in partnership with http://www.bitcoinbazis.hu', ""We hear plenty of talk of how public blockchains are going to change the world, but to function on a global scale, a shared public ledger needs a functional, efficient and secure consensus algorithm.\n\nA consensus algorithm, like bitcoin's proof of work (the one we hear about most often), does two things: it ensures that the next block in a blockchain is the one and only version of the truth, and it keeps powerful adversaries from derailing the system and successfully forking the chain.\n\nIn proof of work, miners compete to add the next block (a set of transactions) in the chain by racing to solve a extremely difficult cryptographic puzzle. The first to solve the puzzle, wins the lottery. As a reward for his or her efforts, the miner receives 12.5 newly minted bitcoins – and a small transaction fee.\n\nYet, although a masterpiece in its own right, bitcoin's proof of work isn't quite perfect.\n\nCommon criticisms include that it requires enormous amounts of computational energy, that it does not scale well (transaction confirmation takes about 10-60 minutes) and that the majority of mining is centralized in areas of the world where electricity is cheap.\n\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto woke us up to the potential of the blockchain, but that doesn't mean we can't keep searching for faster, less centralized and more energy-efficient consensus algorithms to carry us into the future.\n\nWhile not a comprehensive list, the following are a few of the alternative approaches being kicked around out there.\n\nProof of stake\n\nThe most common alternative to proof of work is proof of stake.\n\nIn this type of consensus algorithm, instead of investing in expensive computer equipment in a race to mine blocks, a 'validator' invests in the coins of the system.\n\nNote the term validator. That's because no coin creation (mining) exists in proof of stake. Instead, all the coins exist from day one, and validators (also called stakeholders, because they hold a stake in the system) are paid strictly in transaction fees.\n\nIn proof of stake, your chance of being picked to create the next block depends on the fraction of coins in the system you own (or set aside for staking). A validator with 300 coins will be three times as likely to be chosen as someone with 100 coins.\n\nOnce a validator creates a block, that block still needs to be committed to the blockchain. Different proof-of-stake systems vary in how they handle this. In Tendermint, for example, every node in the system has to sign off on a block until a majority vote is reached, while in other systems, a random group of signers is chosen.\n\nNow, we run into a problem. What is to discourage a validator from creating two blocks and claiming two sets of transaction fees? And what is to discourage a signer from signing both of those blocks? This has been called the 'nothing-at-stake' problem. A participant with nothing to lose has no reason not to behave badly.\n\nIn the burgeoning field of 'crypto-economics', blockchain engineers are exploring ways to tackle this and other problems. One answer is to require a validator to lock their currency in a type of virtual vault.\n\nIf the validator tries to double sign or fork the system, those coins are slashed.\n\nPeercoin was the first coin to implement proof of stake, followed by blackcoin and NXT. Ethereum currently relies on proof of work, but is planning a move to proof of stake in early 2018.\n\nProof of activity\n\nTo avoid hyperinflation (what happens when too much of a currency floods the system) bitcoin will only ever produce 21m bitcoins. That means, at some point, the bitcoin block reward subsidy will end and bitcoin miners will only receive transaction fees.\n\nSome have speculated this might cause security issues resulting from a 'tragedy of the commons', where people act in self-interest and spoil the system. So, proof of activity was created as an alternative incentive structure for bitcoin. Proof of activity is a hybrid approach that combines both proof of work and proof of stake.\n\nIn proof of activity, mining kicks off in a traditional proof-of-work fashion, with miners racing to solve a cryptographic puzzle. Depending on the implementation, blocks mined do not contain any transactions (they are more like templates), so the winning block will only contain a header and the miner's reward address.\n\nAt this point, the system switches to proof of stake. Based on information in the header, a random group of validators is chosen to sign the new block. The more coins in the system a validator owns, the more likely he or she is to be chosen. The template becomes a full-fledged block as soon as all of the validators sign it.\n\nIf some of the selected validators are not available to complete the block, then the next winning block is selected, a new group of validators is chosen, and so on, until a block receives the correct amount of signatures. Fees are split between the miner and the validators who signed off on the block.\n\nCriticisms of proof of activity are the same as for both proof of work (too much energy is required to mine blocks) and proof of stake (there is nothing to deter a validator from double signing).\n\nDecred is the only coin right now using a variation of proof of activity.\n\nProof of burn\n\nWith proof of burn, instead of pouring money into expensive computer equipment, you 'burn' coins by sending them to an address where they are irretrievable. By committing your coins to never-never land, you earn a lifetime privilege to mine on the system based on a random selection process.\n\nDepending on how proof of burn is implemented, miners may burn the native currency or the currency of an alternative chain, like bitcoin. The more coins you burn, the better chance you have of being selected to mine the next block.\n\nOver time, your stake in the system decays, so eventually you will want to burn more coins to increase your odds of being selected in the lottery. (This mimics bitcoin's mining process, where you have to continually invest in more modern computing equipment to maintain hashing power.)\n\nWhile proof of burn is an interesting alternative to proof of work, the protocol still wastes resources needlessly. Another criticism is that mining power simply goes to those who are willing to burn more money.\n\nThe only coin that uses proof of burn is slimcoin, a cryptocurrency based on peercoin. It uses a combination of proof of work, proof of stake and proof of burn, but is only semi-active at this time.\n\nProof of capacity\n\nAs we’ve seen, most of these alternative protocols employ some type of pay-to-play scheme. Proof of capacity is no different, but here you 'pay' with hard drive space. The more hard drive space you have, the better your chance of mining the next block and earning the block reward.\n\nPrior to mining in a proof-of-capacity system, the algorithm generates large data sets known as 'plots', which you store on your hard drive. The more plots you have, the better your chance of finding the next block in the chain.\n\nBy investing in terabytes of hard drive space, you buy yourself a better chance to create duplicate blocks and fork the system. But with proof of capacity, we still have the problem of nothing at stake to deter bad actors.\n\nVariations of proof of capacity include proof of storage and proof of space. Burstcoin is the only cryptocurrency to use a form of proof of capacity.\n\nProof of elapsed time\n\nChipmaker Intel has come up with its own alternative consensus protocol called proof of elapsed time. This system works similarly to proof of work, but consumes far less electricity.\n\nFurther, instead of having participants solve a cryptographic puzzle, the algorithm uses a trusted execution environment (TEE) – such as SGX – to ensure blocks get produced in a random lottery fashion, but without the required work.\n\nIntel’s approach is based on a guaranteed wait time provided through the TEE. According to Intel, the poof-of-elapsed-time algorithm scales to thousands of nodes and will run efficiently on any Intel processor that supports SGX.\n\nThe one problem with this protocol is it requires you to put your trust in Intel – and isn’t putting trust in third parties what we were trying to get away from with public blockchains?\n\nGumballs image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

03/05/2017,"['Analysts from prominent financial institutions including Bloomberg believe that the probability of the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN being approved is fairly high, due to the unpredictable nature of the US Securities Exchange Commission.\n\nThere exist many developing parts to the approval of the COIN ETF. Some of these parts could play a major factor that could encourage the SEC to approve the world’s first Bitcoin ETF and the rest of the moving parts could completely eliminate the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF being introduced to the public.\n\nBased on the SEC’s past decisions and attitude towards innovative ETFs, it is difficult to favor the Winklevoss twins for the approval of their COIN ETF. However, the involvement of a well-respected $30 bln financial institution and the participation of analysts independent of the SEC and the Winklevoss twins, such as quant traders from KCG and Susquehanna, gives hope.\n\nWhy analysts believe Bitcoin ETF can be approved\n\nOver the past few years, Bitcoin has been described as digital gold. It is yet to achieve its full technological potential to operate as an efficient and cheap settlement network. Therefore, the vast majority of Bitcoin users as of current are utilizing the Bitcoin network to protect their wealth and to settle large transactions that weren’t previously possible without the presence of a mediator.\n\nAs Bloomberg Intelligence Sr. ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas explains, the SEC introduced ETFs in the past which opened up new markets that didn’t generate as much attraction and interest from the industry at the time. An example of such an ETF is the ASHR, which was approved by the SEC before US companies came about to trade.\n\nBalchunas stated:\n\n“The odds for and against are so evenly matched. You’ve got possible regulation, liquidity and security issues, but on the reasons for, ETFs have this long history of opening up new markets. A great example of an ETF that was approved by the SEC is ASHR. That was approved before any US companies had a quota.”\n\nLike Spencer Bogart, vice president of equity research at Needham & Co, mentioned before, the odds against the Bitcoin ETF approval is evenly matched because of the fact that the officials of the SEC who will approve the ETF don’t receive any incentive for the performance of the ETF. But, if the ETF fails and the market destabilizes, the officials who approved the ETF will be made responsible for its downfall.\n\nUntil the approval date, Balchunas stated that the probability of the Bitcoin ETF being approved would be at 50 percent. The Bitcoin industry and community are quite optimistic towards the approval of the Bitcoin ETF primarily because of the efforts of the Winklevoss twins in bringing in a reputable financial institution in State Street to essentially operate the ETF and take charge of the auditing process.\n\nOne advantage the ETF structure Balchunas sees is its premium on Bitcoin which is significantly cheaper than existing public Bitcoin instruments. As seen in Bitcoin over-the-counter (OTC) market instruments like the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), Bitcoin in major regulated markets are usually traded with high premiums.\n\nCurrently, GBTC is trading at $129 per share, which represents a price of $1,290 for one Bitcoin. In the global market, Bitcoin is being traded at $1,250.\n\n“If it is a little illiquid like high yields, you might trade Bitcoin ETFs with a premium of 1 or 2 percent but that is much better than the OTC market,” added Balchunas.', 'From Taki Tsaklanos : Bitcoin is a totally different asset type. Traditional analysis methods do not applying when trying to forecast the price of bitcoin.\n\nThat’s why we apply a more fundamental approach in this article in order to come up with a bitcoin price forecast for 2017.\n\nHow not to forecast the future price of bitcoin\n\nMost readers would turn to the cryptocurrency blogosphere where they will read ultra bullish bitcoin price forecasts for 2017 similar to this one from Coindesk. The issue with this approach is that those sites only feature bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, so they offer a very biased view.\n\nTraditional financial media, on the other hand, have their classic story telling format. That is not a useful approach neither for investors. For instance, CNBC looked at the ongoing stream of articles that compare bitcoin with gold, and concluded that “the comparison is perhaps a positive signal that bitcoin is being commoditized. But bitcoin is not a commodity, while gold has been a commodity for thousands of years.” That obviously does not tell anything about the future price of bitcoin.\n\nFortune.com explained how demand for safe haven assets have fallen since the elections “on a stronger dollar, signs of future interest rate hikes, and potentially business-friendly policies that may arise from the Trump administration. Those potential regulatory changes would raise the chances of higher-yielding stocks.” That also is not useful as input for a bitcoin price forecast.\n\nThe most interesting headline comes from CNBC: “Bitcoin predicted to rise 165% to $2,000 in 2017 driven by Trump’s spending binge and dollar rally.”\n\nThere is obviously no correlation between the bitcoin price and the dollar or any other regular asset. Large investors simply don’t pull money out of currencies, stocks or gold in order to buy bitcoins.\n\nA legitimate bitcoin price forecast for 2017\n\nWe believe that a combination of price analysis and fundamental analysis is the most appropriate way to come up with a legitimate bitcoin forecast.\n\nFundamentally, the bitcoin usage data look great: usage of bitcoins keeps on increasing, and that is exactly what it fundamentally is all about. Because of the fact that bitcoin is a form of money, the widening acceptance of bitcoin is the most fundamental data point to consider.\n\nAccording to Statista, bitcoin usage keeps on growing as seen by the number of Bitcoin ATMs which increased from 538 in January 2016 to 838 by November. Most Bitcoin ATMs, as of July 2016, were located in the United States (345) and Canada (108). The Bitcoin ATMs located in Europe as of June 2016 constituted 24.02 percent of the global ATM market share.\n\nMoreover, several bitcoin charts confirm a growing usage and acceptance:\n\nLast but not least, this research paper on bitoin’s big picture trends identifies 3 marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprise (i.e., gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises.\n\nIn other words, fundamentally, the picture for bitcoin looks very good. This is not only a market for speculators anymore, but one of real users.\n\nWe are confident, based on the objective data set outlined above, that bitcoin’s price rise is not only legitimate, but will continue. That results in a bullish bitcoin price forecast for 2017 and beyond.\n\nFrom a bitcoin price analysis point of view, the long term chart looks very constructive. Readers should compare the steep rally in 2013 with the steady and solid rise in the last 2 years. As the price of bitcoin took out all-time highs, it suggests it has much more upside potential.\n\nThe only ‘negative’ is that the price rise has accelerated in recent weeks. Investors want to see a steady rise, not a parabolic rise. So we hope there will be a healthy correction sooner rather than later, to cool off emotions. Ideally, bitcoin’s price corrects to the $1000 to $1100 area in the coming weeks.\n\nWe could easily see bitcoin’s price move to $2,000 in 2017.\n\nEditor’s note: The SEC will rule on whether the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:COIN) will be allowed to launch or not this week.

Read more...\n\nThe principle behind Bitcoin and later the blockchain technology was to create decentralized systems, where no individual or an organization holds the scepter of power. Ethereum, the second-best cryptocurrency in the market, also started with the same vision of creating a distributed applications ecosystem, complete with automated and autonomous smart contracts, etc.\n\nWhile there has been some positive news on ether’s (Ethereum tokens) price front, the community is a bit skeptical about the platform’s original mission. Recently, the cryptocurrency platform made headlines on all major mainstream publications as well as cryptocurrency news websites following the announcement of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.\n\nThe alliance, created by some of the leading banking, technology and blockchain firms intends to build enterprise level Ethereum applications for widespread implementation. Some consider it to be good news for Ethereum and its creators, while others beg to differ.\n\nThere are those who view these recent developments as a hostile takeover by the “Big Bad Wolf” corporations. According to them, the democratization of Ethereum network has turned into a far-fetched dream. They believe that the platform’s downfall started after Ethereum lost its credibility following some hard decisions (including the DAO hard fork).\n\nEthereum was later plagued by technical and security issues, sustained DOS attack and what not. While the developer community was able to fix the holes as and when they appeared, it still showed that the blockchain platform is not ready for the heavy-lifting.\n\nThe banking segment, which until now was envying the rise of Bitcoin and its advantages that could put them out of business, seems to have found their own “pet blockchain”.\n\nSkeptics feel that platform unwillingly sold-out to the banking and financial industry, who might soon start using it to serve their needs, without giving a second thought to the open source crypto-community.

Globalisation and the internet have created a demand for instant transactions and settlement without delays. After initial hesitation, banks and other financial institutions are jumping on the band wagon to take advantage of the increased speed and low cost of Block Chain Technology. But what exactly does that mean? Is this a fad or a revolution?\n\nParticipants with little or no knowledge of Blockchain or Cryptocurrencies will be able to understand the basic terms, explain the challenges and use practical examples, tools and expertise to mitigate compliance risk.

After six years, he proceeded to Wall Street where he worked in the hedge fund industry for four years covering technology companies as a trader, research analyst and portfolio manager.\n\nFollowing three years in the compliance education industry, Mr Lee embraced his combined experience and launched The Governance Risk AML Compliance Ethics Foundation, an edtech/regtech firm which was subsequently acquired by RHT Law Taylor-Wessing, the second largest law firm in Singapore.

It has already surpassed a massive spike on Thanksgiving night 2013, and it has just surpassed the cost of an ounce of gold. [continue below image]\n\nLike any commodity, the exchange value of Bitcoin is driven by supply and demand. But, unlike most commodities, including the US Dollar, the Euro or even gold, the eventual supply is capped. It is a mathematical certainty. Yet, demand is affected by many factors: Adoption as a payment instrument, early signs that it is being considered as a reserve currency, fascination by Geeks and early adopters and its use as a preferred tool by some criminals.\n\nBut chief among reasons for acquiring Bitcoin is speculation. Whether it is buy-and-hold or day trading, speculators still outnumber those who use Bitcoin to settle debts or to buy and sell other products and services. (Earlier this week, I argued that speculation is responsible for 85% of demand and of transactions—but that’s another story).\n\nIt’s a bit ironic that speculation—in the early days of a new market—retards organic adoption. It contributes to uncertainty and volatility, and it reduces the fraction available to the markets that make it both useful and liquid. Yet, in free markets, speculation is a necessary and critical antecedent to adoption.\n\nThis week, short term speculators have an unusually keen opportunity to profit, especially if they know how to buy a ‘put’ or sell a ‘call’ (i.e. to leverage a bet for or against the direction of Bitcoin, without actually acquiring any). For example, you can bet that an exchange-traded stock will fall, because there is a market for puts & calls. But it’s not as easy to bet against commodities that are not yet listed for options trading.\n\nI am not going to give advice in this article. I am not a licensed investment professional and although I am bullish on long term, organic adoption of Bitcoin, I really don’t have an opinion on the current news or the short term prospects for a pull back. But, if you have an opinion on a current news event, then there is an immediate opportunity for you to make (or lose) a significantly leveraged sum in the next few days…\n\nSEC and ETFs (Alphabet soup of investment banks)\n\nNext weekend, on Saturday March 11, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve or deny an application for the first regulated, recognized and significantly backed Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Why is this significant? Because most investments are not hand picked by individual investors. Investors choose the level of risk or diversification that seems reasonable for their life stage and then leave stock-picking decisions to a formula, a market sector basket, or a fund manager. That is, invest or park their money in a fund rather than betting on Space-X, PayPal or the local electric company. [continue below image]\n\nIf approved, an ETF potentially adds massive new demand for a commodity, by offering a financial instrument than can be subscribed by the vast fraction of funds, investors, pensioners and speculators who prefer to leave asset management to an organization, outside broker or formula.\n\nThe first ETF application is created and backed by the Winkelvoss Twins. They were Olympic rowers, but found fame & fortune by contracting Marc Zuckerberg to create an early design for Facebook. If their application is approved, a dozen more investment banks, brokers and hedge funds are standing by to jump in with both feet.\n\nThis morning, Cointelegraph put the odds that the ETF will be approved at 50%. Some analysts place the chances even higher. But consider that Bitcoin has already spiked dramatically in the past few weeks. The excitement is already reflected in the price. So, where is the opportunity?\n\nThe opportunity, as with any speculative decision, is in the dissonance between your research and hunch compared with the overall market expectation reflected in the current price. So, for example, if Bitcoin is accepted as the basis for an ETF (and if it continues to grow in more fundamental adoption), the current price is actually remarkably low. Under these assumptions, it hasn’t even begun its period of rapid ascent. Perhaps more obviously (and even more short-term), if you believe that an ETF will be blocked by regulators, then the recent rise is likely to be reversed quickly, at least in the minutes after the March 11 decision is announced.\n\nSo how can you profit from your belief that a commodity will drop in value? I leave that to your personal investment knowledge and research or your financial advisor. My purpose is not to advise, nor even to teach about puts and calls. It is to point out that a few people will win or lose a lot of real money this coming weekend—at least on paper. And it all hinges on whether they can correctly predict the outcome of a regulatory decision process.\n\nAgain, Bitcoin is a very limited commodity, There are only 15.2 million coins today, and there will never be more than 21 million coins. This does not present an obstacle to adoption, because the coins can be sliced smaller and smaller as needed. In a noteworthy demonstration of ‘good deflation’, there will always be enough units for everyone—even if the entire world adopts it for every transaction under the sun.\n\nPhilip Raymond co-chairs Crypsa & Bitcoin Event, columnist & board member at Lifeboat, editor\n\nat WildDuck and will deliver the keynote address at Digital Currency Summit in Johannesburg.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

03/06/2017,"['One simple chart is creating a lot of buzz in markets. It shows that for the first time in history, one bitcoin is worth more than one troy ounce of gold. Despite the flurry of discussion this factoid has generated, many are stupefied, not quite knowing what to do with this information or how to trade on it. Maybe it’s because they have little to do with each other.\n\nIn fact, gold and bitcoin don’t even represent the same asset class. Comparing them is not like apples and oranges (both fruit). Better said, it’s akin to comparing the prices of soybean futures and Intel stock. Many may argue that both gold and bitcoin are currencies as they can be used to purchase goods and services. Or, they may say both are commodities in that they have strict rules around meeting specified minimum standards and have associated futures and options contracts. But economics 101 argues that gold is a commodity and bitcoin and blockchain are technology.\n\nTHE CURRENCY ARGUMENT:\n\nNeither are currencies. By definition, a currency is used as a medium of exchange and a widely accepted and circulated means of payment. Gold’s classification as a commodity-backed currency is largely a relic of history from the early days of capitalism when one could exchange gold for a cow. But that model didn’t work because there was often a gold shortage. Gold is surely a tradeable instrument and an asset-backed currency, as it can be exchanged for a given quantity of dollars, but try buying groceries with a nugget. Unless another Bretton Woods-type fixed exchange rate is enforced, gold is not tied to anything.\n\n\n\nUndoubtedly, bitcoin is becoming a more accepted means of payment by stores such as Home Depot, for online transactions, or Expedia.com, and more nations, such as Estonia and Denmark. But it’s still not widely accepted worldwide -- at least not yet.\n\n\n\nA currency is defined as valuation through fiat, meaning nations use it in monetary policy. The Federal Reserve can print as many dollars as deemed necessary to stimulate the economy. While more than 50 banks have joined the R3 consortium to incorporate blockchain technology, bitcoin is not reliant on third parties such as governments and banks.\n\nUnlike currencies, both gold and bitcoin have finite supply. The earth’s supply of gold is limited by to what remains underground while the creation of bitcoin is capped at 21 million.\n\n\n\nTHE SUBSTITUTION ARGUMENT:\n\nThe first use of gold was around 700 B.C., and since then, no one has discovered or created anything that has gold’s exact characteristics. Metallurgists have blended alloys to look and feel like gold, but their results are not gold and do not meet the standards for physical delivery. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has many substitutes as myriad “altcoin” cryptocurrencies have sprung up to challenge it, such as ethereum and its beta model, Casper, an alternative to the mining-based model, and ostensibly more secure.\n\n\n\nAccording to cryptocoincharts, there are 3,694 cryptocoins with a $27.8 billion market cap. Granted, bitcoin has an overwhelming share of the marketplace, but who knows what the future holds should other cryptocurrencies gain ground with technologies that challenge or disrupt the current marketplace. It was’t that long ago that Mt. Gox Exchange had many of its bitcoins stolen. Even last summer, a project running on a blockchain technology was hacked and lost millions of dollars. So yes, there’s room for improvement.\n\nTHE COMMODITY ARGUMENT:\n\nPoint blank, gold is a commodity, bitcoin is not. Gold is a classic commodity, defined as a basic good or hard asset used in commerce and as an input in the production of other goods. One can take physical delivery of a commodity, which can then be smelted, crushed, blended or refined to some other form for use. While bitcoin is storable, it’s not physical and cannot be held, felt or transformed in anyway.\n\n\n\nTHE INFLATION/HAVEN ARGUMENT:\n\nFor centuries, gold has been considered a haven as well as an inflation hedge. These qualities are not necessarily steadfast as alternatives came about (e.g. Swiss franc, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), the argument still holds. One cannot say the same for bitcoin. In fact China’s three biggest bitcoin exchanges recently suspended withdrawals after pressure from the People’s Bank of China over concern that bitcoin was being used to move money out of the country. And bitcoin hasn’t been around long enough to make the inflation hedge argument, seeing as there has been no inflation to speak of in its history, until now.\n\nSurely there are similarities. Both bitcoin and gold are rare, their prices can be volatile and each serves as an alternative investment for those lacking faith in fiat currency and monetary policy. Trading bitcoin is not as easy as gold, as one has to open a bitcoin wallet, then purchase bitcoins via online exchanges, or invest in an over-the-counter Bitcoin Investment Trust, often at a hefty premium to the cryptocurrency. Soon there may be a bitcoin ETF, as the Winklevoss twins await the SEC’s approval deadline of March 13. With that go-ahead, bitcoin will become an easier trade.\n\n\n\nTheir relative values, nevertheless, are not revealing much of anything barring validation of the thrill of speculation. The recent rise in bitcoin’s value is in part attributed to tighter currency restrictions in countries such as China, India and Venezuela in addition to investors betting on a more relaxed regulatory environment under President Donald Trump. Thus, with emerging market currency instability, legitimate uncertainty around Trump’s policies, and expectations for a stock market correction, there’s certainly good reasons to buy gold too. Well, so much for that spread.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story:\n\nShelley Goldberg at shelleyrg3@gmail.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nRobert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.net', 'Bitcoin (OTCQX:GBTC) is a totally different investment asset type than traditional asset classes. Traditional analysis methods do not applying when forecasting the price of bitcoin. That\'s why we apply a more fundamental approach in this article in order to come up with a bitcoin price forecast for 2017.\n\nHow NOT to forecast a bitcoin price\n\nMost readers would turn to the cryptocurrency blogosphere where they will read ultra-bullish bitcoin price forecasts for 2017 similar to this one from Coindesk. The issue with this approach is that those sites only feature bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, so they offer a very biased view.\n\nTraditional financial media, on the other hand, have their classic story telling format. That is not a useful approach either for investors. For instance, CNBC looked at the ongoing stream of articles that compare bitcoin with gold (NYSEARCA:GLD), and concluded that ""the comparison is perhaps a positive signal that bitcoin is being commoditized. But bitcoin is not a commodity, while gold has been a commodity for thousands of years."" That obviously does not tell anything about the future price of bitcoin.\n\nFortune.com explained how demand for safe haven assets have fallen since the elections ""on a stronger dollar, signs of future interest rate hikes, and potentially business-friendly policies that may arise from the Trump administration. Those potential regulatory changes would raise the chances of higher-yielding stocks."" That also is not useful as input for a bitcoin price forecast.\n\nThe most interesting headline comes from CNBC: ""Bitcoin predicted to rise 165% to $2,000 in 2017 driven by Trump\'s spending binge and dollar rally.""\n\nThere is obviously no correlation between the bitcoin price and the dollar or any other regular asset. Large investors simply don\'t pull money out of currencies, stocks (NYSEARCA:SPY) or gold in order to buy bitcoins.\n\nA legitimate bitcoin forecast for 2017\n\nWe believe that a combination of price analysis and fundamental analysis is the most appropriate way to come up with a legitimate bitcoin forecast.\n\nFundamentally, the bitcoin usage data look great: Usage of bitcoins keeps on increasing, and that is exactly what it fundamentally is all about. Because of the fact that bitcoin is a form of money, the widening acceptance of bitcoin is the most fundamental data point to consider.\n\nAccording to Statista, bitcoin usage keeps on growing as seen by the number of Bitcoin ATMs, which increased from 538 in January 2016 to 838 by November. Most Bitcoin ATMs, as of July 2016, were located in the United States (345) and Canada (108). The Bitcoin ATMs located in Europe as of June 2016 constituted 24.02 percent of the global ATM market share.\n\nMoreover, several bitcoin charts confirm a growing usage and acceptance:\n\nBitcoins in circulation rose 10% in the last 12 months.\n\nTrading volume on major bitcoin exchanges is structurally higher in the last 12 months.\n\nThe average number of transactions per block is structurally higher in the last 12 months.\n\nLast but not least, this research paper on bitcoin\'s big picture trends identifies 3 marked regimes that have evolved as the bitcoin economy has grown and matured: From an early prototype stage, to a second growth stage populated in large part with ""sin"" enterprise (i.e., gambling, black markets), to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from ""sin"" and toward legitimate enterprises.\n\nIn other words, fundamentally, the picture for bitcoin looks very good. This is not only a market for speculators anymore, but one of real users.\n\nWe are confident, based on the objective data set outlined above that bitcoin\'s price rise is not only legitimate, but will continue. That results in a bullish bitcoin price forecast for 2017 and beyond.\n\nFrom a bitcoin price analysis point of view, the long-term chart (courtesy: Finviz) looks very constructive. Readers should compare the steep rally in 2013 with the steady and solid rise in the last 2 years. As the price of bitcoin took out all-time highs, it suggests it has much more upside potential.\n\nThe only \'negative\' is that the price rise has accelerated in recent weeks. Investors want to see a steady rise, not a parabolic rise. So we hope there will be a healthy correction sooner rather than later to cool off emotions. Ideally, bitcoin\'s price corrects to the $1,000 to $1,100 area in the coming weeks.\n\nWe could easily see bitcoin\'s price move to $2,000 in 2017.\n\nThis bitcoin price forecast for 2017 originally appeared on InvestingHaven.com', 'Peter Schiff, a prominent investor of gold and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, has been criticized by many analysts and experts including Brian Kelly of CNBC for describing Bitcoin as “digital fool’s gold.”\n\nFor the most part, Schiff’s ignorance towards Bitcoin stems from his responsibility to protect Euro Pacific Capital’s business model, which almost entirely relies on the performance of gold. Schiff has also found the vast majority of his career success in gold trading and thus, it is essentially instinctive for Schiff to protect gold against Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, most innovative and successful investors understand that to profit from an ever-changing market, one needs to beat the market. One asset or currency which has beaten the market for three straight years is Bitcoin by outperforming all reserve currencies, stock markets and assets, something gold has failed to do.\n\nRarity, scarcity, decentralization\n\nCurrently, the basis of all criticisms against Bitcoin is the absence of network moderators and the origin of its value. Specifically, conventional economists struggle to understand the purpose of Bitcoin’s fixed supply, as it could theoretically lead to economic issues in the future.\n\nRarity, scarcity and decentralization, the three characteristics of Bitcoin which conventional economists including Schiff warn investors against, are in fact the strongest advantages of Bitcoin. These characteristics of Bitcoin are why mainstream analysts like Brian Kelly are dedicated to offering fair and balanced coverage on Bitcoin.\n\nIn a debate with Schiff, Kelly stated:\n\n“For me, it is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not just digital gold. It is a technology platform that fintech is being built on top of. It is a once in a life generation investment opportunity similar to the Internet growing just as fast if not faster. It is the Internet of money. Everyone is involved in it. The Federal Reserve released a paper on it. Bank of England is involved in it. 14 of the top 30 banks have active projects.”\n\nKelly’s statement is factually accurate in that Bitcoin is a technology platform and an open source protocol in which anyone can build anything on top of. Bitcoin as a base protocol is a payment facilitation tool. It facilitates payments between two users without the necessity of a mediator.\n\nOn top of that layer one technology, two-layer solutions exist as well as other technologies which will allow Bitcoin to transform itself into a settlement system, digital gold, wealth management product and virtually any financial instrument which investors and traders may need in the future.\n\nBitcoin’s structure isn’t a replica of gold\n\nSchiff, however, argues that Bitcoin’s structure is a replica of gold, built to act as an alternative to fiat currencies. As mentioned above, Bitcoin isn’t a replica of gold nor the monetary system adopted by governments across the globe. It can operate as gold and a currency but it wasn’t structured to replicate either of those two.\n\nWhen Schiff states that gold is a more efficient version of Bitcoin, Schiff is considering the commodity aspect of gold. Gold is a commodity and an asset. But, it is not a payment unit and a settlement network. Its value is dependent on an infinite supply, which could exponentially increase if companies manage to find massive sources of gold in the future.\n\nIf Bitcoin had a bug which could lead to the creation of Bitcoin out of thin air, Bitcoin’s value wouldn’t be where it is as of current.', 'New warnings over central banks involvement with digital and cryptocurrency were recently issued by a governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve Jerome H. Powell. In a prepared statement, Powell told conference attendees at Yale Law School that digital currencies issued by a central bank would become global targets for cyberattacks, cyber counterfeiting and cybertheft.\n\n“Central banks could face difficult trade-offs between strengthening security and enabling illegal activity,” Powell said. “Advanced cryptography could reduce vulnerability to cyberattacks but make it easier to hide illegal activity. To the extent we relax strong cryptography to make it easier for authorities to monitor illegal activity, we could simultaneously weaken security.”\n\nWhile Powell’s speech does not dismiss digital currency and distribute ledger technologies outright, the Federal Reserve governor warns that significant security and privacy issues still exist in both spaces and will need to be addressed moving forward.\n\n“We live in a time of extraordinary technological change,” Powell said. “We should be open to the new ideas and innovations that will drive economic growth and improvements in our financial system. At the same time, the public rightfully expects that authorities will do whatever it takes to keep their money safe.”\n\nPowell’s warning comes at a time when the value of digital currency bitcoin is at an all-time high, due to investor optimism on the potential SEC approval of a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund. On Friday, the value of one bitcoin nearly broke $1,300, more than the price of gold per ounce.\n\nPowell’s speech also comes at a time when numerous global financial institutions and technology companies are investigating the value of distributed ledger technologies, especially blockchain.\n\nLate last month, a number of technological and financial organizations announced the formation of a nonprofit organization called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Their goal is to create a new blockchain computing system based on the network of Ethereum, a decentralized platform for applications that backs the popular digital currency Ether.', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investment firm Grayscale Investments plans to launch the first-ever private fund focused on ethereum classic, a blockchain platform, according to Barry Silbert, founder of the company’s parent Digital Currency Group.\n\nEthereum classic’s token is the seventh largest digital currency in terms of market capitalization, totaling $126.6 million. The coin powers a decentralized blockchain hub in which developers can create different applications that can dramatically enhance the transfer and sharing of information and value.\n\nEthereum classic was built on the same fundamental principles as bitcoin: decentralization and immutability.\n\nOn Monday, ethereum classic traded at $1.42 on digital asset exchanges.\n\n“As investors have grown more interested in digital currency as an asset class, we’ve also seen growing frustration with the difficulty in purchasing non-bitcoin digital currencies,” Silbert told Reuters.\n\n“We’re excited to launch a fund for ethereum classic to satisfy the growing interest we are seeing in ETC from more mainstream investors.”\n\nThe ethereum classic fund will be an open-ended trust that can raise an unlimited amount of capital, Silbert said. Digital Currency Group will be seeding it with its own capital and it will be offered initially to accredited investors, he added.\n\nThis will be the second digital currency fund for Grayscale, which launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust in 2013, the only publicly-traded U.S. security in the over-the-counter market invested in bitcoin.\n\nEthereum classic has had a rocky history. It came out of a split from the original ethereum blockchain platform created by Russian programmer Vitalik Buterin and launched in 2015.\n\nIn April 2016, a blockchain solutions company called Slock.it announced the launch of The DAO on Ethereum. The DAO was designed as a decentralized crowdfunding model, in which anyone could contribute ethereum tokens to become a voting member and equity stakeholder in the organization.\n\nThe DAO eventually raised $150 million as of late May last year. But on June 17,2016, an anonymous hacker funneled approximately $60 million in tokens into a separate account.\n\nThe ethereum network decided to undertake a “hard fork”, in which the community would create an entirely new version of the ethereum blockchain, erasing any record of the theft, and restoring the stolen funds to their owners.\n\nA new blockhain platform was then formed, keeping its ethereum name, and the original version was branded as ethereum classic. Both ethereum and ethereum classic trade on digital asset exchanges.\n\nThe new ethereum has a larger market cap of $1.8 billion, with the token trading at $19.97 on Monday\n\n(This version of the story corrects the headline and first paragraph to show Grayscale plans to launch ethereum classic private fund, not that it has already launched the fund)', 'Banks are going to get into big trouble later this year which is going to expose a gigantic derivative bust, silver has a good future ahead and Bitcoin price would triple the price of an ounce of gold - which is expected to reach $4,800 - by March next year, according to the latest data sets from Clif High.\n\nBased on this estimate, one Bitcoin could be worth more than $13,000 by then, he says in the interview he recently had with Greg Hunter.\n\nBanks’ troubles\n\nClif High, who has gradually become a known name for the projection from his Web bots, says his data shows that the derivative that some banks would soon experience would be regional troubles rather than a global bust.\n\nHe says in the video:\n\n“It would be a large failure, say, in a northern Italian bank then the derivative associated with that bank ripples over to Deutsche Bank and maybe they are able to contain it a little bit and so everybody breathes a sigh of relief. Then it breaks out in Texas and a bunch of regional banks in Texas shuts down and there is pressure on some fracking whales and they get it contained with a little bit of credit infusion from somewhere else. Then it spreads to California and up to Asia and the next thing you know it is back in Europe. So we’ll be fighting this basically derivative disease as it pops up here and there. That’s going to be the modus operandi for the banks for the rest of this year.”\n\n“He hints that a lot of people are going to get caught up in the situation when some of these banks go down because they won’t have access to their cash. Also, some of these banks are not likely to recover from the “nasty situation.”\n\nSilver’s going to the moon\n\nHe didn’t say if there would be a correlation between the failure of banks and the projected rise in the price of silver. However, he notes that for a number of years, silver is going to be an increasingly key component of the increasing complex hyper-technologies. This will be as a result of the escalation in the actual growth rate of emotional attachment to silver between this year - when the metal is expected to break out and create a shift in its price manipulation - and 2022.\n\nThey will try to suppress it to contain it in the first instance, he adds, but they won’t be able to contain the next breakout coming towards the end of the year (October) because of what would be coming out as relative to technology by the time.\n\n“The situation will encourage rampant hoarding in silver in 2018 and 2019 in many western countries and its price will escalate rapidly towards achieving parity with gold and become too expensive to be used as money. For gold, he says the next number according to his data sets is $4800 per ounce with a projected timeline of March 2018.”\n\nBitcoin won’t explode until 2019\n\nIf what Clif High, who is considered quite accurate with his predictions about Bitcoin, says about the digital currency is anything to go by, then we should see a $13,000+ Bitcoin by March 2018.\n\nSpeaking of the price of gold in the interview with Hunter, High says an ounce of gold would reach $4800 net by March to drop down by about $300. He adds:\n\n“The data shows that when it’s dropped to that point, just curiously, it happens to match for a brief period of time exactly one-third of the price of Bitcoin when gold does that deepen and it’s back up again.”\n\nThat gives us about a price range of between $13,000 and $14,000.\n\n“Bitcoin is simply escalating. It doesn’t explode until 2019,” he adds with a submission that at some point, there will be one Bitcoin available for every thousand ounces of gold.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

Wirex has offices in London, Tokyo, and Kiev.', 'Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that has increasingly gained prominence in the mainstream as a transactional decentralized global currency and a store of value for investors, has predictably seen a marked increase in bitcoin-based scams by fraudsters.\n\nAn unnamed senior Indian crime branch officer has stated that criminal cases of fraud related to bitcoin are on the rise as bitcoin gains popularity in the country.\n\nIndians had to persevere through a significant and unprecedented demonetization run enforced by the country’s central government, a move which saw 87% of the country’s physical cash in circulation rendered obsolete on November 8, 2016. In the immediate aftermath of the event, demand for bitcoin soared as a currency immune from the controls of the government as Indians purchased bitcoin at a premium of up to 20% within days of the demonetization. Interest in the cryptocurrency was never higher, as Indians explored ways to buy bitcoin.\n\nWithin 3 weeks of the cash crunch, Indians were buying bitcoin at a premium of 35% from local bitcoin exchanges. Elsewhere, the country’s citizens were trading bitcoin in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner, pushing decentralized trading to all-time highs. A month after the demonetization’s announcement, the surge in bitcoin adopters in India was entirely evident.\n\nInevitable Fraud\n\nIn early December, the city of Lucknow, in Northern India, saw its first official case involving bitcoin fraud, wherein a P2P bitcoin trade went awry.\n\nAs reported by India Today, another case of bitcoin fraud came to light last week when a businessman in the country’s capital of Delhi lost ?850,000 (approx. $12,750) to an alleged bitcoin miner, who promised returns on investment with the cryptocurrency. The businessman did not file a police compliant, however, since digital currencies aren’t recognized by the country’s central bank. The Reserve Bank of India issued a public notice last month, reminding users that the cryptocurrency or businesses-related to it aren’t authorized and aren’t subjected to consumer protection laws.\n\nThe lack of regulation and acknowledgment of bitcoin, which is attracting investors in India, is leading to an increase in fraud related to the cryptocurrency.\n\nSpeaking to the publication, a senior crime branch officer stated:\n\nCases of fraud related to bitcoins are becoming more frequent. [Bitcoin’s increasing popularity and acceptance around the world] has attracted many new investors. However, cashing on its rising popularity, some scamsters are also running fraud set-ups.\n\nAuthorities Ignore Bitcoin\n\nThe situation if further exacerbated with the commonly accepted notion that India’s central bank isn’t likely to permit bitcoin as legal tender, despite its agenda to embrace digital payments and financial technologies. A new “Payments Regulatory Board” installed by the Reserve Bank of India that will oversee and handle digital payment gateways that have become hugely popular in India post-demonetization, will not be including bitcoin under a revised set of Fintech-friendly regulations.\n\nThe lack of involvement by the RBI has led to companies from India’s young but growing bitcoin industry to unite and launch a self-regulatory body last month.\n\nIndian authorities’ shunning of bitcoin comes at a time when other Asian countries including Japan and Philippines move toward regulating the bitcoin industry locally.\n\nThe appetite for bitcoin among Indians is only going to increase in a country with one of the world’s youngest populations pushing soaring adoption rates of smartphones with the world’s cheapest rates for telecommunications and mobile internet access.\n\nThe senior crime branch official adds:\n\nAfter demonetization in November 2016, demands for bitcoin have gone up in the country and what gold was to the previous generation, bitcoin is to today’s tech-savvy investor.\n\nImages from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Circle Chief Evangelist Anders Brownworth, who previously taught blockchain technology at MIT, gave a presentation on day two of the 2017 MIT Bitcoin Expo in which he mainly focused on what Circle has been working on for the past few months.\n\n\n\nCircle is a mobile payments application that aims to make sending money to anyone in the world as easy as sending them a message via their mobile phone.\n\nDuring his talk, Brownworth noted that although Circle dropped the ability to buy and sell bitcoin in their mobile application late last year, the company still uses Bitcoin in the background of their current operations. Brownworth also explained Circle’s need for state channels and why the company is now building a new platform on top of Ethereum.\n\nCircle Still Uses Bitcoin\n\nDuring the opening portion of his presentation, Brownworth made it clear that Circle has by no means stopped using Bitcoin completely. In fact, Bitcoin still plays a key role in the background of the company’s operations.\n\n“Bitcoin very fundamentally informs the way Circle works behind the scenes, and it continues to do so,” stated Brownworth. “We continue to use it.”\n\nIn addition to various background operations, Brownworth also noted that Circle has helped fund MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), which funds Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields, Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan and lightning network developer Tadge Dryja. In the past, former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen was also a part of the MIT DCI.\n\nCircle also operates a trading desk for bitcoin and other digital currencies. “We actually operate a trading desk for all virtual currencies — a very active trading desk,” noted Brownworth.\n\nThe Need for State Channels\n\nAccording to Brownworth, one of the main things Circle is working on right now is Spark. It’s unclear if this is an attempt by Circle to create the main payment platform of the future to replace the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum as Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said was needed late last year.\n\nBrownworth described Spark as “smart contract driven,” and the Circle chief evangelist explained the payments company’s need for state channels on any system they build. “We’ll use state channels to keep the cost of transactions low — keep the fees low — and also to add privacy,” he said. “For us, state channels are very, very important. We need them either formally supported or we need the contract primitives to be available, so we can make time-locked contracts (HTLCs).”\n\nAn example of state channels is payment channels in Bitcoin where many payments can be made between two parties before eventually being settled on the blockchain. The lightning network is an attempt to create a generalized layer of payment channels where users can send payments to a wide number of other parties via this mechanism.\n\nAccording to Brownworth, Circle will eventually open-source the Spark platform, and they have no plans to try to compete with other solutions at the platform level. Instead, Circle will focus on building apps on top of the Spark platform.\n\nWhile Brownworth noted that there were many options for building the Spark platform, Circle’s initial implementation uses Ethereum. Brownworth also described the process of learning what it’s like to build on top of these sorts of smart contracting platforms.\n\n“What became obvious very quickly, very early on is it’s really, really hard to make a smart contract system maintainable,” he said. “If you do the sort of Solidity 1.0 basic example and set up your own currency, that’s great and all until tomorrow when you want to add a new feature and you have to delete everybody’s accounts. Or you have to build in a path for all of that information to make its way into the new contract.”\n\nBrownworth added that their current line of thinking is to create a core, permissioning contract that will tell other contracts when there is a new version of that contract available. He also added that this system will be for IOUs rather than digital bearer assets.\n\nWhy Build on Ethereum?\n\nDuring the Q&A portion of his talk, an audience member asked Brownworth to further clarify why Circle was using Ethereum for Spark.\n\n“We could have done this a lot of different ways,” responded Brownworth. “We looked at many different options for technologies to implement this in. Essentially, what it comes down to is, believe it or not, maturity at this point versus all of the others.”\n\nBrownworth added that Hyperledger and Corda are also interesting, but the maturity of the code available for those platforms does not meet Circle’s needs right now. “We actually built this in a number of different platforms, and we ended up coming to the realization that the practical way to implement this right now is Ethereum,” he said.\n\nWhile Spark is being built using Ethereum right now, Brownworth added that Spark is made to be interoperable with other blockchains and platforms via state channels as well.']"
03/07/2017,"['While bitcoin prices have edged up sharply ahead of the SEC\'s upcoming decision on the long-in-the-works Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, at least one major hedge fund is selling off into the rally.\n\nIn an email sent today to its mailing list, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), a Jersey-based investment vehicle that buys and sells bitcoin on behalf of investors, said it believes the market is now signaling a potential approval too strongly for its taste.\n\nUltimately, GABI said it believes ""it does not seem likely"" that investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will receive approval for the vehicle, which they first filed in 2013.\n\nGABI wrote in an email today:\n\n""Without the ETF launch, should that be the case after that deadline, and with the aforementioned issues in China, we believe the market will be short of a catalyst and will have trapped some overly optimistic long positions. We will continue to reduce our exposure into the decision date.""\n\nGABI goes on to write that it projects a 25% chance of approval on the decision. Either way, sources tell CoinDesk a decision is likely to happen this week.\n\n""If it turns out we are wrong, and the ETF does launch, we will certainly miss a spike and will extend this month\'s underperformance into next,"" the statement continues.\n\nHowever, even if the ETF does not launch, GABI is optimistic bitcoin\'s price will head higher – even with continued scrutiny on the market from China\'s central bank.\n\n""We think the ‘bull’ case for bitcoin will be considerably strengthened, and as such, we would expect a very protracted rally in which we will quickly seek to participate,"" the email reads.\n\nElsewhere, the firm discussed the results of trading decisions earlier in the year, highlighting how its performance has been affected by developments in China, and how it has shifted its strategy in response.\n\nLaunched in 2014, GABI received regulatory approval for its offering from the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC).

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Mass adoption is a frequent topic of discussion among the members of the Bitcoin community. There is virtually no disagreement about the fact that Bitcoin would eventually go mainstream and that it would be a great thing.\n\nHaving a larger user base opens up more and better business opportunities, increases the demand for Bitcoins - and, by extension, their price. It also makes it more feasible for business owners to enable Bitcoin payments at their stores and brings other countless benefits to the participants of the market.\n\nHowever, there are many wildly differing opinions out there when it comes to the questions of how mass adoption can be achieved, what factors are hampering the adoption rates right now and whether Bitcoin can become ‘everyday money’ at all.\n\nBack in late 2013, when the cryptocurrency was experiencing mainstream media coverage for the first time, coupled with unprecedented growth in price, some were expecting Bitcoin to receive global recognition within the next couple of years.\n\nBy now it is evident that the prophesied mass adoption has not yet come. But Bitcoin isn’t going to die any time soon either, despite what some of the detractors would have you believe. The question then becomes, when is global recognition realistically possible and what has been preventing it so far?\n\nThe factors impacting the rate of Bitcoin adoption can be roughly divided into three groups: technological, utilitarian and psychological. Let’s take a look at what progress has been made in these three directions so far, and what remains to be done.\n\nTechnological barriers\n\nTechnological parameters of a currency are its most basic restricting factors. Bitcoin could have the best use-cases and a perfect reputation (which, spoiler, it doesn’t), but if the numbers simply don’t add up for a global audience, it will never grow beyond the scale of a niche experiment.\n\nThe two most popularly discussed metrics here are the total supply of coins and the transaction capacity.\n\nOne of the defining features of Bitcoin is a hard-coded limit on the total supply of coins: there will never be more than 21 mln Bitcoins in circulation. In the earlier years, some of the people just learning about the cryptocurrency used to hold a not-uncommon misconception that 21 mln of coins aren’t nearly enough for Bitcoin to serve as a viable currency for a global audience.\n\nWhat those people failed to take into account is that, like dollars, or any other fiat currency, Bitcoins are divisible. In fact, the lowest indivisible unit in the Bitcoin system is 1 satoshi, which is a one hundred-millionth part of a Bitcoin.\n\nLet’s take a look at the numbers here. The approximate amount of dollars currently in circulation around the globe, including cash, money market funds, savings accounts and CDs, is about $10.5 tln, or, expressed in the lowest indivisible unit, 1.05 quadrillion US cents. That is actually less than the ~1.6 quadrillion of satoshi’s which are currently in circulation.\n\nIt’s clear that the actual supply of monetary units of Bitcoin is comparable to that of the largest fiat currency in the world, which should be quite sufficient.\n\nBut the transaction capacity is the actual problem.\n\nWe have described the problem of Bitcoin’s insufficient capacity in detail in a separate article, but here is the short story. Bitcoin has a bottleneck, which limits the amount of transactions that can be processed each second.\n\nThat limit is dictated by the maximum block size - currently, it equals 1 megabyte. Each block is a collection of transactions that have taken place over the last ten minutes or so. Given the one MB limit on the size of blocks, it translates to about three to seven maximum transactions per second.\n\nThat capacity is minuscule when compared to existing money systems, such as cash, which, obviously, has an effectively infinite capacity, or, say, Visa/Mastercard that are capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions each second.\n\nWhat makes this issue worse is the fact that there is no clear solution in sight for it. There are currently two major competing proposals, SegWit and Bitcoin Unlimited, and neither of them has sufficient support to be implemented.\n\nThis is a major factor preventing Bitcoin from ever going mainstream. Right now, it cannot technically service a global audience at competitive transaction times and fees, so the scaling problem will have to be fixed sooner or later. Let’s assume it does get fixed, and take a look at the other factors impacting Bitcoin’s adoption worldwide.\n\nThe lack of utilitarian value\n\nThe next group of factors is utilitarian. Even if a large audience could use Bitcoin on a daily basis, it doesn’t mean that it should or have to. The actual adoption rate depends on how much utility does Bitcoin offer, compared to the other forms of money.\n\nEvaluating Bitcoin’s utilitarian value as global money is a bit tricky, because the cryptocurrency’s efficiency is not uniform, and varies depending on each particular function it performs.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin works great for international remittances. Sending money across the border via conventional methods is a huge pain. First of all, both the sender and the recipient have to have their own bank accounts. It may already present a near-impossible task in some of the underbanked regions, like Northern and Central Africa.\n\nIf the counterparties do have access to banking, they will still have to wait for several days and pay a ridiculous $30-$50 fee before the money goes through. Compare that to Bitcoin, whose only requirement to be sent and received is having Internet access. Plus, the fees range from a few cents to just a couple of dollars, depending on the network congestion.\n\nAs a payment method, on the other hand, Bitcoin has its flaws. In the vast majority of cases, you cannot spend Bitcoins on something you want directly. There are a few big companies, though, that accept bitcoins in their online shops, such as Microsoft, Overstock, Dell, Tesla, Steam, and others. They are mostly enabled by the intermediary payment processors, such as CoinBase and BitPay.\n\nVarious merchant point-of-sales solutions are offered by companies as Coinify, CoinKite and CoinBase. They allow any brick-and-mortar shop to start accepting Bitcoin for their items.\n\nOne can find 9000 such shops around the globe, as of the time of writing, maybe even more. But this is still far, far away from being able to just walk into the nearest store and pay for your groceries with Bitcoins.\n\nAgain, these numbers don’t even stand in line with, for example, more than 40 mln stores which accept bank cards worldwide. However, merchant acceptance is a gradually increasing figure.\n\nIt used to be that you could only transact Bitcoins with like-minded enthusiasts dwelling on niche forums, so being now able to pay Microsoft, or Dell or an occasional brick-and-mortar shop with cryptocurrency is an obvious sign of progress.\n\nIt is likely that Bitcoin will simply become gradually more accepted at various places around the globe, as the general public catches up and generates demand for PoS cryptocurrency payments.\n\nIn the meanwhile, it is important to make the process of introduction to Bitcoin as simple as possible for the first-time users. The process of buying Bitcoins can be notoriously confusing, so production of simple user guides and development of efficient gateways can go a long way towards increasing Bitcoin’s accessibility.\n\nPublic Perception\n\nArguably the least critical today, but very important in the long run are the psychological factors. They mostly pertain to the public’s perception of Bitcoin and the way the cryptocurrency is being covered on by the mainstream media.\n\nThe majority of non-users today have a multitude of established misconceptions about Bitcoin which make them unlikely to try it out. Some of those misconceptions are a result of the media misrepresenting or the people misunderstanding facts, while others are based on outdated information.\n\nThe lack of consumer protection, the strong association with black market dealings and cyberterrorism, the high volatility of exchange rates are just some of the ideas deeply entrenched in the mind of the general populace, preventing it from taking more interest in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is an innovative technology, even revolutionary, in some regards. So its image is deeply impaired by the preconceived notions of what good money should look like. Even the simple fact that you can’t physically hold or see bitcoins is a stopping factor for some.\n\nIf cryptocurrency is to ever go mainstream, these misconceptions will have to be targeted and addressed by direct PR campaigns of sorts. It has to be explained, for example, that the lack of consumer protection is a feature resulting from the lack of central authority and as such is a necessary sacrifice.\n\nAnd, say, that Bitcoin is as much “criminals’ money” as is cash, which can be used for black market deals just as easily. Whereas the volatility, which used to be strong in the early years, is now the lowest it’s ever been, and that has been true for a while now.\n\nThe final verdict (so far)\n\nIt is clear that there are many hurdles left on Bitcoin’s way to mainstream right now and some will be more difficult to overcome than others. Among the most critical issues are the transaction scaling problem, the relatively high knowhow barrier to entry for users and a distorted public image.\n\nHowever, the prognosis seems to be optimistic. Both the number of daily transactions and the price of Bitcoin have steadily grown to quite substantial levels, despite all the setbacks and crashes on the way. It is clear that there is enough determination and enthusiasm in the Bitcoin community to maintain the current positive dynamics into the future.\n\nMaybe it is more prudent not to count on a single, powerful breakout, especially since such bursts have lead to the no less spectacular crashes in the past. Rather, the continuation of the current steady organic growth could be what Bitcoin needs. It is quite likely that five or 10 years half the world will know what Bitcoin is and we won’t even notice how we got there.', 'Editor’s Note: This post originally appeared in slightly different form on The Finanser blog.\n\nAs referenced in my recent post about the R3 consortium, there are various camps out there fighting for the cryptocurrency crown. The lead runners are bitcoin and Ethereum, and both have serious backing. However, it’s still early days. I keep stressing that we need to remember we are experimenting here, and the endgame is still a ways away. The end game is that there will be a digital currency we can all buy into, whether it’s bitcoin or bityuan or ekrona or ether or monero or any of them, who knows … it could be all. Equally, it could be none.\n\nThis is not a win-lose equation, however, as there is a potential win-win zero-sum game where several currencies and blockchains survive and thrive, with interoperability for different use cases. After all, corporates might use Ethereum while the general public uses bitcoin. So here’s a quick lowdown on how I see it.\n\nBitcoin\n\nAfter blogging about bitcoin for six years, I’ve closely followed its peaks and troughs, ups and downs.\n\nRight now it’s peaking with a price of $1,290 per bitcoin. That makes it worth more than gold, and the bitcoinisters are all over the moon. But there’s the usual factions moving here, with the hype of the bitcoinisters versus the reality of the markets. For example, I’m pleased the price of bitcoin is way up there but (a) it’s meant to be a currency you spend, not an investment you hoard; and (b) it’s still tiny (in terms of the size of the market) when compared with other currencies and commodities.\n\nOn the former note, I’m seeing too many people buying into bitcoin because they’re being suckered by the hype and believe it’s a good investment. It’s a currency, not an investment; or that’s what we should be thinking. On the latter, this quote from Fran Strajnar, co-founder and CEO of Brave New Coin, makes sense: “The gold supply is 180,000 tonnes of ‘above ground’ gold, valued at $7 trillion. The bitcoin market value is $20 billion, so gold vs bitcoin is psychological more than anything.”\n\nYep.\n\nBitcoin has had a lot of people buying into the market, but it’s still a small $20 billion market. A long way to go before we can believe it’s mainstream, and there are plenty of competitors out there such as Zcash, which claims to overcome the deficiencies in bitcoin.\n\nIt is notable that the gold rush of recent bitcoin activity is caused by a variety of factors, from Japan’s legitimizing the currency to China’s outlawing it to the Winklevoss twins\' creating a potential SEC-approved ETF to trade in it. All of these factors, along with Brexit and the Trump presidency, are fueling people to invest. This then creates a virtuous circle of the more who invest, the more who invest. This may all come tumbling down quickly, or it may move mainstream. We just don’t know. What I do know is that we no longer talk about bitcoin as a Wild West, the dark net currency, ridiculous or stupid. People are taking it seriously now, and that’s probably a good thing. Even so, there are many who don’t buy into it, with the currency announced as dead 124 times to date. It’s still not dead, though.\n\nEther\n\nEther is the currency of Ethereum, and this is proving popular with corporates. In fact, it’s so popular that the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance was announced last week, driven by Microsoft, Intel and JPMorgan. That’s saying something.\n\nSo why is Ethereum more popular than bitcoin for corporate users? Because of Microsoft. Microsoft saw the potential of Ethereum for blockchain-as-a-service using their cloud Azure platform early on, and has been driving that project forward ever since to its enterprise account base as the platform of choice. Equally, Ethereum and ether differs from Bitcoin and bitcoins (former is the infrastructure, latter is the currency), because it allows both permissioned and permissionless transactions to take place, whereas bitcoin only works in a permissionless way. For corporates, having transparency of transactions and a completely public ledger just wouldn’t work, which is why corporates and banks aren’t buying into bitcoin.\n\nEthereum is not proven, however, as demonstrated by the infamous DAO hack and hard fork last year. However, it does show the nature of factions and different views when you google “Ethereum fail” and the top results include two next to each other: ""Why Ethereum Succeeded Where Bitcoin Failed"" (Motherboard) and ""How Bitcoin Succeeded Where Ethereum Failed"" (Coinjournal).\n\nThe competition between the various blockchain and distributed ledger models was well summarized recently by Penny Crosman for American Banker in an article focused on Microsoft and IBM’s competing projects, respectively, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project.\n\nIt just goes to show that there are lots of tribes fighting for survival here, and it’s not pretty. The two leading tribes are bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are plenty of others, as I outline above. For banks this leads to choices: do we invest in Ethereum and join the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance or do we become part of R3 CEV’s consortia? It is not even as simple as that, as there are plenty of other alliances out there.', '""We don\'t have a set foundation to build on yet.""\n\nThat\'s how Neha Narula, director of research at MIT\'s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), characterized her institution\'s outlook on progress (or lack thereof) in the blockchain industry at the fourth annual MIT Bitcoin Expo this week.\n\nHosted by the student-run MIT Bitcoin Club, the two-day event served to highlight both the scope of the ongoing work at the university, and the difficulties and challenges being faced by the global developer groups seeking to popularize the technology for wider use.\n\nNarula told the audience:\n\n""[Blockchain technology] has the potential to affect billions of people ... but we also think we are at the very early stages of figuring out what is going on. We are still doing the groundwork. We are defining the layers of the tech stack, and as a consequence, the protocols are still shifting and changing.""\n\nSome of those changes were visible at the conference, where several discussions focused on the all-too-familiar themes of how to scale the bitcoin blockchain while keeping the protocol secure.\n\nSo far, the question of how to increase bitcoin\'s throughput (right now digital currency only handles around seven transactions per second) has divided the community. Some want to scale bitcoin by increasing the block size limit, while others prefer to prioritize off-chain solutions.\n\nThen, there is the question of who gets to make those decisions anyway. Some argue consensus is best left to the protocol\'s nodes and transaction validators (miners). But here, too, the issue quickly becomes complex.\n\nWhile all miners are full nodes by default, developers are concerned too few people are maintaining full copies of the blockchain altruistically.\n\nTo that end, David Vorick, co-founder of the decentralized cloud storage platform Sia, urged more people to spin up full nodes for the benefit of the network.\n\nFull nodes enforce the consensus rules, so the argument is that if not enough enthusiasts run this component of the network, important decision making will fall into the hands of miners, who may be incentivized differently.\n\nVorick warned:\n\n""If you are not running a full node, your opinion on whether or not you like a hard fork is less relevant.""\n\nReducing bloat\n\nToday, most of the nodes on the bitcoin network are lightweight, simplified, payment verification (SPV) nodes that rely on the records kept by other full nodes. But, the problem with running full nodes, developers argue, is they incur costs, such as 125GB of hard-drive space.\n\nSome developers feel that growing storage requirement is just one more thing causing node operators to drop out of the network.\n\nConsider that a year ago, there were 5,700 reachable bitcoin nodes. That number has now dropped to around 4,900, according to Bitnodes, a website that tracks the size of the bitcoin node network.\n\nVorick wasn\'t the only one to focus on bitcoin\'s health in this area.\n\nAs part of an effort to reduce the size of a full node, bitcoin core developer Peter Todd presented a proposal for TXO commitments. Todd feels bitcoin\'s UTXO (unspent transaction output) database is becoming too bloated, making it more difficult for bitcoin users to run a full node.\n\nTodd told CoinDesk:\n\n""TXO [proposal] is a change in how you store and transmit that data. It doesn\'t change the consensus itself. We previously thought it did, but you can actually skip that part.""\n\nElsewhere, Todd was vocal about wanting to keep the bitcoin block size at 1MB. He feels Bitcoin Unlimited (a proposal for raising the block size limit) would make node ownership too onerous, leading to further centralization and creating a security risk for the network.\n\nOff-chain focus\n\nOther speakers at the event kept the focus away from controversial development ideas. Though one could argue, in doing so, they have simply prioritized one set of solutions for the scaling debate.\n\nSimilar to other recent technical conferences, like Scaling Bitcoin Milan, the MIT event saw discussion of so-called top-level or \'layer 2\' bitcoin solutions that many argue will require the much-debated Segregated Witness upgrade.\n\nTadge Dryja, who recently joined the DCI as a researcher, presented a proposal for Lightning Network, which he co-created, in which he made the case for SegWit\'s benefits to projects like his own. Lightning, which uses off-chain payments for processing transactions, is viewed by many as one of the most promising options for scaling bitcoin without the increase in block size.\n\nDryja indicated he is currently working on a Lightning wallet software. But unless the network adopts Segregated Witness, which solves the transaction malleability problem, he\'ll have a lot more work ahead, he said.\n\nHe told the audience:\n\n""This gets really hard when you have transaction malleability. There are ways to do it without Segwit, but it is really annoying, and I have to recode everything.""\n\nVideos of day 1 and day 2 of the event are available on Youtube.\n\nClassroom image via Shutterstock; James D\'Angelo image via Paul Goldstein\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He lays out his argument in a LinkedIn post, which I’ve summarized in the scorecard below.\n\nThe higher the score, the more bubbly the market Bitcoin’s score Reflexivity: Higher prices increase demand 0.5 Leverage: Futures contracts and other instruments 0 Psychology: Overconfidence and “religious” conviction 1 Politics: Regulations and moral hazards 0 Maturity: Potential market remaining 0 Total (out of five) 1.5\n\nAnother blogger has weighed in with his own interpretation of the market using Mansharamani’s framework and concludes that trade in the cryptocurrency is a tad frothier. Whereas Mansharamani gives bitcoin half mark for “reflexivity”—the idea that an asset’s rising price increases demand for it, which investors like George Soros subscribe to—SG Kinsmann’s analysis gives bitcoin a full point for reflexivity. The argument for doing so? Transaction volumes and fees, which indicate demand, have risen along with the price.\n\nStill, that puts bitcoin at just two out of five marks for bubble indicators.\n\nBubble or not, bitcoin investors are in for some price action this week. The US Securities and Exchange Commission only has five more days before it must issue a decision on a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which could really open the floodgates of demand for bitcoin—or bring the price crashing back down.', 'Bitcoin price is in the middle of a pullback from its longer-term climb but might be ready to resume the uptrend if support holds.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has been selling off in the past couple of days after breaking below a short-term rising trend line.\n\nThe longer-term uptrend is still intact and bitcoin price is on its way to test a major support area.\n\nTechnical indicators are suggesting that the uptrend could resume after this correction.\n\nBitcoin price is in the middle of a pullback from its longer-term climb but might be ready to resume the uptrend if support holds.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the upside. In addition, the 100 SMA is holding as dynamic support at the moment and might be enough to keep losses in check. A continued pullback, however, could last until the $1100 channel support closer to the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point.\n\nIf bitcoin price continues to slide below that level, a longer-term downtrend could be in the cards. Stochastic is on the move down to show that sellers are on top of their game at the moment while RSI is also heading south so price action could follow suit.\n\nOnce both oscillators hit the oversold areas and turn higher, buyers could return and push price back up to the channel resistance at $1250 and beyond. The gap between the moving averages is widening to suggest strengthening bullish momentum.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe US dollar is strongly supported these days, thanks to expectations of a March Fed rate hike and overall risk aversion. This has weighed on higher-yielding assets like commodities and bitcoin. Still, an event risk for this behavior is the NFP report due on Friday since it could make or break tightening speculations.\n\nAnalysts are expecting to see a 188K rise in hiring, slower than the earlier 227K pickup. Another factor worth watching is the average earnings index as this would be considered a leading indicator of spending and inflation. The COIN ETF approval by the SEC is also another catalyst for bitcoin volatility this week.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Passage of the bill would take another step toward undermining the Federal Reserve’s monopoly on money.\n\nRep. Matt Schaefer (R-Tyler) introduced House Join Resolution 89 (HJR89) on March 2. If passed, the resolution would place a constitutional amendment on the ballot recognizing the right of the people to own, hold, and use a mutually agreed upon medium of exchange, including cash, coin, bullion, digital currency, or privately issued scrip. The proposal would add the following language to the Texas state constitution.\n\n“The right of the people to own, hold, and use a mutually agreed upon medium of exchange, including cash, coin, bullion, digital currency, or scrip, when trading and contracting for goods and services shall not be infringed. No government shall prohibit or encumber the ownership or holding of any form or amount of money or other currency.”\n\nIn effect, passage of the bill would, as Ron Paul has often said, “legalize the Constitution” by treating gold and silver specie as money. Professor William Greene, an expert on constitutional tender, noted that the proposal would introduce competition with the Federal Reserve. “By introducing competition in currency through ‘recognizing the right of the people to own, hold, and use’ bullion such as gold and silver coins, passage of the amendment would take one more step toward the ultimate goal of ‘nullifying’ the Federal Reserve system,” he said.\n\nThe amendment would also protect the right to own and use digital currencies like bitcoin in the state.\n\nThe legislation builds on recent efforts in Texas to encourage sound money, such as the 2013 law eliminating sales taxes on gold and silver bullion, and the establishment of a precious metals state depository that can develop into a “hard money bank” for average citizens to use gold and silver in everyday transactions.\n\nIf passed by the legislature, the proposed amendment would go before the voters in Nov. 2017.\n\nNULLIFYING THE FED\n\nGreen explained how passage of the amendment would take another step toward nullifying the Fed’s monopoly on money.\n\nAs I noted in a paper I presented at the Mises Institute (“Ending the Federal Reserve from the Bottom Up“), when you introduce competition in currency, “[o]ver time, as residents of the State use both Federal Reserve Notes and silver and gold coins, the fact that the coins hold their value more than Federal Reserve Notes do will lead to a ‘reverse Gresham’s Law’ effect, where good money (gold and silver coins) will drive out bad money (Federal Reserve Notes).” Economist Peter Bernholz has labeled this “reverse Gresham’s law” as “Thiers’ Law,” after French politician and historian Adolphe Thiers. As “Thiers’ Law” takes effect, a cascade of events can begin to occur, including the flow of real wealth toward the State’s treasury, an influx of banking business from outside of the State (as citizens residing in other States carry out their desire to bank with sound money), and an eventual outcry against the use of Federal Reserve Notes for any transactions. Far from causing economic destabilization, as monetary theorist and Constitutional scholar Edwin Vieira notes, a “more sound currency will simply supplant a less sound currency, by operation of the free market.” At that point, the Federal Reserve system will have become unwanted and irrelevant, and can be easily abolished by the people’s elected Representatives in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile praising the amendment as a good first step, Green said there is more to be done.\n\nIf a full version of the Constitutional Tender Act were passed into law, then not only would the use of Federal Reserve Notes by the State be made illegal (because they are in violation of Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution); the use of legal tender U.S. gold and silver coins would be encouraged among the general population as well, along with any other currency that parties mutually consent to using. This would have three immediate effects: the elimination of FRNs from State transactions; the requirement of individuals and businesses to cease using FRNs in their transactions with the State; and (like HJR89) the introduction of competition in currencies among the general population. With all three effects working in tandem, the use of low-value pieces of paper issued by the Federal Reserve will become increasingly irrelevant, and an emaciated Federal Reserve system can much more easily be brought to an end — in essence, a de facto “nullification” by the State of the Federal Reserve itself.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHJR89 will be referred to a House committee where it will need to pass by a majority vote before moving forward in the legislative process.\n\nRelated posts', '', 'The federal government is looking for ways to help blockchain startups jumpstart a slowing economy and make Canada a global mecca for the fledgling technology. Canada is already ranked third in the world behind the United States and the United Kingdom in its number of blockchain startups.\n\nIn recognition of the potential economic benefits of promoting blockchain and other innovative technologies, the Canadian Security Administrators (CSA) have launched a “Regulatory Sandbox Initiative” to mentor and work with new startups in a relatively regulation-free environment. The CSA is an umbrella organization for all the provincial and territorial securities regulatory agencies across the country.\n\n“The CSA’s initiative is a clear answer to the increasing number of businesses interested in using innovative products, services and applications all across Canada,” Sylvain Théberge, a representative from the CSA, told Bitcoin Magazine. “We want to encourage all eligible startups to contact their local securities regulator, which will consider its eligibility and refer it to the CSA regulatory sandbox if it provides genuine technological innovation to contribute to the local and national economy.”\n\n“This type of sandbox program is exactly what blockchain and digital currency companies need,” Kyle Kemper, executive director of the advocacy group Blockchain Association of Canada, told Bitcoin Magazine. “The importance of this should not be understated. The regulators understand that they need to work with innovators to understand the technology, the implications, the threats and, more importantly, the opportunities.”\n\nHe noted that compliance regimes and standards are struggling to keep up with the volume of data, which makes it difficult for all parties to operate effectively. “The sandbox approach is a great way for the regulators to support innovators while also becoming innovators themselves.”\n\nThe CSA has already received applications from startups that don’t mind working with the government to get the regulatory environment right without tying their hands in a competitive international market.\n\nJoseph Weinberg, co-founder and CEO of Paycase and a Blockchain Association of Canada board member, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\n“This partnership for us is incredibly important. As financial services companies, we face the realities of having to navigate this financial terrain that is largely based on traditional systems that operate in fundamentally different ways. Our ecosystem has had many challenges, from getting bank accounts to proper payment processing and more.”\n\n“Any blockchain company that is working on projects that involve KYC, AML and securities compliance should be interested,” added Kemper. “These could include exchanges, brokers, payment solutions, new blockchains, remittance firms, companies looking to ICO, identity solution providers, MSBs, reg tech providers, to name a few.”\n\nAccording to Lise Estelle Brault, CSA senior director of Derivatives Oversight, it is important to establish common standards across the country and to protect investors:\n\n“Regulators have a key role to play in providing legal certainty around the implementation of any new market practices, some of which may cross jurisdictional borders. In the future, regulators could be tasked with ensuring the soundness of the governance built into code and turning the increased transparency into tangible intelligence on market stability.”\n\nBrault acknowledged the challenge facing the CSA, which needs the IT infrastructure, appropriately trained staff and the “organizational agility” to successfully work in a rapidly changing technology market.\n\nThe Regulatory Sandbox Initiative is also open to other new innovative technologies including artificial intelligence and online crowdfunding portals.\n\nOntario Securities Commission’s LaunchPad\n\nThe Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) was the first provincial agency to create a “safe space” for blockchain startups with its OSC LaunchPad program. It has already met with interested startups to strategize ways to test the marketplace without the usual rules and regulations.\n\nWeinberg, whose company, Paycase, is a participant in LaunchPad, observed that it is important to keep discussions with the government as a two-way street, educating and fact-checking to ensure that regulators and government organizations have the best information and the right technology solutions.\n\nThe OSC LaunchPad program recently signed an agreement with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing both agencies to refer startups to each other and help new firms navigate in each other’s regulatory regimes.\n\n“The CSA Regulatory Sandbox is a great example of collaboration among securities regulators to provide a harmonized approach to fintech businesses across Canada,"" said Pat Chaukos, chief of the OSC LaunchPad. ""The OSC LaunchPad team will work with our CSA colleagues to share our experiences and expertise to react to the unique needs of these innovative business models.”\n\nWeinberg said that he appreciates the efforts of the Canadian government to ensure new innovative technologies are not hamstrung by outdated regulations.\n\n“Through initiatives being taken by the blockchain community in Canada, in collaboration with all levels of government, regulators and financial institutions, we have created an environment that is based on collaboration instead of competition, and cooperation instead of collision,” he noted. “Our companies, alliances and bodies of government are paving the way to rapid transformation across all systems of our economy.\n\n“The more we can help our regulators and government bodies understand how they (blockchain, cryptocurrencies) work, the faster we can build a more prosperous economy in Canada and create more Canadian companies that compete at the global level.”']"
03/08/2017,"['An important factor which could play a deciding role in the final March 11 approval of the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN is the suggestions and insights of outside counsel, independent consultants and the public.\n\nOn Feb. 14, all of the organizations and officials related to the approval of the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF participated in a roundtable discussion about the future of the ETF, if it is approved. The discussion focused on how the market would react, potential issues that may arise and benefits of the public for having a Bitcoin ETF readily available.\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, outside advisors in KCG Holdings and Susquehanna International were brought in by the Securities Exchange Commission during the February 14 to offer unbiased insight into the launch of the COIN ETF. This is an important aspect of the approval process as the SEC takes the insights of these outside counsel and consultants to decide whether the COIN ETF is ready to be approved or not.\n\nIn addition to the insights of KCG Holdings and Susquehanna International consultants, the SEC also takes public comments with a serious note, evaluating them and building a consensus amongst public members that have contributed to the Bitcoin ETF commenting process.\n\nThoughts of the public so far\n\nAround 72 percent of the public is in favor of the Bitcoin ETF approval so far. The other 28 percent have cited some of the issues the Bitcoin network is dealing with, but in consideration of the state of the Bitcoin network as of current, the problems mentioned by ETF opposers aren’t necessarily urgent issues which the SEC should consider for the ETF approval.\n\nOne of the issues that were frequently brought up by the ETF opposers were the fear of hard fork. Some of the public comments included concerns over the execution of a potential hard fork and the occurrence of a split chain. A split in the chain could lead to the creation of another fork of bitcoin and essentially create two currencies, the 28 percent of the public stated that a Bitcoin ETF isn’t ready to be introduced to the public.\n\nAs of now, a hard fork seems very far from being executed. For a hard fork to be executed, miners must garner 51 percent of the network’s hash power to make the decision. However, Bitcoin Unlimited isn’t near that threshold. Even if Bitcoin Unlimited is successfully executed and it leads to the creation of another Bitcoin, it won’t be a major issue as everyone within the network will be attributed to an equivalent balance of Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nOne of the many supporting comments was written by Philip C. Chronakis, Attorney, Adjunct Professor of Law, who mentioned that the approval of the Bitcoin ETF will place the SEC in a unique position to oversee the development of Bitcoin. It will also place the US at the forefront of Bitcoin development.\n\nChronakis stated:\n\n“Denial of the proposed rule will not stop Bitcoins progress, but approval of the proposed rule and the underlying COIN ETF, will put the SEC in the ideal position to oversee Bitcoins development as an investment asset – and provide fair, broad-based investment opportunities for not only the connected (or technologically savvy) few, but to all Americans who deserve the same chance to benefit from this technological breakthrough and financial opportunity.”\n\nThis is a situation which the SEC is carefully considering. The SEC doesn’t benefit from the approval of the Bitcoin ETF as the SEC isn’t incentivized for the performance of the ETF. However, the government will most likely want the Bitcoin ETF to be approved in order to maintain a more regulated Bitcoin market which it can oversee.', ""Bitcoin trades down 5.3%, or $65, at $1161 a coin as selling takes hold for a second day.

Members of the Digital Assets Tax Policy Coalition are so worried, Boring said that they don’t want to be publicly named as participants for fear of being targeted by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n“The companies are very afraid to speak out, so the chamber will be the face of this,” Boring said.\n\nThe IRS in 2014 classified all virtual currencies as property for tax purposes, meaning the assets -- much like a home -- can be sold at a profit and trigger tax implications. In November the agency served a summons against Coinbase, seeking details about customers who traded digital currencies from 2013 to 2015. If the government has its way, it could open the door for similar actions against the rest of the industry, said Boring.\n\nMatthew Leas, an IRS spokesman, declined to comment on the issue, citing the agency’s litigation against Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin has grown into the largest digital currency in the world, with a market value of about $20 billion. Like ether and other virtual currencies, bitcoin is made possible by a blockchain, a type of software that works as an account ledger on computers all over the world.\n\nThe ledger tracks, verifies and records every use of a bitcoin to ensure the coins are valid and makes it almost impossible to change a past transaction. Bitcoin users are difficult to trace as the entire network, including their identities, is encrypted with no central authority keeping track of who’s who.\n\nBitcoin fell 4.4 percent Wednesday, to $1,190.27 at 1:46 p.m. New York time. In the past year it’s gained 189 percent.\n\nCoinbase, based in San Francisco, said in a January post on its blog that it agrees with the IRS that users of digital currencies need to pay their taxes, and noted that the exchange has in the past responded to the agency’s subpoenas for specific customers.\n\n“Their most recent subpoena asks us to turn over records on all customers (including transaction history, IP addresses, transcripts with customer support, etc),” Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, said in the blog post. “We feel the IRS’s subpoena is overly broad and incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes.”\n\nThe company has filed procedural motions in the case, David Farmer, a director, said in an email. The timing of enforcement proceedings has yet to be determined and is outside Coinbase’s control, he said.\n\nJohn Does\n\nThe IRS action against Coinbase was in the form of a John Does summons. While the tax authority said at the time that Coinbase was not being accused of wrongdoing, “the IRS uses John Doe summonses to obtain information about possible violations of internal revenue laws by individuals whose identities are unknown,” the agency said in a November statement.\n\nThe chamber is using Steptoe & Johnson LLP as a legal adviser for the tax group, according to an announcement on Wednesday.\n\n“Tax solutions that allow the IRS to do its job without resorting to actions such as a John Doe summons will be of benefit to all,” Jason Weinstein, a partner at Steptoe and co-chair of its blockchain and digital currency practice, said in the announcement.\n\n— With assistance by Lynnley Browning', ""European bitcoin exchange Bitstamp and French banking giant Crédit Agricole have teamed up to launch a new service aimed to allow bitcoin to be accepted by investment funds.\n\nFor its side of the deal, CACEIS, the asset servicing branch of the bank, will provide services covering clearing, depositary and custody of bitcoin bought in through the exchange.\n\nThe goal of the partnership is to increase capital inflows to new investment funds by providing an alternative funding method in the form of the digital currency. Fund promoters, working with CACEIS as a transfer agent, can start accepting bitcoin for fund subscriptions as soon as Q2 2017, the firms indicated.\n\nBitstamp CEO, Nejc Kodri?, sees the partnership as a foothold for bitcoin to be used for mainstream, legitimate investment opportunities,\n\n“Bitstamp’s first partnership with a market-leading, asset-servicing bank like CACEIS means bitcoin investments can now be made within fully licensed and regulated framework,” he said.\n\nAs bitcoin gains traction, it's easy to see why some investors are picking up interest.

Of course, the internet has since become a major influence on our lives, from how we buy goods and services, to the ways we socialize with friends, to the Arab Spring, to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Yet, in the 1990s, the mainstream press scoffed when Nicholas Negroponte predicted that most of us would soon be reading our news online rather than from a newspaper.\n\nFast forward two decades: Will we soon be seeing a similar impact from cryptocurrencies and blockchains? There are certainly many parallels. Like the internet, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are driven by advances in core technologies along with a new, open architecture — the Bitcoin blockchain. Like the internet, this technology is designed to be decentralized, with “layers,” where each layer is defined by an interoperable open protocol on top of which companies, as well as individuals, can build products and services. Like the internet, in the early stages of development there are many competing technologies, so it’s important to specify which blockchain you’re talking about. And, like the internet, blockchain technology is strongest when everyone is using the same network, so in the future we might all be talking about “the” blockchain.\n\nThe internet and its layers took decades to develop, with each technical layer unlocking an explosion of creative and entrepreneurial activity. Early on, Ethernet standardized the way in which computers transmitted bits over wires, and companies such as 3Com were able to build empires on their network switching products. The TCP/IP protocol was used to address and control how packets of data were routed between computers. Cisco built products like network routers, capitalizing on that protocol, and by March 2000 Cisco was the most valuable company in the world. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee developed HTTP, another open, permissionless protocol, and the web enabled businesses such as eBay, Google, and Amazon.\n\nThe Killer App for Blockchains\n\nBut here’s one major difference: The early internet was noncommercial, developed initially through defense funding and used primarily to connect research institutions and universities. It wasn’t designed to make money, but rather to develop the most robust and effective way to build a network. This initial lack of commercial players and interests was critical — it allowed the formation of a network architecture that shared resources in a way that would not have occurred in a market-driven system.\n\nThe “killer app” for the early internet was email; it’s what drove adoption and strengthened the network. Bitcoin is the killer app for the blockchain. Bitcoin drives adoption of its underlying blockchain, and its strong technical community and robust code review process make it the most secure and reliable of the various blockchains. Like email, it’s likely that some form of Bitcoin will persist. But the blockchain will also support a variety of other applications, including smart contracts, asset registries, and many new types of transactions that will go beyond financial and legal uses.\n\nInsight Center Business in the Era of Blockchain Sponsored by Accenture How technology is transforming transactions.\n\nWe might best understand Bitcoin as a microcosm of how a new, decentralized, and automated financial system could work. While its current capabilities are still limited (for example, there’s a low transaction volume when compared to conventional payment systems), it offers a compelling vision of a possible future because the code describes both a regulatory and an economic system. For example, transactions must satisfy certain rules before they can be accepted into the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead of writing rules and appointing a regulator to monitor for breaches, which is how the current financial system works, Bitcoin’s code sets the rules and the network checks for compliance. If a transaction breaks the rules (for example, if the digital signatures don’t tally), it is rejected by the network. Even Bitcoin’s “monetary policy” is written into its code: New money is issued every 10 minutes, and the supply is limited so there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, a hard money rule similar to the gold standard (i.e., a system in which the money supply is fixed to a commodity and not determined by government).\n\nThis is not to say the choices Bitcoin currently offers are perfect. In fact, many economists disagree with Bitcoin’s hard money rule, and lawyers argue that regulation through code alone is inflexible and doesn’t permit any role for useful discretion. What cannot be disputed, however, is that Bitcoin is real, and it works. People ascribe real economic value to Bitcoins. “Miners,” who maintain the Bitcoin blockchain, and “wallet providers,” who write the software people use to transact in Bitcoin, follow the rules without exception. Its blockchain has remained resilient to attack, and it supports a robust, if basic, payment system. This opportunity to extend the use of the blockchain to remake the financial system unnerves and enthralls in equal measure.\n\nToo Much Too Soon?\n\nUnfortunately, the exuberance of fintech investors is way ahead of the development of the technology. We’re often seeing so-called blockchains that are not really innovative, but instead are merely databases, which have existed for decades, calling themselves blockchains to jump on the buzzword bandwagon.\n\nThere were many “pre-internet” players, for example telecom operators and cable companies trying to provide interactive multimedia over their networks, but none could generate enough traction to create names that you would remember. We may be seeing a similar trend for blockchain technology. Currently, the landscape is a combination of incumbent financial institutions making incremental improvements and new startups building on top of rapidly changing infrastructure, hoping that the quicksand will harden before they run out of runway.\n\nIn the case of cryptocurrencies, we’re seeing far more aggressive investments of venture capital than we did for the internet during similar early stages of development. This excessive interest by investors and businesses makes cryptocurrencies fundamentally different from the internet because they haven’t had several decades of relative obscurity where noncommercial researchers could fiddle, experiment, iterate on, and rethink the architecture. This is one reason why the work that we’re doing at the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab is so important: It is one of the few places a substantial effort is being made to work on the technology and infrastructure clear of financial interests and motivations. This is critical.\n\nThe existing financial system is very complex at the moment, and that complexity creates risk. A new decentralized financial system made possible with cryptocurrencies could be much simpler by removing layers of intermediation. It could help insure against risk, and by moving money in different ways could open up the possibility for different types of financial products. Cryptocurrencies could open up the financial system to people who are currently excluded, lower barriers to entry, and enable greater competition. Regulators could remake the financial system by rethinking the best way to achieve policy goals, without diluting standards. We could also have an opportunity to reduce systemic risk: Like users, regulators suffer from opacity. Research shows that making the system more transparent reduces intermediation chains and costs to users of the financial system.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe primary use and even the values of the people using new technologies and infrastructure tend to change drastically as these technologies mature. This will certainly be true for blockchain technology.\n\nBitcoin was first created as a response to the 2008 financial crisis. The originating community had a strong libertarian and antiestablishment spin that, in many ways, was similar to the free-software culture, with its strong anticommercial values. However, it is likely that, just as Linux is now embedded in almost every kind of commercial application or service, many of the ultimate use cases of the blockchain could become standard fare for established players like large companies, governments, and central banks.\n\nSimilarly, many view blockchain technology and fintech as merely a new technology for delivery — maybe something akin to CD-ROMs. In fact, it is more likely to do to the financial system and regulation what the internet has done to media companies and advertising firms. Such a fundamental restructuring of a core part of the economy is a big challenge to incumbent firms that make their living from it. Preparing for these changes means investing in research and experimentation. Those who do so will be well placed to thrive in the new, emerging financial system.\n\nEditor’s Note: The headline on this article has been updated from its original version.', 'Hard forks are generally considered as a security hazard by the Bitcoin community as they could lead to a split chain, the formation of new digital currency and persistent community dispute. ZCash CEO Zooko Wilcox explains the definition of a future friendly fork and how hard forks could be beneficial in some cases.\n\nIn the past, particularly Ethereum, the cryptocurrency community has seen many occurrences of hard forks. Wilcox notes that the danger of a hard fork can be analyzed with the two questions:\n\nDoes it result in two (persistent) separate branches of the original Blockchain? Does it result in community schism?\n\nBased on the answers to the two questions, one can easily analyze the danger of a certain hard fork and if the community or the market must approve the fork in order to make major changes to the Bitcoin Network.\n\nThe case of Ethereum Classic\n\nHard forks of Ethereum are unique in a way that they both belong to each one of the two questions. The hard fork executed by Ethereum Classic resulted in two separate branches of the original Blockchain, with both of them having considerable market caps, user base and activity.\n\nRecently, the Ethereum Classic development team also executed a hard fork of their own, to move away from Ethereum’s original inflationary monetary policy to a deflationary monetary policy.\n\nIn regards to the decision, the Ethereum Classic development team wrote:\n\n“In order to further Ethereum Classic’s vision, the community needs to adopt a monetary policy that balances the long-term interests of investors, developers, and business operators. We will continue to work with the Ethereum Classic protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard fork procedure based on the proposed monetary policy.”\n\nThe monetary policy hard fork of Ethereum Classic represents a hard fork which doesn’t create separate branches of the Ethereum Classic Blockchain and doesn’t lead to community schism. Thus, according to Wilcox’ chart of the hard fork, the Ethereum Classic monetary policy hard fork is an example of a healthy and secure hard fork.\n\n\u200b\n\nEvaluating Bitcoin Unlimited with the same method and principle\n\nThe execution of the Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork would be marked as a dangerous and unsecure hard fork as it leads to both community schism and two persistent and separate branches of the original Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nIf two Bitcoins are created and the argument of the Bitcoin Unlimited supporters is to appeal to a larger user base and gain mainstream adoption, it will be much more difficult to explain what Bitcoin is if there are two units of it.\n\nMore importantly, if the two chains continue to exist, users will have to use both Bitcoin and Bitcoin unlimited tokens to settle transactions, which could lead to a major confusion.\n\nSoft forks are less dangerous in the sense that they don’t lead to separate branches of the original Bitcoin Blockchain. They could lead to community schism but generally, soft forks aren’t designed to make major changes to the protocol.\n\nZCash hopes to execute friendly hard forks in the future if they are necessary and the ZCash development team including Wilcox wants the community to evaluate hard forks for what they are and the benefits they can bring to the network.\n\nWilcox said:', 'The price of bitcoin dropped by some $70 on Tuesday (March 7) for no readily apparent reason, leaving investors naturally a bit confused at best, or panicked at worst.\n\nBitcoin had spent the past week climbing toward new record highs on optimism that the SEC could soon approve a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund. Yet trading on Tuesday morning saw a sharp drop in the value of everyone’s favorite digital currency, from around $1,280 on Monday evening down to just over $1,207 by mid-morning Tuesday.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, bitcoin appears to have begun the process of recovering from the slip. At the time of writing, bitcoin was worth $1,248.63. But in the few hours that the price of bitcoin was down, some speculated that it could mean the SEC had denied approval for a bitcoin ETF.\n\nMore likely than not, the sudden drop was just a symptom of the digital currency’s characteristic volatility. Since the SEC decision deadline is fast approaching, however, some investors, who are surely eyeing every fluctuation in bitcoin’s value, inherently (though a bit hastily) had assumed the worst.\n\nDespite what the graphs might imply, the SEC has yet to make a formal announcement on their decision regarding the Winklevoss twins’ proposed bitcoin ETF. The organization has until March 11.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins’ proposed Bitcoin Trust is one of three potential ETFs that could track the value of bitcoin. If approved, some $300 million could potentially flood the bitcoin ETF during its first week. How bitcoin will fare long term, if introduced to the market, still remains anyone’s guess.\n\nSome are worried, for instance, about security risks surrounding a bitcoin-based ETF, given the cryptocurrency’s rocky history. In February 2014, Mt. Gox shuttered its business after a mysterious “glitch” caused some $500 million worth of bitcoin to go missing. Most of those bitcoins have never been recovered.', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur.

03/09/2017,"['The Winklevoss twins, Internet entrepreneurs and venture capitalists seeking approval of their Bitcoin ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission will know their fate very soon. This event is creating a lot of impact within the Bitcoin community and digital currency market as it could represent a major step towards the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss are American twins born on 21 Aug. 1981. They are rowers who participated in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. The Winklevoss twins are also known for their suit against the founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, claiming that he stole their idea to create the popular social networking site.\n\nPresident of Crypto Consultant Jason Cassidy explains:\n\n“The Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF is an on-ramp for less tech-savvy investors who are looking to get involved and acquire some Bitcoin. It removes the still high barrier to entry that exists for most new entrants.”\n\nCassidy notes that the ETF is a derivative that represents the underlying asset that backs the investment, in this case, Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price underwent several huge swings, suggesting some varied expectations by investors.\n\nAccording to Cassidy, the expected SEC approval could present any of a series of outcomes. He identifies such outcomes as:\n\nIndefinite delay\n\nThe SEC will delay the final decision and push it out into the future. This could be due to an approval not coming down until the market is cooled off significantly.\n\nTimed delay\n\nNo approval is given and the answer is not ""No"" but simply ""Not right now."" The SEC would be buying themselves time to do deeper analysis and let the market mature further.\n\nGreen light\n\nThe ETF is green lighted and clear approval is given. Cassidy sees the possibility of this happening at around 1 in 4 or 25 percent. “It could certainly happen, however, I would not bet on it,” he says.\n\nHowever, Cassidy notes that part of the recent Bitcoin price run could have an ETF approval already partially priced in. Yet, he expects the market to react positively to an approval and a price spike to transpire. Also, a delay on the ruling or a rejection of the ETF according to him should have the same impact on the market, with a rejection obviously being more severe.\n\nCassidy adds:\n\n“I expect the Bitcoin price to drop more from an ETF rejection than to rise from its approval. This is Bitcoin though so anything is possible and it is why I love this industry.”\n\nBitcoin attracts new entrants\n\nThe potential of Bitcoin as a store of value and its tendency to increase in price over a given period of time makes it an attractive venture for investors. Like stock exchanges, Bitcoin exchanges may offer individuals the opportunity to buy and keep the cryptocurrency on the exchange over a certain period of time. It attracts especially those who bet on Bitcoin price growth but are less tech-savvy or worry about Bitcoin thefts from their digital wallets.', 'China\'s bitcoin users and traders may face a further wait for services to be restored at the country\'s major exchanges.\n\nWhile BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin yesterday announced that they had completed technical upgrades requested by the People\'s Bank of China, local legal experts believe a decision is likely to be delayed until the end of the National People\'s Congress, which unites lawmakers through 15th March.\n\nFinancial services consultant Zennon Kapron, an author who has written on China\'s relationship with bitcoin, for example, believes it\'s ""unlikely"" that any change in the regulator\'s current positions will be made before then.\n\nBitcoin withdrawals at major exchanges have been suspended since 9th February, when Huobi and OKCoin revealed they would halt operations for one month in order to upgrade their AML systems.\n\nBTCC, while originally promising a speedy return to normal, eventually said it would delay services for one month, as well, and smaller exchanges later followed suit.\n\nIn agreement with Kapron was Roland Sun, legal lead for blockchain consortium effort ChinaLedger, who said exchanges weren\'t likely to reopen ""this week or next"" due to the congress.\n\nAdding to the speculation is that China-based bitcoin exchange Yunbi, which was one of the rare services not to suspend withdrawals, announced yesterday that it would cease allowing bitcoin and litecoin transactions.\n\nThe exchange stated:\n\n""Due to the uncertainty of AML system upgrading time, the resuming time has not been determined.""\n\nAncient gate image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Its meteoric rise is such that on March 3, 2017, bitcoin overtook gold for the first time, trading at US$1,290 compared to US$1,228 for an ounce of gold.\n\nAll the gold that has ever been mined would easily fit under the legs of the Eiffel Tower – in fact, multiple times. Gold’s scarcity is one reason for its value. Another reason is that it’s a very nonreactive metal so it doesn’t tarnish, which is important if you’ve invested millions and don’t want it to slowly deteriorate.\n\nMost governments keep some of their funds in gold (as the video below explains). But although gold is seen as a safe haven in times of crisis, it is still subject to the usual market fluctuations of any commodity. Once the bitcoin reaches its full potential (all bitcoins are mined) the value will be much more stable.\n\nHow much gold is there and why is it a good investment?\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency used for electronic purchases and transfers. It has recently been gaining popularity and a growing number of businesses, including WordPress, Overstock.com, and Reddit, now accept it as a form of payment. Microsoft already accepts bitcoin payments through its Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile platforms, while those shopping online at Shopify may use bitcoin as payment.\n\nBitcoin is also moving outside the virtual space; what may be the world’s first bitcoin store, House of Nakamoto, opened early this year in Vienna. There, people can buy bitcoins for euros, and vice versa, from a dedicated bitcoin ATM. Drinkers in Cambridge can pay for beers at a pub called The Haymakers.\n\nThe number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million. As of March 2017, there were almost 16.2 million circulating. The supply of coins grows steadily because of the way bitcoin is programmed. Each “miner” (“mining” is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins – anyone with computer knowledge and access to blockchain software can act as a miner) introduces new coins to the supply at a rate of around 12.5 coins every ten minutes.\n\nMining is the process of adding transaction records to bitcoin’s public ledger of past transactions (blockchain). The blockchain confirms transactions as having taken place to the rest of the network.\n\nEven as far back as 2013, bitcoin was worth almost as much as gold. And, at the end of 2016, the total value of bitcoins in circulation was US$14bn.\n\nA good investment opportunity?\n\nInvestment in digital currencies, such as bitcoin, has emerged as an alternative to traditional forms of money and created a niche that’s driving major innovations in the financial sector, such as peer-to-peer lending, and digital wallets. As traders gain confidence in alternative forms of money and payment mechanisms, bitcoin is seen as a possible investment alternative.\n\nIn fact, bitcoin exhibits similar features to gold – limited global supply, maintaining value and hedging against global market volatility. Such is the exuberance in bitcoin investment that it actually outperforms the precious metal, generating an annual return of 155% compared to gold’s annual loss of 6% during the same time period.\n\nEven though Bitcoin seems a profitable investment tool, its value can be as volatile as the value of the gold, depending on the perceived risk of owning bitcoin as a commodity. Bitcoins are encrypted for security purposes, but while the coding identifies the currency itself, it does not identify its owner. If someone hacks the miner system and gets a secret bitcoin code they will eventually become the rightful owner.\n\nEven though Bitcoin seems a profitable investment tool, its value can be as volatile as the value of the gold, depending on the perceived risk of owning bitcoin as a commodity.\n\nWhat, then, is pushing the investment value of bitcoin? One driver is increasing demand from developing countries, especially Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. These countries are experiencing economic distress and weakening currencies, making their local currencies unpredictable and volatile. As a result, it’s becoming increasingly popular to use bitcoin as a natural hedge against paper currency.\n\nAnother contributing factor to the rise of bitcoin is the possibility of a trade war between US and China. US President Donald Trump has indicated that he may impose 45% tariff on Chinese imports. This may lead to a weakening yuan, and capital outflow from China as investors will resort to more stable currencies such as euros.\n\nThe hike in bitcoin’s price during financial troubles is also a testament to its increasing attraction as a hedging tool.\n\nWhen Cyprus’s economy crashed in 2013, the price of bitcoins spiked as people resorted to other forms of payment than the national currency. In 2015, when the Chinese currency was in free fall, people in the country turned to bitcoin alongside gold.\n\nAnd after the Brexit vote in the UK, when global currencies and stock markets tanked, bitcoin’s value rose more than US$100 compared to the previous day. This was mainly due to some of the speculative money flowing out of the pound and yuan making its way to bitcoin.\n\nIncreased government support\n\nBitcoin is not just getting increased interest from tech-savvy individuals and banks such as Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, State Street, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS. Governments are also lending support to the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Australian government plans to reduce tax on bitcoin transactions. Current treatment of the digital currency under the goods and services tax (GST) law means that consumers are “double taxed” when using it to buy anything already subject to GST. The government plans to change this.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK’s chief scientific adviser has said that governments should use bitcoin’s underlying technology – blockchains – to help with taxes, benefits and passports.\n\nTaking its cue from bitcoin, the US government is planning to launch a legalized cryptocurrency called Fedcoin, which can be exchanged for a physical dollar. Bitcoin is not considered legal tender because it is not backed by any government.\n\nWhat we can say with certainty is that we cannot use gold to buy bitcoin directly but bitcoin can be used to buy gold.\n\nBitcoin pricing is also motivating the much-anticipated establishment of the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. An ETF is an investment company that has no restrictions on the amount of shares it can issue.\n\nThe approval of a bitcoin ETF would make the cryptocurrency more attractive to risk-averse institutional investors as it would allow an easier way to gain access to bitcoin than buying it directly.\n\nSuch is the dominance of bitcoin that the Bank of England issued a white paper on the subject, investigating the possibility of central banks minting their own cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin’s appeal, compared to gold, comes from two factors. First, it can be used as an easy medium for payments (for a limited but growing number of transactions), which gold cannot replicate. And with their limited supply of 21 million, bitcoins are likely to attract higher demand compared to gold.\n\nThe debate over the supremacy of gold versus bitcoin will continue. What we can say with certainty is that we cannot use gold to buy bitcoin directly but bitcoin can be used to buy gold. You can decide which you prefer.', '', ""The call to raise a bounty for the development of a code that would enable a safe User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) has raised the issue of a likely lapse in the exchange traded fund arrangement.\n\nFollowing news that Antpool mined a Bitcoin Unlimited block and several how-to-manage double Bitcoin wallets tutorials burst online, some Bitcoin users have joined the call to raise a bounty that was initiated by Samson Mow, an entrepreneur who has committed to offering one Bitcoin for the bounty.\n\nDamage control\n\nThe call is to foster the deployment of a safe UASF to “control the damage BU will do to the Bitcoin economy.”\n\nSeveral others have since joined the call with the offer to commit financially. So far on Mow’s page, about six Bitcoins have been raised as at the time of this writing. This amount is still below the amount a known voice in the Bitcoin Unlimited camp stated his team would offer to “control the damage” UASF will do to exchanges.\n\nEarlier, Jihan Wu had offered a 10 Bitcoin bounty for whoever produces a guiding document for exchanges in the event of a split, which he had stated will occur if UASF is implemented. His tweet says the Blockchain is likely to split and create two or three kinds of Bitcoin if the majority of miners vote against the activation of SegWit.\n\nThere are suggestions that Coinbase/GDAX and Bitfinex will list the BU chain as a new altcoin in the event of a chain fork.\n\nIt is worth noting that although the two sides are expressing different views, this does not necessarily mean one is right while the other is wrong but rather that it is a representation of the shared views by sections of a large group.\n\nWhat is also clear is the understanding that Bitcoin momentum is growing and the network effect it is presently creating will be a great opportunity for its advancement.\n\nETF’s possible lapse\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core’s Peter Todd warns that it is not clear yet how safe UASFs actually are or the best way to deploy them, with some suggesting that the bounty raised could be used to push research and development forward in that regard, the question of what happens to an approved ETF in the event of a split in Bitcoin surfaced.\n\nThis is a key lapse in the ETF arrangement that hasn’t been fully discussed and factored into the filing request. Many in the Bitcoin ecosystem have been anticipating the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF this weekend, but as others in the community have raised, the ongoing block size saga with a possibility of a split could be a cog in its wheel. Day traders/speculators would have had a field day if a situation like this had happened with an ETF in operation. Todd added that the ETF hasn't hired competent Bitcoin experts to evaluate their plans.\n\nMeanwhile, the unfolding situation continues to be a testament of what Bitcoin was created to withstand - contention and disagreement."", 'Launching March 10th 2017 at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference and Festivals in Austin, Texas, OZcoinGold expects its limited-issue next-gen cryptocurrency, backed by 100,000 ounces of gold, to reshape financial markets and cryptocurrency models alike.\n\n""OZcoinGold offers the security of a commodity such as gold and the increased investment return potential of forces like market premium,"" Company President Ira Carlin said. ""As an example Bitcoin has no asset backing and is trading more than the price of gold (6Mar2017). Thus Bitcoin\'s value is totally market premium. The fixed number of OZcoinGold units (linked to and backed by 100,000 ounces of 24 karat gold) prevents the production of more OZcoinGold coins. This means that unlike fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, OZcoinGold cannot be devalued by the production of more coins.""\n\nBuilt on 3rd Gen. blockchain technology using Ethereum blockchain, the safest and most advanced cloud-based blockchain-tech in the world, OZcoinGold is at the forefront of financial and investment security. ""With the addition of advanced personal security features built into OZcoinGold Wallet, individuals have more control over their OZcoinGold coins than any other cryptocurrency in the world,"" stated founder and CTO Johannes Breytenbach.\n\nStructured so that one hundred (100) OZcoinGold coins are equal to one (1) ounce of 24 karat gold, OZcoinGold secures an initial minimum price equal to the current price of gold. According to founder and CTO Johannes Breytenbach, ""OZcoinGold presents a unique opportunity to investors. By investing in gold via OZcoinGold there is no Bid-Ask variation and other gold purchase related costs, and for long term investors there are no storage fees on your gold bullion.""\n\nInitially each 100 OZcoinGold coins are backed by 1/3 of an ounce of gold bullion stored in Australia\'s Perth mint (in continuous business since 1899) and 2/3 of an ounce of secured gold reserves.

With the passage, the measure now moves to the state Senate for further consideration. Public records currently do not indicate when the New Hampshire Senate will take up the bill.\n\nSpecifically, HB 436 seeks to exempt virtual currency users from having to register as money service businesses, while also creating a formal definition for ""virtual currency"" under state law.\n\nAccording to a draft text of the bill, the exemption applies to ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"".\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Rep. Barbara Biggie, a former Western Union employee, and co-sponsored Rep. Keith Ammon, a bitcoin early adopter and libertarian activist in New Hampshire. The bill was first introduced in January, moving out of the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee on 16th February.\n\nHB 436 stands in contrast with New York’s BitLicense, formalized in 2015, which added new compliance layers under the state\'s financial regulations for businesses dealing in digital currencies.\n\nThe bill\'s advancement is the latest sign that state legislatures around the US are moving quickly on new laws related to the tech.\n\nJust this week, lawmakers in Maine put forward a proposal to create a commission that would study the veracity of blockchain-based elections.

The new financial vehicle will be structured exactly like the Bitcoin Investment Trust, run privately and available to accredited investors, such as those those with a net worth of more than $1 million or with $200,000 in annual income. It will also have minimum investment requirements, which are yet to be disclosed.\n\nEventually, just like Bitcoin Investment Trust, it may start trading over the counter, Silbert said in an interview. The bitcoin trust, started in 2013, is currently waiting for approval to list on the NYSE Arca market.\n\nBy increasing demand for classic ether, the trust could boost the price of the digital currency, which is less than a year old. Classic ether, in which Silbert and his Digital Currency Group are investors, currently has a market value of about $116 million, having appreciated 44 percent since July, according to CoinMarketCap.com.\n\nPrices for bitcoin and other digital currencies have been surging, partly on a bet that their value will be increased by attempts to make them more widely available for trading. Bitcoin hit a record last week, though it has fallen in the past few days, dropping 6.4 percent Wednesday to $1,165.19.\n\nClassic ether is a far less well known currency that bitcoin, which has a market value of $18.7 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com. It was created after infighting among holders of ether, a separate currency that now has a market value of about $1.48 billion.\n\nClassic ether’s development and rules governing the nets; recently, developers announced there will be no more than 230 million classic ether tokens issued -- a decision that makes the digital currency a scarce resource, just like bitcoin.\n\nSponsored by Grayscale Investments, which Silbert founded, the Bitcoin Investment Trust emerged when bitcoin cost around $100, a far cry from its current price. The trust now has about $220 million in assets under management.\n\n“I think we’ve demonstrated success,” Silbert said. “And I think we demonstrated our ability to identify an investment opportunity before it attracted a lot of attention and a lot of capital.” Grayscale will publish a thesis for the new trust on Thursday.\n\nIn the future, Grayscale Investments may introduce other products focused on additional digital currencies, Silbert said. One other digital currency he holds is Zcash, he said.\n\n— With assistance by Rob Golum', 'Bitcoin continues to make chaotic waves in the finance industry, with one bitcoin currently worth about $1,250 as of this writing. What\'s great about bitcoin is that you don\'t need to shell out rent money to get in the game, because bitcoins can be bought in increments—basically, whatever you can afford. As an example, I buy bitcoins frequently, but only in small increments that I can afford. At least once a month, I put away loose change that would\'ve otherwise gone to small purchases like packs of gum, and transfer them over to my bitcoin account. All in all, I probably spend a little over $10 a month. As bitcoins are currently highly volatile, these purchases can grow or lose value over time, but it\'s ultimately worth the risk for me in the long term, as I only use money I don\'t mind losing. Anyone who wants to get into the world of bitcoin must first obtain a wallet to store their funds. Smartphones are our constant companions, and there\'s no shortage of bitcoin wallet apps on the Google Play Store, but the issue is finding one that fits your particular needs. So here are some of the best wallet apps available for Android, with their key features listed plainly to help you find the right one for you. Don\'t Miss: Gamble with Bitcoin—Even if It\'s Banned in Your Country—Using Any Smartphone\n\n1. Coinbase Coinbase is a bitcoin exchange platform based in San Francisco and founded in 2012. It has apps for both iOS and Android, and features built-in wallets for bitcoins, ether, and the good old US dollar. The wallets are very secure, requiring a three-step verification process in order to access the Coinbase app. Install Coinbase for free from the Google Play Store As a US-based exchange, Coinbase requires an extensive identity verification process during signup that gives it an air of legitimacy—something the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still in dire need of. Proof of ID and residency have to be sent over and reviewed, similar to opening a bank account. Once approved, a user can link his bank account, debit, and credit cards to get started trading. Coinbase is a great option for those new to the world of bitcoin, or those who casually dabble in it. The app is incredibly intuitive to use, and has the ability to instantaneously convert bitcoins to dollars and vice versa by using its built-in wallets for both currencies. If you\'re adventurous enough, you can day-trade using the Coinbase app alone, and potentially make your bitcoin holdings grow. Since all holdings are stored within the app itself, there\'s never any need for a backup. As convenient as it is, many will bemoan the fact that their bitcoins are stored within Coinbase itself, as it may not be as secure as a wallet that\'s kept completely private. Another downside is that Coinbase is subject to capital gains taxes, and with the IRS knocking on its door, it\'s sure to turn off individuals who value privacy in choosing a wallet. Coinbase also monitors bitcoin transfers from known gambling sites, so users will need to be cautious with transferring their gambling wins as it can result in account suspension.\n\nCoinbase Summary iOS app: yes\n\nyes backup needed: no\n\nno verification: login, SMS, email\n\nlogin, SMS, email buy and sell: yes, within Coinbase\n\nyes, within Coinbase bank transfers: yes\n\nyes identity required: yes\n\nyes outstanding feature: built-in USD wallet that enables lightning-fast transactions for day trading\n\n2. Mycelium Bitcoin is often praised for its emphasis on privacy and anonymity, so the developers behind Mycelium applied these same principles to their bitcoin wallet app. When it comes to privacy, Mycelium is considered the gold standard of Android bitcoin wallets, as it uses HD (hierarchical deterministic) seeds to streamline security and transaction speed, meaning that to back up your bitcoins, you only need to remember a set of twelve English words. Install Mycelium for free from the Google Play Store Anonymity is a big plus with Mycelium, as users don\'t need to go through any rigorous identity verification processes to get started buying and selling bitcoins. To keep things even more private, all web-based transactions are funneled through the Tor network to hide the user\'s location and identity. Mycelium gives its user the added benefit of buying and selling bitcoins locally through its Mycelium Marketplace, which is a great way to instantly trade bitcoins for cold hard cash. Not only that, but local transactions can give you slightly more flexible prices over Coinbase\'s fixed pricing, as it provides a bigger pool from which to select the best prices. You can also use your debit and credit cards to buy bitcoins, which is done through an external site only accessible within the Mycelium app. This is what you should see when buying with credit or debit from the Mycelium app. Mycelium has the ability to sync with increasingly popular hard wallets like Trezor and Ledger. Similar to USB sticks in appearance, these wallets are external hardware devices specifically made for securely storing bitcoins. It\'s very easy to use the external wallet—simply plug it into your phone and open Mycelium to get the ball rolling. From there, just verify and confirm the transaction in your external wallet and you\'re all set! A Trezor external wallet. Image by IMineBlocks/YouTube Mycelium can take a little time to get used to, as the app itself is not as intuitive as Coinbase. Trading, for example, is located within the Balance page, and isn\'t a main option, which can get a little confusing when first starting out. But aside from little hiccups like that, Mycelium is a solid wallet app that keeps your transactions as private as possible, making it highly recommended.\n\nMycelium Summary iOS app: no\n\nno backup needed: yes\n\nyes verification: randomly-generated master key\n\nrandomly-generated master key buy and sell: yes (buy with debit, credit, and through Glidera)\n\nyes (buy with debit, credit, and through Glidera) bank transfers: yes, via Coinapult\n\nyes, via Coinapult identity required: no\n\nno outstanding feature: ability to trade locally using its built-in Marketplace for anonymous transactions Don\'t Miss: The 4 Best Phones for Privacy & Security\n\n3. Copay Developed by veteran company BitPay, Copay is another great bitcoin wallet app that differentiates itself with a focus on security and cyber-theft prevention. Like Mycelium, Copay requires you to back up your wallet, and uses the same HD-generated twelve-word system to lock down your wallet. Install Copay for free from the Google Play Store The defining feature of Copay, however, is its multi-signature functionality. With this, a user can create a single bitcoin wallet with multiple devices as signatories. With this feature, a user can create three sets of keys on two phones and a piece of paper, as an example. When a transaction is processed, it will require two signatures (from the phones or paper) in case one is out of reach. This makes it incredibly secure against cyber fraud, as the would-be thief would have to hack into at least two separate devices to access your funds. Note Copay\'s simple interface, which makes buying and selling a breeze. Copay lets the user sync with Coinbase and Gildera to buy and sell bitcoins, but unfortunately, the app lacks the ability to make local transactions like Mycelium. You can also access the ""Buy and Sell"" page from the side navigation menu. By far the biggest letdown with Copay is its transaction management. Currently, only one central server monitors and manages all the transactions. Though your coins are relatively safe from theft, transactions are vulnerable to DDoS attacks and other server-related issues that may arise, leaving you with coins that can\'t be spent due to server downtime. Due to this flaw, people who make a lot of bitcoin transactions might want to avoid Copay, at least until its one-server system is remedied.\n\nCopay Summary iOS app: yes\n\nyes backup needed: yes\n\nyes verification: backup-generated master key\n\nbackup-generated master key buy and sell: yes, via Coinbase and Gildera\n\nyes, via Coinbase and Gildera bank transfers: yes, synced with Coinbase\n\nyes, synced with Coinbase identity required?: no\n\nno outstanding feature: multi-signature option gives an extra layer of protection from theft\n\nConclusion As you can see, there are many options to choose from when picking the best Android wallet to suit your personal needs. If you\'re a novice user who wants a good balance of simplicity and features, Coinbase is probably your best bet. However, if privacy and anonymity are your priorities, Mycelium might be a better fit. Then, for folks who want extra anti-theft measures, Copay offers a great solution.

In his view, economically relevant full nodes are the ones that have “voting” power (for lack of a better term) in attempted hard-forking changes to the rules of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWhat Is the Role of the Full Node?\n\nEarly in his talk, Vorick focused on the general role played by full nodes on the network. “Full nodes validate transactions on the Bitcoin network,” he stated. “Bitcoin has this longest-chain rule where the chain with the most work in it is the one that everybody follows, except this chain also has to follow all of the rules that the network has. The full nodes are the ones [that] check that the chain follows the rules, and if a chain doesn’t follow the rules, it doesn’t matter how much hashrate is behind it, that chain is ignored.”\n\nAccording to Vorick, of all the different types of Bitcoin users, full nodes are the only ones that check that the rules are followed. Those who run an SPV node or use some sort of web wallet are putting their trust in others to verify that certain rules are being followed correctly on the most-work chain.\n\n“They’re faster,” Vorick said in terms of SPV nodes. “They download all the headers. They make sure that they are on the chain with the most work, but they don’t actually check that the chain with the most work is legal or is valid.”\n\nVorick went on to state that SPV nodes are essentially betting that the rest of the network will sufficiently handle the validation process for them.\n\n“SPV nodes just blindly have faith in the broader network to do this process that makes sure that the longest chain is always valid,” Vorick continued. “They don’t actually know. They’re just assuming that the broader network is going to keep them safe.”\n\nWithout full nodes, Vorick says, miners are given the ability to do whatever they want. “If people can spend each other’s money [or] if miners can [produce] money out of nowhere, you have a useless system,” he added.\n\nUpgrades in Bitcoin\n\nVorick also talked about how upgrades are made to the Bitcoin network. When talking about upgrades, he was referring to hard forks specifically. He also referred to soft forks as patches.\n\n“Soft forks don’t actually change the rules; they just are more creative about how they use the rules,” Vorick explained.\n\nIn terms of attempted hard forks, Vorick claimed there are three potential outcomes. In one, the hard fork could fail and everyone may decide to ignore the failed chain. Vorick pointed to the recent block larger than 1 million bytes accidentally mined by Bitcoin.com as an example of a failed upgrade.\n\nAnother possible outcome from an attempted hard fork is that economic activity continues to take place on both chains. Vorick referred to this as a “partially successful upgrade,” and he used the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic as an example of this outcome.\n\nThe third possible outcome mentioned by Vorick is a successful hard fork with new rules where the new chain becomes the only chain people use and everyone ignores the old chain. Besides the hard fork that resulted in the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, the Ethereum chain has also had multiple successful hard forks.\n\nEconomically Relevant Full Nodes Have the Power\n\nWhen determining the level of success achieved by an attempted upgrade, Vorick claimed that it ultimately comes down to the desires of the full nodes. “If you’re not running a full node, sort of your opinion on whether or not you like a hard fork is less relevant because, ultimately, if you’re not validating the rules and someone gives you a transaction following a different rule set, you don’t have a way to detect that,” he explained. “So you can’t actually weigh in on an attempted hard fork, an attempted upgrade.”\n\nVorick then compared full nodes to representatives in a democracy; however, he also pointed out that some full nodes are much more economically relevant than others. BitPay, for example, has a bigger say in what happens than a full node sending and receiving one small payment per month.\n\nAccording to Vorick, users can be dragged along with miners and large businesses if the cost of running a full node is too high. “If full nodes are expensive to run, only people who are capable of running nodes really have any say in what happens in a contentious upgrade,” he added.\n\nAs an example, Vorick pointed out that Ethereum Classic may not have ever existed if it cost too much for the original Ethereum chain’s early supporters to run full nodes.\n\n“I would advocate that, right now, full [Bitcoin] nodes are too expensive,” Vorick concluded.']"
03/10/2017,"[""It is official. The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) denied the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN on March 10.\n\nAlmost immediately after the public statement from the SEC was released to the public, Bitcoin price plunged, from $1,350 to $980 within seconds. Bitcoin price recovered relatively quickly thereafter, maintaining stability at the $1,100 margin.\n\nIn its official statement, the SEC wrote:\n\n“As discussed further below, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter.”\n\nWhy was the COIN ETF denied?\n\nOne of the major parts of the public announcement of the SEC focused on surveillance sharing agreements. For the SEC to approve a Bitcoin ETF, in this case, the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN, the commission had to know with full certainty that the exchange traded funds of COIN can be surveilled and tracked without any potential boundaries or obstacles moving forward.\n\n“First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated,” the document read.\n\nAs a response, Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos wrote:\n\nThe ETF was denied because bitcoin can't be regulated, can't be surveilled.\n\n\n\nFeature, not bug. — Andreas (@aantonop) March 10, 2017\n\nBitcoin non-profit research and advocacy center Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito also noted:\n\n“The Winklevoss ETF proposal was rejected because the SEC found that the significant markets for Bitcoin tend to be unregulated overseas markets that are potentially subject to price manipulation. But this creates a chicken and egg problem. How do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the US and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?”\n\nFuture of Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nWhile most analysts agree that a Bitcoin ETF is not necessary at this stage of Bitcoin development and growth, the SEC believes that regulated Bitcoin-related markets will develop over time and is willing to approve or introduce ETFs in the future that complies with the requirements of the Exchange Act.\n\nSome ETFs including the SolidX Bitcoin ETF are still under the consideration of the SEC. If the SolidX development team can gather information on the failure of the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF and use that to their advantage for their approval, the Bitcoin industry could see the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF relatively soon.\n\nHowever, if the SEC’s core argument on disapproving a Bitcoin ETF revolves around surveillance issues and unregulated OTC markets, then it seems as if it would be a great compromise for Bitcoin security to push for the approval of a Bitcoin ETF."", 'Jurors in Manhattan federal court on Friday prepared to weigh charges against a Florida software engineer and a New Jersey pastor accused of scheming to help an illegal bitcoin exchange escape scrutiny.\n\nThe unlicensed bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, was linked to an investigation of a data breach at J.P. Morgan Chase (jpm) that exposed more than 83 million accounts. The company disclosed the breach in 2014.\n\nProsecutors claim that Yuri Lebedev helped arrange bribes to pastor Trevon Gross, including $150,000 in donations to his church. In exchange, they say, Gross helped the operator of Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, take over a small credit union Gross ran from his church.\n\nMurgio used the credit union to evade scrutiny of banks wary of processing payments involving the virtual currency, prosecutors say. Lebedev is accused of working for Coin.mx through a front called “Collectables Club.”\n\nBut lawyers for Lebedev, 39, and Gross, 47, have painted a different picture, saying their clients did not know that Murgio was running an illegal operation.\n\nIn a closing statement on Thursday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eun Young Choi reviewed numerous text messages, emails and voice recordings presented to jurors during the four-week trial, which she said proved that Lebedev and Gross acted with “corrupt intent.”\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter\n\nLebedev’s lawyer, Eric Creizman, in his closing statement called the evidence a “hodgepodge” designed to “maximize the smoke” around Lebedev.\n\n“But if you look behind the smoke, there’s no fire there,” he said.\n\nHenry Klingeman, Gross’ lawyer, likewise said his client “never thought, at the time these things were happening, that he was doing anything illegal.”\n\nIn a rebuttal delivered on Friday morning, Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble again urged the jury to consider what he called a “mountain of documentary evidence.”\n\nThe trial followed a probe rooted in the J.P. Morgan data breach, which lead to charges against nine people.\n\nGross, Lebedev and Murgio were not accused of hacking. But prosecutors said Coin.mx was owned by an Israeli who was behind the breach, Gery Shalon.\n\nProsecutors say Shalon, together with Maryland-born Joshua Samuel Aaron, orchestrated cyber attacks that resulted in the theft of information from more than 100 million people.\n\nProsecutors said they carried out the hacks to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with promotional emails. Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMurgio pleaded guilty to charges related to Coin.mx in January. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16.', 'Prosecutors are demanding that three men charged with selling drugs online in Norway repay their profits in 120 bitcoins (US$144,300) and millions of Norwegian kroner. It marks the first time the country has asked for payment in the electronic currency.\n\nRichard Beck Pederson, a prosecutor in the case, told AP that the men allegedly used underground websites including Silk Road to sell drugs, and that most of the payments were done with bitcoins, since the currency has a high degree of anonymity.\n\nThe prosecutor said that investigators have “evidence for the sale in bitcoins,” adding that prosecutors are also demanding they pay 3.1 million Norwegian kroner ($360,000).\n\nRead more\n\nThe men were formally charged with selling drugs earlier on Friday.\n\nBeck Pederson said a “challenging” two-year probe previously took place into the drug sales, in which Norwegian police worked with investigators abroad. The case was found to be linked to the drug-selling Silk Road website, which was shut down in 2013 when its founder was arrested in the US.\n\nAccording to the prosecutor, the trio had formed an organized drug-selling group, in which they sent narcotics by mail to their customers.\n\nThe men were arrested in June 2015 in the greater Oslo area. Investigators seized “considerable amounts of narcotics” at the time, along with several computers and an illegal indoor marijuana farm.\n\nAlthough the case marks the first time the Norwegian government has demanded payment in bitcoins, Beck Pederson stressed that “this is in no way an official Norwegian recognition of the digital currency.”\n\nA trial is expected to take place later this year.\n\nBitcoin is an electronic currency that allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money without involving banks, credit card companies, or other third parties. Its legal status varies widely from country to country, with some nations welcoming Bitcoin and others banning it. Critics say the currency has made it easier to conduct organized crime dealings.\n\nMeanwhile, some experts say Bitcoin is becoming more valuable than gold, with the currency hitting all-time highs last week.', ""In 2010, a Florida programmer called Laszlo Hanyecz convinced someone to accept 10,000 Bitcoins he’d mined on his computer in exchange for two pizzas. Back then, when the currency was still in its infancy, that amounted to around $25. On today’s exchange rate those pizzas would be worth an eye-watering $12,046,100.\n\n“It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz said in an interview with the New York Times. “No one knew it was going to get so big.”\n\nThe unprecedented success of Bitcoin\n\nFast-forward to 2017 and times have changed for Bitcoin, so much so that major banks, venture capitalists and forward-thinking individuals have shown a growing interest in the currency. At the last count, around 150,000 merchants now accept Bitcoin with the number of daily confirmed Bitcoin transactions at just under 300,000.\n\nUnlike 2010, the cost of one Bitcoin is now trading at $1,252 despite a slight drop from a March high of just under $1,300. Recent developments such as the Bitcoin ETF's pending SEC approval indicate that the currency has reached a tipping point.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, David Farmer from Coinbase said the company believes it is increasingly likely that a Bitcoin ETF will be approved at some point this year.\n\n“Our professional trading exchange GDAX has received a lot of inbound interest from Wall Street firms,” Farmer said. “If an ETF is approved, this large institutional volume will enter the ETF and spot markets and trusted and regulated exchanges like GDAX will play an important role in creating a well-functioning asset-based ETF.”\n\nSo, with the digital currency steadily rising over the last six years, is this the last chance to buy Bitcoin?\n\nAre the days of making big money from Bitcoin really over?\n\nIn an article from The Motley Fool, it says: “The days of making big money from Bitcoin are almost certainly over, while the risks are as high as they ever were.” While there are some who will disagree, there is some truth in what’s being said.\n\nAt the rate the currency is trading at, it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to invest in the currency. Not only that, but Bitcoin remains volatile. Its price slumped after the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2013 and more recently in January as China attempted to bolster the yuan. If its price were to drastically collapse, no central bank would rush to help with compensation.\n\nAnd yet, while it may be difficult for people to invest in the currency, this could be the last opportunity to do so.\n\nDiversification is key to an investment portfolio\n\nAccording to analyst Adam Davies, who recently spoke to CNBC, the price of Bitcoin could hit $3,000 by the end of the year, representing a near 150 percent increase from its current price, at the time of publication. Additionally, as the supply of Bitcoin is limited, its price is expected to increase over time.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, David Motta, business financial consultant, marketer and investor, said that he thinks the coin will continue to go up.\n\n“[However], I think it’s wiser to invest $10,000 in something that I can purchase for .04 cents that can eventually reach $1 per coin, instead of investing $10,000 in Bitcoin and [waiting] for it to go up another $1,200 to double my investment,” he said.\n\nHe adds, though, that people should expand their portfolio and diversify with other coins in the market to lower risks and to make big money over the long-term.\n\nDiversification is key to an investment portfolio and will do well to have some Bitcoin attached to it, so if you buy Bitcoin now, you may do well over time with them. As with all investments, though, there will be ups and downs to it."", ""Bitcoin exploded to an all-time high on Friday morning. The cryptocurrency surged more than $120 to a record high of $1,327 a coin shortly before 8:30 a.m. ET. While bitcoin has pulled back from its record peak, it remains firmly bid, up 8.3%, or $99, at $1,291.\n\nFriday's gains come ahead of the highly anticipated US Securities and Exchange Commission ruling on whether or not it will approve at least one of the three proposed bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds by a March 11 deadline. Because that deadline falls on a Saturday, a decision may not be announced until Monday, March 13.\n\nBitcoin has had a volatile start to 2017. It gained more than 20% in the opening week of the year before crashing 35% on rumblings China would begin to crack down on trading. But the cryptocurrency has been able to shrug off news that China's biggest exchanges started to charge a flat fee of 0.2% per transaction in addition to them blocking customer withdrawals.\n\nBitcoin gained 120% in 2016 and has been the top performing currency in each of the past two years."", 'The digital database system blockchain could offer a more comprehensive and safer approach to how doctors access patient medical records. Above, a doctor prepares a prescription on a computer. - Adam Berry/Getty Images\n\nListen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src=""https://www.marketplace.org/2017/03/14/health-care/heard-blockchain-you-will-soon/popout"" frameborder=""0"" width=""100%"" height=""240px""></iframe>\n\nIt\'s 2017, but medical records are still mostly stuck in the dark ages. Most hospitals use electronic health records, but if you want your primary care doctor to share information with your allergist or surgeon, it’s a pain.\n\nThe most popular idea right now for connecting medical records — without compromising privacy — is blockchain. The platform used for bitcoin, the digital currency system, could serve health care.\n\nSome of us can remember the old days when doctors thumbed through paper records. These days, they mostly look at records on computers, but the same problems exist: the records from your eye exam, from your blood test — they’re not connected. Even worse, they’re saved on central servers, so they’re easy to hack.\n\nNow, imagine instead, all those pieces of digital paper are encrypted. You need a code to see any single piece. Then the pieces are uploaded into a peer-to-peer computer network. For a doctor who has permission, those digital pieces come together like a puzzle.\n\nThat’s blockchain. Right now, Bitcoin uses blockchain to track financial transactions. Folks in health care want to use it to encrypt and share medical information.\n\nVenkatesh Hariharan is CEO of HealthNextGen in Dallas.\n\n“So if I get even one piece of it that’s not good enough, it’s useless,” Hariharan said. “How many places are you going to hack?”\n\nThere is a lot of hype around blockchain in health care at the moment.\n\n“Blockchain’s going to be game-changing,” Greg Harris, with NewWave Technologies, said. “I can’t think of a more disruptive technology on the market at present.”\n\nHarris just spent a week at one of the health-tech industry’s largest conferences demonstrating how his company’s product, Patient Wallet, would use blockchain to give patients power over their health records.\n\n“And the idea of using this would be: Maybe I’m in a different country, and I have to go for an emergency visit, and I don’t want to spend four hours filling out paperwork. So all I do is ask the hospital for their identification, and I delegate access to all of my health care records, or all the ones I want to give them.”\n\nThis instant access to electronic health records does raise legal questions, especially about sharing data outside the U.S. But it would mean less paperwork and lower administrative costs. That’s why major companies — IBM, Phillips, Merck — all have blockchain initiatives.\n\nEven the U.S. government is interested. Steven Posnack directs the office of standards and technology in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. He said the department is holding a co-sponsored “blockchain code-a-thon” event with the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n\n“We’re inviting teams of people to demonstrate how blockchain can be applied in practice in health care. The variety in different ways it can be used is really exciting to health care stakeholders.”\n\nPosnack said government agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are exploring how the technology could make health care transactions more secure.\n\n“There’s a lot of real interest, but it’s extremely early,” said Dr. John Halamka, who manages the information technology system of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nHalamka, along with researchers at MIT, ran a six-month test of blockchain in the real world. They entered patient\'s medication data — prescriptions, vaccination history, etc. — on separate sites and used blockchain to see if specific doctors could easily access those records. The prototype worked, and they’re planning more pilots with larger networks of hospitals. Halamka said technology isn’t really the challenge.\n\n“We still have the culture where every health care provider thinks of themselves as the single steward of the data that is deposited in that organization,” Halamka said. “With blockchain, every time I make a change to your data, I’m telling the public ledger that the data has changed, and now thinking of it as a communitywide resource is a very different psychology than the past.”\n\nIn other words, before health care providers use advanced blockchain technology to stitch together our medical records, we should address some more philosophical questions: Who owns health data in the first place, and who can grant permission to share it?', 'Barely a few days before the expected resumption of withdrawals by the big Chinese exchanges, a statement by OKCoin indicated an imminent extension of the suspension. In a statement to users on Wednesday, OKCoin said: “Once the regulatory authorities have given their approval, you may withdraw currency.”\n\nA lot of Bitcoin users now think that the decision concerning the resumption of withdrawals is dependent upon the timing and decision of the PBoC.\n\nContrary to this assumption, active participants in the Chinese Bitcoin community, as well as BitLox Director Dana Coe, tell Cointelegraph that the present “suspension” may have been misunderstood by a lot of people as most users in China have carried on with their normal businesses.\n\nCoe says:\n\n“I don’t really see a huge disruption for the majority of the users. The selling of Bitcoins and withdrawal of RMB is not impeded at all.”\n\nAccording to Coe, most Chinese participants in the Bitcoin community are interested in Bitcoin for its value in trading and arbitrage. Most users of the Chinese exchanges deposit RMB so that they may purchase Bitcoins and take advantage of market movements, as any gains are normally converted back to RMB or held on the exchange as Bitcoins.\n\nHowever, Coe notes that even though it may be an inconvenience for users to not take their profits in Bitcoins, it is only appropriate to wait and see what sort of a plan the Chinese regulators and exchanges will come up with:\n\n“It appears they are negotiating for a plan, but it is difficult to say what such a plan will look like as the motives of the regulators is somewhat unclear.”\n\nChinese regulation is good for Bitcoin\n\nCoe continues by telling Cointelegraph of his suspicion that regulators in China may want to reduce overleveraging and what they call “excess” speculation.\n\nThe rationale behind this is that they do not want to be blamed and/or asked to reimburse losses from risky trades or system failures. Regulators want a reduction of such “horror stories” where people lose their shirts from 20x leveraging or not being able to get onto a website so as to sell in a stop-loss capacity. This development in Coe’s opinion is, in the long run, a good thing for Bitcoin in China as stories about sensational losses always scare people.\n\nAnother aspect that Coe observes is the regulation of exchanges in that they must have transparent volume reporting. This he says is healthy for the whole Bitcoin system, as a more accurate picture can be drawn of volumes and transactions.\n\nCoe concludes by saying:', 'The Bitcoin-based payment gateway Abra has added Bitcoin purchasing directly from its wallet.\n\nIn a press release Thursday, the international processor said it was “confident” its purchasing function was “the least expensive [automated clearing house-based] option for buying Bitcoin today.”\n\nAbra already uses Bitcoin ‘behind the scenes’ in order to send international remittances between users around the world, which leave and arrive in denominated currencies users stipulate.\n\nThe ACH option is currently only available to US and Filipino bank account holders, with other methods such as Abra’s teller network available for residents in remaining jurisdictions. Bank account functionality will spread in future to other countries, the company states.\n\nBitcoin purchasing for Abra is timely, given the shifts in price expected this week as a decision to allow or refuse the first Bitcoin ETF comes Friday or Monday.\n\nBitcoin’s sustained $1000+ price point is having a knock-on effect not just for purchasing the digital currency itself, but its use as a point-of-sale payment method.\n\nTour booking firm CheapAir, which has been accepting Bitcoin since 2013, revealed this week its year-on-year Bitcoin sales had risen 74 percent over the past six months.\n\n“I think it\'s great that many [Bitcoin enthusiasts] are enjoying a nice windfall right now and, of course, we want to help them spend some of that windfall on travel!"" CEO Jeff Klee commented.', 'Network congestion has been a significant problem for the bitcoin network in recent months. As a result, transaction fees continue to rise, It appears someone is deliberately sending 750 bitcoin back and forth every 5 seconds. This process has gone on for quite some time, albeit no one knows for sure what is going on exactly.\n\nMore transactions on the bitcoin network result in higher average fees. In that regard, it makes no sense for anyone to spam the network with unnecessary transactions right now. For some reason, one individual is doing exactly that, as a 750 BTC transaction keeps moving back and forth every five seconds. This adds more strain on the bitcoin network as it fills up necessary transaction space in network blocks.\n\nIncreasing Network Transaction Fees For No Reason\n\nIt appears this ping-ponging transaction has been going on for some time now. While no one knows for sure who is behind it, this is definitely a deliberate attempt to push up bitcoin fees. The Bitcoin Core client uses a “smart fee estimate”, for most bitcoin transfers. However, with this transaction going back and forth, that TX fee is slowly pushed higher and higher. This 750 BTC transaction comes with high fees which affect the estimate fee on the network.\n\nIt is possible a specific miner is responsible for doing so. Not only will they recuperate part of their own fee, but they also force everyone else to pay higher fees. A very elaborate scheme if this is the case, that much is certain. Rest assured there will be a lot of speculation as to who is behind this transaction spree. Pushing up fees is not helping the bitcoin ecosystem at all right now.\n\nAnother option is how a mining pool or a group of particular bitcoin supporters is responsible for this behavior. Driving up the fees benefit miners, yet it might be pools purposefully conducting this behavior. Considering the tension between Core and Unlimited is rising, such an attack is not unthinkable. Then again, it goes to show the people behind this attack don’t have bitcoin’s best interest at heart. It is an expensive way to destabilize bitcoin, but to the right people, it may be worth it.\n\nFurther investigation into the matter by one Reddit user shows this activity dates back to December 2016. High-fee transactions are sent back and forth without pause for an unknown reason. So far, it is estimated US$30,000 worth of bitcoin has been spent on transaction fees alone. It is a baffling development that raises a lot of questions no one can answer right now.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', ""On March 9, New Hampshire’s House of Representatives passed a bill that goes one step closer towards effectively exempting persons using virtual currency from registering as money transmitters.\n\nNew Hampshire is considered one the world’s most Bitcoin-friendly states.\n\nPassed the House\n\nAccording to the New Hampshire General Court Bill Status System, House Bill 436 has already been passed and adopted with an amendment by the House of Representatives and it is currently waiting for the Senate to grant the final approval of the bill.\n\nIf approved by the Senate, HB 436 will free every user of Bitcoin and other digital currencies within New Hampshire from money transmission regulations, which may allow businesses such as Bitcoin exchanges within the state to operate without strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems.\n\nBitcoin supporters initiative\n\nHB 436 was introduced, drafted and proposed by Keith Ammon, Barbara Biggie and John Hunt, who are early adopters and supporters of Bitcoin. In fact, Keith Ammon introduced many people to Bitcoin as early as May 2011, when Bitcoin wasn’t legal.\n\nHunt played an important role in getting the bill passed by the House of Representatives, as he brought the bill out of committee, defended it with Ammon and ultimately convinced the House to pass the bill. Ammon is particularly dedicated to passing the bill in the state of New Hampshire due to his involvement with the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, a nonpartisan coalition formed to increase individual freedom.\n\nOne of the main arguments presented by Hunt and Ammon when defending the bill was that if the US government doesn’t consider Bitcoin as legal tender, it shouldn’t fall under the regulatory guidance designed for money transmission services or products. The bill read:\n\n“‘Virtual currency’” means a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States government.”\n\nIf the bill is passed by the Senate within 60 days, or two months, New Hampshire residents will be able to utilize Bitcoin without being subjected to tight money transmission regulations or policies. While it is still unclear if this would allow businesses to refrain from collecting user identity and data for KYC regulations and AML purposes, it will grant users in New Hampshire financial freedom and privacy.\n\nMotives\n\nPrior to the proposal of HB 436, some of the largest Bitcoin businesses, including digital currency exchange Poloniex, suspended their services in New Hampshire due to impractical regulations. In a notice to New Hampshire residents, Poloniex stated:\n\n“Due to changes in New Hampshire's regulatory statute as it applies to cryptocurrency, Poloniex will temporarily suspend New Hampshire account creation until further notice. For existing New Hampshire customers, you will receive an email with instructions on how to suspend your account.”\n\nThe decision of Poloniex to pull out from New Hampshire was the result of the state’s introduction of its own New York BitLicense-like regulatory framework which created an inefficient ecosystem for local Bitcoin businesses.\n\nBy passing the bill, the House, Senate and sponsors of the bill hope to see the Bitcoin market of New Hampshire grow at an exponential rate and encourage other states to ease regulations for emerging technologies.""]"
03/11/2017,"['As the news of the Winklevoss exchange traded fund not being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission sinks, the CEO of CryptoCompare, which brings the latest streaming pricing data of cryptocurrencies, hints at what could have been responsible for the rejection.\n\nCharles Hayter states in an email that the SEC does not like Bitcoin being unchained from all regulation and the rejection move is, in essence, a form of consumer protection.\n\nHe says:\n\n“Whether other jurisdictions will allow a Bitcoin ETF remains to be seen - but for the time being all is not well - and it seems as if the other ETFs in the pipeline for the SEC are facing the same stone wall. The markets are digesting the information at the moment - we expect continued volatility and high volume. The hopes that Bitcoin would move towards mainstream finance have been dashed.”\n\nCompetition dashed\n\nAn approved ETF would have created a jurisdictional competition as other nations may look to create competing products. It could have eased the process of buying Bitcoin and offer benefits to portfolio managers through its low correlations with traditional assets and open up approvals for other Bitcoin ETF vehicles and for other digital currencies such as Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin price\n\nYet it was refused. The market has since seen some panic in the short term and dislocation amongst various fiat pairs. However, as this calms and the fear subsides, the market will likely rally as other hopes step up to the plate, with Bitcoin price continuous growth.\n\nWhat regulators are thinking\n\nSome of the issues that Hayter thinks could have boggled the minds of regulators about the approval of the ETF include the fear of a fork in the code such as the one that occurred with Ethereum last year.\n\n“There has been no precedent in finance for a similar occurrence but this has largely been mitigated by a good faith option whereby.the Custodian will choose the chain with the largest majority or in good faith the one expected to be so,” Hayter says. “This risk is particularly apparent with the scaling debate coming to the fore again with opposing sides taking up positions.”\n\nOther considered issues are a conflict of interests regarding the roles and the involvement of the Winklevoss as the sponsor of the ETF, as well as the provider of the reference price through their 4 p.m. EST time auction and the custodians of the underlying asset. The Chinese market reported the influence of over 98 percent of Bitcoin trading, the resilience of the Bitcoin network security against various attack vectors, volatility, and the innovation ETFs are supposed to bring to the market causing regulators to seek ways to create a balance between approving and the risks of not approving them.', 'Prosecutors in Norway have demanded that drug dealers should pay a penalty in Bitcoins. Does this effectively legitimize Bitcoins?\n\nThe background\n\nNorwegian investigators had worked with crime enforcement officials across the world while investigating a local drug ring, which sold drugs through the mail. This drug ring was linked to the now defunct Silkroad site, which was shut down by the US police in 2013. The Norwegian police arrested three men in this case in June 2015 and seized large amounts of narcotics and several computers as evidence.\n\nProsecutors’ demand\n\nThe prosecutors have demanded that the men who have been charged should repay their profits in 120 Bitcoins and 3.1 mln Norwegian kroner. Each Bitcoin is worth ~10,000 Norwegian kroner, indicating that the Norwegian government has asked for 28 percent of the penalty to be paid in Bitcoins.\n\nWhy would the Norwegian government want Bitcoins?\n\nIt is surprising that the Norwegian government has demanded payment of the penalty in the form of Bitcoins. The accused men were arrested in June 2015 and the value of Bitcoins has increased substantially after that. So by demanding that the drug dealers repay their Bitcoin profits, which were earned in 2013 to 2014, the value of the fine imposed is actually much higher. Crime investigating agencies also require Bitcoins in undercover operations.\n\nDoes this legitimize Bitcoins?\n\nAlthough the prosecutors, in this case, have sought for the penalty to be imposed in Bitcoins, they do not accept that this effectively legitimizes Bitcoins. The prosecutors denial may be immaterial. While Norway is not a member of the European Union, it is a member of the European Free Trade Association member and the EU is its most important trading member. The EU has been taken large strides in recognizing Bitcoin. In April 2016, Bitstamp became Europe’s first licensed Bitcoin exchange, after receiving a licence from Luxembourg to operate as a payments institution. Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, Norway cannot operate in isolation.', '5 SHARES Share Tweet Google Whatsapp Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Delicious Weibo Tumblr Mail Line Telegram Flipboard Hackernews\n\nCryptocurrency has been around for nearly nine years, but few people use it regularly. Several stores and businesses accept payments in digital currency, but many of us still prefer credit cards or good old-fashioned cash.\n\nThat’s because there’s a sensation of mistrust flowing through our country. Many believe Bitcoin, and digital currencies attract criminal behavior, but are virtual coins as bad as we say? Let’s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages Bitcoin and digital currencies bring to the table.\n\nADVANTAGES: Digital Currency\n\nTHEY ASSIST DEVELOPING NATIONS\n\nMany countries don’t possess the economic means of nations like the United States, Canada, Germany, the U.K., and Japan. When it comes to survival, they are eons behind and don’t have the finances necessary to keep people stable. Banks and governments swell with corruption, while those in charge are quick to stash money in their own pockets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat’s where Bitcoin comes in handy. For those who don’t have reasonable access to credit, Bitcoin can be stored and used like fiat currency. While there aren’t exactly Bitcoin banks, platforms like Coinbase exist for Bitcoin owners to open virtual accounts (or “addresses” as they’re called) and store their coins, regardless of where they live or what they do.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’ve filed bankruptcy, have a foreclosure or had your car repossessed. Credit history doesn’t matter, and anyone can receive or send bitcoins as they see fit.\n\nVirtual currencies are also perfect for migrant workers who send remittances back home. Sometimes, when transactions occur between borders, they are subject to certain fees and penalties. Bitcoin is not, so workers abroad can send money home without incurring losses. It’s a simple process that can bring people closer to financial stability.\n\nTHEY’RE POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS\n\nIn many ways, digital currencies work like stocks. Depending on one’s economic state, their values go up or down. Holders likely felt the urge to scream in January 2015 when bitcoin fell below $200 after prancing around between the $400-500 range for most of 2014. Granted they didn’t panic too much and held onto their Bitcoins; holders are probably giving themselves some well-deserved applause right about now – those Bitcoins are worth nearly $1200 in 2017.\n\nIn one sense, the situation is worrisome as you never know if (or when) your coins will fall. Then again, should their value ever explode, there’s a lot of money to be had given one is patient and cautious.\n\nTHE TECHNOLOGY IS PRETTY COOL\n\nWhether you love it or hate it, you’ve got to admit the technology behind Bitcoin is intriguing. Bitcoin and virtual currencies exist via “blockchains,” which allow digital currency transactions to occur. Every time a payment is made or received, the blockchain records it, ensuring there’s evidence the transaction took place. To a degree, this protects one’s assets; should anything go wrong, you can go back and dispute things as needed.\n\nAdditionally, many believe Bitcoin and related currencies will move things in a whole new direction, going so far as to say traditional banking will soon be a thing of the past. While we’re far away from this point, those learning the ropes now are bound to be a little more prepared should such a drastic step ever be taken.\n\nDISADVANTAGES: Digital Currency\n\nAs with every plan, there’s always a few kinks to be worked out. Let’s examine the “not-so-nice” side of virtual currency usage.\n\nIT HAS LEFT PEOPLE IN SHAMBLES\n\nIn 2014, bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox came crashing down, taking nearly half-a-billion dollars in Bitcoin with it. Customers saw most of their earnings practically disappear overnight, and to this day, the mystery surrounding its fall has never been fully solved. Police involvement becomes inevitable, and CEO Mark Karpeles did spend some time in jail, though he was released after a short time. San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken has taken the reins to assist Mt. Gox victims.\n\nSituations like these are not uncommon. Other exchanges like Bitfinex and Bitstamp have been subjected to hacks, and have lost millions in customer funds. While some stories have positive endings, stolen coins aren’t always easy to get back.\n\nBitcoin and virtual currencies are not considered real money, and platforms do not offer FICO insurance like traditional banks, which means getting stolen money back can be a rough road. As mentioned above, many are concerned about the criminal activity Bitcoin is known to harvest. The sad thing is… Sometimes they’re right to worry.\n\nIT’S NOT AS ANONYMOUS AS SOME MIGHT THINK\n\nThe anonymity of Bitcoin is something many experts continue to tout. After all, users want their privacy, especially if they’re conducting business. The problem is, Bitcoin isn’t as anonymous as one might think.\n\nRemember earlier we talked about the blockchain, and how it records transactions in real-time? Your name isn’t necessarily attached to a transaction when it occurs, but it’s not like things can’t be traced back to you, and this sets a lot of people on edge. Some would prefer their monetary habits stayed a secret, and while Bitcoin gets close, it doesn’t quite hit the mark.\n\nThe good news is that unless you’re planning to break the rules, you have nothing to worry about. Then again, it’s a little easy to get caught up in everything. In 2015, Ross Ulbricht received a life sentence for running an online black market known as Silk Road.\n\nConsumers could purchase all kinds of illegal goods from drugs to firearms using Bitcoin and related currencies. Things struck badly in 2013 when Ulbricht, after being tracked for some time, was arrested by FBI agents.\n\n…So if privacy’s your game, Bitcoin may not be the answer you’re looking for.\n\nIT MAY JUST BE A PHASE\n\nContrary to our number one “advantage,” many disagree that virtual currency is revolutionary, and claim it’s just a phase the world is going through. Despite nine years on the market, Bitcoin does face the possibility of disappearing for good at some point. After all, if not enough people are using it, how can it stay alive? It’s impossible to predict when (or if) this might happen, but should a world without Bitcoin ever exist, those invested in it could find themselves at a loss.\n\nSome companies allow you to pay bills in Bitcoin, while others like Overstock.com give consumers the chance to buy goods with it. Many businesses have made room for Bitcoin in their financial agendas, and some citizens in America and abroad have transferred all their savings and funds into virtual coins… But what if the technology goes kaput?\n\nIt’s likely those buried deep in digital currency will get a chance to make the switch, but they’re in for a complicated, time-consuming process of transforming all their savings back into fiat money. No doubt it can be done, but there’s bound to be a few headaches along the way.\n\nComments\n\ncomments', 'BitClub, a Bitcoin mining pool, is accused of launching a transaction malleability attack on the Bitcoin network, the effect of which confuses wallets or businesses with financial transactions getting canceled and bringing a halt to Blockchain.info.\n\nIn a post from Bither, a Bitcoin wallet, it shows that the malleability attack transaction is mined in block 456545 and 456552 and that all transactions in this block may be malleability attack transactions.\n\nMalleability is a problem that Bitcoin has dealt with for many years. However, it’s a problem that has yet to be fixed. Some say that given the fact that you need special software to change transactions while still making them valid, makes this attack politically-motivated.\n\nWith the nerves of the Bitcoin community tense on the eve of the Bitcoin ETF decision, the public space is ripe with accusations and conspiracy theories.\n\nAs an example, Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell professor, suggested on Twitter that some miner was doing a malleability attack to push for Segwit.\n\nOther supporters of Bitcoin Unlimited are accusing BitClub, which supports segregated witness (Segwit), in launching the attacks to boost the case of Segwit.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

The bill was sponsored by Rep. Barbara Biggie, co-sponsored by Rep. Keith Ammon and John Hunt, all of which were early adopters of the digital currency.\n\nIf approved House Bill 436 will free consumers leaving choices in their hand instead of having to register with transmitter regulators. It would also mean that many companies in the state of New Hampshire would be capable of operating without following strict KYC and AML systems.\n\nNew Hampshire is considered a bitcoin-friendly state.\n\nWhat the Bill Changes\n\nBefore the proposal of House Bill 436, digital currency exchanges, including cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, had announced that they had decided to suspend activity for New Hampshire customers in October 2016. This was down to the state’s strict digital currency regulations.\n\nAt the time, the state’s 2016 law for licensing money transmitters included digital currency.\n\nOn its website, Poloniex, said:\n\nDue to changes in New Hampshire’s regulatory statute as it applies to cryptocurrency, Poloniex will temporarily suspend New Hampshire account creation until further notice.\n\nPoloniex’s decision to suspend its services to customers was down to the fact that the state was attempting to introduce its own New York BitLicense regulatory framework.\n\nA $500 nonrefundable application fee was required for each license application. Each money transmitter applicant was also obliged to post a continuous surety bond amounting to $100,000, while an applicant or licensee needed to maintain a net worth of less its daily average outstanding money transmissions for the previous calendar year or $1 million.\n\nNaturally, with the approval of House Bill 436, this will then reverse the regulation that caused Poloniex and other exchanges to cease functioning in New Hampshire, standing in contrast to New York’s BitLicense.\n\nWith the passing of the bill in the House and potentially in the Senate too, it appears that those in support of the bill are keen to see wider adoption of Bitcoin in New Hampshire.\n\nIf the Senate passes House Bill 436, it could lead the way for an ease in regulations within other states in the country who are interested in adopting new technologies such as bitcoin, but weary of the strict and, often, expensive regulations involved in doing so.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Stocksnap.io\n\nJurors in Manhattan federal court on Friday prepared to weigh charges against a Florida software engineer and a New Jersey pastor accused of scheming to help an illegal bitcoin exchange escape scrutiny.\n\nThe unlicensed bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, was linked to an investigation of a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co that exposed more than 83 million accounts.

With the bitcoin price in 2017 trading above gold prices, you have a day that cryptocurrency lovers have longed for and bullion bulls have long feared. Indeed, the gold vs Bitcoin rivalry (at least in the media’s eyes) is only poised to become more heated as the year goes on. So is Bitcoin the new gold? And what’s next for the Bitcoin value 2017? Should you invest in Bitcoin or gold?\n\nFirst, let’s dispense with some of the misconceptions between gold vs Bitcoin in 2017.\n\nBitcoin is not yet a true hedge asset. Why not? Because it simply doesn’t have the stability to protect you from extreme fluctuations. Gold, on the other hand, is still far more stable, at least compared to Bitcoin. The volatility of Bitcoin might make it a more prized investment, but in terms of a place to stash your assets in order to protect them from economic downturns or currency value-loss, Bitcoin is not an entirely safe bet.\n\nConsider that in the past 12 months, gold has run the range of mid-$1,300s per ounce down to just above $1,100.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, in the same time period, shot up from $400.00 per unit to $1,130 at the beginning of this year, then promptly collapsed to the $800.00s, only to shoot back up to its current all-time high. Which is to say that making a Bitcoin price prediction can be a little trickier than, say, sticking to gold.\n\nOf course, it’s worth mentioning that Bitcoin soared by 225% in those 12 months. But again, that makes Bitcoin’s appeal partly due to its value as an investment and not a risk asset. Drawing investors in can boost value, naturally, but then you run the risk of losing those very same people and finding your hard-earned cash worth less than it was the day before.\n\nWhile at times the volatility of Bitcoin has approached that of gold’s (which is usually similar to fiat currencies), those times of restfulness are often fast followed by a return to its old volatile ways.\n\nSecondly, don’t let the price deceive you. In the gold vs Bitcoin 2017 competition, the two are still very much operating in different ballparks. Maybe even in different sports.\n\nCombined above-ground gold stocks are currently valued at around $7.0 trillion. Bitcoin’s market cap comes in at a (comparatively) paltry $18.0 billion. Even adding in all the other cryptocurrencies, you still only get to a market cap that amounts to $21.0 billion. (Source: “Bitcoin Reaches Parity With Gold,” Zero Hedge, March 2, 2017.)\n\nData courtesy of Investing.com and Gold Price\n\nGold has had millennia to establish itself as a worldwide commodity, which only strengthens its place in the global economy. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is not only new and potentially confusing to investors, but it’s also not nearly as secure. If you buy an ounce of gold and put it in a safe, barring a physical assault on said safe, your asset isn’t going anywhere. In that regard, the precious metal has a leg up on the newcomer in the gold vs. Bitcoin debate.\n\nNow contrast that with some Bitcoin horror stories, like that of early Bitcoin miner Jered Kenna who lost millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins to a sophisticated hacking scam. (Source: “Hackers Have Stolen Millions Of Dollars In Bitcoin — Using Only Phone Numbers,” Forbes, December 20, 2016.)\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin theft even more damning is that there is little recourse available to victims of a theft. One of Bitcoin’s big selling points is the blockchain, a database that anonymously records every single Bitcoin interaction. All BTC movements are final. While this appeals to a great many people’s sense of privacy and security, others may be scared off by the potentially disastrous outcome of a theft like that which played out in Kenna’s case.\n\nA final important consideration (though there are many more—too many to cover in a single article in any depth) is that gold and Bitcoin are driven by, at times, different factors.\n\nThe Bitcoin value 2017 is largely predicated (at the moment) on people in countries like China using it to get around strict financial regulations. LocalBitcoins, a site that allows users to post advertisements to sell Bitcoins in local currencies, saw an ¥8.0-million spike from the end of January to late February, showing that Chinese residents are hungry for the online outlet as a way around currency controls, despite the Chinese government’s repeated attempts to crack down on Bitcoin. (Source: “Even China Can’t Kill Bitcoin,” Bloomberg, February 23, 2017.)\n\nGold, on the other hand, is usually used as a reserve against a potentially flagging U.S. dollar or other widely-traded currencies. Which isn’t to say that gold cannot be used in the same way as Bitcion is as mentioned in the paragraph above, but there is a correlation between the dollar rising and gold prices falling, and vice versa. That is why the new U.S. president, Donald Trump, and his business-friendly economic policies are looking like they might hurt gold and strengthen the dollar in the near term.\n\nWhich is to say that while gold vs Bitcoin 2017 might make for a catchy tagline, the two have some key differences that appeal/repel different investors, depending on what they’re looking for and their disposition.\n\nAdd in the fact that gold is still more widely accepted than Bitcoin and that Bitcoin can theoretically be overtaken by a rival cryptocurrency (whereas gold is safe from such a threat), and it’s easy to see how the gold vs Bitcoin billing is over-hyped. (Source: “Bitcoin, Gold and the Risks of Bum Comparisons,” Bloomberg, March 6, 2017.)\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nAt Profit Confidential, we’re no strangers to bold Bitcoin price predictions. Our analysts have it as potentially rising to $2,500 a year, based on geopolitical factors like a Chinese economic collapse or the demonetization in India, coupled with businesses warming to the idea of taking payment in Bitcoin. These are some powerful factors that may push investors towards the online currency, making the choice that much harder.\n\nAnd there are many opinions out there regarding just how high (or low) Bitcoin will go. Some analysts look to the Mt. Gox incident of late 2013, where hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins were lost, as evidence that Bitcoin is a balloon waiting to be popped until it can guarantee safety. (Source: “Has bitcoin matched gold’s status? One expert weighs in,” MarketWatch, March 3, 2017.)\n\nWith that in mind, trying to have a solid projection for Bitcoin price in 2017 can be difficult, seeing as how the online currency is hardly invulnerable to massive, unexpected swings. And in terms of a gold vs Bitcoin chart, you’re unlikely to see gold dip as a result of a massive precious metal heist, a la the James Bond movie Goldfinger.\n\nOther, more—shall we say—optimistic analysts have Bitcoin prices hitting as high as $13,000 by March of 2018. (Source: “Bitcoin Price Will Triple Gold in 2018, Silver Achieves Parity With Gold: Clif High,” Cointelegraph, March 6, 2017.)\n\nOf course, that puts the currency on a one-way track to blistering success, but at the same time does not account for another Mt. Gox-type incident occurring.\n\nAnd others, while not willing to put as high a number on the currency, have similarly boosted Bitcoin as the investment to make in 2017.\n\nTake Brian Kelly, a CNBC contributor, and his take on the cryptocurrency:\n\n“For me, it is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not just digital gold. It is a technology platform that fintech is being built on top of. It is a once in a life generation investment opportunity similar to the Internet growing just as fast if not faster. It is the Internet of money. Everyone is involved in it. The Federal Reserve released a paper on it. Bank of England is involved in it. 14 of the top 30 banks have active projects.”\n\nHe said this in a debate with Peter Schiff, a prominent investor of gold and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, who has criticized Bitcoin as “digital fool’s gold.” (Source: “Unlike Gold, Bitcoin is Once in a Generation Investment Opportunity: CNBC,” Cointelegraph, March 6, 2017.)\n\nBut as mentioned previously, I think comparing gold vs Bitcoin is an exercise in futility. They are very different assets that appeal to very different people. As for the Bitcoin price prediction, expect the currency to continue to shoot up on the back of economic volatility and political instability.\n\nA eurozone collapse could help drive currency skyward. With numerous European elections on the way, that reality is not far-fetched. Euroskeptic wins in France and Germany could spell doom for the continental currency, and within that transition, expect Bitcoin to prosper.\n\nShould You Invest in Gold or Bitcoin?\n\nSince Donald Trump’s election victory, we’ve seen a six-percent decline in gold prices. While it has since rebounded, there is reason to believe that gold might falter under a Trump administration.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, seems poised to take advantage of a number of economic situations around the world and continue its roaring trend.\n\nIf you’re asking which is the better investment, Bitcoin is looking in good shape to take advantage of the political instability affecting global markets worldwide from Venezuela to China.\n\nIf you’re more interested in a hedge against the U.S. dollar or to combat inflation, then gold might serve as the more appropriate option.\n\nIt’s important to remember not to be taken in by the hype. These are two very different beasts, and you shouldn’t be caught up in the gold vs Bitcoin fervor.', ""Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, angel investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nIn this guest piece, Woo discusses the recent run-up in bitcoin price, and the methods he uses to determine if and when bitcoin is overvalued.\n\nSimply put, Google Trends is a great way to track the growth of active bitcoin users.\n\nThe search 'BTC USD' serves as a proxy for the engagement of active bitcoin users as they check the daily price.

It was quite a shock to see, and undoubtedly thrilled a few who were long, and undoubtedly spurred a lot of people to take new positions at what was ultimately a swing high.\n\nOvernight (Asia time) that irrational exuberance was punished by a severe fall to $960 on Kraken. Of course, the news event that allegedly sparked that selloff was the rejection of the ETF. But the chart gave a warning to those who watch the charts. You see, at the high, pricetime hit the long-term 1×1 Gann Angle AGAIN. That angle has been like the electric 3rd rail for a very long time:\n\nThe fall was stopped by the 4th arc pair (blue arrow), and price later found higher support at the 1×1 on the 4 hour chart from the Jan 2017 low. I expect that buying here is a good long-term trade. It seems quite likely that prices will be higher than these levels in the not-distant future.\n\nEthereum\n\nBut for some traders, in my humble opinion, Ethereum is the trade to watch at this juncture. It hit its recent swing low exactly 270 degrees past the June 2016 high (blue arrow), and is presently working its way through a long-term 3rd arc pair.\n\nAs I have stated many times in the past, ANYTHING can happen while price is going through an arc pair. But, when it clears the pair, there is a whole lot of empty space above that arc, before that 4th arc pair is hit. To illustrate that point, view this look at the same chart above, shrunk a bit to show the larger setup:\n\nThe blue arrow at the top right indicates the point at which price might have doubled from here. It is entirely plausible that ETH could DOUBLE from its present price by the time it hits that 4th arc pair.\n\nOf course, there is a Gann angle and a top of square in the way, so it will not be a straight run. But IMO this might be fun.\n\nHappy trading!\n\nRemember: The author is a trader who is subject to all manner of error in judgement.

03/12/2017,"['The Bitcoin community doesn’t seem to be bothered by the US Security Exchange Commission’s decision to disapprove the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN like many analysts expected. The market’s stability after the denial of the COIN ETF led to discussions on why Bitcoin didn’t need an ETF to begin with.\n\nWhy SEC disapproved the ETF and why Bitcoin didn’t need it\n\nBitcoin is one of the only currencies or networks in existence which facilitates payments between two users with the absence of a mediator or a network administrator. Within Bitcoin, regulations are non-existent and manipulation-free transactions can be made, regardless of the amount or the size of the transaction.\n\nWhile Bitcoin wasn’t necessarily designed to replace fiat money, it was introduced in 2009 to serve as an alternative to the global financial structure and ecosystem. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, wanted to present a cash-like settlement network in which users aren’t required to undergo impractical and inefficient settlement processes in order to send and receive money from one another.\n\nOver time, Bitcoin as a decentralized technology evolved, with the work of the Bitcoin Core development team as well as Bitcoin’s global and open source development team of contributors. The Bitcoin network’s hash power began to secure the network from external attacks and welcome tens of millions of new users into the network.\n\nAs Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos notes, the truly decentralized, transparent and secure financial network of Bitcoin is beginning to replace the financial industry and provide the general public with a low-fee and faster financial network.\n\nBefore considering the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars and potentially billions of dollars could have been poured into Bitcoin as a result of the approval of the COIN ETF, it is important to ponder the purpose of Bitcoin as a financial network. Its real purpose within the global financial frame is to allow people to make peer-to-peer payments amongst each other, not to gather large investments within a highly and tightly regulated market.\n\nAntonopoulos stated:\n\n“If you measure Bitcoin\'s success by the approval of the incumbent and obsolete industry it replaces, you\'re doing it wrong.”\n\nSEC’s disapproval is confirmation that Bitcoin is a decentralized network\n\nTwo main arguments presented by the SEC in their disapproval of the COIN ETF were that the SEC can’t protect investors from losses made while trading Bitcoin and that the Bitcoin network can’t be surveilled as easily as others.\n\nSince the Bitcoin network completely eliminates the possibility of recovering transactions or refunding payments, it forces users to be more responsible. On PayPal for instance, a centralized financial network, users can ask network moderators if they mistakenly sent incorrect transactions or processed payments to the wrong receiver. Within the Bitcoin network, no such administrative team exists and users are solely responsible for their money and transactions.\n\nIf the SEC needs to guarantee investors and traders with an insurance policy, which basically means that when Bitcoins are lost or stolen or mistraded, the SEC should be responsible for protecting investors from any losses, it is highly unlikely that a Bitcoin ETF will never be approved by the SEC.\n\nThe official document of the SEC read:\n\n""As discussed further below, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.""\n\nThe SEC nor any other government organizations shouldn’t be responsible for protecting investors from making independent financial decisions. Also, it is almost impractical to introduce a highly regulated market to Bitcoin if Bitcoin was designed from the start to replace regulated markets and inefficient financial systems.', 'Clif High’s estimation that three ounces of gold would be equal to a Bitcoin in price by this time next year remains a bizarre proposition that is not impossible to achieve.\n\nIn a way, a predicted Bitcoin price rise from a meager $1180 to more than $13,000 seems attractive and the technicality of how that would be the case defies common understanding of the law of demand and supply. It could be a repeat of the 1979/1980 scenario.\n\nThis link to a historical event particularly fits in with the fact that High’s data sets have been proven accurate in other instances and his latest estimate show that Bitcoin price would be hinged on the rising price of gold - from $1206 today to about $4,800 by March next year, about a 300 percent increase.\n\nWorking it out\n\nBetween 1978 and 1979, the price of gold recorded more than 120 percent growth from $207 to $455, the highest in its history, due to high inflation because of strong oil prices, Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the impact of the Iranian revolution, which prompted investors to move into the metal.\n\nBy January 1980, gold hits record high at $850 per ounce though for a while as investors seek safe haven - that’s a 310 percent increase between 1978 and January 1980.\n\nFiguring out the total amount of gold that has ever been produced is hard. However, going by rough estimates, there are approximately six bln ounces of gold available - that is 375 ounces of gold to one Bitcoin in terms of production if we are to go by the fact that about 16 mln Bitcoins have been mined so far.\n\nIts production rate does not necessarily translate to a higher price for either even though the number of ounces to be extracted later are unknown and it is certain that there could only be a finite 4.8 mln Bitcoins more to be mined in the next 123 years according to its whitepaper.\n\nOther strengthening factors\n\nOne Bitcoin would be harder to get than an ounce of gold even as interest in the pricing arrangement of both commodities is increasing. Though they both show the potential to become more valuable with time, the catch-up Bitcoin played recently has cast doubt on the outlook for gold as the future’s main store of value. More so, until last year, the price of gold slide for the previous three years.\n\nSomehow, the argument that either gold is overpriced or Bitcoin is undervalued is already adding a twist to the discussion. Different opinions are being formed as the common knowledge that Bitcoin’s value has been growing as well as the understanding of its usefulness has been improving among more people from various sectors.\n\nCoupled with its thinning supply which has been influencing its price and the fact that it could be considered advantageous over gold in several ways including cutting out shady bank practices - though its reliance on electricity and the Internet is still a key argument that has been made against it, a sudden surge could not be overruled.\n\nMore of the growing millennials who choose to look in its direction are finding Bitcoin handy and easier to relate with more than gold despite its intrinsic value, its tangibility and its record centuries of existence.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized, easily moved, harder to counterfeit and gets increasingly difficult to mine over time. These basic features which have been spreading more, stand to favor Bitcoin even to make its price climb far above High’s estimate of $13,000 and its market cap correlatively increase to as much as $40 bln or more in a 12-month period.', 'Bitcoin has been portrayed as the most favored currency among the criminal kind. Thanks to increased usage of the likes of Bitcoin among the darknet marketplaces. However, the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin leads to criminals getting caught on a regular basis. But usually, those who face the trial usually end up having their cryptocurrencies, devices confiscated, sentenced to jail time with or without a monetary penalty slapped on them.\n\nThe penalties paid by the dark net drug or weapons dealer caught in the act is usually in the form of fiat currency, but not in Norway. Recently, reports have emerged that the Norwegian prosecutors are demanding three convicts, charged with dealing drugs on dark web marketplaces, including the Silk Road to repay the profits in Bitcoin. If the court does allow the prosecutors to have it their way, then the dealers will be forced to pay about 120 bitcoins, which is worth around $140,000. But it doesn’t end here. They are also demanding 3.1 million in the country’s native fiat currency, Norwegian Kroner as well.\n\nThe case dates back to the Silk Road days, and the three men were arrested way back in June 2015 for running an online drug distribution ring. The arrests were the result of a 2-year long investigation by Norway’s law enforcement authorities along with other international investigators. The arrests which took place in Oslo, Norway, also resulted in the seizure of a considerable amount of narcotics, computers and even an indoor marijuana farm.\n\nNews articles on media outlets state the prosecution saying that they have enough evidence for the sale in Bitcoins to convict the drug-dealing trio. However, the demand for profit repayment in Bitcoin is heard for the first time in the Norwegian judicial system. The demand made by prosecutors could soon set a precedent for other courts within and beyond the region to adopt a similar practice.\n\nThe government’s interest in seeking Bitcoin payment, which is not even a recognized currency in Norway also sets a milestone in Bitcoin’s timeline, pushing it one step closer to recognition as a mainstream currency.\n\nRef: RT | Image: NewsBTC', 'Bitcoin Unlimited, the new grassroots client, reached 39.6% over a 24 hour period earlier this week, its highest ever. Now standing at more than 30% over the longer one week period.\n\nThe new client aims to increase bitcoin’s transaction capacity to meet growing demand and reduce fees as they now average $1 per transaction. It further aims to return more predictable transaction times which currently can be delayed from hours to days.\n\nIt has found much support from miners with Antpool, bitcoin’s biggest mining pool, switching to Bitcoin Unlimited on Tuesday. The decision was somewhat surprising, but discussions of a flag day soft fork to force segwit appears to have incentivized the miner to move.\n\nThere are now in total ten mining pools on Bitcoin Unlimited, with just one further pool sufficient to allow for near 50% temporary share due to variance. One such pool is to be expected as Chandler Guo, a digital currencies miner, is to open a new pool that will mine on Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nIt is not known if any business is running the new client, but Blockchain.info, Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitgo and many other bitcoin businesses, have advocated for bigger blocks in general and have complained regarding delays.\n\nCritics say Bitcoin Unlimited gives power to miners regarding blocksize decisions and its emergent consensus system is untested. Supporters argue that all nodes decide on the blocksize and the emergent consensus system has been live tested during the increase of the soft limit from 250kb to 500kb to 750kb and then 1MB.\n\nThere are arguments on whether the system allows for re-organization with Charlie Lee, Litecoin’s Founder and Coinbase employee, stating that “if at any point, the [Bitcoin Core] chain grows longer (in PoW) than the [Bitcoin Unlimited] chain, the BU client will reorg to the [Bitcoin Core] chain.”\n\nViaBTC’s founder, Haipo Yang, has suggested that miners wait for Bitcoin Unlimited to reach 75% of the network’s hardware share to avoid a chain split on the same proof of work chain.\n\nThere is, however, a community split. Thus, blockstream employees might PoW fork the chain, but BTC.TOP’s founder, Jiang Zhuoer, has stated that $100 million has been set aside to attack any minority chain and make it inoperational.\n\nAny upgrade to bigger blocks is likely to be gradual to give businesses and node operators considerable time. As the client is now nearing 30% share over 1,000 blocks with variance giving it 40%, such upgrade process might begin.\n\nIf it nears 40% in the longer 1,000 blocks time-frame, then there might be a shift in attitude as temporary variance would give it 50%. Thus, the client gains serious consideration with activation likelihood considerably increasing.\n\nIt is at 50% when, conceptually, it is a done deal. At that point, all businesses will want to be running the BU client. Miners, too, might find it safer, while the general opinion would probably move to ask when, rather than if.\n\nThe time frame is probably months, if this year at all. The likelihood of its activation is difficult to predict, but segregated witnesses has stagnated, leaving BU as the only standing option at this point in time.\n\nOnce it activates, there is no difference whatever as far as end-users are concerned except that fees would be lower and transaction times would be more predictable. Due to bitcoin’s current politics whereby Michael Marquardt, r/bitcoin’s top moderator, applies biased censorship, miners are incentivized to attack the minority chain to avoid any arguments over the bitcoin name. A chain split therefore appears unlikely, but if there is one, there is no difference for end users except that now they hold their coins on both chains.\n\nIf Bitcoin Unlimited does activate, it would be the first time ever in the entire blockchain space that a decision in such a decentralized manner without any guidance or leadership has been made.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'No one can deny the cryptocurrency is thriving right now.

Right now, that percentage sits close to 81%, whereas it used to be over 95% in January of 2014.\n\nFor the longest time, bitcoin has been the dominant cryptocurrency. That is only normal, as it is the only one to gain some market traction. However, several altcoins have proven to be a favorite among speculators and traders as well. Albeit very few of these currencies have use cases, they are perfect vehicles for value speculation. As a result, some money is flowing from bitcoin into the altcoin sector on a regular basis.\n\nBitcoin’s Market Cap Percentage Continues To Drop\n\nThis trend is not alarmed by any means. In fact, diversification of a cryptocurrency portfolio is a good thing. While bitcoin still represents the vast majority of total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, its “share” is dropped. In fact, it has been dropping for quite some time now. Back in January of 2014, bitcoin represented 96% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Fast forward that day, and that number has shrunk to just 84%. Not a big change according to some people, yet it goes to show something is changing behind the scenes.\n\nLooking at the charts, bitcoin has gone through this cycle before. Its market cap percentage dropped below 80% in January of 2015, June of 2016 and Late 2016 as well. Bitcoin rebounds successfully every time, though, and it is expected this pattern will repeat itself once again. After all, there is no reason to ditch bitcoin holdings In favor of any altcoin right now, even though some investments may look appealing.\n\nOne contributing factor to the “demise” of bitcoin is the high transaction fee problem. With fees increasing rapidly, altcoins are becoming more popular due to lower costs. Then again, none of these networks have been tested to handle the transaction volume bitcoin processes every day. Until that happens, it is impossible to tell which currency can keep the costs down in the end. Reducing bitcoin’s fees would be a good start, though, that much is certain.\n\nMoreover, people need to keep in mind not every altcoin is a bitcoin competitor. Ethereum, for example, is not positioned to be a “currency” like bitcoin. Neither is Ripple, as it is a competing technology that appeals to banks. Dash and Monero can compete with bitcoin, although the anonymity features may put off some people. Only time will tell how these percentages evolve over the next few months, though.', ""Since the news of the Legends Room was released, the company has been the subject of local, national, and international news, is negotiating a seven figure purchase of membership tokens by a publicly traded corporation and fielded inquiries to host various events ranging from celebrity afterparties to corporate dinners during major conventions.\n\nThe company has had offers for expansion to clubs outside of Las Vegas, Legends Room merchandising, and for television and film uses.\n\nAs an innovator in the blockchain space, the Legends Room is bringing the idea of membership and fractional ownership to Las Vegas night clubs. Part of the club is designated as a members only area. Memberships which will be registered using blockchain technology allowing owners to rent their memberships like real estate.

With this in mind, I thought I'd use this tool to investigate the growth of active users of bitcoin.\n\nFor this, we again examine the search term 'BTC USD'.\n\nIf you're an active bitcoin user, it's likely you'll be checking the price periodically, and a proportion of users type 'BTC USD' into Google to do just that.\n\nIn this way, I'd argue we can use the search term as an effective proxy for the growth and engagement of active bitcoin users over time. From the chart above, we can see that the bitcoin user base is in a period of exponential growth.\n\nBitcoin users double every 12 months\n\nWhat we have here is a steady exponential growth baseline with periodic peaks.\n\nAs covered before, these peaks are are inline with price bubbles, periods where more users head online to check the value of their wealth.\n\nTaking readings from the baseline shows an order of magnitude of growth every 3.375 years. Or, expressed in terms of time, the user base doubles approximately every 12 months.\n\n(In honor of Moore's Law, I propose calling this Woo's Law of bitcoin user growth.)\n\nBitcoin's adoption curve\n\nBut what to make of our new law?\n\nExtrapolating further, it's possible to use this as a proxy for bitcoin's overall adoption as a technology, using other disruptive tech as a basis point.\n\nFor example, there's expected to be 10 billion people on this planet by 2050. If we assume the active user count of bitcoin today is 10 million, 1,000-times growth is needed to reach 100% coverage.\n\nAt current pace, that would take 10 years. Yet, in the real world all adoption curves follow an 'S' pattern.\n\nIf we were to assume bitcoin’s adoption curve will be a symmetric S-curve, we should reach 50% adoption in nine more years. However, to complete the last half of the 'S' will take 17 more years – 26 years from today, or roughly one human generation.\n\nWill today's children transact in a world where everyone uses bitcoin?\n\nWe shall see, but the charts tell their own story.\n\nPilot baby image via Shutterstock; Charts via Willy Woo\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Things were looking rather bleak for this altcoin, yet it somehow managed to gain over US$.2.5 in value compared to Friday afternoon. With XMR trading above US$15.7 once again, there is plenty of excitement among Monero holders right now.\n\nMonero Surges Ahead Amid Bitcoin ETF Rejection\n\nIt was only to be expected certain altcoins would thrive ever since the bitcoin ETF rule change proposal has been rejected by the SEC. That does not mean this price trend will be permanent, though, as the cryptocurrency world remains susceptible to volatility in every market on any given day. For Monero, this volatility is working out in a favorable manner, pushing the price per XMR back over US$15.\n\nTo put this news into perspective, the XMR price went up by 11.5% in the past 24 hours alone. That is quite a significant jump, although weekends are often good times for altcoin trading. In some cases, this leads to significant losses, but it appears bitcoin holders are spreading some of their funds around across different markets right now. Some of that money is finding its way to Monero, by the look of things.\n\nIt is anything but surprising to learn Monero has appreciated in value against bitcoin. a 7.13% gain in the past 34 hours shows there is still some room left for future value increases. However, bitcoin is starting another bull run by the look of things, which may result in XMR trading volume drying up slowly. Poloniex is holding down the fort with over 8.500 BTC in trading volume, though, so things are looking quite good for Monero.\n\nOne thing that is rather apparent is how not all of the trading volume is coming from the Bitcoin side of things. Both the USD and EUR market have exploded in volume these past few days. The USD market sits at US$16m worth of volume, whereas its EUR counterpart generated nearly 1 million in volume. Both numbers are spectacular increases for Monero, compared to a few days ago. The appetite for XMR seems to be insatiable at this time, although things may turn around at any given moment.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

03/13/2017,"['Winklevoss ETF has come and gone, it was not approved. At the incident of the announcement of non-approval, Bitcoin price collapsed from $1,350 to $980 within a very short time. Several hours later, Bitcoin price has been seen to be on a steady recovery and trades at $1,230 at the time of writing.\n\nJeremy Epstein, CEO at Never Stop Marketing, says:\n\n“This is a pothole in the road, to be sure. The decentralized asset world has to slow down and adjust, but the momentum that Bitcoin and altcoins have is past the tipping point.”\n\nExpectations were high in certain quarters before the SEC announcement, different schools of thought filtered through the Bitcoin ecosystem and expert analysis offered predictions of possible market reactions, depending on the outcome of the event.\n\nETF denial not a surprise\n\nEpstein tells Cointelegraph that he was optimistic towards the ETF approval. However, as for the reasons that most things from the government in the last 15 years haven’t always been what they seem, he had his doubts.\n\nHe describes the scenario as part of Schopenhauer’s “violent opposition” on the way to “inevitable.” However, Epstein is of the opinion that in the long term, the market forces are in favor of Bitcoin, so the market will get over this pothole and pick up steam.\n\nMichael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins, tells Cointelegraph that prior to the announcement, he had mixed feelings on how important the ETF could be towards the growth of Bitcoin.\n\nVogel says:\n\n“I was fairly ambivalent about the Bitcoin ETF announcement; it isn\'t crucial (or relevant) to Bitcoin\'s success for there to be a publicly traded ETF, although it certainly is an interesting idea.”\n\nBitcoin is powered by diversified global use cases\n\nAccording to Vogel, the ruling did not come to him as a surprise either because Bitcoin and Blockchain represent a fairly subversive technology and we\'re still in an era where banks and governments are publicly embracing ""the Blockchain"" but aren\'t yet comfortable with the idea of Bitcoin even though they are arguably one and the same.\n\nCiting the diversified global use cases, Vogel does not see the SEC decision having a long-term effect on the market. However, he commends the efforts and innovations of the Winklevoss brothers while showing expectation towards what their next move will be.\n\nHe concludes:\n\n“I think the Winklevoss brothers are terrific ambassadors for Bitcoin and I can\'t wait to see what their next move is. An ETF would certainly help wall street traders safely dip their toes into the world Bitcoin and continue to encourage new adopters.”\n\nETF was a bad idea\n\nSimon Dixon, CEO and co-founder BnkToTheFuture, in his view rather thinks that an ETF is a very bad way to hold Bitcoin. Dixon says that an ETF would introduce counterparty risk into Bitcoin - one of the only zero counterparty risk assets. He perceives the phenomenon as an example where traditional regulations decrease consumer protections as a result of trying to shoehorn Bitcoin into a traditional investment vehicle.\n\nAccording to him, those holding Bitcoin as a store of value were excited about the ETF as it would have been a race for instructional money to purchase cheap Bitcoins that would have been removed from circulation as a result of the ETF.\n\nDixon explains that the ETF would have made Bitcoin an even more scarce asset and would likely drive the price much higher. Therefore, those who use Bitcoin as a currency should be happy with the decision as removing such a large number of Bitcoin from circulation will make it even less stable and subject to being controlled and manipulated by instructional money.\n\nHowever, Dixon notes that if the SEC decision means no ETF will be approved then it means that investors will have to use Bitcoin the way it was intended without counterparty risk, which in the long run is very good news for Bitcoin, but he still thinks that in the end, an ETF will slip through, saying that they a version of one already exists outside of the US.', ""Update: Antpool has indicated that the entire pool will be switched to Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nAntpool, Bitcoin’s largest mining pool, has begun mining blocks supporting Bitcoin Unlimited, cementing deadlock in the scaling debate as transaction issues worsen.\n\nLast month, Bitcoin Unlimited briefly passed 25 percent of total blocks mined, indicating that a hard fork to increase the block size might be on the horizon. Though that rally did not last, now Unlimited is comfortably in the lead again thanks to Antpool beginning to mine Unlimited blocks, indicating that Bitcoin’s struggle over scaling solutions may be far from over. Meanwhile, transactions become slower and more expensive.\n\nAntpool, Bitcoin’s largest mining pool, switching to Unlimited\n\nWhile the tug-of-war continues between Segregated Witness, Bitcoin Core’s preferred upgrade to the network and Bitcoin Unlimited, a scaling solution championed by famed investor Roger Ver allowing miners to decide and implement a block size increase, a new development may tip the scales. Blocks mined by China-based Antpool, Bitcoin’s largest mining pool, increasingly support Unlimited, indicating that the pool may turn over completely in favor of a block size increase.\n\nAt the same time, Ver’s own mining pool, Bitcoin.com, was recently opened to the public, allowing for a greater increase in Unlimited’s chances of succeeding:\n\nGet more cash for your hash on the world's highest paying mining pool. NOW OPEN TO THE PUBLIC! https://t.co/8IbNun01Cf pic.twitter.com/n62O0odEZZ — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) March 7, 2017\n\nAs a result, at present Bitcoin Unlimited represents over 30 percent of both hashpower and blocks mined, landing comfortably ahead of SegWit adoption for the time being.\n\nThe scaling debate remains in gridlock\n\nDespite gains by Bitcoin Unlimited, however, the contest remains too close to accurately call, and both implementations, or neither, could succeed. Roger Ver points out that Unlimited is closer to implementation and present:\n\n.@BitcoinUnlimit is currently much closer to activation than Segwit, so if anyone is blocking anything, SegWit supporters are blocking BU. — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) March 9, 2017\n\nCharlie Lee, Litecoin’s founder and Coinbase’s Director of Engineering, insists that it’s SegWit that should be adopted instead:\n\nLots of fighting between SegWit and BU folks today on Twitter. Getting to a breaking point. I have a solution...\n\n\n\nActivate SegWit! ? — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) March 4, 2017\n\nMany debates have occured since hard forks to increase the block size were attempted almost two years ago has centered around not whether bigger blocks would allow Bitcoin to temporarily scale but whether or not increasing the block size would cause detrimental effects. Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer\u200f opines that an increase in block size would not have such negative effects:\n\nReminder: no one has shown that a modest blocksize increase has any downside at all. This oft-repeated dichotomy is false. https://t.co/Advi8s3vXq — Emin Gün Sirer (@el33th4xor) March 12, 2017\n\nBitcoin’s fees and transaction times are becoming worse\n\nThe gridlocked debate over scaling solutions has led to Bitcoin’s transaction times and fees, once the envy of the world’s payment systems, to become significantly less attractive. This year alone, Bitcoin’s mempool size of backlogged transactions has grown over tenfold. The average confirmation time for a Bitcoin transaction reached an all-time high of over two hours in February, since down to around 1.5 hours. Median fees have more than tripled this year.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin-using businesses are feeling the effects. Popular point-of-sale system and Bitcoin debit card provider BitPay reports that the amount they spend on fees has been exponentially rising, having almost doubled since Christmas. Co-founder and CEO Stephen Pair, however, still believes that Bitcoin “is working perfectly.”\n\nUsability issues may drive users to altcoins\n\nAll while Bitcoin has had its own scaling issues, the top altcoins have had quite the showing in the markets. Ethereum, Dash and Monero have all shot up over the past several weeks, bringing total altcoin market cap to an all-time high and taking Bitcoin’s percentage of cryptocurrency’s total value to a five-month low.\n\nAccording to Robert Genito, project lead for peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading platform Wall of Coins, companies and users can easily switch to a tool that better suits their needs:\n\n“Genitrust only took about 60 man hours to switch our company over to being able to have our storage financial back-end be entirely Dash. Customers move quickly. Bitcoin needs to act just as quickly.”"", 'Wu Xiaoling, vice chairwoman of the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee of the Congress in China has stated that the supervision of bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms in the country should fall under the purview of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).\n\nWu, who formerly served as the deputy governor for the PBOC, the country’s central bank, stated her opinion in response to a question fielding during an interaction journalists and reporters last week.\n\nAs reported by major regional publication 163, Wu sees the central bank’s tasks in ensuring anti-money laundering guidelines and foreign exchange management as factors for the apex bank’s supervisory purview over exchanges in the country.\n\nThe prominent government official also revealed that the central bank’s recent regulatory review and involvement in the local trading market are to ensure that the cryptocurrency does not become a channel for money laundering. Although these concerns have long been speculated, the PBOC has only led its crackdown on bitcoin exchange activity since the turn of the year. Capital outflows from China have proven to be particularly tricky for authorities to deal with.\n\nBitcoin a ‘Digital Asset’\n\nWu says she hopes that Chinese trading platforms comply with AML, foreign exchange rules and payment settlement rules. Further, the former PBOC deputy governor added that bitcoin trading platforms are actively cooperating with the central bank toward self-regulation.\n\n“Bitcoin is a relatively successful use-case of blockchain technology,” Wu stated, in roughly translated comments. “Governments and regulatory authorities [around the world] have different attitudes toward bitcoin. In China, it is certified as a digital asset. There are some countries that identify it as illegal money [since it isn’t] issued centrally.”\n\nBitcoin can Co-Exist with Government Money\n\nAs CCN reported in late 2014, Wu has notably referred to bitcoin, as a “private digital money” can co-exist and function alongside government (fiat) money.\n\nShe had stated:\n\nPrivate digital money can coexist with government money. […] Coexistence of private money and government money will be a normal part of our world.\n\nSpeaking at a panel that included bitcoin exchange Huobi’s CEO Leon Lin at the time, Wu, although not directly mentioning bitcoin, referred to the world’s most known cryptocurrency as “private digital money,” “virtual money,” and “algorithmic money” during her speech.\n\nAt the time, Huobi underlined Wu’s speech as “the highest-ranking government official to have made such positive public statements about bitcoin.”\n\nNotably, she added:\n\nA new value transfer network based on open-source, distributed information technology will reduce costs and increase efficiency; it is worthy of exploration and development.\n\nThe former PBOC official’s statements were proved true when the PBOC revealed it was exploring the possibility of issuing its own central bank-issued digital currency. The PBOC announced that it was, in fact, looking to issue its own digital currency “as soon as possible”.\n\nWu has been making public statements on bitcoin as early as 2013, when she stated that bitcoin, while not seen as a legal currency, was not explicitly prohibited by the central bank.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While people have been observing coins like Ethereum and Dash reach all-time highs, the crypto ecosystem as a whole seems to be taking off. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in circulation has neared $25 bln.\n\nBitcoin – the dominant one\n\nBitcoin is, of course, the dominant cryptocurrency. It currently accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in circulation. In the run-up to the decision on the Winklevoss’ Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), Bitcoin dominance was as high as 88 percent.\n\nPost rejection of the ETF, Bitcoin price has stabilized, and it has been in a consolidation mode.\n\nSecondary coins take off too\n\nCrypto investors, who were betting on ETF approval, now seem to prefer secondary coins like Ethereum and Dash. Both these coins have reported massive gains in the last three months and seem to be further increasing post the rejection of the ETF.\n\nEther’s market capitalization has shot up from $1 bln a month ago to over $2.5 bln currently.\n\nDash has recorded impressive gains too, with current market capitalization of $500 mln which is up from $120 mln a month ago.\n\nAltcoins which have enhanced privacy features (like Monero and Zcash) are other coins which seem to be leading this bull run.\n\nBubble territory? Not even close!\n\nDoes a total market capitalization of $25 bln mean that cryptocurrencies are in bubble territory?\n\nThe market capitalization is a pittance when compared to other asset classes. The market capitalization of US stock markets is approximately $25 tln, or a thousand times the value of all cryptocurrencies in circulation. The value of all gold in circulation is approximately $7 tln.\n\nThe total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is roughly equal to the market capitalization of Snapchat and less than one eighth the market capitalization of Visa Inc.\n\nGiven the huge potential of cryptocurrencies in areas ranging from money transfers to smart contracts, cryptocurrencies are definitely not overvalued.

This goes on till it explodes and the people lose all their money.”\n\nWhile neither Agrawal nor fellow interviewee, Unocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath, explicitly named an example of such schemes allegedly operating in India, cryptocurrency’s legality in the country remains a problem.\n\nA legislative vacuum is countered by frequent government and central bank warnings on supposed dangers of using Bitcoin and its ilk, these accompanying a currency crisis which after four months is still causing headaches for consumers.\n\nSuch mixed signals put India on par with jurisdictions such as Venezuela, where authorities have not banned cryptocurrency but appear to selectively penalize its operators.\n\nMeanwhile, Monday, at last, saw cash withdrawal restrictions lifted in India as supplies of new banknotes slowly increase.\n\nZebpay and Unocoin are among the first local Indian Bitcoin exchanges. Both resources have seen marked increases in use since the currency reforms and recently announced a plan to self-regulate the market through their own association.', '', 'Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price has been moving sideways, bouncing off support at $1100 and testing resistance at $1170.\n\nPrice is hovering around the resistance at the moment and a move back to support could be in the cards.\n\nTechnical indicators are showing that sellers are in control but that a breakout could be possible soon.\n\nBitcoin price is stuck in a range against the dollar for now as traders are holding out for this week’s top-tier events.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the range resistance is more likely to hold than to break.\n\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing so an upward crossover could take place, signaling that bulls are about to take over and push for a break past the range resistance. If so, bitcoin price could climb by around $70 or the same height as the range.\n\nStochastic is on the move down, though, which means that sellers are on top of their game and have enough energy to push for more losses. RSI is also edging down, indicating that presence of bearish pressure. A break below the 100 SMA dynamic support or the previous lows at $1140 could be enough to reflect selling momentum.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe main event for BTCUSD this week might be the FOMC decision, as the Fed is highly expected to hike interest rates by 0.25% following the stronger than expected NFP release last Friday. Should the committee decide against this or hint that they can no longer implement three hikes for the year, the dollar could give up a lot of ground to bitcoin. On the other hand, reiterating their hawkish views by upgrading growth and inflation forecasts could shore up dollar demand and drive bitcoin price losses.\n\nThere are several other central banks set to announce their policy decisions this week, providing potential volatility from other markets. For now, though, bitcoin is still reeling from the SEC denial of the COIN ETF and traders are reevaluating their positions.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

The fact that Deloitte chose Ireland as the landing spot for their EMEA Blockchain Hub, he notes, was was a huge vote of confidence for Ireland in terms of being recognized as a global blockchain player.\n\nA big issue at the moment in Ireland, said Godfrey, is the race to hire programmers who understand the technology. “It’s becoming evident that there simply aren’t enough ‘experts’ to fill these roles. In the coming year to eighteen months, I foresee a growing need for cross-training of existing talent. In the meantime companies in this space will need to fundamentally rethink their current approaches. Those that fail to keep up may see their business model quickly outdated and face serious disruption from new startups.”\n\nGodfrey pointed out that the blockchain community in Ireland remains slightly fragmented. “There is still no guidance at a national level so it’s up to us and other organizations, universities and the private sector to bring the conversation forward and elicit a stance from policymakers and regulators.”\n\nIn terms of the long-term future for blockchain technology and bitcoin in Ireland, Godfrey concluded, “I always answer the same way on this, namely, that it’s like the internet was 25 years ago. We could have predicted the web’s impact on, say, print media, but it would have been far harder to predict the social and political impact of the broader social media landscape of Twitter [and] Facebook. So I’ll close by quoting Donald Rumsfeld: ‘There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns ... But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don’t know we don’t know.’”', 'Our London Correspondent Nick Ayton, aka the Sage of Shoreditch, reviews another exciting few weeks: the Japanese buying more Blockchain, ICO snapshots, MotherCoin for your mom and Satoshi spotted at Tate Modern.\n\nIt’s a busy week for Bitcoin fans as the digital currency spiked passing gold and then Bitcoin price fell even before the SEC rejection of the Bitcoin ETF proposal by the Winklevoss twins.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency."", 'A controversial plan to fix bitcoin’s network congestion suffered a setback after attackers used a newly-discovered bug to crash the software.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, which had been attracting support from the digital currency’s biggest miners, was attacked after developers brought the bug to light. The numbers of ""nodes"" hosting Unlimited fell to about 300 from 800 following the attacks, the lowest level since October, according to website coin.dance which tracks industry data. That figure bounced back to about 800 within 24 hours after developers patched the bug.\n\nNodes make up the core of bitcoin’s infrastructure. Those with mining abilities shoulder a significant workload of verifying transactions with specialized computers, while non-mining nodes independently track those transactions and effectively ensure the entire network is functioning as expected. By running a certain version of the software, such as Unlimited, each node can signal how they want bitcoin to evolve.\n\nWhile the exploit was quickly patched, it is validation to critics who say Unlimited programmers lack the experience to fix bitcoin’s complicated congestion issue. Unlimited had in recent weeks won the backing of influential miners, as some decided to give up on reaching a community consensus after more than two years of discussion. The bug raises uncertainty about whether miners will follow through on their support.\n\nThe Unlimited side wants to remove a pre-programmed cap on the amount of data bitcoin’s network can process, which they argue can end congestion. Opponents say removing the limit would put too much power in the hands of large organizations who have better resources to process large amounts of data, potentially undermining bitcoin’s independence from governments and global banks. They’ve offered to ease the congestion with an approach called SegWit, which uses a slightly different method to verify transactions.\n\nBoth sides took to social media to celebrate or defend their respective camps. The community has grown increasingly polarized as bitcoin’s underlying network has become more backlogged than at any point in the currency’s eight-year history.\n\n— With assistance by Lulu Yilun Chen', 'As China moves closer to Bitcoin regulation, the specifics of the People’s Bank of China Director Zhou Xuedong’s views on the cryptocurrency are coming to light.\n\nIn a translated summary of his findings uploaded to Twitter by cnLedger, Xuedong stated, among other items, that “most Bitcoin investors are young people” and that exchange behavior such as faking trading volumes “should be examined and regulated.”\n\nBitcoin’s future in China “cannot work out without regulations,” he said, speaking in the wake of the US refusal of the first Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAs China’s major exchanges continue preparations to fully recommence withdrawals in line with PBoC guidelines, the community is focused on what shape any regulation will likely take when officially outlined.\n\nWhile Xuedong advised that a “forgiving attitude” would be adopted with regard to exchange regulation, it is likely that direct supervision of their operations will continue for some time to come.\n\n“A certain level of regulations on Bitcoin trading platforms is indeed necessary,” he continued. “Without the regulations, bubbles will be amplified by speculation, so I suggest some red lines should not be crossed.”\n\nSpeculation elsewhere regarding the Chinese market continues meanwhile, with unconfirmed reports that authorities are considering banning P2P marketplace LocalBitcoins. The resource had formed an essential alternative for China’s traders when exchanges originally ceased allowing withdrawals in February.', 'A decade ago, the concept of a decentralized currency was nothing more than an idea. It went by the name of Bitcoin.\n\nToday? A single Bitcoin is worth over $1,200.\n\nThose who saw the vision for the idea many years ago invested, and have since made fortunes for themselves. Since then, many other entrepreneurs believing the future of cryptocurrencies to be bright, have pushed their chips forward in favor.\n\nNow? There’s a new name in town: Ethereum, a blockchain-based platform extremely similar to the one operating Bitcoin. The difference? According to IEEE Spectrum, “Some of the biggest names in the sectors of finance and software—including Intel, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, and Accenture—finally stepped into the fray, announcing their intention to work together on a private version of the Ethereum blockchain. Their efforts will be coordinated under the auspices of a new nonprofit organization called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which will guide the engineering of a standard blockchain technology based on the Ethereum blockchain and customized for the needs of all enterprise members.”\n\nIn short? Ethereum has an alliance of more than 30 companies, extremely influential and powerful each in their own right, supporting the future of cryptocurrencies by building a highly specialized platform with the intention of self-executing peer-to-peer contracts.\n\nOver the last two years, I have come across more than a handful of extremely intelligent entrepreneurs that swear by the potential of cryptocurrencies—and who are now swearing up and down about Ethereum being the next Bitcoin. Considering I missed the ball on Bitcoin (even though a friend of mine told me to buy 1000s of coins back when it was under $50), I am listening more closely this time.\n\nI have come across many people who are buying Ether by the dozens as a long term play.\n\nThen, just this last week, Dan Fleyshman and Branden Hampton, two super stars in the world of digital influence—started talking about the future of Ethereum and began making big purchases themselves. These are guys that have made some very lucrative investments over the years, so again I took note.\n\nDan Fleyshman is the youngest founder of a publicly traded company, Author and Angel Investor in 24 companies. I asked him what his thoughts were on the future of cryptocurrencies, and he said, “I have been active in Bitcoin since 2014 when I got the first BITCOIN ATM placed into a Las Vegas casino by introducing the owners and sitting through the intense vetting processes with city officials, attorneys and mountains of paperwork to make sure the BTC ATM was fully compliant for the Nevada Gaming Commission’s rigorous rules to protect people. Over time, I noticed that the only other coin on the Coinbase platform was ‘ETHEREUM,’ I started researching it. Then once I heard about the ‘Ethereum Alliance’ being backed by 30 major corporations, I decided it was time to go all-in. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin, but for a variety of technical reasons, arguably better.”\n\nOn March 4, 2017 Fleyshman told his followers on Facebook and Twitter to keep an eye on Ethereum and that he was heavily investing. It was then at $19. Since then, as of the time of publishing, it has gone on to increase to nearly $30, which is over a 150% increase. “I’m all-in,” said Fleyshman, referring to Ethereum.\n\nBranden Hampton, the largest independent social media publisher in the world with over 31 million followers across all social media platforms, weighed in as well: “I feel like I have a great eye for trends and emerging markets. Ethereum has my radar going crazy. It’s revolutionary in both the b2b and b2c markets and the applications have unlimited potential.”\n\nThese two entrepreneurs aren’t the only ones looking ahead at what sorts of opportunities could unfold from the development and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream culture. But one thing is for sure: if you get in early, you could be sitting pretty a few years down the line.', 'The Bitcoin blockchain is basically becoming useless for low-value, instant purchases. Frankly, if you’re ordering a beer at a bar, you’re better off using cash or a credit card at this point.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was once touted as a cheaper alternative to credit cards that was going to revolutionize the payments industry, but the P2P digital cash system has hit a bit of a speed bump in terms of those long-promised “free” transactions. Let’s take a closer look at Bitcoin’s increased transaction fees and what solutions exist to solve this issue.\n\nWhat’s Wrong With Small Payments on Bitcoin?\n\nThe problem with low-value transactions on the Bitcoin network right now is that fees are too high for it to be of any practical use in these situations. 21’s bitcoin fee estimator recommends a fee of 54,240 satoshis at the time of this writing, which equates to roughly $0.69. This cost is roughly double the amount of fees involved in many low-value credit card transactions.\n\nIn fact, as a user on Reddit pointed out, more than half of the Bitcoin addresses in existence contain a balance lower than the current estimated transaction fee. However, the balances of these addresses amount to roughly 0.00001% of all bitcoins in existence.\n\nWhile the level of censorship resistance offered by Bitcoin’s permissionless payment network has obvious value, it’s also rather expensive. The system must remain decentralized in order for this resistance to censorship to remain intact. The cost of operating a full node increases as more transactions are processed on the network, and some users already see the costs related to full node operation as too high.\n\nThe reason that this sort of change has not yet been implemented is that coming to consensus on a proper solution for this sort of issue in a decentralized fashion has proven to be difficult. It is both a positive and a negative that Bitcoin is resistant to these sorts of changes.\n\nBitcoin payments were much cheaper in the past because demand for block space was much lower. Users are now essentially bidding on the right to have their transactions included in the next block. Large-value transfers and payments that necessitate a certain degree of censorship resistance will tend to outbid lower-value, everyday payments such as the purchase of a cup of coffee.\n\nHow Could Smaller Payments Work on Bitcoin Right Now?\n\nFor now, smaller-value payments with bitcoin tend to require a degree of trust in another party, which is ironic because removing that third party was outlined in the original Bitcoin white paper as a reason for Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation. If you’re going to avoid an on-chain transaction fee with your bitcoin payments, then you’ll likely be holding your coins in a bitcoin bank, such as Coinbase or Xapo, with the receiver of your payment also having an account at that particular bitcoin bank.\n\nThe level of trust in the bitcoin bank can already be mitigated a bit by using something like Blockstream’s Liquid or an Open Transactions voting pool. In these sorts of schemes, funds are held in one giant multisignature address by all of the banks involved in the program. An individual bitcoin bank would not be able to steal customer funds, but customers must still trust that a majority of banks (depending on the setup) do not collude to steal funds from the now much-bigger pot.\n\nSystems like Liquid and voting pools also have the side effect of not requiring an on-chain transaction for the transfer of funds between the participating entities and their customers.\n\nNo bitcoin bank or exchange has publicly announced that they are using one of these systems at this time.\n\nAlternatively, bitcoin banks could decide to make agreements with each other to settle transactions between their customers once per day. This would essentially mean that payments between customers at Coinbase, Xapo and any other centralized bitcoin bank or exchange would happen off-chain at little or no cost.\n\nHow Could These Systems Improve in the Future?\n\nIn the spirit of Bitcoin, the level of trust required in these centralized entities can also be reduced through further improvements at the base protocol level. Solutions such as the lightning network and TumbleBit drastically reduce the amount of trust required in one of these centralized institutions to the point where it would probably be incorrect to refer to them as banks at all.\n\nIn TumbleBit, for example, the “bank” is unable to steal customer funds and does not know where user funds are being sent. TumbleBit also provides better privacy and essentially instant quasi-settlement of bitcoin transactions.\n\nLess useful and elegant versions of the lightning network and TumbleBit are possible with the current version of Bitcoin, but they would be greatly enhanced if Segregated Witness were activated on the Bitcoin network. Content sharing and monetization platform Yours intends to launch with a payment solution similar to the lightning network that acts as more of a hub-and-spoke system rather than a generalized layer for these types of payments.\n\nIn a situation where these layer-two protocols are implemented and widely used, bitcoin users would essentially have two sets of bitcoins in their wallets that come with different levels of security. The bitcoins that are unconnected to the lightning network or a TumbleBit hub would be like money in a savings account, while the coins “tied up” (for lack of a better term) on these layer-two systems would be similar to money in a checking account.\n\nThen again, this structure would not be too dissimilar to how things work today. Many bitcoin users already keep their bitcoin savings in some form of cold storage while their spending money is in a mobile wallet. The specifics of how this would play out are somewhat unclear at this time.\n\nAn increase in the block size limit via a hard fork would also create an increase in the supply of block space, and thus lower the cost of on-chain transactions overall, but it’s unclear how large blocks can become while retaining a sufficient level of decentralization and censorship resistance. A key difference with the aforementioned solutions is that they potentially increase the level of risk involved with a user’s funds on an opt-in basis. With hard-forking changes being made at the protocol level, users are forced to opt into new risks by default.\n\nThis is not to say that a hard-forking increase to Bitcoin’s block size limit cannot be made; it just needs to be balanced with the tradeoffs made when it comes to the cost of operating a full node. Past research has indicated that an increase from 1 MB to 4 MB may be worth it, but new research in this area would be useful.', 'The latest growth data for Bitcoin as a currency shows sustained increases in adoption as mainstream media pick up on a growing trend.\n\nPicking up on five separate positive charts it says “shows Bitcoin may be turning into a real currency,” Quartz highlights Bitpay payment data as an example of stable growth.\n\n“BitPay’s data speaks for itself,” the publication wrote Tuesday.\n\nBitpay saw just over 200,000 payments processed in December 2015, the latest month information obtained by The Atlas is available for.\n\nThe value of these payments totaled around $160 mln, a figure which has likely changed as the average payment amount has become larger due to higher transaction fees in 2016-17.\n\nLast week, in fact, Bitpay raised its minimum invoice amount from four cents to $1 in order to deal with “uneconomical transactions” on both its and the customer’s side.\n\n“New data suggests that Bitcoin payments are gaining traction, as its volatility has fallen and its value has rocketed,” Quartz nonetheless asserts.\n\nHighlighting the figures nonetheless demonstrates a growing schism in the popular press regarding Bitcoin’s identity.

The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 has already forced 888poker to leave the country and major poker rooms like PokerStars and PartyPoker are also planning their exit. Thanks to bitcoin, however, online poker could still have a place in Australia, as players will have the opportunity to play the game they love through a number of different types of sites that are bitcoin-friendly. This is great news for Australian online poker players, who would otherwise be restricted from playing poker under the new legislation.\n\nCurrently, online poker is available in other countries where online poker is otherwise restricted thanks to the use of bitcoin. The United States is a great example of this, and serves as a blueprint of sorts for operators who want to continue to offer poker in Australia despite their legal restrictions. After the law was passed that made online poker in the United States illegal (but, ironically, left open a loophole that paved the way for the daily fantasy sports industry to thrive), it was assumed that the game was gone for good for Americans.\n\nBut bitcoin has changed that, with users able to fund anonymous accounts via an anonymous bitcoin wallet, making it possible for Americans to take a seat at the table again. While the process of funding an online bitcoin poker account is a bit frustrating for American players, something we’ll touch on later, that process is better than not being allowed to play online poker at all. Therefore, Americans have taken the good with the bad, and have gone through that process. Bitcoin should provide a similar reprieve for Australians looking to continue playing online poker in spite of the recent ban, only without the same hassles.\n\nFortunately for Australians looking to begin playing bitcoin poker online for the first time, the game has grown substantially in terms of its relationship with bitcoin over the years. Once relegated to smaller bitcoin poker sites like Seals with Clubs, bitcoin poker players can now take their pick of many larger sites that now accept the crypto-currency.\n\nLarger poker sites such as America’s Cardroom and BetOnline now accept bitcoin, which allows members of those sites to continue funding their accounts and playing online poker regardless of any restrictions placed upon Australia by the government. A huge positive to using sites like these is that they are well-respected brands already, and have no issues with credibility, the way sites with less of a track record could.\n\nBitcoin-only poker rooms are also an option for players who are looking for alternatives to more traditional poker sites. A great example of these sites is Nitrogen, who offers an exemplary poker experience with some differences from other poker sites. The first positive in using a bitcoin-only poker site such as Nitrogen is the lack of transaction fees for both deposits and withdrawals, something that is a negative to using BetOnline and other sites that deal in currencies other than bitcoin. These bitcoin-only sites also offer lower rakes on each hand, which means that more of your bankroll goes toward playing hands instead of going toward paying the house for the ability to do so.\n\nFor Australian players, buying bitcoin is a straightforward process, especially when compared to the process of purchasing bitcoin in other countries. In the United States, players have to purchase bitcoin using an exchange site such as Coinbase, then transfer those funds into an anonymous bitcoin wallet (because exchange sites like Coinbase will shut down your account if it is associated with online wagering sites), then deposit those funds into your online poker site of choice.\n\nIn Australia, bitcoin can be bought with cash at over 1,200 newsagents. So instead of going through two different bitcoin wallets before depositing funds into a bitcoin online poker site, players will be able to simply make a cash purchase of bitcoin, and transfer those funds into the poker room of their choosing, making the process almost as easy as depositing traditional currency into a poker site before doing so was deemed illegal.

One BU node operator accused him and other responsible parties of “plain incompetence” as panic gripped a community to whom Ver had only last week unveiled a brand new mining pool.\n\n""Normally, in Bitcoin Unlimited when we find a Core bug we just fix it and move on"" https://t.co/cqQaIm5FZJ — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) March 14, 2017\n\nLitecoin creator Charlie Lee added to the criticism of BU, stating that the bug “proves that users cannot trust Bitcoin’s $20B network in the hands of BU developers.”\n\n1/ Today’s Bitcoin Unlimited node crashing bug proves that users cannot trust Bitcoin’s $20B network in the hands of BU developers. — Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) March 14, 2017\n\nLee also quoted suspicions that Stone’s description of BU “vulnerability” did not mathematically add up.\n\nDisappointed to see doctored image (left) in @GAndrewStone\'s post about a BU vulnerability. Doesn\'t even sum to 100% https://t.co/Byirt7eiCL pic.twitter.com/EArZwFSyOb — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) March 14, 2017\n\nOnly Andreas Antonopoulos, commentating that “individual incompetence” was not the root cause of the problem, appeared to remain neutral on Wednesday.\n\n“It\'s about a process with diverse and laborious review, which catches bugs before production,” he continued in a series of tweets, while nonetheless praising Bitcoin Core’s development structure.\n\n“Blaming this on ""incompetence"" of BU devs misses the point & undervalues the invisible but highly effective QA process that Core offers.”', ""Last Friday, the SEC ruled against approving the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF), the outcome of an almost four-year process. While the decision was a disappointment to many, it is only one skirmish in what is likely to be years of back-and-forth before digital assets take their rightful place as widely-accepted tokens for global commerce.\n\nWhile regulatory debates continue, the price of bitcoin is up almost 200 percent from March 2016, overtaking gold for the first time in history this month. This demand continues to drive the development of varied and institutional-quality investment vehicles for digital assets.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs this institutional interest in blockchain grows, so too does the universe of prospective investors, further emphasizing the need for balanced regulation that protects the public, while allowing this transformative new technology to flourish.\n\nA Deeper Issue\n\nThe SEC’s decision is indicative of a much deeper and more systemic issue within the U.S. regulatory landscape. Our regulatory system is fragmented, complex and uncoordinated. It is laden with agencies quick to point the finger and slow to assume responsibility for enabling innovation.\n\nIn its rejection, the SEC noted that the majority of bitcoin is traded on exchanges outside of the U.S. — hardly surprising when considering the current status quo.\n\nIn the U.S., digital currency exchanges have largely been categorized as “money service businesses”, subjecting them to state regulation. These exchanges have to obtain licenses on a state-by-state basis in order to operate — an enormously burdensome, if not prohibitive process.\n\nWithout a clear regulatory framework, nor the ability to secure the licensing and approval needed to go to market, blockchain companies are increasingly being forced overseas. Our global counterparts continue to show decidedly more progressive attitudes toward the development of blockchain technology.\n\nWith moves like this SEC decision, we risk more jobs, innovations and businesses seeking friendlier regulatory environments in Europe and Asia, where the appetite for fintech innovation is markedly greater.\n\nTo regain and retain leadership in this important sector of the economy, U.S. regulators should focus on pro-growth initiatives, such as establishing a federal option for digital currency exchanges, to seize the generational opportunity to develop this country as a true center of excellence in financial technology.\n\nSteady Progress\n\nProgress has never been linear for digital assets, but it's been mostly consistent. Innovation on a potential multi-trillion-dollar scale naturally generates something of a rollercoaster — think back to when the Netscape browser gave way to Internet Explorer and Safari, Google supplanted Yahoo!, or Facebook replaced MySpace.\n\nWe should accept that this is the natural process when high tech brings value to people, and regulators should be judicious in facilitating the adoption of best practices. The SEC’s decision not to approve an application for a Bitcoin ETF captivated the attention of financial leaders, blockchain startups, retail investors and the financial media.\n\nNow is a crucial time for the blockchain community to build on this momentum and to capitalize on the growing public awareness of this emerging sector. Government agencies across the U.S. are actively exploring blockchain technology, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDespite this latest setback, there are still many avenues for the blockchain community to establish a permanent place for digital assets in our financial system and to encourage the incorporation of distributed ledger solutions at a widespread level.\n\nPerianne Boring is the founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the world's largest trade association representing the blockchain industry.\n\nThe views expressed by contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill."", 'Regional police in Canada have issued a warning to local residents about fraudulent investment schemes involving bitcoin.\n\nIn a statement, the Durham Regional Police Service, based out of Ontario, said that residents have reportedly been solicited about money-making pitches involving the digital currency that ultimately see them losing funds to the fraudsters.\n\nThe police statement said:\n\n""Residents have reported being contacted by fraudsters after applying for jobs or responding to ads online involving a promise to make money.

Though a new, and controversial, idea, it\'s grabbed the attention of many bitcoin developers, including JoinMarket developer Chris Belcher and David Vorick, co-founder of decentralized storage platform Sia.\n\nThen, this Sunday, shaolinfry, seemingly in a hurry to give his idea a spin, posted a second proposal.\n\nThis one puts forth a SegWit-specific UASF that fits with the requirements of the current deployment. This means that, if implemented, it could trigger the new type of soft fork as soon as October.\n\nShaolinfry told CoinDesk:\n\n“Under that circumstance, if Segwit isn\'t activated by 1st October then miners will be required to do so. If they don\'t, the exchanges would reject blocks from those non-signaling miners, and the miners wouldn\'t get paid.”\n\nBelcher noted that developers are now calling it the ""super-UASF"".\n\nThe proposal\n\nBacking up for a second, bitcoin needs a way to upgrade its rules if it wants to add new features like SegWit. But, upgrading is complicated for software that’s worth about $20bn, and worries of how to do it safely – like, without splitting the blockchain in two – abound.\n\nA soft fork with support from miners is arguably the safest way to do so, since it\'s backwards-compatible and not everyone needs to update.\n\nHowever, shaolinfry sees a UASF as a necessary option right now.\n\n""There has been a very dangerous myth circulating in some circles that miners can decide on the consensus rules,"" shaolinfry said, adding that the bitcoin white paper describes miners\' role as limited to ordering valid transactions into blocks.\n\nVorick, in turn, argued that SegWit is an optional upgrade, one that no one has to use, and has benefits for the ecosystem.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n”UASF is now becoming a popular idea because the miners are rejecting something that appears to have substantial community support.""\n\nHowever, not convinced the method needs to be tried right away, Vorick stepped in on the mailing list to argue that a better way to implement the \'super-UASF\' would be to first get written agreement from major economic players.\n\nWhen shaolinfry was asked whether it might be too soon to roll it out, the pseudonymous programmer said:\n\n”I personally don’t believe so, because this is not a new deployment. This BIP only needs buy-in from the exchanges, enough to hashpower into signalling, or choosing to mine something else profitable with SHA256 asics. It will take the upgraded nodes along.”\n\nOn the mailing list, shaolinfry further argued that a majority of nodes are upgraded to bitcoin software that uses SegWit. Many companies have further upgraded their software to support the change, and several Lightning Network implementations, which are dependent on it, have cropped up, offering ""significant social proof"" that the ecosystem supports it, the programmer said.\n\nBesides, the developer reasoned, a UASF was previously used to deploy other upgrades without any problems.\n\nHitting skepticism\n\nHowever, many disagree that a UASF is a good idea, with discussions raising a number of questions: How does one actually measure that economic majority? Is it really safe? What happens if the miners don\'t follow along?\n\nAnd some think it’s just too risky right now.\n\nPhD student Phil Daian, who works on cryptocurrency projects for Cornell’s IC3, called it the “worst of both worlds” in a detailed blog post analyzing different types of forks. His concern, which he pointed out is shared by Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr, is that, ironically, it puts too much trust in miners.\n\n""If a single malicious block is mined, then you essentially have a chain split. And, if a majority of hash power is not enforcing the new fork, then it could be a permanent chain split where you essentially have a hard fork with the bulk hash power that’s not validating the soft fork rule. And then you have the hash power that is,” he told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n“You’re relying a lot on miner honesty and good faith.""\n\nThe counterargument is that miners would have no choice but to support the chain that the economic majority wants, at least if they want to be able to continue to sell the bitcoins that they win from mining.\n\nVorick said more time is needed. ""USAF needs more study and consideration before we can be certain. I think it\'s likely that we attempt a UASF if the SegWit upgrade fails,” he said.\n\nAll that said, he’s optimistic, even if SegWit never goes through at all.\n\n""Bitcoin never upgrading again would be a disappointing result,"" Vorick said. ""But I also don\'t think that its spot as top dog in the cryptocurrency space would be threatened by that setback.""\n\nHe concluded:\n\n""Bitcoin has captured many properties that no other cryptocurrency has.""\n\nChainlink image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In October 2016, the bitcoin exchange told local media that its IT system was ""damaged by an external interference"" that resulted with the loss of a portion of its total assets.\n\nBut while platform\'s operator said that it had notified the authorities of a potential crime, as of earlier this month, the website has no content.\n\nThe Prosecutor\'s Office said in a statement that it is investigating the case on suspicion of crimes against the property of third persons.\n\n""Injured persons who have not submitted a notice of offense can submit such notices directly to the Prosecutor’s Office in ?ód?,"" the statement said.

In addition, the gap between the moving averages is getting wider so bullish momentum is getting stronger. Also, the 100 SMA lines up with the channel support, acting to its strength as a floor.\n\nStochastic is on the move up, also confirming that buyers are in control of price action. A bit of bullish divergence can be seen since the oscillator made lower lows while price had higher lows since yesterday.\n\nHowever, RSI is still on the move down so there may be some selling pressure left. A larger pullback could last until the 200 SMA dynamic support around $1153. If support holds, bitcoin price could climb back up to the resistance near $1170. On the other hand, a breakdown could send it to the next area of interest at $1145-1150.\n\nMarket Events\n\nThe FOMC statement was not as glaringly hawkish as many expected, even though the Fed did hike interest rates by 0.25% and signaled room for more tightening. The dot plot of forecasts suggested three rate hikes are still possible for the year, although it’s worth noting that one FOMC member dissented in favor of keeping rates on hold this time.\n\nWith that, the dollar sold off across the board after the announcement and press conference, with part of the move also attributed to profit-taking.

Read more...\n\nThe recent news of Coinbase suspending its services to the residents of Hawaii took many by surprise. The cryptocurrency wallet and exchange services, one of the big names in the industry made the hard decision after the Division of Financial Institutions introduced a new regulation that classified the company has a money transmitter. As per the new classification, Coinbase was not only required to get a license, but also match the value of bitcoins held on the platform with an equivalent fiat reserve.\n\nThe regulation in question that forced Coinbase out of Hawaii seems to be flawed on many counts. For starters, the Hawaii DFI has directly equated Bitcoin with money, which is not really the case. Without a proper understanding of the asset, the business model followed by Bitcoin companies and the difference between money and bitcoin, the regulators have imposed hurdles to the development of a crypto-economy.\n\n“While the state gives lip service to the idea that we foster high-tech companies in Hawaii, a careless or hostile regulatory environment for new technology tells entrepreneurs and investors that doing business in Hawaii comes with unnecessary hassles and risks.”\n\nA recent article on one of the news publications lists the differences between bitcoin exchanges and money transmitters. The author makes an attempt to present the case in such a way that everyone including the regulators can understand the cryptocurrency, the recently introduced cryptocurrency regulation and how the latter is affecting the former.\n\nThe author takes an example of the Western Union, a money transmitter and compares with the business model of Coinbase. While a regulation requiring the money transmitter to maintain enough reserves makes sense for the Western Union, it may not hold good for cryptocurrency businesses. In the case of Western Union, the money in physical form doesn’t change hands directly. Whereas, bitcoin transactions are completely digital and it is transmitted to the recipient’s wallet in “almost” real-time and the very same tokens are received by the person on the other side.\n\nThe movement of Bitcoin is akin to sending money over mail, which is exempted by the money transmitter license. However, with a thirty-day deadline looming over the Coinbase customers’ heads to withdraw funds (and bitcoins) from their account, they are unsure about managing it. The Hawaii DFI’s regulations are expected to stay in effect for at least two years, stifling not only the cryptocurrency businesses in the state but also digital currency accepting merchants.\n\nThe recent regulations are expected to have far-reaching consequences, which could include tourism as well.\n\nRef: CivilBeat | Image: Shutterstock', 'The director of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has recently shed some light on his views circulating the digital currency Bitcoin after the country’s central bank’s recent regulatory inspections on bitcoin exchanges.\n\nIn a translated summary uploaded to Twitter by cnLedger, Zhou Xuedong, stated that ‘most Bitcoin investors are young people’ and that ‘some platforms faked a lot of volume in order to attract investment.’\n\nAfter hearing the news of the U.S.’s refusal to approve the first ETF, Xuedong said that the future of Bitcoin in China ‘cannot work without regulations.’\n\nPBoC Interferes with Bitcoin\n\nIn January, it was reported that the PBoC had conducted on-site checks on major Chinese bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai. These were BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi.\n\nIt’s believed that the increased value in the currency was attracting the attention of authorities who were attempting to reduce capital outflows they believed were taking place through the digital currency.\n\nAs a result, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $790 while lesser known Chinese bitcoin miner HaoBTC revealed that it was shutting down its operations after announcing the removal of its exchange service to its users.\n\nIn a bid to adhere to the AML and regulatory requirements enforced by the PBoC upon bitcoin exchanges, BTCC announced in February that it was suspending Bitcoin and Litecoin withdrawals. OKCoin and Huobi announced a similar measure too.\n\nAll three exchanges were due to resume withdrawals this month, however the suspension continues for all three as they wait for regulatory approval.\n\nPBoC’s View on Bitcoin\n\nWith no timeframe insight as to if and when the three Chinese bitcoin exchanges will receive regulatory approval, it appears as though their month-long suspension is to continue indefinitely for the time being.\n\nHowever, while the PBoC seems set on regulating the currency, it remains to be seen how exactly this will pan out. Earlier this month, it was reported that a central bank official had stated that China should provide clarity toward the currency’s regulation and supervision of bitcoin exchanges.\n\nNot one to take responsibility, though, an official from the Chinese government responded by saying that the supervision of the digital currency exchanges and trading platforms falls under the remit of the PBoC.\n\nWith a toing and froing ensuring between both sides it looks as though it may be a few years before any sort of regulation will be seen in China.\n\nHow this will impact the currency’s position in the country is not yet known, but it is sure to impact exchanges who currently have their hands tied waiting for regulatory approval.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'CloudCoin Logo\n\nA provisional patent has been granted for a new technology that will challenge Bitcoin and the underlying Blockchain technology used in cryptocurrencies. This technology, called RAIDA (Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents), is only the second technology (the Blockchain being the first) to solve the physical integrity problem presented by digital currencies.\n\nRAIDA is superior in every way to the Blockchain, and a new currency - CloudCoin - has been created. CloudCoin transacts in milliseconds (Bitcoin in 40 minutes), CloudCoin is 100% anonymous (Bitcoin is pseudonymous), and CloudCoin does not require encryption (Bitcoin requires massive computational resources, storage space and electricity). CloudCoin is the first currency in human history that cannot be counterfeited or lost. Bitcoin “mining” is actually counterfeiting used to support infrastructure. CloudCoin is self-funded.\n\nThere are big problems with cryptocurrencies that cannot be ignored. Quantum computers are now in operation, and the Blockchain is not quantum-safe. This means that Bitcoin is vulnerable and can be destroyed. Bitcoin transactions take 40 minutes to complete. The C3 (CloudCoin Consortium) predicts this time will increase to 2 days within a few years as more accounts and more transactions are completed using Bitcoin. The C3 also predicts that the Blockchain will soon be too large to fit on most hard drives and to move around the Internet. CloudCoin has none of these problems, and will go into circulation this week.\n\nThe inventor of RAIDA – Sean H. Worthington, a tenured computer science instructor in northern California – noticed that monetary systems are actually information systems, and he applied the rules of data integrity used in databases to create a philosophical model for a perfect currency. The result was the RAIDA, CloudCoin and the C3.\n\nThe RAIDA is the first ever distributed, fault-tolerant and self-healing authentication system. It is spread out over 20 different countries in different jurisdictions, and like the fault-tolerant TCP/IP protocol that makes the Internet indestructible, the RAIDA is a permanent storage protocol that can have large parts wiped out and still provide authentication.\n\nWilliam Caput, who works as the chief security officer of a major dot com, is a member of the CloudCoin Consortium, where he oversees the operation of one RAIDA Cloud. He says that, “In traditional authentication systems, you have one username, one password, one login server and one database. You may have many databases that sync with each other. With RAIDA, each CloudCoin has over 24 Clouds of servers that all have different usernames and passwords, and they don\'t synchronize. If one RAIDA Cloud goes down - say by a nuclear bomb or a government -- others just pop up and self-repair.”\n\nThe globally-significant RAIDA technology has been given free to the CloudCoin Consortium in order to produce theoretically ""perfect"" money. The C3 is made up of 20 independent Cloud providers in 20 different countries like Russia, Switzerland, USA, UK, Taiwan and India. The C3 has implemented RAIDA and will now begin its work.\n\nFor More Information:\n\nMarketing Website: http://www.CloudCoinConsortium.com\n\nConsortium Website: http://www.CloudCoinConsortium.org Skype id of Principle: Sean.Worthington\n\nInternal Marketing: http://CloudCoin.Global Phone: (530) 591-7028\n\neMail: CloudCoin(at)protonmail(dot)com\n\nContact information for consortium members that can be interviewed available on request.']"
03/16/2017,"[""Let me be clear: I do not trade bitcoin, but I do write about it often.\n\n\n\nBefore going into journalism, I spent my days trading. I learned a lot about technical analysis during that time, and right now, technical analysis spells huge trouble ahead for the cryptocurrency.\n\nLet's recap what has been going on in the bitcoin market so far this year.\n\nBitcoin rallied 120% in 2016 and has been the top-performing currency in each of the last two years. It opened 2017 by gaining 20% in the first week before crashing 35% on news that China was going to consider clamping down on trading.\n\nSince then, bitcoin has ripped higher by more than 50% even in the face of several pieces of bad news.\n\nFirst, China's biggest bitcoin exchanges said they were going to start charging a 0.2% fee on all transactions (previously there was no fee). This was significant as nearly 100% of bitcoin's trading volume takes places on China's exchanges.\n\nThen, China's biggest exchanges said they were going to block withdrawals from trading accounts.\n\nBut bitcoin kept climbing higher.\n\n\n\nIt put in a record high of $1,327 a coin on March 10 as traders piled in ahead of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's ruling on the Winklevoss twins' bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The SEC denied the ETF. There are two more SEC rulings on the way, the next being on March 30. Neither one is expected to pass.\n\n\n\nThat ruling sent bitcoin crashing 16% lower, but again it was ultimately resilient in the face of bad news. Prices snapped back up in overnight trade and ended the following session above the previous day's opening price.\n\nAll of those ups and downs, though, have left the cryptocurrency in a precarious position. Take a look at a bitcoin chart:\n\nThe chart pattern appears to be putting in a classic double top pattern. In very simple terms, that's describing those two peaks you see highlighted above.\n\nWhat the double top does, is give us a clue to where traders will go from buying to selling bitcoin. In order for this pattern to be activated, bitcoin would have to close below the neckline, which appears near the $1,100 level.\n\nAnd while that hasn't happened yet, there is another troubling sign that's popping up on the charts.\n\nBitcoin volume exploded into the end of 2016, but has vanished in 2017. This means that as the price was going up, the drop in volume didn't support the price trend. In other words, there wasn't any conviction behind the move. It appears that the transaction fees implemented by China's biggest exchanges have caused participation to dry up.\n\nSo where is bitcoin headed?\n\nIf the cryptocurrency falls below the neckline drawn on the first chart, the charts suggest a trip to the $900 area is likely. That's $300 a coin less than it's current level, or a 25% drop."", 'With the ETF decision out of the way, the focus in the Bitcoin community has turned back to the scaling debate. While some proponents of an increase in block size are in favor of a hard fork, South African Bitcoin entrepreneur Vinny Lingham feels that this would negatively impact Bitcoin.\n\nScaling arguments\n\nThe Bitcoin network seems to be choking at the moment, with unconfirmed transactions piling up, transaction fees shooting through the roof and a general sluggishness across the network. Microtransactions have more or less ended, with high transactions fees making them unviable. Everybody agrees that there is a problem but unfortunately, consensus eludes the Bitcoin community on what the solution should be.\n\nThe Core team believes that retaining block size at 1 MB is crucial to maintaining the distributed nature of the Bitcoin network, while others advocate increasing the block size to increase the network capacity.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\n\nBitcoin Unlimited (BTU), which seeks to transfer power to decide on the block size to the miners, has emerged as a frontrunner to handle this problem.\n\nThe proportion of nodes who have “signaled support” to Bitcoin Unlimited has increased steadily to over 30 percent. It has overtaken SegWit, currently backed by the Bitcoin Core team, which has 28 percent of nodes supporting it.\n\nThe increasing support for Bitcoin Unlimited has had some unintended consequences, with a bug in the software (since rectified) resulting in a number of codes crashing and doomsday scenarios being predicted if Bitcoin Unlimited becomes successful.\n\nOnce the number of miners signaling support for Bitcoin Unlimited crosses 50 percent, it is possible for a miner to generate a block size greater than 1 MB, thereby forking Bitcoin.\n\nWhy is Vinny Lingham against a hard fork?\n\nVinny Lingham believes that Bitcoin has the potential to reach $3000, only if there is no hard fork.\n\n“Danger on the horizon. If Bitcoin forks, all bets are off and we can kiss $3k BTC in 2017 goodbye…”\n\nVinny believes that Bitcoin’s greatest asset is its brand awareness, which will get diluted if there is a hard fork.\n\nIt could lead to confusion for the common man of which Bitcoin is the real one. Merchants might avoid both BTC and BTU because of the confusion.\n\nIt could also result in rival factions dumping both versions of Bitcoin at exchanges, thereby depressing the price.\n\nVinny points out to what happened to Ethereum Classic when the Ethereum Foundation sold off their coins. Moreover, the network effect would decrease with users divided between BTC and BTU, thereby lowering the overall value of Bitcoins in circulation.\n\nWhile the block size debate has sharply polarized the Bitcoin community, working together would be the only way to ensure that Bitcoin’s value is not destroyed.', 'Next month, a venture capital firm called Blockchain Capital plans to do something that could change the way companies get funded—and perhaps even the way they operate. Instead of an Initial Public Offering, in which a company sells stock via a regulated exchange like Nasdaq, the San Francisco-based VC firm is making an Initial Coin Offering, selling its own digital token as a way of raising money for its latest venture fund. Anyone who buys a token will be buying into the fund.\n\nYes, they call it an ICO, and over the last 14 months, more than 60 startups, open source projects, and ragtag online communities used this method to raise over $250 million for their own business efforts. ""The data shows a ton of momentum at the end of the year,"" says Matt Chwierut, of Smith and Crown, a new research outfit that tracks this new phenomenon, ""and that momentum has only continued.""\n\nThis isn\'t just more blather about bitcoin as the future of currency. Yes, many of these online operations are merely trying to create digital currencies that serve as an alternative to bitcoin. The Zcash Electric Coin Company, for instance, recently offered up a currency designed to ensure that financial transactions remain private. But many others are using new internet tokens not as digital currencies per se, but as a way of building an entirely new kind of business.\n\nTake The Golem Project, which bills itself as ""AirBnb for computers."" This rather elaborate effort aims to create a system that allows anyone to buy computing power from anyone else. But the added trick is that this system will operate outside the control of any one central authority, as a kind of online co-op. Golem recently offered up a digital token that provides a share of the fees generated when services are bought and sold on its network. This token is not quite a currency. And it\'s not quite a stock. It\'s a third thing when you thought there were only two.\n\nFor now, this strange new breed of business operates outside of government oversight, and nobody is really sure how governments will regulate these kinds of sales. That\'s where Blockchain Capital comes in. Today, the firm announced that in the US, it will only offer its tokens to accredited investors, as the firm seeks to comply with US regulations. Overseas, any investor can buy the token, which will be called BCAP. The firm plans to release a detailed memorandum describing the offering on April 3, and the offering itself will likely follow after a few more weeks, through an organization based in Singapore. In Singapore, regulators do not consider this kind of digital token to be a security.\n\n""Our view is: let\'s just face regulation head on, and see if this can be done compliantly,"" says Blockchain Capital managing partner Brock Pierce. ""Once we\'ve done this, everyone is going to copy the roadmap we\'ve created.""\n\nThis method is new to the ICO world, but probably warranted. The structures to help ICOs succeed and thrive in the mainstream are still evolving—like the Argon Group, which longtime Wall Streeter Stan Miroshnik founded to help oversee ICOs. Argon will bookrun the token offering on behalf of Blockchain Capital, meaning, in this case, that it will actually issue the token. ""Our mission is to help this new capital market evolve,"" Miroshnik says.\n\nCertainly, Blockchain Capital\'s coin offering is far less extravagant than an ICO from a distributed operation like The Golem Project. And it lacks the potential to truly change the nature of business in the way such a project can. But it could at least call greater attention to the complex dynamics that an ICO can bring.\n\nICOs are a very different animal from IPOs. Operating atop a blockchain—a vast ledger for recording digital transactions, like the one that underpins bitcoin—these coins have value in and of themselves. When you buy a coin, you\'re not just buying something that represents a piece of an operation. You\'re buying an actual piece. ""It has some resemblance to how equity works,"" says Peter Van Valkenburgh, a lawyer and the director of research at the Coin Center, a crypto-finance think tank. ""But it works in a purer way."" Plus, these coins can help drive a truly decentralized operation like the Golem Project. Like many other ICO tokens, the Golem coin sits atop the Ethereum blockchain, which can run automated agreements called smart contracts. That allows the project to operate without a central authority.\n\nThe Blockchain Capital token will be somewhat similar, in that it will let individuals buy straight into an operation. The firm invests solely in, yes, companies exploring technologies related to bitcoin and the blockchain. Previously, it raised money for two traditional funds. Now, its ICO will provide part—but not all—of a third.\n\nThis ICO also means investors can readily sell their investments on a secondary market. In the US, only accredited investors can buy the coin at the beginning, but after a waiting period, they can offload their investments online, and others can buy in. ""We call this liquidity-enhanced venture capital,"" Pierce says, meaning that people can invest without locking their money up for years on end. In the long run, this kind of setup could attract more investors, and more money. Of course, as Van Valkenburgh points out, the secondary market for these coins may be subject to regulation.\n\nBecause only accredited investors can buy the coin in the US—with Blockchain Capital adhering, it says, to regulations that exempt it from registering the coins as securities with the SEC—the initial ICO won\'t reach as many investors. And the fund certainly isn\'t decentralized. Pierce and his partners will decide how to invest the money. Across the community that drives bitcoin and various other blockchain projects, the real hope is that ICOs can feed far more ambitious creations. Already ideas like Arcade City, a decentralized version of Uber, and Augur, a decentralized service for prediction markets, have raised money through ICOs. Ethereum itself was originally funded with an ICO, and similar blockchains continue to offer their own coins. The knock-on effect is enormous. A new San Francisco hedge fund called Polychain is investing solely in ICO coins.\n\nThat said, there\'s reason for caution. Blockchain watchers will remember the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a blockchained venture capital fund that got hacked to the tune of $50 million. Today\'s ICOs have even more potential than the DAO, as long as the people using them take the time to ensure they\'re on solid ground.', ""There is hardly a way the Bitcoin price won't maintain its current spot or continue on a rising trend with the prices of several major alternative digital currencies starting to reflect their respective networks’ gains as they establish in chosen areas of usefulness.\n\nA quick look at how Dash, Ethereum, Monero and maybe Augur, have performed with their prices in the last few days show that despite the attention that has shifted to these altcoins, Bitcoin’s standing does not seem to be affected at all. Rather, it maintains a strong grasp of the market and continues with its back and forth movement over or around the $1200 price range.\n\nThe altcoins’ rising prices could not go unnoticed by serious-minded investors who may be exhibiting a practical foresight into what the future could hold for the financial sector - or how cryptocurrencies could help simplify the sector’s coordination in time.\n\nA new economy\n\nThe influence Bitcoin wields over other alternative currencies - probably for its early adoption advantage or other technical reasons that I am not qualified or able to explain now - is enough to sustain its backbone role into the distant future even as its supply gets thinner while the awareness of its use spreads wider. From the Philippines to, let's say, India and back to Russia and Mexico, the struggle to lay hands on a fraction of Bitcoin continues.\n\nHowever, the intensifying scramble for bits of Bitcoin considering the rising price of acquiring a full coin is, in a sense, a major factor pushing many to look into the new economy that the totality of cryptocurrencies is creating.\n\nMany are now inching towards altcoins instead of a full Bitcoin to be a part of the new economy that is devoid of any form of restrictions and dependence on the status quo but rather afloat in a new world that has little to do with the financial arrangements we've known for years.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nStill looking away from traditional markets like the US, Europe and China which are still the largest in my view but just that the others have started squeezing out their share, a Nigerian asked me recently if I think the most populous black nation is ready for the 'Bitcoin craze'. I replied that it isn't yet. I still stand on that view.\n\nWith a population of about 200 mln people, about a tenth of Nigerians - or even less - can claim all the Bitcoins in existence from a practical view.\n\nHowever, it isn't about the money or the lack of a risk appetite to invest a huge amount into the digital currency because the country could boast of some of the most shrewd business owners the continent of Africa has ever produced. It also has a huge young population that is willing and ready to take on the world at several levels. Rather, what has been stopping them is the information gap or a lack of the good understanding of what Bitcoin is doing or could do.\n\nThe same applies to people in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa or even Rwanda where tech-savvy individuals are being developed at a faster pace in Africa. Put another way, a fraction of people in one or a combination of two or three of these countries have what it takes to achieve what is being suggested of Nigerians in terms of Bitcoin acquisition but for a similar hindering factor.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nAddressing this key factor will see the Bitcoin adoption level jump drastically among the Internet penetrated populace especially in developing countries like those in Africa. It could also lead to postulating that Bitcoin may not necessarily depend on the soon-to-be launched new use cases to be stronger or pricier.\n\nAs its high price and risk level have made it grow out of the league of favorite currencies for day traders, no new use case for Bitcoin by tomorrow does not translate that the most popular digital currency as at this writing is ever going to be irrelevant.\n\nAll it needs is the resolution of core issues such as its scalability to be sorted out once and for all."", 'As the implications of the invention of have become understood, a certain hype has sprung up around blockchain technology.\n\nThis is, perhaps, because it is so easy to imagine high-level use cases. But, the technology has also been closely examined: millions of dollars have been spent researching blockchain technology over the past few years, and numerous tests for whether or not blockchain technology is appropriate in various scenarios have been conducted.\n\nBlockchain technology offers new tools for authentication and authorization in the digital world that preclude the need for many centralized administrators. As a result, it enables the creation of new digital relationships.\n\nBy formalizing and securing new digital relationships, the blockchain revolution is posed to create the backbone of a layer of the internet for transactions and interactions of value (often called the \'Internet of Value\', as opposed to the \'Internet of Information\' which uses the client-server, accounts and master copy databases we’ve been using for over the past 20 years.)\n\nBut, with all the talk of building the digital backbone of a new transactional layer to the internet, sometimes blockchains, private cryptographic keys and cryptocurrencies are simply not the right way to go.\n\nMany groups have created flowcharts to help a person or entity decide between a blockchain or master copy, client-server database. The following factors are a distillation of much of what has been previously done:\n\nIs the data dynamic with an auditable history?\n\nPaper can be hard to counterfeit because of the complexity of physical seals or appearances. Like etching something in stone, paper documents have certain permanence.\n\nBut, if the data is in constant flux, if it is transactions occurring regularly and frequently, then paper as a medium may not be able to keep up the system of record. Manual data entry also has human limitations.\n\nSo, if the data and its history are important to the digital relationships they are helping to establish, then blockchains offer a flexible capacity by enabling many parties to write new entries into a system of record that is also held by many custodians.\n\nShould or can the data be controlled by a central authority?\n\nThere remain many reasons why a third party should be in charge of some authentications and authorizations. There are times when third-party control is totally appropriate and desirable. If privacy of the data is the most important consideration, there are ways to secure data by not even connecting it to a network.\n\nBut if existing IT infrastructure featuring accounts and log-ins is not sufficient for the security of digital identity, then the problem might be solved by blockchain technology.\n\nAs Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in his (or her) seminal work, ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"": “Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.”\n\nPrivate key cryptography enables push transactions, which don\'t require centralized systems and the elaborate accounts used to establish digital relationships. If this database requires millions of dollars to secure lightweight financial transactions, then there’s a chance blockchains are the solution.\n\nIs the speed of the transaction the most important consideration?\n\nDoes this database require high-performance millisecond transactions? (There is more on this point in our guide: ""What is the Difference Between a Blockchain and a Database?"").\n\nIf high performance, millisecond transactions are what is required, then it’s best to stick with a traditional-model centralized system. Blockchains as databases are slow and there is a cost to storing the data – the processing (or \'mining\') of every block in a chain. Centralized data systems based on the client-server model are faster and less expensive… for now.\n\nIn short, while we still don’t know the full limits and possibilities of blockchains, we can at least say the use cases which have passed inspection have all been about managing and securing digital relationships as part of a system of record.\n\nAuthored by Nolan Bauerle; images by Maria Kuznetsov', ""Two announcements from the DC Blockchain Summit came from Bloq, a pioneer in the development of enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. First, the company announced the creation of BloqLabs to boost its ongoing sponsorship while bringing support to viable open-source projects in the Bitcoin and blockchain space.\n\n\n\nSecond, Bloq revealed that it will be joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), an alliance that connects Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics and technology vendors with Ethereum thought leaders and experts. Bloq Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Garzik has been appointed to the alliance’s Technical Steering Board.\n\nIntroducing BloqLabs\n\nAccording to Garzik, BloqLabs aspires to set the tone for blockchain technology, ensuring that enterprises are embracing innovations from the community’s robust ecosystem of developers.\n\nAs such, BloqLabs will support and help to develop several key projects and platforms. The initial cohort of supported projects will include Drivechain, Qtum, VeriBlock, bitcoinj and the Android Bitcoin Wallet.\n\n“Open source is at the core of Bloq’s DNA, as both a patron and developer,” said Andreas Schildbach, developer at Bloq and the developer of the first bitcoin wallet for Android. He also maintains the bitcoinj repository primarily used in bitcoin wallets and transaction services globally. “I'm grateful for Bloq sponsoring work in open source blockchain software.”\n\nPaul Sztorc, an economist at Bloq and chief architect behind Drivechain, concurred. “The record is clear: open source is the way to go — it’s better, faster and more secure,” he said. “I’m thrilled to have Bloq sponsor the project; few companies are this generous.”\n\n“Businesses have been exploring blockchain technology for years now, but without widespread adoption,” said Patrick Dai, co-founder of the Qtum Project, another early recipient of BloqLabs’ support. “BloqLabs aligns with Qtum’s goal to bridge the gap between the business and technical worlds with open-source solutions that meet the commercial needs for privacy, security and, most importantly, usability.”\n\n“BloqLabs will serve as the platform for deeper engagement between enterprises and the open source community, just like Bell Labs and Xerox Parc did for networks and technologies we use every day,” Garzik said to Bitcoin Magazine. “We’re excited to be kicking off BloqLabs with such a diverse group of projects and established leaders in bitcoin and blockchain [technology].”\n\nJoining Forces With the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance\n\nFurther emphasizing Bloq’s commitment to broader blockchain solutions, Bloq has joined the company of Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, BNY Mellon, BG, ING, Thomson Reuters and ConsenSys, as a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Garzik has also accepted a position on the Technical Steering Board of the alliance.\n\nAnnounced on February 28, 2017, the mandate of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is to build, promote and broadly support Ethereum-based technology.\n\n“Initiatives like the EEA and BloqLabs will be critical to connecting enterprises with open source blockchain innovation,” said Garzik. “We’re thrilled to contribute our time, energy and insights to this project, and I’m honored to be appointed to the Technical Steering Board.”\n\n“Jeff [Garzik] is a legend of the open source community and has been one of the most prominent advocates for strong technical governance of public blockchains,” said Jeremy Millar, chief of staff of ConsenSys and board member of the EEA. “Combined with his experiences from the Linux Foundation, Red Hat and Bitcoin Core, Jeff is a tremendous addition to our technical leadership.”\n\nBloq delivers blockchain technology solutions for global enterprises. Its software platform enables companies to build, manage and scale solid blockchain-enabled ecosystems, all backed by enterprise-grade service and support.\n\nLed by a team of world-class blockchain developers, entrepreneurs and investors, the company utilizes open-source technology, providing key linkages for secure interoperability with prevailing business systems. Its technology targets critical business issues surrounding security, provenance, authentication and reconciliation.\n\nOver the past five months, Bloq has been in a major expansion mode, having acquired blockchain analytics pioneer Skry as well as co-launching Vulcan Digital Asset Services. The latter is a platform that gives digital assets utility for everyday banking, commerce and assets services, through PwC Australia."", 'One of the leading Indian Bitcoin exchange, Unocoin has partnered with ShapeShift to enable users exchange altcoins to INR on the platform. Read more...\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry in India is on the rise. The country’s leading Bitcoin platforms have been introducing new features on a regular basis. Unocoin, one of the “Big Four” Bitcoin platforms in the country today announced a partnership with ShapeShift. The partnership will allow Unocoin to slowly extend its reach beyond just Bitcoin and start dealing with other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nAccording to the platform, Unocoin users will now be able to convert their blockchain assets like Ethereum, Monero, ZCash, Dash and other altcoins supported by Shapeshift to Bitcoin. The converted Bitcoin can then be traded for INR using Unocoin’s existing exchange service.\n\nIn the press statement, the founder of ShapeShift Eric Voorhees describes the changing cryptocurrency ecosystem by saying,\n\n“When I was first got involved with Bitcoin in 2011, it was mostly a Western community. It’s been tremendously exciting to see Unocoin help bring this technology to India. ShapeShift is very proud to partner with them for digital asset exchange.”\n\nIn India, Bitcoin is a major cryptocurrency. Other altcoins are yet to make a mark due to various factors including the lack of domestic exchange and trading platforms that offer multi-cryptocurrency support. The inclusion of ShapeShift’s services makes Unocoin the first company to consider other cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nSunny Ray, the co-founder of Unocoin was quoted in a media report stating,\n\n“Many view Bitcoin as digital gold and we’re always looking for ways to make it easier for people to get into Bitcoin. Many people learn about Bitcoin through other cryptocurrencies, and once they do, we would like to give them an easy way to convert their blockchain assets into Bitcoin. In the meantime, we’re keeping a close eye on the open blockchain ecosystem and may or may not introduce deeper integrations in the future.”\n\nEven though the recent partnership is a welcome development, the country’s cryptocurrency ecosystem still has a long way to go before it can support multiple crypto-assets. Even the latest ShapeShift integration doesn’t do much in terms of encouraging the use of alternative assets. However, it is just the beginning, and if Unocoin does take a step towards creating its own multi-cryptocurrency exchange, then it will probably be a different story. Unocoin is currently in a position to steer the Indian cryptocurrency ecosystem towards a whole new range of cryptocurrencies, which might be good news for the people of the world’s largest democracy.\n\nRef: DNA', '', 'The District Prosecutor’s Office in ?ód?, a city in central Poland has launched an investigation into Bitcurex, the country’s first bitcoin exchange that went offline last year.\n\nBitcurex was Poland’s first and largest bitcoin exchange after commencing operations in 2012.\n\nIn October 2016, the troubled bitcoin exchange shut down its exchange operations after losing 2300 bitcoins (approx. $1.5 million at the time), citing an “external interference in automated data collection and processing of information”. Digital Future, the exchange platform’s operator, claimed to have filed a report with the ?ód? district prosecutor’s office of the losses it suffered. The notice indicated services to resume on or before November 30, 2016. The operator claimed to ink a recapitalization agreement with an investor to resume services and allow users to withdraw funds.\n\nBitcurex has not notified users with any public statements and the website, as it stands, is offline.\n\nIn an announcement this month, the prosecutor’s office has now revealed it is overseeing an investigation into the losses suffered by users.\n\nRoughly translated, the statement [PDF] from the prosecutor’s office read:\n\n“Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Lodz announces that oversees the investigation signature PO VI Ds 50.2016, given among other things the supply to the unfavorable disposition of confiscated property. So far, the number of people naturally and legally connected with the exchange Bitcurex, led by the company “Digital Future limited liability Company” limited partnership, based in Lodz, this is an act of art. 286 § 1 of the Penal Code in conjunction. Article. 294 § 1 of the Penal Code.”\n\n“Victims who have so far not reported a crime may direct such concerns to the to the District Prosecutor’s Office in Lodz – by mail,” the notice added. “ Written notices should, if possible, have attached copies of the documentation or printouts confirming the amount of damage suffered (BTC balance, confirmations of transfers in PLN or other currencies).”\n\nHaving begun operations in July 2012 with its base in ?ód?, Bitcurex faced its first notable hacking attack in March 2014 when a hacker triggered a buy order for 19,000 bitcoins through hacked PLN (Polish Zloty). Bitcurex succeeded in blocking the while halting all trading operations. Days later, Bitcurex was fully operational.\n\nBitcoin-Friendly Poland\n\nMeanwhile, the Polish government is notably taking an encouraging stance toward bitcoin and blockchain technology. A televised meeting organized by a member of the Polish parliament put the financial technologies under the spotlight to discuss their legality and regulation.\n\nAttending the meeting was Sylwester Suszek, CEO of prominent Polish bitcoin and altcoin exchange BitBay. Speaking to CCN at the time, he stated:\n\n[The meeting] shows that both sides of this dialogue (bitcoin industry and authorities) are interested in cooperation for the future of bitcoin, both on the business and the state level.\n\nFollowing the meeting, the Polish Ministry of Administration and Digitization established a working group to educate Polish citizens about cryptocurrencies. More recently, Poland’s Central Statistical Office (GUS) recognized the trading and mining of electronic currencies . Fundamentally, companies who use virtual currencies will now be able to register with the authority.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin price broke below the rising trend line support, indicating that bears may be taking the upper hand from here.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price recently broke below a short-term consolidation pattern and its rising trend line visible on the 4-hour chart.\n\nThis signals a potential reversal from the earlier uptrend as bears are able to push bitcoin price below the strong support zone.\n\nTechnical indicators are confirming a pickup in selling pressure at the moment.\n\nBitcoin price broke below the rising trend line support, indicating that bears may be taking the upper hand from here.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is still above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance might still be to the upside and this might prove to be a fakeout.

RSI is heading south as well so bitcoin price might follow suit. Once both indicators reach oversold levels, though, buyers could return and either spur a pullback or a continuation of the climb.\n\nPrice is also testing the resistance turned support level at the $1100 mark, which means that there may be a lot of buy orders located at this area.

03/17/2017,"['A newly released statement from major exchanges today may have stoked tensions in the ongoing bitcoin scaling debate – but it also revealed more about how the confrontation is becoming increasingly complex.\n\nToday, nearly 20 exchanges announced that, should a certain developer group take actions that would split the bitcoin blockchain into two competing networks, the network running software developed by Bitcoin Core would retain the ticker symbol ‘BTC’. Bitcoin Unlimited, the alternative option, would then be advertised as ‘BTU’.\n\nOstensively aimed at preventing customer confusion, the move has already been highly politicized, with some supporters of the Bitcoin Core development team heralding it as the effective end of the Unlimited project and its particular proposal for redrafting bitcoin’s rules.\n\n""Mining pools may signal Bitcoin Unlimited, but this letter makes it crystal clear that the economy won\'t accept it – the best outcome they can hope for is to have their BTU token listed,"" former BTCC COO Samson Mow alleged in a statement.\n\nHowever, to exchange officials, the move is designed not to provoke, but to be forward-thinking in how it safeguards user funds. (A key component of the messaging is that to list the alternative, the exchanges would require a guarantee that users would be protected from attacks).\n\nFurther, major exchange representatives are saying that the statement does not mean that they intend to act as decision-makers. Rather, it\'s that they’re open to having the market naturally settle the issue.\n\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk:\n\n""There should be no implication taken that anyone is committed to leaving the BTC tickers with core. At least some would assign that ticker to the longest chain.""\n\nAs noted by Powell, there remains an open argument over how to decide which of the two resulting blockchains would be the true “bitcoin”, and the role that exchanges would play in what could be a long decision-making.\n\nMiners and the economy\n\nTo observers, the debate has now evolved into one in which two communities, miners and the so-called \'bitcoin economy\' (exchanges, wallets and developers), could square off to determine the future of the network.\n\nYet that reality shows that while ethereum and ethereum classic, the most high-profile fork to date, was a divergence of two groups that wanted to go separate ways, bitcoin’s hard fork is predicated on one widely held agreement – that participants only want one bitcoin asset.\n\n“It’s my opinion that those two will eventually be the same,” Michael Perklin, chief information security officer at ShapeShift, one of the announcement\'s signatories, told CoinDesk.\n\nHe added:\n\n""Miners will hash the chain that has the economic majority. Users will choose the blockchain that has the most proof of work. Eventually one will win over the other.""\n\nBlockstream CEO Adam Back cited historical precedent for this idea, noting that during bitcoin\'s first halving (in which its rewards declined from 50 BTC to 25 BTC), some miners continued to try to elicit the former level of rewards.\n\n""Unfortunately for them the economic nodes on the network automatically rejected and hid their blocks, so they stopped and rejoined the network,"" he said.\n\nThis time, the fear is that given the ideological lines involved, the process could be prolonged.\n\nExchange representatives acknowledged that a fork could be a complex process from an operations standpoint, one in which charting and historical data would be disrupted, and costly upgrades would need to be made.\n\nEconomy first\n\nBut today’s events also mark a major challenge to the idea that miners have a natural role as decision-makers on the bitcoin blockchain, one that was original encouraged by some developers.\n\nDigging further into this idea, a notable contingent of developers believe that bitcoin’s software was designed with a smaller role for miners in mind. After all, bitcoin’s white paper envisioned that mining would take place on desktop computers, not complex data centers.\n\nThis view is perhaps best summarized by support for the so-called UASF, a recent proposal by which the \'economic majority\' would drive miners to support opt-in code changes.\n\nIf the exchanges, payment processors and nodes that participate in the bitcoin economy commit to supporting a certain version of the software, then miners will have to go along, otherwise they won’t be paid – or so the view goes.\n\n""The economic power is much greater than the mining power, and if you have the economic actors pushing a certain action, the miners are working for the economy,"" Lopp said.\n\nMow pointed to a list of companies that support one code change in question, SegWit, as evidence that miners are not supporting what users want.\n\nBitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr went on to describe the roles of the economy and the miners as not pitted against one another, but presented the current debate as a refinement of this understanding.\n\nMiners simply have a specific role to uphold, he contends.\n\n""It\'s not so much that one follows the other, but that miners are obliged to do what the economic majority decides.’ he said, concluding:\n\n“And if they don\'t, they cease to be miners.”\n\nBoxing ring via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

They face up to 20 years behind bars when sentenced in July.\n\nThe case [PDF] revolves around Coin.mx, an illegal Bitcoin exchange that masqueraded as a currency collectors club. Lebedev, his associate Anthony Murgio, his father Michael Murgio and other partners ran Coin.mx out of Florida, but claimed in bank documents to be based in New Jersey.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015 the trio set up bank accounts to process the funds raised from the Bitcoin transactions and lied to the banks about where the money was coming from by recoding the transaction records to make it look as though it was coming from credit and debit cards.\n\nThen, it seems, they decided to get into the banking business themselves and approached Pastor Gross, who ran the now defunct Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union. They gave Gross $150,000 and in exchange he appointed Lebedev and Murgio junior seats on the board of directors and let them funnel millions of dollars of transactions through the institution.\n\nThe scam worked for a while, but then Uncle Sam's financial regulators caught on – and the FBI moved in. The Murgios have already pled guilty as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. Gross and Lebedev contested the charges against them, insisting they were innocent.\n\nTheir trial jury disagreed, and on Friday found them guilty on all counts. However the case against Coin.mx isn't over yet: there is one other owner who will now be hauled into the dock.\n\nGery Shalon, an Israeli national, also owned a stake in the Bitcoin exchange and is currently facing charges [PDF] that he used customer data from the massive 2014 JP Morgan hack, in which 76 million households' and 7 million small businesses' records were snaffled.\n\nShalon is said to have used the email account data to run pump-and-dump scams, whereby worthless penny stocks are purchased, then hyped up in email campaigns to get dupes to try to get in on the action. Once the price has risen, the scam operator dumps their stock and leaves investors with worthless shares.\n\nThe US government extradited Shalon and his compatriot Ziv Orenstein from Israel last June. They face 23 charges related to the scams and Coin.mx. Their trial was put on hold by prosecutors until the Gross and Lebedev trial was concluded, but is now expected to move forward swiftly. ®"", ""Bitcoin prices fell to their lowest level in a week today, dropping to a low of $1,057 at press time.\n\nIn total, the price of bitcoin has fallen $100 since 15:00 UTC yesterday, declining steadily to its lowest point since 10th March, data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index reveals.\n\nThe news comes amid continued discussion about a bitcoin hard fork that, if executed, could result in bitcoin splitting into two separate networks with two distinct 'bitcoin' assets. Today's dialogue was propelled by major exchanges, nearly 20 of which indicated they are taking steps to prepare and safeguard user funds in the event of such a scenario.\n\nDespite the decline, however, bitcoin's price is currently in its longest period above $1,000, stability that has come even amid negative news, including continued uncertainty regarding China's regulatory situation and the rejection of a bitcoin investment vehicle last week.\n\nBitcoin's decline also comes amid a string of gains by alternative blockchain-based assets, with ethereum's token, ether, and dash hitting all-time highs in recent trading sessions.\n\nBoots in water image Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Contact us at news@coindesk.com."", 'Almost immediately after the disapproval of the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF, contrary to the predictions of most analysts, Bitcoin price recovered, surging back to $1,250. On March 16, Bitcoin price declined again to the $1,160 mark.\n\nWhile an increase in Bitcoin price is important for everyone within the network and community, in consideration of the current status of the Bitcoin network, it is optimal for Bitcoin price to remain relatively stable at the $1,160 margin.\n\nIf Bitcoin price had continued to increase in value after the initial ETF recovery to the $1,300 region and reached an all-time high price, extensive mainstream media coverage and intensive hype around Bitcoin would have led to a massive short-term increase in Bitcoin price.\n\nFor investors and traders that sustain a reserve of Bitcoin for short-term gains, the abovementioned situation would be ideal. However, the Bitcoin community is currently in the midst of addressing serious scalability issues to eliminate or at least reduce Blockchain congestion. The fee market has grown significantly over the past few months and the average fee per transaction has been on the rise.\n\nIn fact, Coinbase announced that it will not be handling Bitcoin transaction fees for users anymore for that reason. Ankur Nandwani, the product manager at Coinbase, stated:\n\n“We will discontinue paying network transaction fees for on-chain transactions starting March 21st, 2017. Network transaction fees do not go to Coinbase, they go to the miners of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. Since our inception, we have been paying network fees on behalf of our customers to help support the growth of the bitcoin and ethereum networks. We now have over 6 million users worldwide, and this has become a significant cost.”\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin lacks off-chain scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network which enable microtransactions and open Bitcoin to a new generation of applications. With off-chain solutions, platforms and applications will be able to make extremely cheap, fast and secure transactions with ease, which allows the introduction of a wider range of Bitcoin-based services.\n\nThe majority of the community is beginning to favor Segregated Witness (SegWit) over Bitcoin Unlimited because of the internal bugs found in the software of Bitcoin Unlimited. The errors of Bitcoin Unlimited led to a 6-hour downtime for miners and shut down 500 nodes almost instantly. According to security and Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos, the recent Bitcoin Unlimited bug would have led to millions of dollars in losses if it was being forked.\n\nAntonopoulos wrote:\n\n“This time there was little economic impact. During a fork, the damage would have been in the millions. QA matters. It matters millions.”\n\nWhile developers, miners and community members are building consensus on which software and solution to adopt in order to scale the Bitcoin network properly, cautiously and efficiently, it is for the best interest of the Bitcoin community as a whole that Bitcoin price maintains stable at the $1,160 region. It relieves pressure on the network and it grants a larger time period for the community and the market to decide upon the viable solution.', ""Legislative uncertainty in both China and Europe is weighing hard on the Bitcoin price, with around 10 percent lost in the past 24 hours.\n\nNews is expected imminently of how Chinese authorities will go about regulating Bitcoin and its trading in the country, which historically has exerted considerable influence on the price of a coin.\n\nFollowing preliminary statements and feedback from People’s Bank of China Director Zhou Xuedong last week, markets are expecting a mixed bag of supervision and a “forgiving attitude” towards exchanges.\n\nHowever, Xuedong states certain “red lines” should remain uncrossed in terms of what services exchanges can offer.\n\nIt is likely that full identification procedures will also need to be introduced and complied with, MarketWatch reports on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, the European Union’s long-awaited virtual currency legislation has received final amendments prior to its assumed compliance deadline in June.\n\nHaving spent almost two years at the deliberation and consultation stage, the controversial Directive (EU) 2015/849 could require owners of any virtual currency wallet to link their identity to it.\n\nSpecifically, reference is made to “registering users' identities and wallet addresses accessible to FIUs, as well as self-declaration forms for the use of virtual currency users.”\n\n“Competent authorities should be able to monitor the use of virtual currencies in order to identify suspicious activities,” European Parliament states in an update."", 'When it comes to generating buzz, it’s hard to beat blockchain.\n\nWhile many of us think of payment applications and cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin), the reality is that there’s more to blockchain.\n\nBlockchain has business potential beyond just providing new types of currencies. While payment is a big part of it, there are also applications like smart contracts and intellectual property protection.\n\nAnd it’s not just the fringe interested in applications these days. Mainstream companies are increasingly interested in blockchain and its potential.\n\nPartnerships with Blockchain Companies\n\nOne of the interesting developments at CES a couple months ago was the continued investment by mainstream companies in fintech.\n\nHowever, there was also interest in blockchain developments at CES. Mainstream companies are taking notice of what’s out there. On top of that, the growing consumer interested in blockchain provides opportunities. Forward-thinking companies want to be on the ground floor.\n\nOne of the most interesting partnerships moving forward with a mainstream company is the way Samsung SDS is partnering with Blocko to add blockchain capability to the Samsung Card.\n\nSamsung and Blocko Join Forces\n\nMany corporations offer credit cards. It’s a way to encourage loyalty and it can be another revenue stream. Samsung is no different. Samsung SDS offers the Samsung branded credit card.\n\nWhat is a little new is the idea of adding blockchain technology to credit cards. According to ZDNet, Samsung SDS is looking for help developing more payment options. Plus, digital identity is a big part of blockchain as well.\n\nThe idea is to allow consumers to use credit cards to engage in secure transactions. The Samsung deal is aimed at creating new businesses using digital identity, digital money, and digital payment.\n\nNot only that, but Blocko and Samsung SDS also plan to look for opportunities to bring blockchain technology to the financial markets.\n\nAdding Blockchain Technology to Mainstream Payment Options\n\nThe idea is to secure transactions with blockchain technology.\n\nIt’s not just about using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Although these cryptocurrencies are increasingly popular.\n\nIn fact, companies experimenting with blockchain payments aren’t doing it with alternative currencies. Instead, they are using the technology to secure transactions as much as possible. They are using blockchain technology with traditional currencies — dollars and euros and the like.\n\nLast year, payment processing giant Visa started testing an interbank payment system that involves blockchain.\n\nAdding blockchain to credit cards and interbank transfers could be a big step toward securing the system and moving toward a frictionless system. Visa’s interbank transfer experiment was meant to help banks send money to each other easier.\n\nBut it can also be used for person-to-person transactions. Blockchain makes use of a shared digital database that records and verifies electronic transactions. It takes place without a central ledger, instead relying on a network of computers. You could send money easily to someone else using this technology.\n\nCryptography is a big part of the blockchain ecosystem in order to prevent fraud and protect users and consumers from hackers.\n\nAdding blockchain capability to credit cards and debit cards could be an even bigger deal.\n\nBitcoin Debit Cards?\n\nFor now, mainstream investments in blockchain technology are mostly about securing transactions and verifying identities.\n\nBut what if cryptocurrencies became part of our plastic money landscape? There are Bitcoin debit cards, but they don’t allow you to spend Bitcoin directly.\n\nInstead, you store a balance on the card and then can access that balance to make more traditional transactions. You can get cash from an ATM or swipe the card at any store that takes the card. You can even use other cryptocurrencies, like DASH, if they are compatible with the card.\n\nWhen you make transactions, your cryptocurrency balance is accessed, and the necessary amount is changed into more traditional currency so you can spend it.\n\nBlockchain debit cards are designed to help you bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and a world where they aren’t fully accepted.\n\nAdding a credit card component might be interesting. Imagine if you could borrow in cryptocurrencies to complete transactions and then repay when you receive your payment in turn.\n\nPlus, there might come a time when cryptocurrencies are more widely accepted and you won’t have to choose a card that converts your Bitcoin into traditional currency.\n\nSmart Contracts and Payment Settlement with Blockchain\n\nEven if mainstream companies aren’t quite on board with the idea of using cryptocurrencies, they do like blockchain technology.\n\nMasterCard has been developing blockchain APIs. These APIs focus on smart contracts and payment settlement.\n\nThis is where blockchain can really shine when it comes to business applications. However, these uses for blockchain don’t get a lot of play.\n\nThe way blockchain is set up, it’s possible to create smart contracts that make it easier to verify the terms of an agreement are met. The public, decentralized ledger helps. But so does the fact that certain actions have to be taken to verify the transaction.\n\nSmart contracts are a way to further secure agreements.\n\nPayment settlement using blockchain technology also makes a lot of sense. It can be accomplished quickly, and almost without friction. This is one of the reasons Visa is testing out interbank transfers.\n\nEscrow accounts could be managed in completely different ways with the help of blockchain technology. Plus, when it comes to business payments around the world, you can skip the problems that come with the exchange rate. Businesses could change the way they do things globally.\n\nA lot of the applications so far are business to business. However, consumer-driven blockchain solutions are also possible in the future.\n\nConsumer Applications for Blockchain Technology\n\nIt’s not just about smart contracts and payment settlement for business. There are plenty of consumer applications as well.\n\nImagine being able to complete mortgage paperwork without the need for an in-person signing. With blockchain technology and intelligent signatures, it might be possible. You could close your home sale from across the country. No need to fly back. No need to sign documents and then overnight them (which can get expensive).\n\nLast time I signed major legal documents, I needed to be in the presence of a person. They had to verify my identity. It involved appointments and bringing in my ID, and a bit of hassle.\n\nWith blockchain technology, though, some of that hassle could be eliminated. I found it interesting that the Blocko/Samsung SDS deal also focuses on digital identity applications. Digital identity through intelligent signature means a whole new way of conducting personal busines.\n\nYou could sign mortgage papers, divorce papers, or get a marriage license squared away digitally. No need to schlep down to an office somewhere.\n\nThere are other consumer applications as well.\n\nImagine using blockchain technology for smarter coupons. You could more easily transfer money to friends and family. It’s nice, too, that in many cases these transactions come with lower fees.\n\nSavings and simplicity with blockchain technology.\n\nBottom Line: Blockchain Can’t Be Just about Cryptocurrencies\n\nBlockchain technology isn’t mainstream — yet.\n\nIt’s getting there, though.\n\nMajor payment processors and other corporations are interested in the possibilities.\n\nAnd this type of investment in blockchain technology is what is most likely to bring it into the consumer mainstream. But it only happens if we stop viewing blockchain as the exclusive domain of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt’s true that cryptocurrencies are gaining wider acceptance, and it’s even possible to do some of your shopping online and offline using tools like Bitcoin, DASH, and Bitpay.\n\nHowever, blockchain adoption isn’t just about cryptocurrencies. It’s about a technology that offers a number of options for security and accessibility.\n\nYou don’t need to start mining Bitcoin or accept payment using DASH in order to benefit from blockchain technology.\n\nWith the investments made right now by big companies, we could see more applications down the road.\n\nAnd many of them might be aimed directly at consumers.\n\nThis article was originally published on Due.com.', 'NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday rejected an application for a bitcoin-based exchange-traded-fund, suggesting that the digital currency has far to go before it wins approval as a traded investment on a public securities market, according to the SEC’s ruling on the case and industry sources.\n\nThe SEC’s 38-page ruling (here) listed significant barriers to the approval of trading in bitcoin securities, given a lack of safeguards in the market to prevent fraud and manipulation. While the agency left open the possibility that it could approve a bitcoin fund in the future, the digital currency is at “relatively early stages of its development” to consider turning the digital currency into tradeable shares, the SEC said.\n\nThe proposal to approve a Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust would have created a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund offering investors the first chance to acquire shares and trade shares based on a basket made up entirely of bitcoin holdings. Created as an alternative to government currencies, bitcoin are heavily encrypted certificates bought and sold on private exchanges that list daily price fluctuations.\n\nBITCOIN COULD WIN ADOPTION “OVER TIME”\n\nThe approval would have been a boon to the digital currency, said its backers, who saw it creating the potential to turn bitcoin into a liquid, highly visible marketplace for the digital currency. The approval would have helped legitimize its use in commercial applications so far hampered by frequent shutdowns and trading irregularities on existing unregulated bitcoin exchanges.\n\nThe SEC ruled that the proposed bitcoin ETF would not satisfy the Exchange Act requirement that securities have a “surveillance-sharing agreement with a significant, regulated, bitcoin-related market.” The conditions could potentially be met over time, the agency said, but first the regulator wants to see “regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size.”\n\nThe application drew significant support in the bitcoin industry as its backers argued that SEC approval would have spurred an influx of mainstream investors and lead to greater oversight. The SEC’s response that it could not allow trading in what it saw as an unregulated commodity could doom other pending bitcoin proposals. Bitcoin fell sharply on private markets globally after the application failed.\n\nSEC DIFFERS FROM BANK REGULATOR\n\nThe SEC knocked down Winklevoss’s contention that New York state already regulates its bitcoin exchange. The New York Department of Financial Services gave a charter to the Winkelvoss operating company, Gemini Trust Co, to run its bitcoin market, Gemini Exchange, last year. The state charter allowed it to handle banking-related operations such as handling payments and processing bitcoin transfers.\n\nBut the SEC instead ruled that the bitcoin fund must meet a higher standard to create an exchange-traded security, along the lines of those required of ETFs created from commodities such as gold and other precious metals, which are monitored by various exchanges and regulatory authorities. The SEC holds statutory power to approve the sale of securities or to operate a securities market.\n\nUNIQUE PROBLEMS FOR WINKLEVOSS PLAN\n\nTo be sure, the Winklevoss proposal faced objections unique to their own proposal, most notably a potential conflict of interest their bitcoin securities operation pose, which might not be true with other potential ETF sponsors seeking SEC approval. As the largest known owner of bitcoin, the twins, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, would be in position to benefit from their role operating an exchange traded fund, putting it in a different from their investors.\n\nTheir marketplace could favor the fund’s own transactions in handling bitcoin redemptions or transactions to stay in operation, the SEC said. ""It may not be possible to entirely eliminate these conflicts of interest,"" said the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF prospectus, a 129-page document (here) with a voluminous list of risk disclosures, including their own lack of experience in running investment funds and their uncertain relations with regulators and bitcoin miners, who create certificates, and competing exchanges.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins vowed to continue their effort to create a public trading venue for bitcoin. The flat rejection by the SEC, however, suggested there are basic flaws that will not be easily overcome by a simple resubmission.\n\nThe Winkleboss twins said, ”We agree with the SEC that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors.” In their plan, they advocated a “pure play” bitcoin fund based entirely on the value of a basket of bitcoin. They said that many of the problems that have surfaced in bitcoin exchanges would disappear if their plan was approved. The newly legitimized bitcoin operation would trigger a flood of liquidity into the marketplace, they said. The price of bitcoin had surged in anticipation their plan might win approval.\n\n“BACK DOOR” APPROVAL OF BITCOIN CLOSED\n\nBut the SEC action suggests that bitcoin-based ETFs that take such a “back door” approach to creating a marketplace are likely to meet the same response. The Winklevoss proposal asserted that its own efforts to provide transparency and oversight, along with the self-policing of the blockchain consortium that certifies the digital signatures, could provide security and integrity to the market and protect the fund’s investors. They argued that they would use their position as the largest known holder of the digital currency to influence bitcoin market compliance.\n\nThe SEC pointed out, however, that the Winklevoss group accounts for barely one percent of the global bitcoin market. The rest of bitcoin is spread over multiple exchanges spread around the world, and is thinly traded, illiquid and anonymous. Many bitcoin promoters have backed efforts at regulating the digital currency to broaden its appeal, but other factions prefer that it remain untraceable and unregulatable.\n\nBITCOIN STILL SHADOWED BY SHADY PAST\n\nFor the foreseeable future, the SEC ruling suggests, the digital currency is likely to encounter regulatory skepticism in efforts to transform the secretive currency once used to fund drug deals and other illicit activities into a Main Street investment product, industry figures said.\n\nThe SEC cited the potential for abuses. Andreas Antonopoulos, a widely followed academic and bitcoin industry consultant on regulation, said the SEC decision shows it has not close to overcoming regulators’ concerns.\n\n“The ETF was denied because bitcoin can\'t be regulated, can\'t be surveilled. Feature, not bug,” he tweeted on Friday (here).\n\n(Richard Satran is a financial journalist covering daily and emerging issues for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.)', 'Indian bitcoin exchange Unocoin has announced a partnership with Shapeshift to enable users to convert altcoins, deemed as ‘blockchain assets’, into bitcoin.\n\nMore specifically, Unocoin will make use of Shapeshift’s API, allowing the following cryptocurrencies to be converted to bitcoin through Shapeshift. Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, Lisk and Factom are among the altcoins listed on Unocoin presently. While Unocoin’s announcement also lists Zcash and Dash among the altcoins for bitcoin swaps, the website does not show support for the cryptocurrencies at the time of publishing.\n\nUnocoin’s users will also be able to change altcoins into Indian fiat rupees (INR), through bitcoin., in what is seen as a first in India.\n\n“When I first got involved in Bitcoin in 2011, it was mostly a Western community. It’s been tremendously exciting to see Unocoin help bring this technology into India,” stated Shapeshift founder and notable bitcoin evangelist Erik Voorhees.\n\nIndians’ interest in bitcoin is on the rise, particularly after November’s demonetization drive which plunged the country into cash chaos. There is a surge in Indian bitcoin adopters with exchanges witnessing record trading volumes. India also witnessed all-time high levels of peer-to-peer trading via LocalBitcoins in the aftermath of the demonetization run.\n\nCalling itself India’s leading bitcoin exchange, Unocoin confirms that interest in altcoins among Indians isn’t very high with the distinct lack of options to convert them into bitcoin or fiat cash. It hopes to spur investors’ and users’ adoption of altcoins with its new integration with Shapeshift, altogether contributing to a thriving cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nSunny Ray, co-founder and president of Unocoin stated:\n\nMany view bitcoin as digital gold and we’re always looking for ways to make it easier for people to get into bitcoin. Many people learn about bitcoin through other crypto currencies and once they do, we’d like to give them an easy way to convert their blockchain assets into bitcoin.\n\nThe executive also added that Unocoin “may or may not introduce deeper integrations in the future” hinting that the bitcoin exchange is likely to stick to focusing on the trading of bitcoin for the foreseeable future. The newly released Altcoin-to-Bitcoin feature is entirely powered by Shapeshift, through the latter’s APi.\n\nUnocoin’s biggest in-house development so far has been its own API, enabling individuals or companies to generate bitcoin wallets to transact with the cryptocurrency and merchants to accept bitcoin in the country. The release of its API followed soon after the bitcoin startup raised $1.5 million in Series A funding round, a record investment for a bitcoin company in the country.\n\nImage from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'With the recent surge in the price of ether, institutional investors have started taking a greater interest in the cryptocurrency, OTC trading experts have told CoinDesk.\n\nEther, the token that powers the smart contract-focused blockchain platform ethereum, has seen its price climb roughly 150% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap, reaching above $40 in a historic first for the asset.\n\nIn response, analysts have offered varying explanations when explaining this sharp price increase, with some pointing to an overall rally in digital currencies and others asserting that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is encountering noticeable tailwinds as a result of bitcoin’s recent struggles.\n\nMartin Garcia, vice president for Genesis Global Trading, weighed in on how ether\'s sharp rally has helped spark the interest of institutions.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""As the market cap has increased in recent weeks, we\'ve finally started to see institutional investor interest pick up in ethereum, something we hadn\'t really seen before.""\n\nGarcia noted that price action has occurred on both sides of the trade, with some investors seeking to short the fast-moving market as well.\n\nYet, Garcia was not alone in expressing this sentiment.\n\nHarry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, offered similar input, stating that his firm, which places large trades for both high net-worth individuals and institutions, has been trading ether ""quite a bit"".\n\nThe cryptocurrency has proved to be quite popular as of late, he told CoinDesk.\n\n""We do get a lot of calls for ethereum now.

He has led a 15-person blockchain team that successfully secured several global projects in the blockchain domain. He also developed prototypes of commercial use cases in healthcare and government, among other industries.\n\nIn 2016, building upon his Deloitte stint, which opened him to the enterprise world, he co-founded Nuco, a Toronto-based infrastructure solutions provider specializing in the development and deployment of custom blockchain networks. Nuco’s platform allows enterprise clients to seamlessly set up private blockchains tailored to their specific use case and business requirements, while having the choice between multiple consensus mechanisms, performance optimization tools and legacy integrations.\n\nThe company’s modular architecture allows for infrastructure customization to enable use cases across a wide range of industries. Nuco’s value proposition includes digitally signed identities, advanced cybersecurity, enforced consensus, automated audit trails, asset tokenization and immutable records management.\n\n“Nuco’s potential impact is in overhauling traditional processes, which are based on the conventional wisdom of ‘trusted 3rd party’ reliance,” said Spoke. “We aim to bring the improvements of blockchain technology to the domains that stand to gain most from its introduction, namely: problems that cannot be efficiently addressed by any other means.”\n\nReaching Out to the Unbanked Market\n\nThe company, he says, is particularly stoked about solving issues facing billions of people worldwide who currently fall in the “unbanked” category.\n\n“Our focus on the unbanked is something we are increasingly experimenting with. It boils down to figuring out how to extend bank infrastructural capability to people who are outside of the traditional space. It also involves making it affordable for financial institutions to increase their reach utilizing digital infrastructure.”\n\nSpoke says that the basic premise involves opening up basic financial access in the forms of lending, credit and mortgages off of blockchain systems, essentially automating the process. He points out that one of the biggest expenses in addition to brick-and-mortar infrastructure is staff onboarding to review the applications of the clients. A key factor is the extent to which it can be automated and made autonomously intelligent in a blockchain smart contract for things like lending applications.\n\nSpoke says that he and his team are also looking to establish a footprint with modern energy grids in a way that will bring about new levels of efficiency by autonomously trading electricity amongst all of its users in real time.\n\nBlockchain as a Tool for Transparency\n\nSpoke also believes that from a regulatory perspective, blockchain technology will offer better tools for regulators to more effectively do their jobs because of access to real-time information. He also sees it as a way to counter corruption.\n\n“We’re going to prove that there is a right way to track information and transactions to create immutable records of truth. And once we get there, there won’t be any going backward because a new standard of proof will have been established — one that will permeate through every digital system moving forward.”\n\nSpoke believes that blockchain technology’s ability to achieve consensus among interacting parties without utilizing a centralized authority model is a particularly big breakthrough, with far-reaching implications in a multitude of domains.\n\nHe credits his team of advisors, which includes Ethereum mastermind Vitalik Buterin and blockchain thought leader Alex Tapscott, as pivotal to Nuco remaining on track relative to its progression in this space.\n\n“Vitalik of course has led the efforts to shape the Ethereum for Enterprise ecosystem. His knowledge of our product roadmap helps The Ethereum Foundation to collaborate and deliver on enterprise-centric features that will benefit Nuco’s platform and offerings. It also enables us to leverage on Ethereum’s vast user and developer base.\n\n“And Alex, as a globally recognized thought leader on blockchain tech and the co-author of the bestselling book ‘Blockchain Revolution,’ has been great about raising awareness on blockchain [technology] and Nuco, thus expanding our global exposure.”\n\nIn terms of emerging trends for the enterprise blockchain space over the next 12 to 18 months, Spoke cited three:\n\n1. The development of dApps (decentralized applications) on public networks.\n\n2. Increased investments and implementations within the blockchain space, with many companies building prototypes and proof-of-concepts (POCs) to integrate with existing legacy systems.\n\n3. The shaping of open standards focused on legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nSpoke said that while markets are generally in agreement on blockchain technology playing a major enterprise-related role in the years ahead, technology has just come out of its inception stage.\n\n“We are starting to witness the first hints of solutions getting closer to production. Seeing some traditional companies convert their status quo business models onto a blockchain system is going to be a step forward. I believe that we’ll see more and more of this as 2017 progresses.”']"
03/18/2017,"[""Just two days after Gyft founder and Civic CEO Vinny Lingham’s warning about a Bitcoin hard fork devastating bitcoin’s value, 21 different Bitcoin exchanges have clarified their position on Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) trading. The exchange coalition stated in a hard fork contingency plan that they will trade any BU cryptocurrency as an altcoin alongside bitcoin, thwarting any plan for BU to replace Bitcoin.\n\nIn software engineering, a fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community.\n\nThe development of Bitcoin Unlimited required forking Bitcoin's code. Once the fork is released, there will be two separate blockchains, even though they contain identical transaction histories. The BU developers hope that BU will quickly acquire all of the miners that are currently mining the existing, 'Bitcoin Core' blockchain. If it were to do so, the latter would then be unable to secure its network, and therefore the original Bitcoin would quickly cease to be of value. If instead, only some of the current miners left to start mining BU's blockchain, two coins could exist side by side. This is what happened in June when Ethereum forked, resulting in two competing cryptocurrencies. This is also the fate that Lingham said Bitcoin must avoid at all cost.\n\n- Statement on Potential Bitcoin Hardfork Event\n\nThe first of three announcements on Friday was sent to the media as well as posted on the Bitfinex website. It contained signatures of some of the biggest exchanges by trading volume, including Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC China, Bitsquare, Bittrex, Coinfloor, itBit, Kraken, ShapeShift, Zaif, and nine others.\n\nThe announcement states that the exchanges are collectively faced with addressing the very real possibility that a Bitcoin network split may occur in the future, and that bitcoin miners have a right to choose an alternative implementation of Bitcoin. “We do this not out of judgement or philosophical reasons but rather for practical and operational considerations,” the group declared.\n\n“As exchanges, we have a responsibility to maintain orderly markets that trade continuously 24/7/365,” the announcement reads. “We cannot suspend operations and wait for a winner to emerge [...] Due to operational requirements alone we are compelled to label an incompatible fork as a new asset.”\n\nHowever, when a fork of this nature happens, there is a danger of coins from one blockchain being spent on the other coins' blockchain, known as a “replay attack.” The exchanges have agreed to not list BTU until this threat has been addressed.\n\n- Statement on Potential Bitcoin Hardfork Event\n\nA second announcement on Friday came from Poloniex, which has yet to decide if they will be listing BTU coins. The exchange reiterated many of the same points raise in the first announcement. “We will support Bitcoin Core continuously as BTC,” the exchange states, adding the same stipulation about replay attacks. “Poloniex agrees that any contentious hard fork must include replay attack protection. Without this, exchanges cannot continuously and properly operate.”\n\nA few hours later, the co-founder and CTO of international Bitcoin exchange BitMex, Samuel Reed, issued the final statement of the day. “As proposed in the multi-exchange hard-fork contingency plan, there is significant doubt that a BU hard fork could be done safely without additional development work,” states Reed. “In the case of a fork, we support the plan as proposed by Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTCC et al.”\n\nReed further added that “it will not be possible for any exchange, including BitMEX, to support both chains separately.” The exchange will not even consider listing the coin until the replay attack protection is in place and BU is not “at risk of a blockchain reorganization if the Core chain becomes longer.”\n\nThe news rattled traders, sending Bitcoin’s price dropping sharply throughout the day, from a high of $1160 to a low of $1052. However, the solidarity of so many exchanges on the issue has calmed a lot of the Bitcoin community, while enraging others.\n\nJihan Wu, the co-founder of Bitmain, the largest Bitcoin ASIC chip manufacturer and mining pool operator in the world, is a known BU supporter. Wu recently switched over 75 percent of his mining pool's power to support BU. Since the exchange’s contingency plan was announced, Wu has referred to the exchanges as “not world class level.” Meanwhile, BitGo engineer and Bitcoin Core developer Jameson Lopp tweeted, “It appears that BU devs have no intention of adding replay protection - their plan is to kill the Core chain instead.”"", ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium. His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", ""Slush, CEO & IT Architect of SatoshiLabs, the parent company of Bitcoin hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor, believes that without Segregated Witness (SegWit), Bitcoin will be like gold - just as bad, inefficient and limited in functionality.\n\nSegWit was originally released in Bitcoin Core v0.13.1 on Oct. 27, 2016, as a scalability solution. It was designed to maximize block size and reduce Blockchain congestion in order to handle a larger volume of transactions.\n\nIn the past, developers such as Lightning co-author Thaddeus Dryja noted that SegWit is an actual block size increase solution, contrary to the claims of most Bitcoin Unlimited and hard fork supporters. During his personal tests, Dryja discovered that SegWit could handle 3.7 MB blocks, a size significantly larger than that of the current Bitcoin block size.\n\nDryja wrote:\n\n“The new software doesn't touch non-witness blocks. The blocks are bigger. I have a script that will spam testnet and make 3.7MB blocks. It's not a 800KB regular block with txids and output scripts, and a 2.9MB witness block with just a bunch of signatures. It's a single block, that looks pretty much the same as old blocks with a few extra requirements, that's 3.7MB.”\n\nHowever, criticisms continued to emerge on SegWit as a scalability solution as it fails to provide an immediate and fixed expansion of the Bitcoin Blockchain. In other words, community members are skeptical toward SegWit because there exists no guarantee that SegWit will provide a 3.7x increase in block size.\n\nDoor to off-chain scaling\n\nAs SegWit support started to increase, the community began to emphasize SegWit’s ability to introduce two-layer solutions into Bitcoin by eliminating transaction malleability. Most notably, SegWit enables Lightning, a solution which allows the facilitation of micropayments. The community began to realize that off-chain scaling solutions such as Lightning and TumbleBit can address additional scalability issues on top of SegWit’s optimization of on-chain transactions.\n\nSlush further noted that Bitcoin is more like gold without the presence of SegWit, as it limits the functionalities of the Bitcoin network. It can’t operate as an efficient settlement network and transaction facilitation system without proper on-chain and off-chain scaling technologies.\n\nWhile expanding the Bitcoin block size is important to reduce transaction delays, Slush explained that it is equally important to activate SegWit to introduce a new generation of applications and solutions.\n\nSlush stated:\n\n“Bitcoin as Gold is Bitcoin without Segwit. Just activate it and whole world of new applications and solutions will appear.”\n\nCurrently, the support rate or SegWit is nearly identical to Bitcoin Unlimited to the point wherein Bitcoin exchanges had to release a collaborative statement on the potential Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork execution. In the event of a hard fork, Bitcoin exchanges including Bitfinex, Bitstamp and BTCC announced that Bitcoin Unlimited will be considered as an alt-asset, not as Bitcoin."", 'Days after the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was roundly rejected by regulators, this much is certain: digital currency investors remain in waiting for the asset\'s proper Wall Street debut.\n\nBut, how long exactly might this be? And will bitcoin ever see mainstream market acceptance? Those are just some of the lingering questions that the tech\'s avid supporters, and industry analysts, are now left with.\n\nHowever, a consensus on sentiment is starting to emerge.\n\nIn the aftermath of the SEC\'s decision, many in the industry are asserting that the rejection was more than just an indictment of the particular proposal. Rather, they argue it was a clear message that further maturation of bitcoin markets is needed before such a product can be offered to retail investors.\n\nBlake Estes, an attorney with Alston & Bird, argued that those seeking to launch similar financial projects aimed at retail investors will likely be destined for the same fate as the Winklevoss proposal.\n\nHe said:\n\n""It is clear that the SEC believes that the bitcoin markets do not currently have the structural protections and controls necessary to support an ETF product.""\n\nEstes focused on the SEC\'s emphasis on ""fundamental deficiencies"" in the bitcoin markets, arguing any proposed investment vehicle will likely see a drawn-out approval process and rejection.\n\n""I don’t see what would change in the underlying bitcoin markets so significantly in the next six to 12 months that would allow the SEC to get comfortable,"" he said.\n\nStrong critiques\n\nAs the SEC\'s mandate is to ensure that investors are protected, observers emphasize that more work must now be put into building investor and consumer protections in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nMark T Williams, a professor at Boston University’s business school and former bank examiner at the Federal Reserve, used the rejection to highlight his long-held criticisms of the market surrounding cryptocurrencies generally.\n\n""This detailed SEC ruling makes it clear that more focus has to be placed on needed protections to stabilize and add basic controls over the bitcoin infrastructure before it will be investor-safe and ready for public consumption,"" he said.\n\nHe went on to add that a premature approval of an investment vehicle without such protections would likely undermine the long-term prospects of such currencies and innovations in blockchain technology.\n\nWilliams said:\n\n""I was a little surprised that so many market pundits assumed that the SEC would simply approve this bitcoin ETF and ignore concerns about price discovery, lack of regulation, operational standards and controls that increase price manipulation, fraud and cyber risk.”\n\nEstes agreed, arguing that the reasons for disapproval were due to deficiencies in underlying markets – and the fear of worst-case scenarios.\n\n""The SEC’s nightmare scenario is they approve this, all this retirement money floods in and then there’s another enormous headline-grabbing hack where millions of bitcoins are stolen or something happens in one of the Chinese markets,"" he said.\n\nGoing solo\n\nStill, given the swift rebound in bitcoin’s price following Friday’s announcement, another question being weighed is how much Wall Street approval ultimately matters to bitcoin’s legitimacy.\n\n""I think bitcoin [will never get] accepted by financial regulators in any major way, and the reason why is that it\'s fundamentally against sovereignty,"" said Josh Crumb, co-founder of GoldMoney and a former commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs.\n\nCrumb added:\n\n""Bitcoin’s utility is that it cuts through sovereignty. It’s its own law.""\n\nMati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, voiced a similar sentiment, stating his belief that cryptocurrencies don\'t need SEC approval to gain legitimacy.\n\n""Although bitcoin was volatile around the time of the announcement, the bounce back in price shows increasing confidence in the asset,"" he said.\n\nNonetheless, observers reckon that successful operation of these vehicles could potentially be a bridge toward bitcoin being packaged more broadly for the public.\n\nTimes Square image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'Not much has changed with respect to the fundamentals of the bitcoins over the last three years. | Photo Credit: Reuters\n\n“Bitcoin value hits a life-time high,”; “bitcoins are now more expensive than gold,”; “Winklevoss twins make a bid for an exchange traded fund based on bitcoin.” Headlines such as these are making everyone sit up and take notice of the virtual currency that had faded into oblivion two years ago.\n\nSimilar frenzy and excitement had prevailed in 2013 and 2014, followed by revelation of a series of scams and nefarious activities involving these currencies. Value of bitcoins had then crashed; bitcoin exchanges closed down and investors had forgotten about them.\n\nNot much has changed with respect to the fundamentals of the bitcoins over the last three years. They still remain highly unsuitable, both as medium of exchange and store of value.\n\nWhile bitcoin usage could increase in the years ahead, they carry multiple risks that investors need to be aware of.\n\nBitcoin basics\n\nFor those who joined the party late, bitcoins are virtual currencies created in 2008 by an anonymous person calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto. He created a system wherein these currencies could be created (mined) by those who could solve some complex algorithmic equations. Every bitcoin transaction is recorded and verified in an open ledger called block-chains, thus preventing counterfeiting or double spending.\n\nUsing bitcoins is simple, if you are tech savvy. You have to first acquire a bitcoin wallet through one of the sites buying and selling bitcoins. Then you have to transfer funds from your bank to the wallet which can then be used to buy bitcoins. The bitcoins can be stored in the wallets, on your desk-top or mobile, or in the cloud until put to use.\n\nBitcoins can be used to buy products and services from various websites including Microsoft and Dell. Many gift cards can be purchased with bitcoins that can, in turn, be used on online retail stores such as Amazon, Walmart and Target.\n\nSo far so good. But if you thought that bitcoin is a substitute for your normal currency, think again.\n\nFaulty price discovery\n\nBitcoin prices are discovered through exchanges that are unregulated with very lax KYC compliance process. Wash trades, front-running and trading with insufficient funds is said to be common in many of these exchanges.\n\nAccording to the website bitcoincharts.com, Japanese exchange, coincheck, clocked the highest volume in the last 30 days and accounted for 25 per cent of global bitcoin transactions. kraken exchange that operates in Canadan EU, Japan and the US and okcoin that is based in China are next in the list of top exchanges by transaction volume. The largest US bitcoin exchange, bitstamp, accounted for just 14 per cent of global volume.\n\nIn other words, the value of bitcoin is determined largely by unregulated pools of investors.\n\nRe-think If you want to buy one bitcoin, you have to pay ?75,820\n\nLack of regulation\n\nThe speed of money transfer and the lower cost of transaction in bitcoins are mainly because there is no supervising authority. But with no overseeing authority, instances of price manipulation is common. There is no central authority giving the rights to set up or trade on the bitcoin exchanges either. Regulators, including the Reserve Bank of India, have issued cautionary notices to users, highlighting the risks they take in dealing with these currencies. This causes a problem for bitcoin users too. If the user suffers a loss due to an exchange or the dealer deducting unfair transaction charges, he has no one to complain to. If the bitcoin wallet is hacked into or some bitcoins are lost, there is again no recompense.\n\nThis lack of regulation had resulted in websites dealing in narcotic drugs and arms smuggling using bitcoins in the past.\n\nPrice volatility\n\nIf you thought that bitcoins could become a store of value, then the sharp price volatility seen in this currency is a deterrent to such aspirations. Check this out. One bitcoin could be purchased for $5 in 2011. Between February and November 2013, exchange rate rose from $20 to $1,000. By early 2015, the rate was at $200. In recent times too, volatility has been acute. On January 4, the high was $1,140. But a week later, prices were down more than 30 per cent.\n\nThe main reason for this volatility is that there is no underlying to which the value of the bitcoin can be pegged. Its price is based just on the demand and supply in numerous unregulated exchanges around the world.\n\nThe trading volume is quite shallow too. It’s reported that 50 per cent of the bitcoins is held by less than 1,000 people. Hoarding of bitcoins is also quite rampant.\n\nAnother problem is that only 21 million bitcoins can be mined in all. Over two-third is reported to be mined already. As the number of bitcoins mined reaches the upper limit, the value is expected to shoot through the roof. Vendors facilitating transactions through this currency will then stand to lose.\n\nThe block-chain revolution\n\nWhile it is best to be wary about bitcoins, the technology on which they are based — block-chains — is likely to grow popular going ahead. An open ledger where users enter information, verified by a set of people, can greatly increase transparency and cut down costs. It’s already used in the financial services industry and could grow in popularity in future.', ""Most top altcoins have experienced an upsurge within the last couple of weeks. Amid a booming altcoin scene, Bitcoin has sunk to a record low in terms of its share of the cryptocurrencies market, sitting at just 70.5 percent as of Friday.\n\nThere seems to be no pattern, though, in price movements among the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdoption\n\nThe rise in Ethereum price may have coincided with certain partnerships and developments within the community. However, the CEO and Founder at ether.camp, Roman Mandeleil, thinks that the rise in Ethereum value is more of a reflection of industry adoption.\n\nMandeleil says:\n\n“I don't think any specific development is the cause of the rise in the price of Ethereum. In my opinion, the surge in price is a reflection of increased adoption of the technology in the industry for BC development.”\n\nEthereum Harmony\n\nOne of the developments that Mandeleil notes is Ethereum Harmony.\n\nMandeleil describes Ethereum Harmony as an independent Ethereum peer that has all the functionality required to manage one's Ethereum funds and use RPC API from any computer.\n\nReleased in its trial version in September 2016, Mandeleil says Ethereum Harmony is capable of providing full support and provisioning the full state of the smart contract and can also be used by developers to see the internals of Ethereum and ensure the network works fine.\n\nAn expanding industry\n\nAlmost a year ago, the Ethereum price surged to new highs with the creation of The DAO but slumped after the hard fork that happened as a consequence of The DAO breach. The event saw the community split into two. Ethereum price remained quite stable in its low state until the recent surge that has seen it rise above $40 as at the time of writing.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency industry expands and new users flux into the ecosystem, price becomes less volatile. This is predominantly due to the fact that movements in price, especially in the upward pattern as observed lately, does not depend on isolated events. Most cryptocurrencies show upward price movements mainly because new adopters are entering into the ecosystem, therefore, use case scenarios are on the increase which automatically creates demand for the cryptos and subsequent increase in value."", 'Even though most bitcoin users are focusing their attention on how the protocol should scale, it appears an interesting change is taking place right now. To be more specific, the average transaction fee is dropping sharply, and the bitcoin mempool is virtually empty as of right now. In fact, there are less than 5,000 transactions waiting for confirmations as we speak.\n\nLower Fees And Empty Mempool?\n\nBitcoin network congestion has been a critical issue as of late. With a mounting number of transactions, users have to pay higher fees if they want their transfers included in the next network block.This situation has caused quite a bit of controversy over the past few months, as bitcoin transactions quickly became more expensive than using traditional payment methods\n\nFor some unknown reason, it appears there is now a clear window during which bitcoin transactions can be sent without spending a lot of money on every transaction. The bitcoin mempool is almost empty, compared to seeing tens of thousands of transactions waiting to be confirmed just a few days ago. It is not uncommon for the mempool to seemingly reset all of a sudden, although this is quite a significant change that very few people anticipated.\n\nAs one would come to expect, a lower transaction backlog has a positive impact on the bitcoin transaction fees. Right now, the fees dropped to 2 Satoshi per byte, or 0.4 cents to send a bitcoin transaction. Not too long ago, users were complaining about how they had to spend a full dollar or more to move their bitcoins quickly enough. Things have changed quite significantly over the past few days, that much is certain.\n\nRest assured this situation will not last all that long, though. Someone will try to flood the bitcoin network once again in the coming days to artificially prop up transaction fees. Spam attacks have been occurring on a frequent basis throughout 2017, and there is no reason to think that situation will change anytime soon.Once these spam attacks occur again, the transaction fees will go up in an accelerating fashion.\n\nIt is nice to see under 5,000 unconfirmed transactions on the bitcoin network for a change. Although the weekend is usually a seemingly quieter period for bitcoin transfers, such a low number is very unusual. It is an intriguing development, to say the least, and it will be interesting to see how this situation evolves over the next few weeks. Rest assured this situation will spawn a lot of new discussions moving forward.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Bitcoin price has started a downside move after failing near $1180 on many occasions against the US Dollar, and BTC/USD now could extend losses.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price traded towards $1180 against the US Dollar on a couple of occasions and failed.\n\nThe price moved down sharply and formed a bearish line on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD with resistance near $1100.\n\nThe price may continue its decline and could even settle below the $1000 level.\n\nBitcoin price has started a downside move after failing near $1180 on many occasions against the US Dollar, and BTC/USD now could extend losses.\n\nBitcoin Price to Lose Ground?\n\nThis past week we saw a decline in BTC price due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s verdict on the Bitcoin ETF request. The price moved down, but was seen later recovering above $1050. However, there were many attempts by the price to settle above $1200. It failed every time to settle above the $1180 and $1200 levels. As a result, a decline was initiated in Bitcoin price. It moved down below $1050, and settled below the stated level.\n\nI think the most important close was below $1100. It is a major pivot, and a crucial support. So, a close below $1100 is a bearish sign, and might call for more losses in the near term.

03/19/2017,"['In the afternoon of March 18, Bitcoin price plunged to $926 on Coinbase’s GDAX and $940 in most global Bitcoin exchanges, recording a 16 percent drop in value within a day, falling from $1,100 to $926. Within minutes, Bitcoin price recovered, bouncing back from $926 to $975.\n\nSimilar to the price trend of most digital currencies and alternative assets, Bitcoin price heavily fluctuated in value, mostly due to the unresolved issues surrounding Bitcoin scalability. Bitcoin price increased by $20 in the past 24 hours, reaching $995 on March 19.\n\nBitcoin price stalls as community debates over solutions\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that the downward trend of Bitcoin price is ultimately beneficial for the Bitcoin network and community. If Bitcoin price continues to climb up and reach new highs, it will exponentially increase transaction volume of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is already struggling to deal with mempool clearance and its current volume of transactions because of Blockchain congestion. A rapid increase in Bitcoin price at the moment will only worsen Bitcoin network scalability issues.\n\nCurrently, the Bitcoin community is trying to come to a consensus on a viable solution. The main debate between Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Bitcoin Unlimited has seen some progress in the past few days after an internal bug was discovered in the Bitcoin Unlimited software which led to a six-hour downtime for miners. The majority of the community argues that a closed group of developers can’t be trusted to lead Bitcoin development if network issues and severe bugs continue to surface.\n\nThe miners and community’s indecisiveness on the matter is allowing Bitcoin price to fluctuate wildly on a daily basis. Today, global Bitcoin exchanges opened trading at $1,068. At their peak, Bitcoin price reached $1,100 and in their lowest trading points, Bitcoin price plunged to $926. Such volatility is making it difficult for Bitcoin businesses and merchants.\n\nChina’s Central Bank makes an announcement\n\nThe People’s Bank of China also released a statement to announce that a new round of meetings will be held next week. PBoC officials are expected to meet with Bitcoin exchanges to discuss regulations and policies.\n\nPreviously, these discussions led to the suspension of withdrawals for OKCoin and Huobi users. Therefore, the Chinese market is reacting negatively to the statement of PBoC, even if Bitcoin price is quite resilient toward external factors such as PBoC, regulations and ETFs.\n\nIn the upcoming days, Bitcoin price is expected to fluctuate, as discussions on SegWit and Bitcoin Unlimited continue. If Bitcoin exchanges including Bitfinex, Bitstamp and BTCC continue to support their view on Bitcoin Unlimited as an alt-asset, the market will likely stabilize. However, if the network nears a hard fork, Bitcoin price may decrease further.', 'Blockchain is only one of many technologies within Bitcoin which powers its peer-to-peer protocol. It essentially is like a database that stores, secures and facilitates transaction data for Bitcoin users.\n\nOver the past few years, leading banks and financial institutions have focused on building Blockchain-based systems including cross-bank payment facilitation tools, inter-ledger protocols and multiple layer financial solutions. Billions of dollars have been allocated for the development of so-called “private Blockchains or ledgers” and banks are yet to demonstrate the commercial success of the Blockchain.\n\nOne major reason why banks continue to struggle to adopt the Blockchain and demonstrate its usability within the financial industry is the regulatory conflict which arises due to the decentralized nature of Blockchain.\n\nBy money transmission and financial policies, banks are required to strictly oversee transactions and financial activities. If a public Blockchain network-based system is implemented, banks will not be able to manipulate transactions and thus lose control of their network.\n\nBasically, a public Blockchain network cannot be adopted due to regulatory hurdles. Private Blockchain networks can’t be applied either due to severe security issues. Over time, investors and Blockchain consortia realized that Blockchain doesn’t suit the financial industry and corporations such as the R3CEV have moved on to Blockchain-inspired technologies.\n\nIs Google working on its own Bitcoin?\n\nGoogle-funded Currencycloud is following a roadmap that is similar to the R3 consortium. Instead of pegging their system on Blockchain, Currencycloud is entering the financial industry with a Blockchain-inspired technology that is actually applicable to a wide range of operations such as transaction facilitation.\n\nRecently, Currencycloud raised another $25 mln funding round from Google’s venture capital arm GV, which puts their total funding to date at nearly $55 mln, acquired from prominent venture capital firms and technology companies including Sapphire, Notion Capital and Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten’s fund Anthemis.\n\nEssentially, the infrastructure of Currencycloud works as a cross-bank ledger that allows instantaneous transactions in a more secure yet cheaper ecosystem. With a simple API, banks can utilize Currencloud’s infrastructure to optimize settlement of payments.\n\nCurrencycloud CEO CEO Mike Laven stated:\n\n“GV looked at that and looked at empowering developers and making it easy for them to tie up to global services and said that is consistent with our view of the world, a tool that\'s part of globalization. That was part of the theme of the investment. We\'ve been saying all along, we\'re not just a payments company, not just an FX company. We\'re a platform with API access to the world of global payments.""\n\nA rapidly emerging group of fintech companies and Blockchain-inspired infrastructure developers are targeting banks and financial institutions that can utilize their solutions to optimize large commercial projects. So far, Blockchain technology, or to be more specific private Blockchain network-based platforms, haven’t proved its worth in the financial industry despite billions of dollars being invested in the technology.\n\nThe question remains if Blockchain technology is relevant in the realm of finance and if it actually can improve banking services. Concerns of investors on fintech and Blockchain startups is that banks are beginning to realize Blockchain without Bitcoin or the main digital asset, hash power and an open community of developers isn’t at all efficient.', 'Bitcoin shed about a fifth of its value over the weekend as an increasingly bitter split in the developer community behind the virtual currency threatened to literally break it in two.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $999 on Sunday after trading as low as $970 on Saturday.

There was a requirement concerning bit currency risk for trading platforms to identify users’ identities, including real name, registration name, identity card numbers and other information.\n\nThe proposed change includes two aspects regarding AML. One is to establish an AML structure to improve AML, anti-terrorism financing and an internal control system. Another is to clarify the platform’s obligations, including prevention and control measures. Such measures would include customer identity information, a system for preserving transaction records and a system for recording suspicious transactions.\n\nVirtual platforms will need to have “on-site certification.” The trading platform will have to follow the KYC principle and establish a system for customer identification. When users of virtual currency make withdrawals and redemptions, they will be required to have a valid identity document. Customers applying for counterfeit goods, virtual goods and the equivalent of more than 50,000 yuan should provide remote video certification.\n\nCustomer ‘Presence Certification’\n\nThe customer for the first time would be required to have “presence certification.”\n\nIn addition to making detailed requests for customer identification, the proposal stipulates that the platform should develop senior management personnel responsible for AML and anti-terrorism financing, and establish specialized agencies and positions and an internal control system.\n\nThe platform should properly store customer identity information and transactions to ensure complete and accurate reproduction of each transaction.\n\nThe proposal also includes a list of suspicious transactions to focus on. Should a transaction involve criminal activities like money laundering, the platform should report it to the central bank business management department.\n\nXuedong said the whereabouts of funds can be learned from the blockchain technology.\n\nAlso read: Report: China should clarify ‘bottom line” of bitcoin exchange supervision\n\nOn-Site Exchange Inpsections Begin\n\nSince the beginning of January 2017, the People’s Bank of Beijing, Shanghai and other branches of the joint local financial regulatory authorities have carried out on-site inspections of exchanges that found the AML internal control system is not perfect.\n\nOn January 11, the Shanghai and Beijing branches of the PBOC conducted on-site checks of three bitcoin exchanges, sending prices crashing. Exchanges in the country began enforcing sweeping changes, beginning with halting leveraged or loan-based trading of the cryptocurrency between platforms a week after the PBOC became involved. On January 24, Chinese exchanges ended zero-fee trading and began charging a flat 0.2 percent fee of the value of the transaction.\n\nThe central bank continued its investigation of Chinese bitcoin exchanges in February. A closed door meeting with a number of domestic exchanges took place on February 8.\n\nOn February 9, a notice was issued to upgrade the AML system and that the standard development and implementation period was expected to be one month.\n\nOn March 8, a notice mentioned the need to address AML, foreign exchange management, payment settlement and other financial regulations.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

In Dryja’s series of tests, he discovered that Segwit is able to handle a single block of 3.7MB.\n\n“The new software doesn’t touch non-witness blocks. The blocks are bigger. I have a script that will spam testnet and make 3.7MB blocks. It’s not a 800KB regular block with txids and output scripts, and a 2.9MB witness block with just a bunch of signatures. It’s a single block, that looks pretty much the same as old blocks with a few extra requirements, that’s 3.7MB,” wrote Dryja.\n\nIn opposition to the claims of Bitcoin Unlimited supports and developers, Segwit actually expands the bitcoin block size by 3.7x, from 1MB to 3.7MB in a safe and non-contentious manner as explained by Bitpay CEO Stephen Pair.\n\nThis is where Harding’s comment on the 4 MB limit of Segwit becomes more relevant. Harding stated that bitcoins received before the upgrade will be counted as 4 units toward the 4 million unit weight in Segwit, each byte counting toward a 1 MB limit of the original bitcoin block size.\n\nWith Segwit-enabled transactions however, the size of transactions will be reduced by 4 times, from 4 units to 1 unit counting toward a 4 MB limit. Thus, essentially, it can be said that Segwit-enabled wallets and transactions can increase the block size by up to 4 MB and on average, 3.7 MB as discovered by Dryja.\n\nHarding wrote:\n\n“If you spend bitcoins received before the upgrade, each witness byte will be counted as 4 units towards the 4 million unit weight in segwit, effectively each byte counting towards a 1 MB limit. If you spend bitcoins received after the upgrade, each witness byte will be counted as 1 unit towards the 4 million unit weight in segwit effectively each byte counting towards a 4 MB limit.”\n\nConclusively, the activation of Segwit will not lead to manual upgrades in the part of users.

In other words, the downtrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. The gap between the moving averages is widening, reflecting stronger selling pressure.\n\nThe nearby 100 SMA could already hold as dynamic resistance around the $1050 area, which is also an area of interest. Meanwhile, the 200 SMA is slightly above $1100 but could serve as the line in the sand for the correction. A break above that level could signal that bulls are reganing control.\n\nStochastic is on the move down from the overbought area, confirming that bearish pressure is in play. RSI is pointing up, though, so there may be some buying momentum left but the oscillator is already nearing overbought conditions. If the selloff resumes, bitcoin price could find its way back to the recent lows at $950 or lower.\n\nMarket Events\n\nBitcoin price was bogged down by a fresh round of doubts on the stability of the cryptocurrency, as talks of a hard fork in the network and setbacks from regulatory agencies led investors to move funds out. This was compounded by the Fed’s decision to hike interest rates, which boosted demand for US assets and the dollar.\n\nStill, some profit-taking on Friday allowed a bounce to take place but it remains to be seen whether or not this is merely a correction from the huge drop. There are no major reports due from the US economy today but President Trump will be speaking so this could inspire a new round of volatility for BTCUSD.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

In fact, for most, Bitcoin is an important survivability tool that allows residents to support their families.\n\nBitcoin is one of the very few currencies or assets that is decentralized in nature. Within the Bitcoin protocol and network, administrators or mediators aren’t present and users are wholly responsible for their financial activities.\n\nBenefiting the unbanked\n\nIn underbanked regions, Bitcoin is an efficient settlement platform and cross-border payment facilitation tool as it allows anyone to obtain a wallet and start transacting immediately with Bitcoin, unlike banking services that require a certain level of fixed income and lists of identifications amongst other requirements.\n\nResidents in countries like Venezuela are struggling to obtain bank accounts and utilize financial services to either receive or send money to and from abroad. In fact, it is actually purposeless and insignificant to own a bank account in Venezuela because cash or government-printed money has been rendered worthless in a period of months.\n\nCurrently, Venezuelans are suffering from strict capital controls and hyperinflation rates as a result of the country’s economic and financial demise. Families are desperately trying to find basic necessities such as food, medicine and clothes in order to prevent their family members from dying of starvation, dehydration and sickness.\n\nHyperinflation and financial crisis within Venezuela worsened after the Venezuelan government released the new 100-bolivar banknotes in mid-December of 2016. The government announced that within 72 hours that all 100-bolivar bills, which according to the NY Times account for over three-quarters of all cash in circulation, would be worth nothing in value.\n\nBurning cash, earning Bitcoin\n\nAt the time, residents who failed to obtain banking services had virtually no other choice but to see their piles of cash turn worthless as time passed. Within 72 hours, Western media began to broadcast footages of outraged communities and Venezuelans burning cash as a means to protest against the government’s incompetence.\n\nLocal residents including Alvaro sought out for alternative financial tools apart from cash and precious metals since both the inflow and outflow of gold and the USD were heavily restricted by border controls. Venezuelan officials and police seized gold and USD at their demand, to ensure capital doesn’t leave the country.\n\nNaturally, the younger population of Venezuela began to turn toward Bitcoin as it eliminates the possibility of government intervention and regulation. In local exchanges including Surbitcoin and BitInka, Venezuelans bought Bitcoin and purchased food from online platforms such as Amazon to feed their families.\n\nAn increasing number of people also engaged themselves in Bitcoin mining to earn the digital currency instead of local money.\n\nAlvaro wrote:', 'A couple’s honeymoon might not seem the time to undertake a social experiment, with the digital currency Bitcoin, but that’s exactly what one soon-to-be-married couple are planning when they tie the knot at the end of the month.\n\nOn 28 March, 2017, South African residents Wilhelm Lehmann and Natasha Bezuidenhout are due to get married and just like most newlyweds they’ll be enjoying their time together on their honeymoon.\n\nFor them, this is the perfect time to demonstrate the real-life value of Bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking to CCN, Lehmann, a telecoms and IT specialist, who has used Bitcoin extensively and whose hobbies include cryptography and firearms, said that he has been following Bitcoin since its inception, concluding that it might be possible to live solely using the currency. He adds that this is a challenge he wants to prove after the honeymoon challenge.\n\nHe said that if the experiment is successful it will further boost his view of it as a real-world currency, which he hopes to explain in his whitepaper after the honeymoon.\n\nIt would prove you can travel to multiple countries using a single currency stored virtually in the cloud, so you don’t have to worry about losing credit cards [or] cash being stolen.\n\nThe couple is planning to travel for a week to Zanzibar, Mauritius and South Africa. Using Bitcoin Core, Electrum and paper wallets, Lehmann says that he plans on pre-booking everything, choosing vendors that use payment processors that accept the digital currency.\n\nHowever, while many may consider this too short a time to determine the currency’s value in day-to-day expenses, Lehmann says how much they can do depends on the availability of Bitcoin that they are hoping friends and family will put toward their honeymoon fund.\n\nHe states:\n\nCurrently our main challenge is getting enough Bitcoin together to pay for our honeymoon.\n\nThe Growth of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is one of the quickest growing digital currencies with a market cap value of just over $20 billion. Ethereum, in second place, is valued at just under $3 billion.\n\nWith one Bitcoin currently valued around $1,248, a slight drop from its previous high of $1,350, after the SEC rejected the approval of the first ETF, the currency is demonstrating that despite setbacks it is much stronger than previously thought.\n\nNot only that, but the currency is illustrating its ease of use, which millions of people are experiencing.\n\nLehmann states:\n\nPeople are moving to convenience, and online transactions are more common every day.\n\nHe adds that as a backup he’ll be taking his credit cards with him as he says he ‘can’t let our honeymoon be spoiled because the spa won’t take Bitcoin for a massage.’ He concludes, though, that this would be a last resort if there was no way of getting what they needed with the currency.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
03/20/2017,"[""Bitcoin’s scaling fight has led to a record low in its percentage of cryptocurrency’s total market cap as investors hedge with top altcoins.\n\nAs its user base expands, Bitcoin’s transactions have also grown, leading to blocks, capped at 1mb, to be filled to capacity. As a result, transactions have slowed and fees have spiked. An effort to solve Bitcoin’s scaling issues has led to a civil war of sorts between the Core development team and its supporters backing the Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork, and the Bitcoin Unlimited miner-directed block size hard fork and its supporters.\n\nIn contrast to previous hard fork attempts (XT, Classic), Unlimited has gained speed, occasionally passing SegWit in adoption by miners. Recently, Unlimited has secured a solid lead, due in part to a major mining pool, Antpool, switching to Unlimited.\n\n“Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver, who has led the opposition to the current state of Bitcoin and its hard cap of 1mb blocks, has stated that he believes that the current inability to find a resolution to the issue has cost Bitcoin billions of dollars already:\n\nThe damage caused by Core's intentional fee market via full blocks has already likely damaged Bitcoin's market cap by billions of dollars. — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) March 19, 2017\n\nOther coins rise as investors hedge their bets\n\nAs a result of increasing uncertainty, lack of usability and conflict surrounding Bitcoin, its growth has stagnated- even receded, while other coins have seen exceptional gains. Ethereum, cryptocurrency’s number two contender, has seen a massive increase, more than doubling in market cap and price in the last 10 days alone. It currently sits at about $4 bln total and $45 per coin, with a current trading volume of over $200 mln.\n\nDash has seen even more impressive relative gains, multiplying its value and market cap five times over since one month ago. It has broken the three-digit barrier and appears to have settled above $100, having also broken 10 percent the price of Bitcoin per coin. As a result of this growth, Dash’s treasury, 10 percent of its block reward set aside for development and other projects, has passed $500,000 monthly, closing in on a million dollar monthly budget for the newly number three ranked coin. Monero has also picked up on the Bitcoin exodus, doubling in value over the last 10 days, maintaining a solid fourth place and passing $300 mln in market cap.\n\nThis growth and reshuffling of the cryptocurrency field has led to a slipping in Bitcoin’s dominance. Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap has sunk to 70 percent, a new all-time low since the previous low of 74 percent during Ethereum’s initial boom last year. Total cryptocurrency market cap remains slightly lower than its all-time high, while combined altcoin value has grown from approximately $2.2 bln at the year’s start to over $7 bln now, nearly $4 bln of that growth over the last month alone.\n\nThe scaling debate gets ugly\n\nIn spite of this growing shift, the Bitcoin scaling conflict continues to become more heated. Ver alleges that many Unlimited nodes identify as Core in order to avoid DDoS attacks, which have plagued Bitcoin.com all last week. Unlimited supporters have documented a pattern of alleged censorship on the Bitcoin subreddit, filtering out comments in support of an alternative implementation of Bitcoin than the one stewarded by the Core developers.\n\nMeanwhile, faced by increasing resistance from large mining pools, such as Antpool, Core member Peter Todd publicly mused about a proof-of-work algorithm change in order to reshuffle mining power as a “backup plan”:\n\nWith some miners threatening 51% attacks against Bitcoin, researching a PoW change is a good backup plan: https://t.co/SEZ1qlxhAH — Peter Todd (@petertoddbtc) March 19, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin’s network congestion remains an issue. Low-end fees remain above 50 cents and the median confirmation time continues to rise. The mempool of backlogged transactions has filtered out slightly, though it still remains in excess of 20mb over a seven-day average."", 'Bitcoin regained its footing on Monday, having suffered its heftiest falls since early 2015 between Thursday and Saturday as investors sold the digital currency on worries about its future.\n\nHaving soared to an all-time high of $1,350 on the Bitstamp exchange on March 10, on speculation that regulators could approve the first U.S. bitcoin exchange traded fund the following day, the digital currency then slipped back.\n\nIts falls began accelerating on Thursday and it hit a five-week low of $944.36 on Saturday. But bitcoin recovered a little on Sunday and built on those gains on Monday, climbing around 2.5% to roughly $1,050 by 18:15 GMT.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter\n\nBitcoin experts said its steep losses were driven by a longstanding, and intensifying, row over whether – and how – to increase the capacity of the “blocks” that bitcoin transactions are processed in, so as to make sure there are no delays in transactions being finalized.\n\n“The bitcoin scaling debate is a risk for the network and highlights core issues in terms of governance and this is where more nimble crypto competitors see advantages in fleshing out their capabilities sooner,” said Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency analysis website Crytocompare, in London.\n\nRelated: This New Tactic Might Finally Lure Big Investors to Bitcoin\n\nAt the same time that bitcoin was plunging, a newer, rival “cryptocurrency” was soaring: ether. The digital currency behind Ethereum – a project that some experts say holds more potential than bitcoin – has almost tripled in value this month, jumping to record highs of around $45.\n\nSome experts said traders were selling bitcoin and buying ether, which was exacerbating the falls in the original cryptocurrency.\n\n“Traders in the space are looking for better returns in the more risky and nascent cryptos such as Dash, Monero and Ethereum (and are) looking to replicate the extraordinary returns that bitcoin saw in its early days,” added Hayter.\n\nU.S. regulators dashed Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’s bitcoin ambitions earlier in the month by rejecting their application to list an exchange-traded fund linked to the digital currency.', 'Bitcoin believers argue the famous crypto-currency would be more stable—and more valuable—if only hedge funds and other institutional investors would get with the program and buy some. But so far, many big fish have stayed away—in part because bitcoin doesn’t provide the financial products and regulatory compliance they require.\n\nThis could start to change, however, as more companies shape their services for traditional investors that want exposure to bitcoin and other digital currencies. The latest examples comes from San Francisco-based Coinbase, whose GDAX exchange—a trading platform backed by the New York Stock Exchange, venture capitalists like Andreesen Horowitz and others—announced on Monday the launch of margin trading.\n\nThe new feature, which lets investors leverage their bets on bitcoin by a factor of three, is significant because the ability to trade on margin is widely used when trading traditional assets, and it is something institutional investors expect, according to Coinbase vice president Adam White.\n\nA few other U.S. digital currency exchanges, including Kraken, offer margin trading. But White, in an interview with Fortune, says Coinbase’s GDAX (for Global Digital Asset Exchange) is different because it has the state licenses that asset managers want to see before they lay down clients’ money.\n\nGDAX expects its combination of margin trading and regulatory compliance will attract hedge funds, high net worth individuals, and market makers like Cantor Fitzgerald. Down the road, White thinks digital currency will also attract investment bank “whales,” and that the likes of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan will set up dedicated trading desks for bitcoin like the ones they have for oil, gold, and other types of foreign exchange.\n\n“It will be hard to get the first big one. It’s a matter of waiting for the first mover, then the fast followers will come,” White says.\n\nHere’s a GIF showing the trading platform in action:\n\nBring on the short sellers?\n\nWhite also says GDAX’s new margin offering is significant because it provides an easy way to short bitcoin, meaning funds will have a way to hedge their positions. (The ability to short sell arises because GDAX supplies the margin purchase in bitcoin, which the investor can immediately sell for dollars and then later repay at a profit if the price drops).\n\nIt’s unclear, though, if this will be enough to draw in a new class of traditional investors at a time when bitcoin virtual currencies are still considered by many as exotic assets with a reputation for volatility and scams. The SEC this month dealt a blow to the digital currency industry when it flatly refused to approve a new ETF, which would have let investors buy and sell bitcoin like ordinary shares.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter\n\nWhite, though, downplays the impact decision and points to a surge in trading volumes since the ruling came out on March 13. He says the average worldwide trading volume has jumped 33% across the world, and that GDAX’s daily average has jumped 67%.\n\n“I believe the SEC’s decision will increase demand for GDAX and our margin trading feature precisely because the SEC has highlighted the risk of offshore, risky exchanges. GDAX has established itself as a trusted, U.S. based exchange that operates within regulatory requirements and that is why our average daily trading volume has grown 2x relative to the rest of the industry,” White says.\n\nDespite his optimism, bitcoin also faces a series of fresh headwinds that include a major IRS investigation, tighter regulation in China, and a squabble among bitcoin developers that could create two versions of the currency. Meanwhile, the latest controversies over bitcoin have proved a boon to competing virtual currencies like Ethereum and Dash, whose share of the digital currency market cap has jumped in recent weeks.\n\nThe bottom line is bitcoin and other virtual currencies are unlikely to lose their reputation anytime soon as an exciting but unpredictable investment.', ""BTCC, the company behind the oldest Bitcoin exchange in China, is once again expanding its footprint globally. This time with a multi-currency Bitcoin wallet Mobi, which they believe will be the killer app for payments.\n\nHeadquartered in Hong Kong, BTCC plays a major role in nearly every segment of the Bitcoin ecosystem from digital currency exchanges, mining pools, physical Bitcoins and now a mobile wallet like no other on the market yet.\n\nWhat is Mobi\n\nReleased the 20th of March 2017, Mobi is available for download from both iOS and Android and has an instant in-app conversion of over 150 different currencies including the pound, dollar, euro, gold and silver.\n\nIt also includes an optional Visa debit card and enables payments to Twitter replacing ChangeTip but focusing on larger payments. Uniquely, Mobi allows customers to send money in any currency, including Bitcoin to any of Twitter's 319 mln users.\n\nMobi will also appeal to Bitcoin users and those looking to hedge or speculate on Bitcoin and other currencies’ price movements by allowing instant in-app conversions between Bitcoin and 154 currencies with no trading fee.\n\nInnovations in the payments industry have been led by Chinese companies for quite some time with the likes of AliPay and WeChat, although Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, believes Mobi will succeed where the other Chinese payment technologies have not.\n\nBobby Lee says:\n\n“Mobi is the only app that supports instant conversion, storage and transfer of 100+ currencies so it can be used worldwide compared to AliPay and WeChat which only supports CNY, and can only be used in China. With Mobi you can send any form of money to anyone, anywhere. Mobi eliminates friction in money transfers, making money truly global.”\n\nPrivate Blockchain\n\nAll Mobi accounts are linked to the users’ mobile number, so all that is needed to use it is a smartphone. Mobi users can instantly transfer funds to any of the two bln other global smartphone users using Mobi’s private Blockchain. Mobi also supports Bitcoin transfers on the Bitcoin public Blockchain.\n\nThe optional debit card is linked to users’ Mobi accounts allowing them to withdraw fiat in any currency at ATMs worldwide as well as enabling the spending of funds at any retail point of sale that supports Visa. The debit card automatically deducts funds from the customer's’ wallet balance.\n\nMobi also offers support for 15 languages including English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.\n\nLee concludes:"", 'A New Jersey pastor was found guilty of pocketing $150,000 from shady bitcoin traders in exchange for giving them control of a credit union he headed so they could run it as a front for their bitcoin exchange.\n\nThe pastor, Trevón Gross, was found guilty along with programmer Yuri Lebedev by a Manhattan federal court jury on Friday. Anthony Murgio, the founder of the exchange, Coin.mx, pleaded guilty in January.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin just became more valuable than gold. Why does the price keep rising?\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nIn 2013, Murgio founded Coin.mx and Lebedev helped run it. The exchange operated through a phony front company called Collectables Club in order to fool banks into thinking illegal bitcoin transactions were legitimate sales of stamps and sports memorabilia. By posing as a site for philatelists and sports nerds and by miscoding credit and debit card transactions, the pair tricked banks into processing more than $10 million in bitcoin-related deals, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe pair also sold bitcoins to victims of “ransomware”—cyberattacks that involve hackers electronically blocking access to victims’ computers until bitcoin ransoms are paid. “In doing so, Murgio, and his co-conspirators knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes,” an FBI press release says.\n\n“When the banks caught on to their scheme,” acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon Kim said in a statement, “Lebedev and others bribed Trevón Gross so they could have a captive credit union to process those transactions, undermining the credit union’s safety and solvency.” The credit union, which had 110 members and assets of about $626,000, was shut down by the National Credit Union Administration in 2015.\n\nThe website for Jackson’s Hope Cathedral lists Gross as its lead pastor and says he was licensed to preach at the age of 14 and founded the ministry in 2002. “With degrees from the University of Virginia, Duke University and further graduate work at Harvard University, Pastor Trevón has a passion for teaching the Word of God,” the site states, adding that his wife is also a pastor at the church.\n\nProsecutors have also said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli who has been charged with overseeing an enormous hacking scheme that stole the personal information of about 83 million JPMorgan Chase customers, Reuters reported. Shalon was extradited to the U.S. last year and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nDefense attorneys for Lebedev did not respond to an email seeking comment. Gross’s defense attorney, Henry Klingeman, said in an email, “On behalf of Pastor Gross, we will now seek a judgment of acquittal from the court and—if and when the time comes—a fair and lenient sentence.”', 'The Internal Revenue Service revealed new details about its investigation into tax evasion related to bitcoin, filing court documents that suggest only a tiny percentage of virtual currency owners are reporting profits or losses in their annual returns.\n\nThe new documents, filed Thursday in San Francisco federal court, come in the midst of a closely-watched legal fight between the IRS and Coinbase, a popular service for buying and selling bitcoins that hosts over a million customer accounts.\n\nThe dispute began last year when the IRS issued a sweeping summons for Coinbase to turn over a vast amount of customer data, including every customer account as well as detailed transaction records.\n\nCoinbase claimed the IRS demands are illegally broad and refused to comply, which in turn led the IRS to file a federal lawsuit last week to enforce the summons.\n\nJurors Weigh Charges Against a Pastor and Software Engineer in Bitcoin Trial\n\nWhile the lawsuit did not come as a surprise, a new affidavit from IRS agent David Utzke reveals additional information about how the agency is conducting the investigation. Specifically, Utzke explains he ran a computer analysis against the IRS’s repository of hundreds of millions of tax records, and found fewer than a thousand people filed a Form 8949 to account for a “property description likely related to bitcoin.”\n\nForm 8949 is used to report capital losses and capital gains and, under current IRS rules, would require bitcoin owners to declare their profits. In some cases, the profit could be significant given the virtual currency soared from $13 to over $1,100 during the three year period (2013-2015) for which the agency is seeking information.\n\nHere is a paragraph from Utzke’s affidavit that states only 802 individuals filed a bitcoin-related Form 8949 in 2015(emphasis mine):\n\nThe IRS searched the MTRDB for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015. I received the results of those searches. Those results reflect that in 2013, 807 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin; in 2014, 893 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin; and in 2015, 802 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin.\n\nIt’s impossible to know what percentage of Coinbase customers these numbers represent, but it’s likely only a small fraction. Even though some Coinbase accounts belong to non-U.S. citizens, and many others did not have any transactions (and therefore did not trigger any capital gains), it’s possible an IRS review of the accounts could identify hundreds of thousands of individuals who should have declared bitcoin income.\n\nIn a Friday blog post, Coinbase said it has yet to turn over any information, and that it would push back against the scope of the summons.\n\n“Coinbase remains concerned with the indiscriminate and over broad scope of the government’s summons and we have produced no records under the summons,” wrote Coinbase lawyer, Juan Suarez.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe company has previously described the IRS probe as unreasonable, noting the agency would not approach other financial institutions like JP Morgan or PayPal and demand every single of their customer records.\n\nIn January, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong complained the legal fight could cost his company up to $1 million, and that he would prefer to spend the money hiring employees. Armstrong at the time also offered an olive branch to the IRS, saying Coinbase is ready to provide customers with 1099-B forms, which are used by brokerages and others to help customers report their taxes.\n\nOther virtual currencies a target?\n\nFollowing news of the IRS tax probe, one virtual currency lawyer said the agency’s demand simply represented an opening gambit for negotiations—and that it that would end with Coinbase providing a far more narrow set of information.\n\nA person close to Coinbase, who was not authorized to speak for attribution, confirmed to Fortune the company and the IRS have been in talks, but also expressed surprise the agency has so far refused to narrow its demands.\n\nA spokesperson for the IRS said the agency cannot comment on specific investigations.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that many Coinbase customers are likely to feel uneasy since the investigation could eventually lead them to owe back taxes or penalties, or even see the IRS seize their accounts.\n\nBitcoin Prepares For an Ugly Breakup\n\nMeanwhile, Coinbase isn’t the only one taking issue with the IRS’s bitcoin stance. A Los Angeles law firm, Berns Weiss, sued the IRS last year, complaining the agency’s summons swept up one of the firm’s partners, Jeffrey Berns, who held bitcoin at Coinbase, but had never sold it. The firm had to drop the lawsuit after the IRS told Berns he would not be a target of the investigation—but has since vowed to resume the legal battle.\n\n“We will, however, continue our efforts to protect the rights of Coinbase customers regarding this patently overbroad summons. Thus, we plan to file a motion to intervene in the enforcement proceeding on behalf of other Coinbase customers who have contacted us and expressed their interest in fighting the summons,” said the firm in a statement.\n\nFinally, it’s unclear if the IRS is also targeting other virtual currency operators. While Coinbase is the most popular and mainstream bitcoin platform, there are numerous others. Meanwhile, the growing value of other virtual currencies, including Ethereum, mean firms that offer such currencies could soon find themselves in the cross-hairs of the IRS too.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the IRS form on one occassion as Form 8948 not 8949. It has been updated.', 'How Blockchain is Changing the World\n\nBy now, you have probably heard of the term “blockchain” somewhere amidst discussions of digital currency, banking, and the future of finance. Many believe it’s going to revolutionize the world — from Wall Street adopting blockchain technologies by 2018 to companies trading publicly with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. But what exactly is blockchain?\n\nThe system of Blockchain has been quietly growing since its inception in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto (the pseudonym for the suspected group of individuals who co-created Bitcoin). Blockchain serves as the underlying infrastructure for Bitcoin, a form of cryptocurrency that has become increasingly popular: at the time of publication, 1 XBT was worth $1,031.14 USD. Blockchain serves as a peer-to-peer network that takes place privately and exclusively between two users. Information stored in blockchain technology is completely decentralized from any external influence, and all movement of information is accounted for through a blockchain ledger.\n\nOutside of banking and currency, blockchain is gradually changing how business is done in other fields. The most popular form of blockchain development in enterprise technology is Ethereum. Originally founded in 2013 by developer Vitalik Buterin, the company was developed by the Swiss nonprofit Ethereum Foundation. Ethereum is a custom-built blockchain that can be used in payment systems, crowdfunding, gold investing, and other cloud computing functions. The custom-built blockchain system has attracted the interest of some big names in technology, like Accenture, Microsoft, Intel, several large banks, and blockchain startups around the world.\n\nEthereum’s All-Time High\n\nGlobal corporations like Maersk are adopting blockchain systems for record keeping and information sharing. This industrial shift has elevated blockchain developers like Ethereum to new heights. Almost remarkably so: Ethereum (ETH) hit an all-time high, trading at over $50 a share — an almost four hundred percent increase from last month when it sold at around $13 a share (at time of publication, it was trading at $44 a share). While the all-time high value only lasted a few days, the implications for Ethereum are clear. Blockchain systems are well on their way to becoming the new industry norm.\n\nAs mentioned, corporate giants like Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase are working together to form the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). The EEA aims to create a standard of the Ethereum software so that business around the world can collaborate effortlessly. So far, 30 companies have joined the nonprofit initiative. It’s been speculated that the formation of this entity is what’s behind the recent surge for the blockchain company.\n\nThe benefits of the EAA could mean greater transparency, reduction in costs, and more appeal to national and international governmental organizations. While the consistency of the Ethereum trend isn’t a guarantee, it’s definitely something worth keeping an eye on.\n\nDisclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets.

The PoW upgrade would allegedly offer protection from such attacks, allowing individuals to mine once again and thereby increasing decentralization of the process.\n\n“Changing the proof-of-work will fire the current crop of miners and open the door for quickly and easily scaling the network,” the project’s website states.\n\nDespite Todd’s publicity, the upgrade plan is not sponsored or officially endorsed by Core, Bitcoin Project or Blockstream.\n\nElsewhere, highly charged rhetoric from Core supporters continues, with former BTC COO Samson Mow tweeting over the weekend, “You can't sell a centralized coin to people that live & breathe the ideals of decentralization.”"", 'Since most altcoins are based on Bitcoin’s codebase, upgrades to Bitcoin are often relatively easy to implement in altcoins. Indeed, as Segregated Witness (SegWit) is slow to activate on Bitcoin, several altcoins are taking a stab at implementing and activating the soft fork first.\n\n\n\nHowever, it seems the very same politics that are holding back the protocol upgrade on Bitcoin are now seeping into several of these altcoins.\n\n“What we are seeing is a stalling tactic from miners,” Viacoin lead developer Romano told Bitcoin Magazine. “They know that if SegWit activates on altcoins, it will make blocking it on Bitcoin even less credible.”\n\nGroestlcoin\n\nLaunched in 2014, Groestlcoin has a total market cap of some $365,000, earning it the 163th spot on CoinMarketCap at time of publication. This makes it the smallest of the five altcoins aiming for SegWit but also the first to have actually succeeded in activating it. The required 95 percent of hash power signaled support back in January, and the protocol upgrade has been live since.\n\n“Jackie,” who prefers not to reveal his full name, is the project lead for Groestlcoin.\n\n“All the FUD [Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt] is false,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “SegWit as a soft fork is about as safe as the CSV soft fork was — and you don’t hear anyone complain about that.”\n\nAs a digital currency that isn’t used much yet, Groestlcoin never faced scaling issues like Bitcoin. But Jackie said he considers SegWit a malleability fix first and foremost, which in turn enables features like the lightning network, atomic cross-chain transactions and other innovations.\n\n“Less useful and elegant versions of lightning [network], TumbleBit and Mimblewimble were possible with the old version of Groestlcoin, but they are greatly enhanced now Segregated Witness is activated on the Groestlcoin network,” Jackie noted.\n\nThat said, Segregated Witness itself is not very actively used so far. There are no Groestlcoin wallets that support the option, so apart from some specially crafted transactions to test that the new feature worked, most Groestlcoin transactions still use the old, pre-SegWit format.\n\nThough, Jackie added, “We’re in the process of updating our Electrum version for Groestlcoin to support SegWit transactions. That should be done before the end of this year. When that is completed anyone should be able to easily send and receive SegWit transactions.”\n\nVertcoin\n\nVertcoin may well be the next altcoin to activate Segregated Witness.\n\nAs a result of an implementation bug, Vertcoin initially suffered a setback from their Segregated Witness integration: the blockchain forked in two. Vertcoin developer and project manager “etang600” emphasized, however, that this had nothing to do with SegWit itself — only with how they implemented it.\n\nThe issue has since been resolved and SegWit signaling has started. Requiring 75 percent hash rate support, it is getting relatively close to activation with some 40 percent of hash rate signaling.\n\nHowever, one mystery miner, most likely a solo miner, controls over 30 percent of all hash rate. It’s this miner that is seemingly holding everyone back.\n\n“We don’t know who this miner is,” etang600 told Bitcoin Magazine. “We are trying to figure out ways to contact him. But it’s still pretty early; we have only been signaling for two weeks, so we hope they’ll update.”\n\nLitecoin, SysCoin and Viacoin and the F2Pool Dilemma\n\nLitecoin ($200 million market cap for #6 spot on CoinMarketCap), SysCoin ($6.9 million market cap for #49 spot on CoinMarketCap) and Viacoin ($1.1 million market cap for #104 spot on CoinMarketCap) are also planning to implement Segregated Witness.\n\nBut since Viacoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and SysCoin is merge-mined with Bitcoin, all three coins are facing the same problem: Bitcoin and Litecoin mining pool F2Pool is not signaling support for the soft fork.\n\nIn addition to benefits offered by a malleability fix, SysCoin will adopt Schnorr signatures: a signature scheme that could make both Bitcoin and SysCoin more efficient. Unsurprisingly, therefore, SysCoin backend developer Jagdeep Sidhu is hopeful F2Pool will start signaling support for the upgrade soon.\n\n“F2Pool will probably signal support for Segregated Witness on Bitcoin and SysCoin together,” Sidhu told Bitcoin Magazine. “But I think they’re still in wait-and-see mode.”\n\nWhen asked by Bitcoin Magazine last autumn, F2Pool operator Wang Chun said his system could not build C++11 and that’s why he was holding off on SegWit signaling.\n\nToday, on Twitter, Chun suggested he may be able to finally compile C++11 code when Debian 9 is released.\n\nI’ve heard rumors that Debian 9 will come with a C++11-compatible compiler. So let’s prayer for it could be released sooner and sooner. https://t.co/uW0ob1x80H — Wang Chun (@f2pool_wangchun) March 20, 2017\n\nBut some are skeptical that an inability to compile C++11 is the real reason Chun isn’t signaling support yet. For one, compiling C++11 should not be that difficult in the first place. And as Sidhu pointed out, the latest version of SysCoin is already coded in C++11. Since SysCoin recently hard forked, older versions of the software are no longer compatible, so any SysCoin miner must be able to compile C++11. That includes F2Pool.\n\nSegWit signaling will start soon on Viacoin, but Romano is not very optimistic about quick activation either. “It seems more likely they want to refrain from activating Segregated Witness on altcoins because that would give them even less reason to hold off activation on Bitcoin,” he said.\n\nRomano went even further. “Maybe F2Pool are under some hidden pressure or coercion, and are trying to make a plausible cover story. It is well known that Jihan Wu of Bitmain controls the supply of about 70 percent of the mining hardware. His mining pool is blocking SegWit on Bitcoin, and he is able to exert pressure on miners and pools by sanctioning new equipment sales should they go against his wishes.”\n\nF2Pool operator Wang Chun told Bitcoin Magazine that he preferred not to comment at this time. But in response to Romano’s comment, Bitmain’s Jihan Wu said:\n\n“They are customers of us, and there is enough competition in the market. (Where is the other so-called ""30%"" coming from?) This theory is not right on the assumption part. Wang Chun of F2Pool is a very mature man, he gives no sh* to any authorities or political pressure.”']"

Maybe not, at least according to a hacker or a group of hackers trying to extort a small fortune for themselves from the Cupertino-based tech giant.\n\nAccording to reports, the hackers going by the name “Turkish Crime Family” are claiming to have access to millions of credentials belonging to iCloud and Apple email accounts. They have threatened to make use of the data to access customers’ accounts and wipe their Apple devices in case the company fails to pay the ransom.\n\nThe hackers are demanding a ransom of $75,000, to be paid in Bitcoin or Ether. Alternatively, they have also given an option to pay an equivalent of $100,000 in iTunes gift cards. Once their demands are met, they have assured to delete the cache.\n\nThe leading tech magazine reporting on the incident also provides information about the conversation between the “Turkish Crime Family” and Apple’s security team. The media outlet managed to get in touch with one of the hackers, who was quoted in the article saying,\n\n“I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing. “\n\nThey have also uploaded a small demonstration video on YouTube, where one of the hackers was shown accessing an iCloud account belonging to an elderly woman. They not only accessed the backed-up photos but also had an opportunity to wipe the Apple devices associated with the account remotely.\n\nThe hackers have given Apple time until April 7, after which the will start deleting the iCloud accounts and wipe the devices. Responding to the demand, Apple seems to have taken a tough stance, asking the hackers to provide a sample of the data set in their possession. The company has also threatened to share the communication with law enforcement authorities.\n\nThe authenticity of the data in hackers’ possession will only come to light after the first attack, provided the company hasn’t caved in already and paid the ransom. Meanwhile, it is advisable for Apple product users to voluntarily change the credentials of their iCloud and Apple email accounts.\n\nRef: MotherBoard | Image: NewsBTC', 'Bitcoin\'s price plunged 25% over the weekend on rumors of a conspiracy theory to take over the network.\n\nLong-simmering tensions between two factions hardened, with each side threatening the other with everything ranging from lawsuits to software changes that would completely cut off the opposing group.\n\nTwitter, Reddit and Bitcoin forums were aflame with insults and tough talk as each stakeholder vied to ensure that their piece of the cryptocurrency, whose market cap fell from $20 billion to $15.5 billion, remained secure.\n\n“We’re dangerously close to what could be the death of bitcoin,” said bitcoin developer Andrew DeSantis over the weekend after he posted a tweet storm Friday that set off alarm bells for many in the community.\n\nWhat triggered the widespread panic was the possibility that the network would be controlled by an oligopoly rather than held in an equilibrium of competing interests.\n\nFrom Thursday to Saturday, the value of bitcoin dropped 25%, though it has recovered somewhat to 15% below. That day, Vinny Lingham, an entrepreneur in the space known for his price targets, said, “The smart money left three days ago.”\n\nThe alleged bad actors maintained innocence.\n\n“I think it’s conspiracy theorist stuff,” said Roger Ver, one of the most vocal advocates of a new version of the bitcoin software called Bitcoin Unlimited that, if it gains sufficient control of the computing power in the network, could become the main version of bitcoin and be incompatible with previous versions. (Ver is nicknamed Bitcoin Jesus because of his history evangelizing bitcoin.)\n\nHis fellow Bitcoin Unlimited supporter, Jihan Wu, the cofounder of bitcoin chip manufacturer Bitmain, said by phone from Beijing, “Definitely, I don\'t have such kind of plan.”\n\nWhether or not the conspiracy theories are true, over the weekend, what has so far been a two-year-long he said-she said stalemate turned into an incredibly expensive game of chicken.\n\nWhat They’re Fighting About\n\nThe crisis has its roots in a two-year-old debate over how to scale the network, which currently accommodates, on average, about a handful of transactions a second, based on a data cap of 1MB roughly every 10 minutes. On the surface, the argument is that some participants in the ecosystem want to raise that limit, called the block size, to what, under Bitcoin Unlimited, would be a flexible cap, while the developers who have been designing and maintaining the software for the last several years, a team called Bitcoin Core, want to keep the 1MB limit but make the system more efficient so it processes more transactions per block.\n\nThe argument stems from philosophical differences. “At the highest level, there are two camps that see bitcoin becoming two different things: digital gold or electronic cash,” says Adam White, head of GDAX, the professional trading platform of one of the most well-known startups in the space, Coinbase. “Neither is right or wrong. They’re just different perspectives on what the network can become.” The developers’ approach is one more of digital gold — not necessarily putting every coffee payment onto the bitcoin network itself, but having them processed by other, faster networks that would later connect to bitcoin’s to provide finality to the transaction. Bitcoin Unlimited’s vision, supported by a number of miners at this point, is of bitcoin as e-cash — a network that has room for every morning coffee to be processed on bitcoin’s network, which would, incidentally, give them more transaction fees.\n\nHowever, what might, in the abstract, be called a philosophical disagreement has become, on the ground, an all-out power struggle.\n\nTo understand the fight, it helps to know the game theoretic aspects of bitcoin. Bitcoin miners are people and companies with computers that process transactions for the network by adding them to the blockchain, or the ledger of every bitcoin transaction since the network launched in January 2009. Miners are motivated by a payout that the bitcoin software makes as it mints new bitcoin with every block of transactions processed. (This so-called block reward is currently 12.5 bitcoins, or about $13,750 at press time.) In addition to newly minted bitcoins, miners also receive small transaction fees paid by every user sending bitcoin. Wu is involved in mining in two ways: He not only manufactures bitcoin mining chips through Bitmain but also runs the biggest bitcoin mining operation called Antpool.\n\nDesigning the game, and the incentives in it, are the developers. Their motivations can range from ideological to technical. Many developers simply want to see a decentralized financial system not controlled by one or a few entities, whether it’s a government or a few big miners. But they need the miners. Without miners, the network wouldn’t exist, and without enough of them it’s not secure. However, if too few of them dominate, then the delicate balance of no one party fully controlling the system falls apart since mining would be run by an oligopoly. Conversely, if the developers don’t do enough for the miners, the miners can retaliate against the developers.\n\nBecause the developers and the miners both need each other and have opposing incentives, they don’t fully trust each other. “Bitcoin is one of those things where nobody wants to be seen as controlling it,” says DeSantis. The magic of bitcoin has been the ability for various players with opposing interests to engage in a system that has so far led to an optimal outcome for all of them.\n\nThere’s one last group important to the game theory of bitcoin, but before we get to them: The detente between the two sides has lasted for a few years because the people who support bigger blocks (now in the form of Bitcoin Unlimited) had too little computing power on the network to take control of it. Also, certain technical upgrades, including a block size increase, require what’s called a hard fork, which runs the risk of creating two versions of bitcoin if not done with the full support of the community. Many consider this type of hostile hard fork a potential nuclear option in bitcoin — one that could destroy, or at least damage, the industry that, until last Thursday, had a $20 billion market cap.\n\nFrom Impasse To Panic\n\nOn Friday, several exchanges announced that, in the event of a fork, Bitcoin Unlimited would not have the ticker symbol BTC. They were effectively preemptively awarding Bitcoin Core the reputation of being “the true bitcoin.” Many people in the community thought that that would deter Bitcoin Unlimited from forcing a hard fork.\n\nBut alarm spread when, later that day, DeSantis posted a 28-point tweet thread pointing out that Wu would soon be launching new facilities that would bring a lot more computing power to the network. (One deal was for U.S.-based facilities with John McAfee’s company MGT set to launch in the second quarter of 2017 and called MacPool.) While that wouldn’t necessarily give Wu or his companies more than 50% of the computing power, the worried developers hypothesized that since Wu’s company Bitmain manufactures the mining equipment that many miners use, purchasers of his mining equipment might feel pressure to support Bitcoin Unlimited so as not to have their supply of mining equipment cut off in the future. That could then tip Bitcoin Unlimited over the threshold that could allow them to, essentially, create a new version of bitcoin that cut off control from the current group of developers, which would then put the Bitcoin Unlimited developers in control and, at the very least, sow confusion in the market about which was the “true” bitcoin, if not make their version of it the dominant one.\n\nThe clincher? Bitmain owns BTC.com, and Ver controls Bitcoin.com. DeSantis asserts that, through search-engine strategies, Wu, Ver and their affiliates could lead many newcomers to believe that Bitcoin Unlimited is the “true” bitcoin. (The MacPool website, currently under construction, sports a ticker provided by Bitcoin.com; Ver is an advisor to MGT.)\n\nAs DeSantis puts it, “Most of the hardcore Bitcoiners are not good at talking to the press. They’d probably try to tell you about how the code is not the same and they’d go into some mathematical stuff and it would be a nightmare. You’d have a bunch of guys walking around, talking about math, and then other guys” — Wu, Ver, Bitcoin Unlimited — “saying, ‘We’re Bitcoin.com. Use Bitcoin.’” (DeSantis also notes that McAfee has been accused of murder and Ver is a convicted felon.)\n\nIn response, the Core team, DeSantis and other bitcoin developers are contemplating their version of the nuclear option: that they change the Bitcoin software so that it no longer works on the hardware currently running it. It would be as if Microsoft decided to change Office so that it no longer ran on PCs, rendering an entire industry useless. (Such a move would hit Wu, as both a manufacturer of the equipment and a mining pool operator, doubly hard.)\n\nBut Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core developer, says, “I’d rather that not happen. I think it’d be dangerous for the network to go down that route. It’s basically a warpath…. But all the players have to consider that these things might actually happen.”\n\nThe Defense\n\nBoth Ver and Wu deny that they plotted to bring online new mining facilities that would force a fork to Bitcoin Unlimited and then push that as the “true” version of bitcoin. Their criticisms of Core are somewhat similar: Both are unhappy that the team has ignored what they believe is a need for bigger blocks, and both have personal gripes about the developers.\n\nVer says that Core is ignoring very real problems that currently exist on the network that not only slow transaction times but therefore make transactions less safe altogether. He also says that they treated “horribly” several developers who had been deeply involved in developing the protocol when they advocated for increasing the block size.\n\nWu thinks that Bitcoin Core’s current proposal to make the network more efficient (for technical reasons, called SegWit) is good technology that solves a number of problems. However, he is angry that about a year ago, a number of Core developers and miners came to an agreement in Hong Kong to adopt both SegWit and a small block size increase. Since then, the developers have proceeded with what they wanted — SegWit — but not the bigger blocks the miners desired.\n\n(Calling the Hong Kong agreement “a diplomatic failure” and “botched,” Lombrozo wrote in an email, “The agreement was not signed by the Core team as a whole…it was signed by a few individual contributors and many of us felt that not only was it impossible to deliver what was expected but that it was contrary to the philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin. … Ultimately, protocol changes cannot be negotiated behind closed doors by small numbers of people.”)\n\nAs for theories that purchasers of his mining equipment would feel pressure to support Bitcoin Unlimited, Wu says, “We have to look at the facts — whether I have ever done this to my customers before. No, I have never. Because the customers give us money to buy equipment. Maybe I can talk to them, maybe I can convince them about what is the best interest of bitcoin miners, but I never force them to do anything because that is anti-bitcoin.”\n\nHe also notes that some of the computing power in the new mining facilities will mostly be rented out to other miners (10% of the Chinese facility will be controlled by Bitmain) and so those miners, and not Bitmain, will choose whether to run Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Core on their individual machines. However, despite a March 1 press release announcing MacPool would go online in Q2, he could not give a launch date for either facility and said both were delayed.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of the Core team changing the software so it no longer works on his mining equipment (which involves changing something called the proof-of-work, or POW, algorithm), Wu, who first learned about bitcoin in 2011 and launched his company in 2013, said he remembers the first time he heard this threat in a chat forum in early 2016: “I was astonished. Switching the POW algorithm of bitcoin was never the kind of idea you can think of. If someone disagrees with you, you decide to what? I decided this was very political and was about interests, it’s not only about engineering. If it was only an engineering debate, it would not escalate to this level.” His conclusion: “Since they are doing such threatening, I think it’s OK that we run another kind of software, Bitcoin Unlimited.”\n\nWu says if Bitcoin Unlimited gets enough network power, the fork will occur. This could create two coins — one with less value than the other, as happened last summer when the Ethereum network split into two, creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, the latter of which is worth a fraction of Ethereum even though it is technically the original chain. When asked why he would be willing to risk losing what could potentially not only be a huge sum of money but his entire business, Wu says, “I will reject your assumption” — meaning, he refused to even entertain the possibility that Bitcoin Unlimited would become the chain of lesser value.\n\nHypothetically, the final touches on the Bitcoin Unlimited nuclear option would be if, after the fork, Bitcoin Unlimited allocated some of its computer power to attacking the other chain so that it was unable to function properly. It would be possible technically since, in order to fork, it would need to gain 80% of the computing power, which means the other side would have a fraction right after the split. (Unlimited has ramped up steeply, rising from about 20% to 37% share over the last month, while Core fell from 80% to 62%. Another miner today announced support for Unlimited.) When asked if Wu would undermine Core, he wouldn’t rule it out: “It may not be necessary to attack it. But to attack it is always an option.” Another way of harming Bitcoin Core would be if supporters of Bitcoin Unlimited dumped all their Bitcoin Core bitcoins, driving down the price for Bitcoin Core coins.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin Core developers and DeSantis say they are working on a compromise to prevent the various nuclear options. Wu declined to comment on whether he is currently negotiating with anyone. However, just in case, Core is working on new versions of the software that wouldn’t run on current mining equipment.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nBack to our game theory analysis: The last group with an interest in bitcoin are the users, whose motivation is to make bitcoin transactions. (Note: exchanges have a role too, but they will ultimately follow the market, hence, for this discussion, we’ll lump them in with the users.) The way in which the network accommodates more transactions may be immaterial to many of them, making them neutral on the e-cash vs. digital gold question. However, their power over the system is economic: If, say, two versions of bitcoin came out — one that reflected the miners’ preferences and one that reflected the developers’ — the one that would prevail (or at least dominate, if both continued to exist) won’t necessarily be the one that the majority of miners support even though that network might be more robust. Nor would it necessarily be the one that the majority of developers support, even though that network might be perceived as being more technically sound or more decentralized. It would be whichever one the greatest number of investors put their faith in.\n\nWu suggests a futures contract to determine what the market response would be before any nuclear options are pursued. One currently on offer on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex shows Bitcoin Unlimited having a fraction of the value of Bitcoin Core. But Wu says the contract is not structured correctly and instead suggests one with three possible outcomes: Bitcoin Unlimited after a fork; Bitcoin Core after a fork; and Bitcoin Core as it is now, no forks. (The current contract could be lumping together the latter two possibilities into one.)\n\nWhether this death match ends in disaster or a truce remains to be seen. After all, Bitcoin\'s ""death"" has been pronounced many times. However, while Bitcoin’s price has been seesawing, the value of Ethereum has more than doubled in the past two weeks and quadrupled since January, giving it a market capitalization of almost $4 billion. Bitcoin’s has now risen to $18 billion by press time, though it was as low as $15.5 billion on Saturday. Still, many cryptocurrency traders talk of what they foresee as “the flippening” — the moment when Ethereum’s market capitalization surpasses that of bitcoin’s. Some industry players surmise that if bitcoin underwent some fiasco around the same time Ethereum gained more validation, the two market caps could cross and never reverse. (Bitcoin\'s block size debate may have also gotten at least one Ethereum developer contemplating reducing the reward to their miners.)\n\nLingham no longer even cares about DeSantis’s theory that Wu, Ver, McAfee and company planned to use their new mining facilities to force a fork to Bitcoin Unlimited. “I don’t want to delve into the details of whether this is true or not,” he says. “It’s irrelevant. The point is … this should not be possible in bitcoin.”\n\nDespite the bitter grudges held on both sides, multiple sources said that they thought the most likely outcome was that no hard fork would occur. “My suspicion is these people aren’t dumb enough to try to actually, in such a public way, get control of bitcoin because they know it would lead to a big price drop in general, no matter how good the outcome was,” says Peter Todd, a bitcoin protocol researcher who is aligned with DeSantis and Core. “I think the most likely scenario is that nothing will happen. I really mean nothing.”', 'Bitcoin is higher for a second straight day on Tuesday, trading up 6.5% at $1,110 a coin as of 2:13 p.m. ET.

Despite his fascination in cryptocurrency, he is currently working to become an architect in hopes to design a better world. Follow us www.Cryptocrooks.com www.Matthewhickey.nyc', 'GDAX, the cryptocurrency exchange run by Coinbase, has added margin trading to the platform.\n\nEligible traders can now trade up to 3X leveraged orders on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin order books.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with trading and exchanges, margin trading is when you borrow money from your broker to buy or sell more stock than you can afford. It’s essentially a short-term loan. By buying or selling on margin, traders can increase their leverage and buying power, potentially generating profits beyond what their own cash balance would have supported.\n\nThis feature is mainly geared toward institutional investors. That’s because Coinbase has launched the feature attempting to fit within the boundaries of the Commodity Exchange Act.\n\nThis means that traders have to certify that they meet one of the qualifications to be allowed to trade on margin. While the full list is here, the requirements include things like being a corporation with a net worth exceeding $1,000,000 and trading on margin in order to hedge risks associated with your business. Individuals need to have a minimum of $5,000,000 invested on a discretionary basis in order to be allowed to trade on margin.\n\nBy deciding to build their product within the guidelines of the Commodity Exchange Act, Coinbase has at least initially excluded a large segment of their user base. Other exchanges, like cex.io, offers margin trading to all users — but probably wouldn’t stand up to U.S. regulators.\n\nFor Coinbase, moving slowly and maintaining a favorable relationship with regulators is necessary if the company wants to stick around. The company explained: “we’re committed to working with regulators as the blockchain space continues to develop, rather than take on unnecessary risk just to get features out more quickly. Some other digital currency exchanges have decided not to do this. For us, the best approach was to carefully design our margin trading feature and engage with the CFTC to make sure that GDAX remains compliant.”\n\nAdditionally, the exchange isn’t currently charging interest or fees to access Margin Trading because they “believe that consumer lending laws require specific licenses to do this.”\n\nThis move should also please Wall Street investors who were waiting on the recently denied Bitcoin ETF application. With the combination of margin support plus the strict regulatory focus, Coinbase and GDAX could be an ETF alternative for investors wanting to safely purchase bitcoin now.\n\nFeatured Image: Thomas Trutschel/Getty Images', 'Bitcoin’s block size debate is seeping into the mainstream press, the Wall Street Journal states that the “bitter split in the developer community behind the virtual currency threatened to literally break it in two.” The article echoes statements made by investors such as Vinny Lingham, the Civic CEO and Gyft co-founder, who states “I’ve been very surprised with the amount of vocal support for a Bitcoin Hard Fork.”\n\nA fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community.\n\nThe scaling debate revolves around the size of Bitcoin blocks, which hold the networks transactions. Bitcoin Unlimited is a hard-fork of Bitcoin that raises the block size, but isn’t backwards compatible with the current source code. Lingham is concerned that a hard-fork in Bitcoin will result in two competing cryptocurrencies, or “altcoins.”\n\n- Vinny Lingham, Civic CEO and Gyft Co-Founder\n\nPrevious attempts to increase the block size limit by way of a hard-fork, such as Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT, have all failed. Bitcoin Unlimited is the latest such attempt, but 18 bitcoin exchanges released a statement last week indicating they will list Bitcoin Unlimited tokens as an alternative asset.\n\n“While a contentious forking event may be inevitable, and may ultimately provide a path forward for on-chain capacity increases, we have an obligation to our customers to provide a clear and consistent plan to minimize potential confusion surrounding such an event,” the announcement states. “In the case of a Bitcoin hardfork, we cannot suspend operations and wait for a winner to emerge.”\n\nHowever, a proposed soft-fork, Segregated Witness (SegWit), may increase the block size limit to over 2.1 megabytes, according to Bitfury’s Alex Petrov, based on current user activity. A soft-fork alters the current implementation of Bitcoin, maintaining a single cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the associated Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), the protocol change is scheduled to activate after 95 percent of the Bitcoin network\'s hashrate signals support, which is the deployment process outlined in BIP 9. Roughly 25 percent of miners are currently signaling readiness for Segregated Witness. According to Coin Dance, every major exchange and wallet provider is currently implementing or plans to implement Segregated Witness.\n\nThat said, a team of developers believe they have a second solution that will keep everyone on the same network. Paul Sztorc, who is an economist at enterprise blockchain startup Bloq, first introduced Drivechain late in 2015. The concept builds on sidechains, and promises to make altcoins, “obsolete.”\n\n- Paul Sztorc, Drivechain Creator\n\nSidechains themselves are not new. The idea, and how to build them, has been discussed since 2014. The key idea revolves around sending a cryptocurrency to another blockchain. R3 Chief Technology Officer Richard Gendal Brown describes these blockchains as, “a Bitcoin-like system out there that you’d like to use.”\n\n“Perhaps it’s litecoin or ethereum or perhaps it’s something brand new,” Gendal Brown presupposes. “Maybe it has a faster block confirmation interval and a richer scripting language. It doesn’t matter. The point is: you’d like to use it but would rather not have to go through the risk and effort of buying the native tokens for that platform.”\n\nSztorc explains how that process might work in drivechains, “You could take 3 BTC, use them to purchase 3 side-Litecoin at a fixed 1:1 exchange rate, send those Litecoin to a friend on the Litecoin-chain, and then this friend can then redeem them at the same same 1:1 exchange rate (for exactly 3 BTC, which re-appears on the Bitcoin chain).”\n\n“It would take me all of five minutes to change the block size on a bitcoin fork,” Bitcoin developer Patrick Murphy tells BraveNewCoin. “I bet it would take an hour to get it all finished on the slow side.” Murphy is currently finalizing an implementation of drivechains.\n\n- Drivechain\n\nSztorc tells BraveNewCoin he has been working on a new website explaining the drivechain concept, and a variety of alternative blockchain projects are already listed on the site. The project that will catch the eye of big block supporters is known as Extended Bitcoin.\n\nThe project is simply the current version of Bitcoin Core with Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 101 implemented on top of it. BIP 101 is the hard-fork block size increase implemented in former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn’s Bitcoin XT software client.\n\nAccording to Sztorc’s original post on the subject, he does not think drivechains can do anything bad to bitcoin; however, there are some concerns among the greater technical community. Miners have to agree to start merged mining on the various blockchain chains, where two or more different cryptocurrencies based on the same algorithm are mined simultaneously.\n\n“Lot\'s of people hate merged mining and lots of people hate miners having power,” Murphy told BraveNewCoin. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd has stated that merge mined sidechains are, “much less secure,” and could lead to further centralization of the mining industry.\n\nHowever, Sztorc believes he has ""risen to the challenge"" of these technical concerns through the use of what he calls blind merged mining. ""When I describe sidechains to people, most people think \'it\'s too good to be true\'...it\'s\u200b a kind of reverse wishful thinking,"" Sztorc explains. ""Well, they\'re good, and they\'re true. And they\'re almost finished.""\n\nA third iteration of a drivechain implementation is currently being completed, and will be presented to the greater technical community for feedback and bug testing. “We’re trying to get something finished enough to prove the idea, and then we’ll have the developer community tear apart everything and go from there,” Murphy told BraveNewCoin.\n\nAfter further technical review, it will then be up to the greater community to decide whether this is something they’d like to see in bitcoin. However, enabling each new sidechain in bitcoin would, according to Murphy, require a separate soft-fork change to bitcoin’s consensus rules.\n\n- Patrick Murphy, Drivechain developer', 'This material was created in partnership with Bitcoin Bazis\n\nEveryone in the Bitcoin industry and all of the enthusiasts wowed cheerfully for the Bitcoin acceptance of expedia.com. The travel bookings giant made a significant step forward and issued a statement that they will accept Bitcoin earlier in 2014.\n\nWe tried it out, the question was simple: does that really work from Eastern Europe? The answer: nothing happens. Nothing at all. You can pay with your credit card or PayPal, you can use other conventional payment systems but you cannot pay with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin payment option appears and soon disappears\n\nThe story begins really well. Everybody knew what expedia.com said about Bitcoin acceptance earlier in 2014. To refresh our memory, here were their words:\n\n""Bitcoin is a great example of how Expedia is investing early in an array of payment options to give our customers and partners more choice in the ways they interact with us,” expedia.com told Coindesk. “Customers simply indicate Bitcoin as their method of payment and then follow a few steps to safely and securely complete each transaction.”\n\nThe statements were once appropriate, you can only use Bitcoins to book hotels. Maybe, you could, but now you can’t.\n\nStatements and reality don’t match\n\nAfter a year the good mood of the travel bookings giant had a bit shutter. In 2015, 40 percent of the Bitcoin payment orders flew away with the Bitcoin price decline.\n\nThough statements were made, as this:\n\n""We accept Bitcoin as a way of just allowing customers to pay with whatever method they want to pay. For us, Bitcoin is on an even playing field with the other payment types we offer.""\n\nIn 2015, they added:\n\n""We accept Bitcoin on hotels only where we are a merchant of record. So for some of the hotels that we sell we are the merchant, meaning that you, as a customer are the one paying on our site directly when you are trying to book.""\n\nSo, we tried booking, but no Bitcoin paying possibility.\n\nThough there is a long Terms and Condition list on Expedia’s website, you can’t pay with Bitcoin. Or maybe it is just not possible to do so from Hungary.\n\nKeeping a low profile?\n\nSo, now in 2017, you cannot find any possibilities to pay with your Bitcoins. We tried to reach Expedia’s press office.\n\nWe asked a few simple questions: Is there an opportunity to pay with Bitcoin on your website? Is it public how many Bitcoin users could use - or maybe used the website and the expedia.com? Will there be an opportunity to pay with cryptocurrencies, if yes, when? Nobody answers anything.\n\nCointelegraph tried to reach other travel and hospitality service giants, like booking.com, or Airbnb, surprisingly no answer came. After Bitcoin steadily reached and passed the red $1000 barrier, it seems no travel services can be bought with Bitcoin from the major service providers.\n\nBy Tamas Csizmadia', 'The cryptocurrency industry is developing with incredible scope, no wonder entrepreneurs are seeking to occupy certain niches to meet demands of the public. At this point, it is important for the industry players to review the current state and discuss pressing challenges to facilitate further development.\n\nOn March 9, Tallinn hosted a Blockchain-related conference, which became the largest one ever organized in the Baltic states. Despite the fact that technology and its main derivative, Bitcoin, still seem to be alien to a majority of people, the event has attracted a huge interest, with approximately 250 guests from over 20 countries.\n\nEstonia is the leader in digitization\n\nEvent management company Smile-Expo has chosen Tallinn for a Blockchain Conference due to a more than favorable digital environment and the huge support received from the government bodies for organization of technology-oriented projects. Estonia is often viewed as a country leading in certain fields of digitization and business convenience industries.\n\nA number of prominent industry experts, including Jon Matonis, Founding Director at Bitcoin Foundation, Kaspar Korjus, e-Residency Managing Director, Karolina Marzantowicz, Distinguished Engineer at Polish branch of IBM, Kaidi Ruusalepp, Founder of Funderbeam, shared their experience of implementing Blockchain technology solutions in governmental institutions, banking system, trading, media, healthcare and other fields.\n\nThey discussed challenges of the new industry, including regulatory issues, trends in public recognition of cryptocurrencies, advantages and limitations of public and private Blockchains, key players in the Blockchain technology industry, and strategies that can be followed by consortiums.\n\nBlockchain revolutionizing Govtech\n\nThe potential of Blockchain technology is endless, many speakers discussed its applications that go far beyond the financial services, for instance for patents registration, establishment of private banks and universal European databases.\n\nManaging Director of E-residency, Kaspar Korjus, shared with the audience the operating principles of his own project and application of Blockchain technology in its infrastructure.\n\nKorjus said:\n\n“There is no other place for Blockchain discussions than here in Tallinn. Blockchain itself is nothing, it needs to be considered together with digital identity, legal environment and efficient e-governance. Only then we will start to understand its real impact.”\n\nKaspar Korjus presented an unprecedented electronic residency project which allowed 18,000 and 1,300 companies from 136 countries becoming Estonian residents.\n\nPublic or private?\n\nJon Matonis, famous Bitcoin-evangelist and founder of Bitcoin Foundation gave a speech regarding Blockchain consortiums reviewing attempts of global corporate finance giants in taming Blockchain technology.\n\nHe emphasized that although private Blockchains are beneficial in the short-term, in the long run, they are useless due to their absolute isolation. To exist they would require communication with the outside systems which can be ensured only in the public Blockchains.\n\nMatonis commented:\n\n“Public Blockchains will always have more advantages comparing to private Blockchains, mostly due to their attractiveness for developers. Their nature itself implies more opportunities for innovations.”\n\nA call for partnership\n\nKarolina, Marzantowicz, a representative from Polish branch of IBM said that Blockchain technology will change the digital economy, however, it will require financiers to be more open for cooperation in the field. She added that financial institutions are aware of the advantages of Blockchain technology, however, their presence on the market is not that significant.\n\nJuri Laur, head of the Payment Service of the leading Estonian bank LHV, one of the first in the world to implement Blockchain in their operations commented:\n\n“Banks haven’t implemented Blockchain technology yet for regulation reasons. You shouldn’t use Blockchain in order to just use it. Blockchain without cryptocurrencies is only a half of the battle.”\n\nDon’t try to regulate what initially cannot be regulated\n\nPavel Kravchenko, founder of Distributed Lab presented his project openbankIT, which deploys Blockchain technology for building an open-source banking platform for e-money management.\n\nThe product aims to eliminate technological barriers between financial institutions guaranteeing the highest level of transparency and reliability. Not requiring any specialized equipment openbankIT allows users, banks, merchants and financial institutions customizing the platform to serve their needs.\n\nKravchenko believes that the success of Bitcoin is mainly related to the fact that it pioneered the world of cryptocurrencies, however today it solves only a limited range of issues, such as for example the speed and the cost of transactions.\n\nHe commented:\n\n“The beauty of Bitcoin is in that it allows to avoid regulators. This is actually the biggest contradiction. A tool which allows avoiding regulations cannot be regulated, therefore if you ask me when the adoption of Bitcoin will reach the level of that of traditional money, my reply to you will be - Never.”\n\nTrue that many governments express a certain level of suspicion and mistrust towards cryptocurrencies, seeing them as a source of problems rather than a solution to existing issues in the financial system.\n\nExecutives from the Bank of Estonia and LHV Bank were spotted at the event, what shows that key financial institutions are open up for a change and do not intend to stay away from innovation.\n\nThe conference was not all about discussions on a more general level. Representatives from Emercoin, WageCan, OpenLedger, HashCoins, BitcoinChaser, and Cryptopay presented their solutions that already work.\n\nThe next round of Blockchain and Bitcoin Conference will take place in Moscow and Prague. Later on, a similar event will be hosted by Kiev.', '']"
03/22/2017,"['Bitcoin is under pressure. Selling on Wednesday has the cryptocurrency down 10.5% at $997 a coin, where it is now more than 20% below its all-time high from earlier this month.\n\nThere\'s no obvious trigger for the drop, but trading in bitcoin has been extremely volatile lately as traders parse through a large amount of headline risk.\n\nOn March 10, when the price peaked, sellers slammed bitcoin below the $1,000 level after the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the Winklevoss\' twins plans for a bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe SEC said it was ""disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.""\n\nBitcoin quickly recovered those losses, but plunged just four days later after The Wall Street Journal reported that developers were threatening to set up a ""hard fork,"" or alternative marketplace for bitcoin.\n\nThe new platform would be incompatible with the current platform, thus creating a split and two versions of the currency. That news sent bitcoin crashing 20% over the weekend to about $950 a coin, its weakest since January.\n\nAnd that\'s not all\n\nFor most of 2017 a Chinese crackdown on trading has been in the news. With nearly 100% of all transactions coming from Chinese exchanges, Beijing announced it was cracking down on the cryptocurrency. That caused China\'s three biggest exchanges to first implement a 0.2% transaction fee on all trades before eventually blocking customers from withdrawing their bitcoin.\n\nChinese regulators have not yet allowed withdrawals to continue. On Tuesday, China\'s biggest bitcoin exchanges announced they would start asking customers for proof of fund sources and withdrawal destinations. While that might be one of the final steps before allowing withdrawals to continue, it shows further evidence of China looking to reign in the market.\n\nAnd even if that happens, there\'s more headlines to come this month. The SEC is set to make two more rulings on bitcoin ETFs, with the first due by March 30.', ""Previously, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin price declined to $926 due to hard fork contingency and the likelihood of Bitcoin Unlimited being forked by its closed group of developers. Bitcoin price bounced back to $1,115 in the earning morning of March 22.\n\nHowever, almost immediately after Bitcoin price recovered back to the $1,115 margin, it plummeted to $1,010, due to the ambiguity surrounding the execution of the Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork. Because of the possibility of Bitcoin Unlimited creating a split chains and two tokens of the Bitcoin network, both investors and traders worry that the introduction of BTU (Bitcoin Unlimited token) will lead to the decline of Bitcoin price in the short term.\n\nOver the past few days, Bitcoin price highly fluctuated for the abovementioned reason. On March 19, Bitcoin price declined by 16 percent in one day as the tension between Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Bitcoin Unlimited supporters intensified. As long as support for Bitcoin Unlimited continues to rise as a result of the allocation of hash power from China, Bitcoin price will continue to fluctuate and fail to stabilize.\n\nSecond Bitcoin Unlimited bug & patch\n\nCurrently, the entire market, including the Bitcoin community, miners, developers and businesses are focused on the development of the block size debate and the progression of Bitcoin Unlimited. An increasing number of miners in China are starting to show their strong support toward Bitcoin Unlimited with the fear that off-chain transactions made by innovative solutions such as Lightning will decrease their revenues.\n\nAlthough the miner profitability issue was already addressed by experts including BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp, miners in China are still concerned that the reduction of on-chain transactions will lead to lessened miner revenue. This concept emerged due to some of the miners’ failure in understanding that SegWit is, in fact, a real and actual scalability solution which can expand bitcoin block size by up to 3.7 times.\n\nEarlier today, Cointelegraph revealed that the second Bitcoin Unlimited bug was discovered by its developers. As a temporary response, Bitcoin Unlimited developers released a closed-source code in order to prevent the bug from affecting miners and node operators.\n\nThe community is worried about a buggy and a faulty piece of software that is being developed by a closed group of developers will be forked and branded as Bitcoin. Lopp also noted that engineers like himself will never attempt to run unstable software as they are responsible for the well-being of their IT system and architecture.\n\nI'm the guy who gets paged in the middle of the night if our infrastructure blows up. I won't run unstable software. https://t.co/pf5LDh2Pih — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) March 21, 2017\n\nIf the hash power in support for Bitcoin Unlimited continues to rise, Bitcoin price will fluctuate intensely in the upcoming days. On the contrary, if the support for Bitcoin Unlimited dwindles due to the emergence of bugs and internal errors, as security and Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos stated, the probability of Bitcoin Unlimited being forked will be less than 10 percent."", 'A group of hackers is threatening to wipe data from millions of Apple devices in two weeks if the company doesn’t pay them US$150,000.\n\nThe group, which calls itself Turkish Crime Family, claims to have login credentials for more than 627 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com email addresses. These are email domains that Apple has allowed for users creating iCloud accounts over the years.\n\nEven though the Turkish Crime Family hasn\'t been in the media spotlight before, its members claim that they\'ve been involved in selling stolen online databases in private circles for the past few years.\n\nThe group said via email that it has had a database of about 519 million iCloud credentials for some time, but did not attempt to sell it until now. The interest for such accounts on the black market has been low due to security measures Apple has put in place in recent years, it said.\n\nSince announcing its plan to wipe devices associated with iCloud accounts, the group claimed that other hackers have stepped forward and shared additional account credentials with them, putting the current number it holds at over 627 million.\n\nAccording to the hackers, over 220 million of these credentials have been verified to work and provide access to iCloud accounts that don\'t have security measures like two-factor authentication turned on.\n\nThis was determined by testing the credentials using automated scripts and a very large number of proxy servers to avoid getting banned by Apple, the hackers said.\n\nInitially the group asked Apple for the equivalent of $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrency. The ransom value has been raised to $150,000 and the group intends to increase it further if Apple doesn\'t pay in three days.\n\nNews website Motherboard reported seeing alleged emails between the hackers and Apple in which a member of the company\'s security team said that the company does not plan to reward cybercriminals for breaking the law and that the communications have been archived and sent to the authorities.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the absence of payment, the group plans to launch an automated attack on April 7 that would log into iCloud accounts and wipe their contents and the devices associated with them.\n\n""We are doing this because we can and mainly to spread awareness for Karim Baratov and Kerem Albayrak, which both are being detained for the Yahoo hack and one of them is most probably facing heavy sentencing in America,"" a representative for the group said via email. ""Kerem Albayrak on the other hand is being accused of listing the database for sale online.""\n\nThe representative said that the group\'s members are originally from Istanbul, Turkey, but that they now ""rep"" Green Lanes, an area in North London.\n\nKarim Baratov, a Canadian national, was indicted last week for allegedly hacking into email accounts at various email providers at the request of two officers from the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB. The same indictment accuses the two FSB officers and a Russian hacker for breaking into Yahoo\'s infrastructure and gaining access to over 500 million Yahoo accounts.\n\nThe Turkish Crime Family\'s claims haven\'t been confirmed by Apple so far, but someone posted a video on YouTube showing some of the leaked credentials being used to access iCloud accounts.\n\nThe group claims that the person who posted the video is not one of their members, but that he had access to one of the servers hosting their database, which is how he managed to get the credentials and record the video.\n\nThe video shows usernames and passwords in plain text, even though Apple most likely doesn\'t store passwords in plain text in its database. This would be a very bad security practice and one that serious websites have avoided for many years.\n\nHowever, it is possible that these passwords were stolen as part of other breaches or cracked from stolen cryptographic hashes and then matched to iCloud accounts due to password reuse practices. Most passwords shown in the video are not complex enough to withstand brute-force attacks.\n\nIf Apple does confirm the group\'s claims, it could force password resets for its entire iCloud user base just to be on the safe side. Until then, concerned users can change their passwords on their own and turn on the iCloud two-factor authentication feature.', 'Digital currency exchange Coinbase has received approval from New York’s financial regulator to offer trading of Ethereum and Litecoin to users in the state. The crypto exchange was also given the green light to offer ‘Shift Card’, its debit card service, in the state.\n\nCoinbase becomes the second cryptocurrency exchange to see its application to offer Ethereum trading approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS). Notably, Coinbase is also the first approved exchange to offer Litecoin trading for New York users, starting today.\n\nThe state’s financial regulator previously granted approval for Ethereum trading to Gemini, an exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers, in May 2016.\n\nCoinbase will also be permitted to offer its bitcoin debit card service, first launched across 24 states in November 2015. Launched to much publicity, Coinbase’s ‘Shift Card’ became the first bitcoin debit card in the United States.\n\nIn its announcement, today, the DFS claims it has “rapidly responded to innovations” by issuing licenses and charters to financial technologies.\n\nIn statements, DFS Superintendent Maria Vullo said:\n\nNew York continues to lead the nation in fostering financial technology by responsibly promoting innovation and protecting consumers. DFS has proven that the state regulatory system is the best way to supervise and cultivate a thriving fintech industry, like virtual currency.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, Vullo then adds that the DFS will oppose the federal effort of the US Treasury Department’s initiative to consider granting charters to allow Fintech companies operate as special purpose national banks.\n\n“New York will remain steadfast in pushing back against federal encroachment efforts like the OCC’s proposal to impose a one-size-fits-all national bank charter that increases risk and seeks to usurp state sovereignty,” Vullo stated.\n\nThe department’s BitLicense, which has frequently seen criticism for restrictive regulations for the cryptocurrency industry, has so far granted a total of three licenses since it came into effect in 2014.\n\nCircle became the first company in the industry to gain a BitLicense in September 2015. Ripple followed in mid-2016, granting Ripple Labs the approval to sell and obtain its native digital asset, XRP. Coinbase became the third company to gain the license in January this year, seeing approval to offer bitcoin trading, storage, and transmission for New York customers. Gemini is operational in New York after receiving a DFS charter to offer services in the state. Regulated as a fiduciary, it is exempt from requiring a BitLicense and can service both individual and institutional clients.\n\n“At Coinbase, our first priority is to ensure that we operate the most secure and compliant digital currency exchange in the world,” stated Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong upon receiving approval today.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'While San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Coinbase locks horns with the IRS for the upcoming trial, a blockchain governance firm has unveiled a tax reporting software that will allow Americans to report their digital currency gains.\n\nLaunched today, the software is developed by New York-based governance firm Node40, commonly known as the masternode host provider for Dash, a prominent cryptocurrency.\n\nThe software, named ‘Node40 Balance’, performs cost-bases calculations on net gains and losses on all transactions in a calendar year. Data sourced from the blockchain before directly filing details into IRS Form 8949. The form seeks taxpayers to report capital gains and losses from transactions related to investment property.\n\n“A simple FIFO [First In First Out] strategy is not sufficient in dealing with digital currency transactions,” stated Node40 CEO Perry Woodin in a statement. A method of asset valuation, FIFO assumes that the first assets produced or acquired are the first products sold. The valuation is frequently used for traditional investments where assets are seen as whole units.\n\nWoodin claims the method to be inadequate for digital currencies where transactions will have multiple inputs, stating “Node40 Balance uses the true carry cost and days held to calculate precise valuations that ensure you are not over-reporting your tax liability.”\n\nThe software sees its launch after a two-year development cycle which included a beta program involving real-world testing by Dash traders, miners, accountants, lawyers and tax professionals. It is designed to work for individuals, small businesses, large corporations as well as government departments to file taxes.\n\nWoodin added:\n\nNode40 Balance analyzes the blockchain and provides valuation data for all your transactions. You annotate your transactions according to your real-world needs and Node40 Balance provide reports with your gains, losses and income.\n\nAt launch, the software supports the Dash blockchain and Node40 adds that bitcoin users will be able to use the software before the next tax season later this year.\n\nThe software release comes within days after the IRS stated that, during the course of its investigation into Coinbase, less than 1,000 users were declaring bitcoin earnings each year. The standoff between the tax agency and the bitcoin exchange continues after the IRS filed a civil petition targeting bitcoin transactions of Coinbase users in November.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""LONDON, March 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Starting March 2017, the leading Bitcoin service provider SpectroCoin extends support to over 41 different cryptocurrencies.

The company was founded in 2011, and their actions generally indicate the future direction of the industry.\n\n“When we started in 2011, we would be excited to get five or six transactions through BitPay in a day.” said Pair in a fireside chat with Gallippi, held during the recent Distributed: Markets 2017 conference in Atlanta.\n\nBitPay would go on to cut deals with the likes of Microsoft, Newegg, Expedia and other major corporate customers to provide payment processing services.\n\nChallenges for Bitcoin’s Use in Consumer Payments\n\nWhile many early Bitcoin adopters claimed the P2P digital cash system was going to replace the use of credit cards and completely overthrow the banking system in 2013, things haven’t exactly panned out that way — at least not yet.\n\nBitcoin is currently dealing with some issues as a consumer payments platform, mainly because the system is experiencing growth at a rate faster than it can safely scale.\n\n“We have seen an increase in customer service inquiries because of transaction confirmation delays for bitcoin purchasers,” Pair told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview. “We’re also seeing substantially higher transaction fees on our own settlement transactions.”\n\nRecently, BitPay decided to stop covering Bitcoin network fees on invoice payments.\n\n“This friction is making us get more creative in how we do user experience design for delayed payment states on the BitPay platform,” said Pair. “Often delays are an educational opportunity to explain how the Bitcoin network works and point people to wallets that use dynamic transaction fees. Copay and BitPay wallet users have been largely immune from transaction delays because their wallets calculate transaction fees dynamically.\n\n“Our designers and engineers are constantly attuned to how we can make using Bitcoin intuitive,” Pair added.\n\nThe lightning network is a proposed method of dealing with the issues related to transaction delays and higher transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. The transaction caching layer would effectively enable potentially improved versions of many of the features people have associated with Bitcoin in the past, such as instant transactions at nearly no cost.\n\n“We’re exploring all possible solutions for scalability,” Pair said. “It’s not a surprise to us that Bitcoin needs to scale — scalability is something we’ve been thinking about for years. The only surprise is that while we anticipated short-term bumps in the throughput, we thought that changes for more on-chain throughput would have happened a couple of years ago. This slow movement to increase network throughput is something we did not foresee. At some point we’re going to reach an actual scalability limit that will only be overcome through solutions like these.”\n\nSome have wondered whether companies like BitPay may turn away from Bitcoin and toward alternative options, such as altcoins or permissioned blockchains, due to the historically high U.S.-dollar-denominated fees and general congestion on the network.\n\n“We have carefully studied the most significant alternatives to the Bitcoin blockchain and have concluded that none of them are compelling,” Pair responded.\n\nBitcoin’s Use in Consumer Payments Is Still Growing\n\nAlthough Pair admitted Bitcoin has some issues with scaling right now, BitPay is still seeing growth in the use of the technology among consumers.\n\n“Bitcoin is the fastest, most secure and most cost-effective means of doing value transfer on the internet,” said Pair. “We think of ourselves as a payment innovator, and from a functional perspective, consumer payments and B2B payments are no different on the Bitcoin network and on BitPay’s platform.”\n\nAt the Distributed: Markets fireside chat, Gallippi claimed that their transaction count has more than doubled over the past year. Much of that growth, he said, has been seen in the areas of digital goods and video games. Specifically, he pointed to digital distribution platform Steam’s acceptance of bitcoin through BitPay as a source of this growth, and pointed out that there is a lot of overlap between the Bitcoin and gamer communities;\n\nGrowth for Bitcoin Outside of Consumer Payments\n\nIn addition to continued growth in the area of consumer payments, Pair noted that BitPay is also seeing growth in the use of Bitcoin for B2B money transfers.\n\n“We’re seeing significant interest and transaction volume growth from businesses that need to transfer value to other businesses,” said Pair. “Bitcoin is a fantastic solution for these business-to-business transfers, especially when it comes to international payments, where bank transfers are still slow and inefficient.\n\n“They’re using our platform for billing and settling internationally with a lot of their suppliers,” Pair stated during the fireside chat.\n\nGallippi added that there has been an uptick in the use of Bitcoin for payment disbursements.\n\n“It’s not that easy to pay people on a regular basis to the majority of the world. Eastern Europe, Israel, Africa, India [and] the Middle East — where a lot of these apps are being [developed] — it’s very difficult to pay them,” said Gallippi, as he explained how app stores pay developers who sell apps on their store.\n\nGallippi noted that for the app store example or digital marketing companies, BitPay can receive one payment from the business and then disburse payments in bitcoin at all of the endpoints.\n\n“We built that product originally because we had our own needs to pay our own employees in bitcoin,” added Pair. “We’ve got a lot of Fortune 500 companies coming to us now every day asking us to solve these kinds of payments problems.”', 'West Africa’s fastest growing web-hosting brand – HostNowNow now accepts Bitcoin payment for all its services!\n\nA statement from the organisation on Monday, said clients can now pay with Bitcoin for services such as: Shared and Cloud Hosting, Virtual and Dedicated Servers, Domain Registration, Server Management, SiteLock, SSL and other technical-related services.\n\nAccording to the President & Co-Founder, HostNowNow, Olorunsheyi Emmanuel, the company took this stride because of its international appetite to capture the entire African region market before year end; starting with West Africa.\n\nHe observed that accepting payments in other local currencies had been a major challenge in the sector, adding that with this unique solution, anyone from any part of the world can now patronise HostNowNow.\n\n“There were HostNowNow clients resident in other countries who couldn’t pay for services, using the traditional payment methods like PayPal or local debit cards.

Photo by Casey Jaywork. Image has been slightly stretched to fit.\n\nWashington pot shops are typically cash-only. Shopping at one, you’ll usually see one or two cheap, portable ATMs that charge $2.95 per withdraw. You can only get multiples of $5 or sometimes $20.\n\nThere are a few shops in town that will let you pay your budtender with a debit card. From a customer’s perspective this is more convenient that slogging through the ATM interface. Functionally, though, it’s the same thing: the cashier runs your debit card through an ATM that’s integrated into their cash register instead of a monolithic box. It’s an ATM in a cheap tuxedo. You still have to pay the withdraw fee, and you still have to withdraw/buy an amount that is a multiple of the ATM’s minimum.\n\nBut no credit cards. Why? Because big banks and finance companies are nervous about getting in trouble with federal regulators if they finance purchases of a Schedule I prohibited substance, even if that substance has been legalized by state voters. Seattle pot lawyer Daniel Shortt explains: “It’s not that banking is absolutely unavailable. It’s that banks are very risk averse, and larger banks are aware that dealing [with] cannabis brings a host of federal liability.” For this reason, Washington’s legal pot stores have been cash-only since they first started opening for business in 2014. That creates a problem, says Shortt, as well as an opportunity. “The lack of access to banking is going to create opportunity for entrepreneurs” to create “workarounds,” he says.\n\nEnter POSaBIT, a Pioneer Square-based startup that’s using bitcoin (a kind of virtual currency) to let pot customers pay without cash. “I saw an industry that was in dire need of a credit solution,” says POSaBIT CEO and co-founder Ryan Hamlin, a former Microsoft executive. “I said, ‘Software has got to be able to solve this problem’” by eliminating cash from the transaction. He calls POSaBIT a “bitcoin kiosk solution.”\n\nHere’s how the company’s website describes its service:\n\n“POSaBIT gives consumers easy access to bitcoin by allowing them to purchase bitcoin during the retail experience. These wallets can be used to make purchases on the spot or anywhere that accepts bitcoin such as Amazon.com.”\n\nThe upshot for customers is that now, at a handful of pot shops, they can easily swipe plastic to buy a gram. POSaBIT is currently available at all three Uncle Ike’s locations, A Greener Today, Herb’s House, and Queen Anne Cannabis Company. It’s also available at some other pot stores in the state and some other non-pot stores in Seattle, according to Hamlin.\n\nUncle Ike’s starting offering POSaBIT “a week or two ago,” says owner Ian Eisenberg. He says it’s “too early” to say what kind of effect it’s having on business, if any.\n\nThe checkout experience of buying pot through POSaBIT is barely distinguishable from typical tablet checkout (via, for insance, Square) you might do at an independent coffee shop. Hand over your credit card for a quick swipe, authorize the transaction, and sign on the touchpad. You can even add a tip. There’s a flat $2 charge each time you use POSaBIT, and an upper limit of $150 “to limit any exposure to Bitcoin abuse,” says Hamlin. He says that limit will eventually double.\n\nHamlin explains that the crucial feature of his service (from a legal liability standpoint) is that customers who buy bitcoins from POSaBIT kiosks inside pot shops can choose to walk out of the store with those bitcoins and without ever buying any pot. There’s nothing requiring them to spend the bitcoins in the store. Hence Hamlin and POSaBIT’s ability to plausibly argue that this isn’t just money laundering scheme; it’s a legitimate currency changing service that fortuitously happens to all but remove friction between legally-sold pot and your credit card.\n\n“We are selling bitcoin to [individual] customers, and allow our [pot store] customers to accept bitcoin as payment,” says Hamlin. “Obviously federal laws prohibit using credit cards to purchase cannabis,” he says. “That’s exactly what we’re not doing.”\n\nHamlin says the company rolled out pilot locations last summer in Seattle, and has been operating “in stealth mode,” since January. To ensure that POSaBIT is in compliance with everyone and everything, the company became licensed with the state as a money transmitter/currency exchanger. They do an internal audit twice a year, Hamlin says, and had a legal team from the firm Perkins Couie carefully review their plans. “They’ve vetted everything,” he says. The result: a “rich anti-money laundering policy” that serves as the “secret sauce” of POSaBIT’s business model.\n\nUPDATE Some of the comments on this story suggested that banks might cancel the accounts of people who use POSaBIT at pot shops. We asked Ann Flannigan, vice president of public relations at WSECU, about this. Short answer: nope.\n\nLong answer:\n\n“WSECU sees purchases run through our system now on credit and debit cards for bitcoin exchange. And although there is uncertainty around virtual currency, it is legal in the U.S. We do not block these kind of transactions for money services. In the case you raised, we don’t believe the location of the machine offering the exchange is relevant, nor is what the person is going to purchase with the virtual currency. It’s analogous to credit union members using their debit or credit cards at ATM machines found at some retail marijuana locations to withdraw cash to pay for their purchases. Those transactions are coded simply as an ATM withdrawal. It doesn’t matter that the machine is in [a pot shop]. Purchases from legally-licensed marijuana related businesses are just that: legal under state law. As a financial institution, we don’t have a stake in how a consumer pays for what they buy.”']"
03/23/2017,"['The bitcoin ETF may still rise.\n\nAfter a March 10 Securities and Exchange Commission ruling that nixed an official exchange-traded fund for bitcoin, many saw the issue as settled. But Bats BZX Exchange, which would have listed the ETF on its exchange, has revealed it will appeal the SEC’s decision.\n\nThe SEC turned down the ETF earlier this month because the online exchanges that bitcoin is traded on are not regulated, and therefore susceptible to fraud and other manipulation. (Read: Everything You Need to Know About the Bitcoin ETF.) Had the ETF been approved, it would have tracked the price of bitcoin and made buying and selling them as simple as a stock transaction.\n\nThe ETF, known as the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, was created by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who were made famous (and quite rich) thanks to their lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg over their involvement in Facebook’s creation. The two brothers have been trying for years to bring bitcoin to the mainstream, and the failure to get approval for their ETF is a big blow to that cause.\n\nAlthough bitcoin has been around since 2009, it didn’t really become part of public consciousness until 2013, at which point its value skyrocketed from around $140 in late October of that year to more than $1,100 a month later, according to Coin Desk. But almost as fast as the price shot up, it crashed back down. Since then, it has taken more than three years for bitcoin’s price to make it back to the $1,100 mark, finally reaching it in January.\n\nOne bitcoin currently trades for $1,047, down from $1,258 before the SEC’s ruling. Large price swings in short time frames like that have happened frequently in bitcoin’s past, and that volatility was another reason the SEC declined to accept the Winklevoss ETF. Unlike other currencies such as the U.S. dollar or the Euro, whose values change incrementally and in a fairly predictable fashion, price fluctuations in bitcoin can be absolutely monstrous and it isn’t always obvious what is making the price move.\n\nOne thing to note is that even though Bats will appeal the decision, there is no guarantee that the SEC even has to act on it in any way, let alone actually reconsider its choice. But if the ETF is approved, it would likely move bitcoin from being seen as a curiosity on Wall Street to being something investors see as worth legitimate attention for the first time.', 'A small group of bitcoin industry leaders, developers and miners are planning to discuss the digital currency\'s development roadmap at an invite-only meeting in May.\n\nA notice of the gathering, as well as a list of potential guests, was posted to a private mailing list today, with participants reportedly including major players from the ongoing, and recently active, scaling debate.\n\nBitcoin.com owner Roger Ver, Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith are among those listed as possible attendees.\n\nOther participants suggested to be attending include Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, an undecided representative from BitGo and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert.\n\n""It is certainly my hope that each of you see somebody below that you know and trust to advocate for – and hopefully agree on – a path forward that is best for our industry,"" Silbert wrote in the mailing list message.\n\nDCG confirmed it is helping to organize the meeting, which would be held in New York in May.\n\nBitPay CEO Stephen Pair and Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu confirmed they were participating in statements to CoinDesk.\n\nThough some declined to comment, others indicated that they are keen to use the venue as a way to increase their understanding of ongoing disagreements.\n\n""I am hoping to better understand what those that want a hard fork are hoping to achieve.

Ethereum? It’s the ghostly sounding name for a so-called blockchain technology similar to the one that made the digital currency bitcoin possible. Its inventor, Vitalik Buterin, released his software to the world in 2015, not long after dropping out of the University of Waterloo, in Canada. Less than two years later, JPMorgan, BP, Microsoft, International Business Machines, and ING are among the companies in the group experimenting with it.\n\nButerin didn’t attend the EEA meeting, but he had a video message to deliver. Except the EEA couldn’t get the video to play, because the computer hosting it crashed. As the crowd began to stir, a frozen frame of Buterin’s face came on-screen, then he disappeared. After the tech crew scrambled for 30 minutes, they finally got it to work.\n\nIt’s an apt metaphor for a technology that’s come with enormous promises but suffered setbacks almost from its inception. Last year, hackers stole $60 million worth of ether, the digital currency linked to Ethereum. The heist was a huge black eye—chances are, if you’ve heard about Ethereum, it’s because of the hack. And yet it isn’t dead. The reason: Unlike bitcoin, this blockchain isn’t really about currency. Its advocates think it could be a universally accessible machine for running businesses.\n\n“Ethereum gives you a new way for the computer to interact with the real world and how money moves,” says Emin Gun Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University. “It’s potentially a huge game changer whose value has yet to be tapped.”\n\nThink of Ethereum as a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement\n\nTo understand what the excitement is about, it helps to start with bitcoin, because without it, there would be no blockchain. Previous attempts to create digital money that could be sent as easily as email ran into a problem: How do you guarantee that each virtual dollar is unique, so the sender can’t spend the same cash more than once? For bitcoin, this is solved with blockchain, which is simply an online ledger book that’s distributed on computers around the world. It tracks and verifies every use of bitcoin. To give people an incentive to maintain the blockchain on their machine, it awards a number of new bitcoins to the first computer to verify a transaction. It’s like a banking system that runs itself—but its main use is just letting people move currency from point A to point B.\n\nEthereum’s ledger does more. It can store fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A … and so on. As with bitcoin, the ether currency is a lure to get people to lend the system their computing power, and you need it to participate in a contract. Think of Ethereum itself as a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts—which in essence are just operating procedures—you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization.\n\nFor example, John Hancock Financial is experimenting with a tailored version of Ethereum to keep track of compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations in its wealth management unit. Airline industry giant Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain. Like David Hasselhoff, Ethereum is popular in Germany: Power producer RWE AG and online bank Fidor Bank are investigating ways to integrate it into their businesses.\n\nThe 2016 ether theft showed that though Ethereum may be powerful, it’s still new and prone to mishaps. One of the first things people used ether for was to invest in a kind of decentralized venture capital fund built with an Ethereum smart contract. Investors could vote on how the fund’s ether would be used; hackers found a bug in the contract that forced the fund to funnel its ether to them.\n\nAfter much consternation, there was a vote in the Ethereum community, supported by Buterin, to edit the blockchain’s transaction history so it appeared as if the hack had never occurred. Blockchain purists were so enraged at the idea of fiddling with the ledger, they began supporting an alternative form of Ethereum, which they took to calling Ethereum classic.\n\nButerin is unapologetic. “In general, the Ethereum community is on board with the notion that we do not have to do things exactly the way that things are done in other crypto communities,” he says. “I did not create Ethereum to let hackers get away with $60 million.”\n\nThis is the stuff of passionate debates on Reddit forums, but it may not matter to corporate users, because many of them don’t want to work on the fully public Ethereum blockchain anyway. JPMorgan just released a version of Ethereum known as Quorum. Developers around the world can work with it, but only companies invited to participate will be able to record transactions and contracts on it. The Airbus blockchain would be similarly walled off.\n\nThese blockchains would run alongside the main version of Ethereum, which anyone can use. “We’ve built an unstoppable, uncensorable world computer,” says Joe Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn company that develops blockchain applications, speaking of Ethereum. Andrew Keys, head of global business development for the company, still sees the technology as a grass-roots tool for cutting out intermediaries of all kinds—from law firms to online social networks. “Our digital identity is on Facebook, and Mark’s getting paid,” he says, referring to Facebook Inc. co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. “Instead of them housing that, we’ll have self-sovereign identity with peer-to-peer transactions.” In other words, instead of using Facebook to control who can and can’t see their family photos, people could one day set the rules themselves using smart contracts.\n\nEthereum is still a long way from that kind of success in either its public or private forms. The public version needs significant upgrades to be able to handle anything like the volume of interactions on the internet today. Ethereum’s leaders, in their response to the hack, offended a substantial part of the blockchain development and programming community, which isn’t that big. On the business side, corporations have to be convinced that they won’t be giving away trade secrets through their use of a ledger shared with other companies. At the same time, they’ll need to keep the technology open enough so that anyone can put their ideas into the same Ethereum ecosystem. “I don’t want to build AOL,” says Amber Baldet, blockchain program lead for JPMorgan. “I want to build the World Wide Web.”\n\nThe bottom line: Ethereum could present a whole new way to run a business, but there are some serious kinks to work out.', 'The weekly trading volume of LocalBitcoins China is on the rise again amid the People’s Bank of China’s meetings with Bitcoin exchanges on strengthening regulations surrounding Bitcoin trading. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has dropped again by around four percent overnight, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nLast week, the PBoC announced a series of meetings to be held this week with local Bitcoin exchanges. Officials and regulators from the PBoC planned to discuss current regulations and policies surrounding Bitcoin trading and the regulatory framework for Bitcoin exchanges moving forward.\n\nSo far, discussions between the PBoC and local Bitcoin exchanges including OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC have been optimistic, mostly because OKCoin and Huobi, the two Bitcoin exchanges flagged by the PBoC for having incomplete Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems, announced that they will enable Bitcoin withdrawals soon.\n\nHowever, users of OKCoin and Huobi were requested to submit detailed information on their funds and the transfer of money between their bank accounts and the accounts of Huobi and OKCoin. As reported by Cointelegraph on March 23, users are now required to submit these documents in order to continue trading Bitcoin:\n\nYour account info at Huobi:\n\nYour login info. Your account UID.\n\nExplanations of the sources of your funds:\n\nBank transfer records to Huobi bank account. Explanation of the sources of the funds you transferred. Relevant proof that can back up point b.\n\nProvide sources of funds:\n\nHistorical bank transfer record details. Text description of the fund source. Screenshot or pictures of bank information.\n\nUse of Bitcoin or Litecoin, particularly how the user intends to use the funds.\n\nWhy more users are moving to LocalBitcoins\n\nWhile the plan of OKCoin and Huobi to enable withdrawals was an optimistic and highly anticipated announcement for the local Chinese Bitcoin community, traders and investors within the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market didn’t expect the two exchanges to tighten their KYC systems to the point in which traders have to submit any information that pertains to Bitcoin purchases or trading activities.\n\nFor this reason, since February, LocalBitcoins volume for the BTC-CNY pair has continued to rise exponentially, nearly reaching 60,700,000 mln yuan weekly trading volume, which is equivalent to $8.82 mln. In consideration of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market’s daily trading volume of $36.8 mln, more than three percent of trading is facilitated by LocalBitcoins.\n\nMoreover, a significantly large number of high-profile traders purchase Bitcoin directly from miners or trade in a peer-to-peer platform apart from LocalBitcoins. In total, the OTC market could account for more than five percent of trading that occurs in China.\n\nFor the PBoC, the rise of the over-the-counter market and rapidly increasing volumes of peer-to-peer trading platforms such as LocalBitcoins may become a serious issue moving forward as these markets are very difficult to regulate. If LocalBitcoins continues to grow at the current rate, the PBoC could be pressured into improving their regulations and optimize policies to facilitate the growth of local Bitcoin exchanges.', 'A Seattle Bitcoin merchant is seeking to move the local cannabis scene forward from cash-only payments by using the virtual currency instead.\n\nThe aptly-named POSaBIT is currently installed at six outlets in the Washington State capital, with several others beyond.\n\nCustomers use their credit or debit card to purchase Bitcoin, which is then used to pay for goods at the point of sale.\n\n“I saw an industry that was in dire need of a credit solution,” CEO and co-founder Ryan Hamlin, an ex-Microsoft executive, told local news resource Seattle Weekly. “I said, ‘Software has got to be able to solve this problem.’”\n\nThe service monetizes its features by charging a $2 flat fee per transaction, with an upper purchase cap of $150 Hamlin says is designed “to limit any exposure to Bitcoin abuse.”\n\nPOSaBIT means Washington follows in the footsteps of neighboring Oregon, which gained a sanctioned Bitcoin-based cannabis purchasing solution from First Bitcoin Capital last October.\n\nConversely, the state has recently tightened its virtual currency business laws, requiring a money transmitter license which saw well-known exchange Bitfinex close its doors to residents from March 1.\n\nFellow exchange and wallet provider Coinbase was recently forced to exit nearby Hawaii for the same reasons.', 'Dave Carlson is a former Microsoft software engineer who discovered Bitcoin in 2010, a year after the system was launched by creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Carlson is now the CEO of Giga Watt, a blockchain hosting and servicing center for mining hardware.\n\n\n\nCarlson’s previous bitcoin mining firm, MegaBigPower, was recently acquired by Giga Watt, which Carlson says will essentially take everything MegaBigPower was working on and supercharge it with more capital and a bigger team.\n\nBitcoin Magazine recently reached out to Carlson in order to get his thoughts on everything from the incentives that persuade miners’ actions on the Bitcoin network to the perceived centralization of bitcoin mining in China.\n\nHow much of Bitcoin’s network hashrate is at your facility? Do you have a notable share of other coins’ hashrate there?\n\nAt 3.5 Exahash, there’s a tremendous amount of hashing on Bitcoin’s network. If we use all our current available power, we’d achieve only 1 percent.\n\nI’ve been focusing on diversification in the last year. We now split our available power across about four or five primary blockchains and operate over 1,700 GPUs. That will change as we build out our 30 MW project this year, which will put up a lot of Bitcoin hashrate.\n\nWhat do you think the role of miners is in the Bitcoin network? Should they be implementing the protocol changes they think would be best for Bitcoin or looking to users, full node and the economy for guidance?\n\nIf you look at the way Bitcoin’s protocol incentivizes miners, it’s clear that the role of miners is to be focused on deploying as much processing equipment as they can, while focusing on improving the efficiency of the hardware, the facilities and the operations team.\n\nMiners don’t get incentives to weigh in on political or technical debate. Miners will always seek the best returns. The system is designed this way.\n\nIt’s more about self-preservation [than] it is about greed. Miners are the ones with the fixed costs they have to cover if they want to continue to operate. For example, as a miner I want to see fees rise. If my perception is that small blocks increase competition for transactions and drive fees higher, then the easiest thing for me to do is make no change at all.\n\nIf you look at who has the real power to change Bitcoin, it’s the pools. But many of the pools keep transaction fees, so they also benefit from no change. The only people who are worried about it are those who have a deep enough understanding of the protocol to believe that Bitcoin may fail to grow without a change.\n\nThe answer (and solution) to all this is to look to the community of creative problem solvers for some innovation. If Bitcoin is not scaling in the direction of transactions per second, it will find scale in a different direction, likely as a result of innovation.\n\nAre you still planning an ICO for Giga Watt? If so, will this be a registered security?\n\nWe’ve been working very hard to come up with a product or service that gives anyone — not just accredited investors — access to our blockchain processing facility infrastructure. We didn’t need to do an SEC-registered ICO. Instead, we created a token offering in which people can get access to the electrical infrastructure that powers their miners.\n\nWhen people place miners with us and own the WaTT tokens for the infrastructure that runs it, they are literally operating their mines with full economic advantage. We are giving people a way to remotely assemble their own mining operation within our facilities, where we have the best design, best team and most advantageous prices. We’ve shown that the best results in mining are achieved by combining highly efficient facilities with extremely cheap electricity cost and now we are giving anyone in the world the opportunity to do it too.\n\nCan you respond to this blog post on the Bitmain website regarding the alleged unauthorized use of their trademark? They claim the following:\n\n“We have never authorized and will not authorize Giga Watt as our official hosting facility or our service center in the USA. We have never supported and will not support Giga Watt’s ICO. We have never authorized and will not authorize Giga Watt to use our BITMAIN trademark in any circumstances. Mr. WU Jihan has never been and will not be a member of Giga Watt team.”\n\nAs always, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. When the lawyers drop a bomb like this, it’s often a “shoot first, ask questions later” type response. This was a combination of simple misunderstanding, timing and circumstance. Regrettable.\n\nNote: Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitmain, but the bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer had nothing to share outside what was already written in the blog post.\n\nDo you think there is a need to get more bitcoin mining happening outside of China? Is Washington the best alternative to China for mining?\n\nI absolutely do believe China has gotten too dominant on the network. Because of the economics of mining, it’s simply not possible to create [the incentives] to mine just anywhere — in most places, the cost of power immediately rules out mining profitably.\n\nWe are fortunate to enjoy extremely cheap hydro power in Washington State, so it’s one of a number of great places. As awareness of the blockchain processing industry begins to awaken, I’m very interested to see how larger businesses (such as power generation owners) begin to find unique ways that blockchain processing can benefit them, thereby beginning a trend toward global decentralization again.\n\nDo you think miners should be signaling for Segregated Witness (SegWit) with nearly all exchanges and wallets preparing for it or looking forward to it?\n\nSegWit seems to have the most fundamentals behind it. It’s a non-arbitrary solution, unlike what most other options seem to be. It was written by a brilliant engineer and clearly represents some deep understanding of blockchain [technology] and crypto.\n\nI also like that it is a soft-fork solution that is less disruptive to the network. The reason it (and all other solutions) [hasn’t] been taken is simple — miners don’t see how they are going to make more money. If you show miners a way to scale the network that also gives them a financial incentive, you’ll have consensus in no time.\n\nWhich mining pool does Giga Watt point its hashrate at?\n\nAt the moment, we allow our customers to control that, so we use many pools. I expect to put up a GigaPool later this year that will provide mining for a regional consortium of mining operator-partners. This work is based off my earlier attempts to start a franchise program.\n\nWhat do you think of Bitcoin Unlimited?\n\nBitcoin Unlimited is interesting in that it gives miners (pools, really) the ability to choose block size for themselves and change it over time. I think this is pretty creative, but essentially miners will config for whatever makes the most money.\n\nIf smaller blocks with larger fees makes them money, we will have consensus, but block sizes will still be small. In the future, it will give the biggest pools and those with the most mining power [the ability] to effectively manipulate fees at will.\n\nThe more recent threats to hard fork the network [are] terrible for bitcoin’s value. A fork would dilute the brand, confuse newcomers and demonstrate just how dangerous centralization has become. The power represented in these recent actions shows who is holding all the cards. We desperately (and quickly) need a balance of power in the mining space — for too long, investors didn’t pay attention to this part of ecosystem, leaving the door wide open for someone else to take over control.', 'The past week has seen Dash rise to equal 10 tokens per Bitcoin for the first time in its history.\n\nThe historic boundary was crossed on March 18, data from CoinGecko shows, as the price per one Dash touched $110.\n\nThe privacy-focused altcoin has surprised the cryptocurrency community with its speed and subsequent long-term growth in value, starting out from $23 only one month ago.\n\nWhile many predicted a crash would accompany its meteoric rise, Dash has seen only modest retraces, managing to continue trading around the $100 mark despite even admissions from its own developers that they had been caught unawares.\n\nThis level now appears to be a natural cruising altitude for the coin, Bitcoin having come down slightly to once again equal practically 10 Dash per unit.\n\nThe sustained highs, meanwhile, are being met with the equally fast growth of the Dash ecosystem.

03/24/2017,"['Apple has announced that their system has not been breached by a hacker or hackers, after it was reported earlier this week that they were attempting to use an alleged store of iCloud accounts and Apple emails to extort thousands of dollars worth of digital currency from the company.\n\nOn Tuesday, Motherboard reported that the hackers, who identified themselves as ‘Turkish Crime Family’, were demanding $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum, or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards in exchange for deleting the supposed horde of data.\n\nThe hackers claimed they had access to more than 300 million Apple email accounts; however, this number was then changed to 559 million accounts.\n\nNow, though, in a report from Fortune, Apple have stated that their systems have not been breached, but that if the list is authentic, it was not obtained through an Apple hack.\n\nAn Apple spokesman said:\n\nThere have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.\n\nAccording to Fortune, a person aware of the contents of the unproven data set said that many of the passwords and email accounts are those that match data that was leaked in a previous breach at LinkedIn.\n\nWith hackers typically recycling past hacked data for future scams, there may be reason to be skeptical of this alleged hack.\n\nCriminals Turn to Ether for Ransom\n\nInterestingly, in the past, hackers have tended to demand their ransom payments in bitcoin.\n\nA report in December found that hackers are using mobile phone numbers to steal millions in bitcoin. While universities have also found themselves paying hackers ransoms in the digital currency.\n\nNow, though, in what may be the first incident, hackers are turning their attention to Bitcoin’s rival: Ethereum.\n\nFor years Bitcoin has been the prominent currency of choice for criminals, but in recent weeks Ethereum is gaining ground and distinction, which is positioning itself as a viable alternative when it comes to ransom demands.\n\nLast week it was reported that Ethereum’s price rose above $57 on Coinbase before dropping down to $35. It has since risen to just below $45 with a market cap value of just over $4 billion.\n\nIn what is considered the first high-profile extortion case seeking Ether, this could mean that more criminals will eventually demand payments in it as its value steadily rises, gaining ground on Bitcoin.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin is back below $1,000. Aggressive selling on Friday has the cryptocurrency down 4.1% at $987 a coin as traders remain uneasy over its near-term outlook.\n\nTraders continue to grapple with a number of headwinds. The future of bitcoin was called into question last weeekend as a rift among developers has created the possibility that a ""hard fork,"" or alternative marketplace could emerge, splitting the cryptocurrency in two. Additionally, traders have had to contend with a crackdown on trading in China, as well as the US Securities and Exchange Commission\'s ruling against the Winklevoss twins\' ETF.\n\nFriday\'s selling has trade probing key support in the $1,000 area. Trade briefly broke below that level a couple of times over the past two weeks, but has been unable to close below it. The last time bitcoin ended a session below $1,000 was on February 9.\n\n2017 has been a volatile year for bitcoin. It gained as much as 37%, putting in an all-time high of $1,327 a coin on March 10, but has fallen 25% after the SEC\'s ruling on the Winklevoss ETF. Two more rulings are on the horizon with the first due out on, or before, March 30. Neither is expected to pass.\n\nBitcoin has been the top performing currency every year since 2010 aside from 2014.', 'Bitcoin scam instances closely track Bitcoin price movements, a study into the “dark side” of cryptocurrency by ZeroFOX has found.\n\nA report by the Baltimore-based company indicated that a surge in scam operations occurred in the first week of March, just prior to the Winklevoss ETF decision announcement and when Bitcoin price equaled with that of an ounce of gold for the first time.\n\nDuring this time, Bitcoin’s price also spiked. In the days following the rejection of the fund, the price and number of scams dropped accordingly.\n\n“To date, we’ve identified 3,618 Bitcoin scam URLs,” the report, which was released Thursday, explains.\n\n“We measured how often posts containing these URLs were shared over a three week period in early March and discovered a total of 516 shares averaging 24.53 shares per day.”\n\nSocial media plays a significant role in the propagation of spurious schemes, ZeroFOX found, echoing behavior of longer-established suspected Ponzi schemes such as OneCoin.\n\n“Historically, all curated Bitcoin scam URLs were shared a staggering 126,276,549 times within social media posts. This number was skewed upward by two specific URLs that’ve been shared over 40m times and two others that were shared over 10m times,” the company continues.\n\nLast week, Cointelegraph reported on complaints from India’s cryptocurrency business sector regarding a preponderance of scams recently flaring up in the country. In Canada, meanwhile, police advised residents of Ontario to be vigilant in the wake of a fraud scheme targeting customers involving local Bitcoin ATMs.', 'It is not uncommon for a new technology still finding its footing to undergo periods of tumult—witness the long ago war over videotape formats VHS and Betamax.\n\nBitcoin, the cryptocurrency growing in popularity, turns out to be no different. For the last several years, technical experts have been arguing over how to adapt the currency’s software to allow it to handle more transactions and meet the increased demand. The debate has recently become so heated that it threatens to throw bitcoin itself into chaos, a phenomenon most clearly seen in the recent plunge in bitcoin’s price.\n\nThe conflict threatens to “fork” bitcoin, splitting it in two. Each branch would run a different version of the cryptocurrency’s software. Bitcoin’s principal innovation has been its blockchain, an immutable ledger of all the transactions ever performed with the cryptocurrency. A fork would generate two versions of the ledger, creating practical problems, like coins that could vanish, and philosophical ones, like agreeing on which blockchain represents the one, true, bitcoin.\n\nThe tension reached a fever pitch last week when bitcoin’s top exchanges (with some notable exceptions, such as Coinbase) issued a joint statement explaining how they would deal with the split, called a hard fork. This acknowledgement of the very real possibility of a fork sent bitcoin traders scrambling to sell their holdings. Bitcoin fell 24% over two days, from March 16, though it has recovered significantly.\n\nBoth camps have doubled down on their positions, and the saber rattling is growing louder. There is talk of changing the proof-of-work algorithm that bitcoin runs on, which could render the bitcoin mining industry, which earns millions a day in revenue, useless in one fell swoop. Miners—who process transactions and also increase the total supply of bitcoin in circulation—are now threatening legal action against developers who are working on such a proposal. There’s also a widely circulated conspiracy theory that involves John McAfee, the anti-virus entrepreneur who’s embroiled in a murder case in Belize. McAfee is supposedly colluding with a powerful Chinese miner to force a fork.\n\nThe arguments\n\nThe bickering over the right way to grow bitcoin’s transaction capacity is known as the block size debate. It has been raging for years. Last January it claimed a famous victim: longtime Core developer Mike Hearn, who quit the bitcoin world dramatically (paywall) because of the block size impasse. As if on cue, Hearn’s departure was dismissed as a “whiny ragequit” and the battle continued.\n\nThe squabble over block size has divided the bitcoin world into the Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited camps. The Core group, trading under the current BTC ticker, wants to solve the transaction problem by implementing a clever workaround called Segregated Witness, or SegWit, that will effectively increase the block size from the current 1 megabyte to 2 megabytes. The 1 MB restriction was an arbitrary limit put in place by bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto; some speculate it was to ensure that the bitcoin blockchain could be easily downloaded by users, and thus encourage adoption. In any case, it was a problem to be dealt with only if bitcoin succeeded.\n\nThe Bitcoin Unlimited camp, which would trade under a new ticker symbol BCU, wants to remove any restriction on block size and thus transaction capacity. But that would force a hard fork and two bitcoins would then inhabit the Earth. The Unlimited camp is backed by Roger Ver, an early bitcoin adopter whose relentless evangelizing for the cryptocurrency earned him the moniker “Bitcoin Jesus.” Unlimited is also backed by major miners, and part of its pitch is that miners should decide on block sizes. It proposes to do this by letting miners set their own caps for blocks, reasoning that eventually, miners will come to an agreement about what the optimal block size should be.\n\nSupporters of Core argue that the Unlimited code is riddled with bugs. Indeed, last week a bug was exploited, sending 70% of Unlimited nodes offline thus reducing the amount of processing power devoted to implementing it.\n\nBut Core is making a larger, philosophical point, about who controls the bitcoin network. They don’t like the idea of miners setting block sizes because they believe it increases centralization of bitcoin. Without a block size cap, powerful miners can simply mine bigger blocks, and thus be responsible for larger chunks of the bitcoin network, entrenching themselves further.\n\nCoffee money or digital gold?\n\nThere’s also a struggle about bitcoin’s function. As Adam White, who runs the GDAX exchange, tells Forbes, the Core camp wants to treat bitcoin as digital gold: a finite resource whose fundamental properties can’t be changed. The Unlimited folks want bitcoin to be digital cash, with limitless transaction capacity so that everyday payments can be recorded on the blockchain. Vinny Lingham, a noted analyst of the bitcoin industry, observes: “Roger [Ver] wants cheap coffee transactions, Core wants to ensure [bitcoin is] sufficiently decentralized and secure.”\n\nStill, bitcoin’s blocks are getting filled up, meaning transactions can’t be processed quickly enough—hence the urgency for a solution. Critics say that Core developers’ proposal for a 2 MB block size, SegWit, simply delays the inevitable—a hard fork—because it doesn’t raise the cap enough. A solution to Satoshi’s block size limit can no longer be avoided.\n\nWho’s winning?\n\nSo who’s winning? One exchange has opened what is effectively a prediction market for a hard fork. It lets traders buy tokens representing the adoption of either Core or Unlimited. If Unlimited isn’t adopted, and a fork doesn’t occur, Unlimited tokens become worthless. By this measure Core is winning: tokens representing its adoption are worth four times the Unlimited tokens.\n\nBut Unlimited is gaining ground among miners. About 40% of the processing power, or hashrate, on the bitcoin network supports Unlimited, compared to 60% supporting Core, according to analytics site Coin Dance. And the gap is rapidly closing.\n\nThe picture isn’t as simple as who’s got more hashing power. In order for Core’s SegWit proposal to be adopted, 95% of hashing power must be devoted to it, according to a threshold set by its developers. Unlimited doesn’t have a fixed threshold. Instead, it relies on a rather circular logic: It can only be adopted if miners decide to admit blocks larger than the current 1 MB, but miners would only have an incentive to do so if other miners did the same. “It’s kind of like people getting together to cross a road. Everyone holds hands and then someone decides to cross and everybody crosses with it,” one Redditor explained.\n\nA hard fork isn’t unprecedented for a major cryptocurrency. Ethereum experienced this after a hack, birthing what’s now known as ethereum classic. The fork also arose from ideological disagreements: The solution to the hack was to undo some transactions, which struck some ethereum users as an unprincipled move. A blockchain’s immutability is one of the pillars of the cryptocurrency world. Today the two coexist; there is even a publicly traded ethereum classic fund for the over-the-counter markets, although the value of all ethereum in circulation is about 18 times greater than ethereum classic.\n\nBut ethereum is a lot younger than bitcoin; it was only a year old when it split. The value of all ethereum in circulation is about a quarter of bitcoin’s current $17 billion value. A messy hard fork for bitcoin could mean serious disruptions for miners, who operate industrial-scale facilities, the well-funded exchanges, and the myriad startups who have raised $1.5 billion in venture capital collectively since 2012. A lot is riding on the question of how to scale bitcoin, and the conflict is showing no signs of easing up.\n\nRead this next: Bitcoin might just be a plausible response to the “war on cash” declared by governments around the world', 'Our own correspondent Nick Ayton, aka the Sage of Shoreditch, reports on the Turing Award winner, HoneyCoin, perspectives of Bitcoin hard fork, new ICOs and the tokenization of everything during a rather somber week in London.\n\nOh, and Satoshi leaving a trace at Gatwick.\n\nAnd the Turing winner was\n\nMIT professor Silvio Micali was the co-winner of this prestigious accolade, the Turing Award. His theory “ALGORAND,” a new consensus model that apparently scales, has received what is considered the Nobel equivalent of computing.\n\nI remain a big fan of zero-knowledge proofs and zk-SNARKs where Silvio has added a lot and I have to agree that Blockchain will struggle to move on to phase two without a rethink.\n\nThere are no standards and the Blockchain stacks vary depending on who you speak with.\n\nUnlike the ISO and TCP/IP stack, Blockchain is different. In my view there are five layers:\n\nConsensus\n\nMining or Forging\n\nPropagation\n\nSemantic\n\nPhysical Internet\n\nConsensus drives Blockchain defining everything about design and operations; dictating the underlying performance, scalability, governance, data capacity, security and redundancy which remain the core attributes of the technology, with other aspects dealing with crypto economic rewards and incentives around token management and supply.\n\nTime will tell and I look forward to learning more about ALGORAND that looks at vested economic interest as a means to effectively rank the nodes and define how things get done.\n\nICO booming\n\nThis week saw the Qtum ICO secure more than 90 percent of its funding in the first few hours, the Internet of Coins steaming ahead, Matchpool and Cosmos starting very soon and the 21Million project confirmed that they are planning for May.\n\nThere is no doubt that ICOs are gaining pace and quality and are rapidly becoming the preferred choice for crypto-entrepreneurs. And, of course, we assume you have purchased your share of ChocoholicCoin and MothersCoin for this coming Mother’s Day weekend.\n\nSatoshi spotted again\n\nI couldn’t believe it, there I was in the queue at Gatwick Airport to board a plane to Dublin and there it was, two people in front of me that familiar rucksack ‘Bitcoin Sold Here.’\n\nCointelegraph: Hey Vittalark what are you doing here?\n\nHe turned around looking very surprised to see me.\n\nVittalark Buttering: I found out he is in Dublin you know.\n\nCT: How do you know?\n\nVB: I spoke to Victor at the foot spa who said Satoshi had told him he was off to Dublin, he may even be on this flight.\n\nWith that, he showed me his boarding pass and was off down the gangway to the plane.\n\nCT: What seat have you got?\n\nVB: 21B, of course. I always try to get this seat because it is what Satoshi would choose.\n\nCT: Does that mean he is not on the flight then?\n\nVB: You know Dublin is where the secret stuff is being worked on, you know the new Bitcoin code. I can’t say anymore I think I am being followed. See that lady, she keeps looking at me and then talking on her phone.\n\nCT: Do you think Bitcoin will fork, ending up with BTC and BTU (Bitcoin Unlimited)?\n\nBut Vittalark had moved on and was already sitting down and I went to my seat at the back of the plane.\n\nNo sign of Satoshi, with Dublin to look forward to.\n\nTokenizing everything\n\nIt is likely that every asset on the planet will be tokenized, which will not only allow all value to be programmed and exchanged simply and easily but will also signal the changeover from today’s capital markets to crypto capital markets which have already started.\n\nI love crypto-economics because it redefines how value is created and exchanged and why stock exchanges, in particular, are starting to wake up to the opportunity to create and trade entirely new asset classes.\n\nUntil now, the majority of ICOs were for software developers to build things - e.g. the Qtum project - while others may have the beginning of a Blockchain platform they will build out or for ConsenSys, adding another spoke to the ConsenSys Ethereum core platform.\n\nLater this year we will see new emerging types of ICO, both specifically asset-backed for land and real estate, and also content-based.\n\nWith 21MCoin for the film and entertainment industry representing an entitlement to a royalty that moves it away from being seen as a financial product.\n\nThen there is ERCoin with an ICO planned for June/July that is fully asset backed by land and property, that can be part of an ETI (exchange traded instrument) opening it up to institutional investors and where a strip of cryptocurrency sits as part of a broader performing fund.\n\nMany altcoins plummet in value after launch but in the cases of 21MCoin and ERCoin, the token is supported by assets that generate an income stream as the value of the underlying asset increases.\n\nA token of entitlement, rewards, royalties and benefits that will accelerate ICOs to become a go-to place for mainstream institutional cash looking for a home.\n\nSEC decision does not matter\n\nThe big news this week is the state of Bitcoin following the SEC ruling, another move by China to control movement and concerns over the technology scaling.\n\nMy take on theBitcoin ETF SEC ruling is that it matters not.\n\nIf the US wants to place draconian rules on Bitcoin, the activity will simply get up and move to regions that remain open and favorable.\n\nPeople forget that Bitcoin is a movement - it is a packet switched protocol that lives in the ether with Bitcoin the first smart contract that works autonomously.\n\nBitcoin isn’t owned by anyone, it crosses borders and jurisdictions and cannot be regulated.\n\nLike TCP/IP, they tried and failed.\n\nBitcoin hard fork\n\nThe fork is a real issue though as for some time there have been concerns over fundamental scaling that has lifted trading volumes of large-scale selling and then buying. As commentators see it through their capital markets lens, traders predict Bitcoin price will settle below $750 creating a new resistance level. But then I don’t get this or see it that way.\n\nIf Bitcoin forks you end up with Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin Unlimited (BTU) that exposes holders of Bitcoin to uncertainty and possible losses. And a choice of which way to fall, the process remains unclear. Then there is the mining community that is significantly invested in BTC and some in the crypto press have predicted everything will get legal and nasty as two sides fight and argue, as value is disturbed.\n\nUS agenda\n\nComments no doubt are driven by a US agenda to pull the rug from under Bitcoin.\n\nBut with miners spread globally, huge pools in China and Asia with the majority operating beyond sovereign control, the community remains largely anonymous, autonomous and economically insulated from reprisals and also mine several cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin.\n\nLawyers still don’t understand how it works and there is no court in the land that could adjudicate. So I struggle to see the legal fight anytime soon.\n\nThe issue of China stepping in is not a negative for Bitcoin at all. It is, however, predictable as the Chinese economy would take steps to secure money flows and currency, remembering they are a hybrid capitalist economy as the bulk of the land remains under sovereign control.\n\nBut then again, does old-fashioned supply and demand, market forces and economic models apply to cryptocurrencies. I would suggest it is this thinking that is contributing to volatility, as once again the few try to spike the market for quick gains.\n\nHoneyCoin launches in Somerset\n\nCT caught up with beekeeper Norman Snitch to discover more about his plans for HoneyCoin and find out of if there is a sting in the tail.\n\nCointelegraph: So Norman what is the idea behind this?\n\nNorman: Unlike other commodities, Honey is technically different as it is owned by the birds and the bees. It doesn’t need expensive refining or production process in a factory.\n\nCT: So what do investors in HoneyCoin get?\n\nNorman: They get two things really. They own some bees, they are entitled to a dividend from the honey we sell and we throw “sting and hay fever insurance” in for good measure.\n\nCT: So how much does one HoneyCoin cost?\n\nNorman: Well it is difficult to say because we don’t accept money or Bitcoin. We accept only flowering plants that provide the environment for the bees to get pollen and do their stuff.\n\nWe own the land already and we make our money from selling the purest, fair trade honey on the market, and we record who has given us plants, and where they are planted on the Blockchain. The number of flowering plants matter and Smart Contracts work out the yield of flowering buds versus number bees visits and allocate coins and royalties on this basis.\n\nCT: Sounds brilliant Norman, real eco-friendly Honey produced in a libertarian way.\n\nNorman: Exactly. Do you want to taste?', 'Kirit Somaiya, a Member of Parliament of the ruling BJP in India, has raised concerns about Bitcoin being a Ponzi scheme. The rapid rise of Bitcoin has attracted attention in India, coming as it does during the government’s experiment with demonetization.\n\nDr. Somaiya has written to the Finance Ministry, the Reserve Bank of India and the SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) on the increasing use of an unregulated currency in India. The finance minister is expected to officially reply shortly.\n\nStrong views against Bitcoin\n\nSpeaking in the Parliament, Kirit Somaiya said:\n\n“The use of Bitcoin, a hypothetical currency, is increasing at a rapid speed in India as well as in the world. Experts have expressed concern that Bitcoin is a pyramid Ponzi-type scheme. This issue should be taken very seriously and there is urgent need to have a study on the development of Bitcoin in India. There is no regulator. As it is functioning like currency and seems like Ponzi scheme, RBI and SEBI as well as Finance Ministry to take appropriate step to save the people from another big Ponzi fraud.”\n\nWho is Kirit Somaiya\n\nKirit Somaiya is a Member of Parliament from Mumbai, the financial capital of India. He is also a chartered accountant, with a doctorate in finance capital markets. He is a member of the ruling BJP and his words are likely to have an impact in shaping policy.\n\nHowever, as history has shown us, not many experts in the field of finance have been successful in understanding Bitcoin.\n\nFor example, Dr. Mark Williams, a finance teacher at Boston University, predicted in 2013 that Bitcoin would trade for less than $10 by June 2014.\n\nReserve Bank of India’s stance\n\nThe RBI has taken a nuanced stance on Bitcoin in India.\n\nWhile it has not banned the use of Bitcoin outright, it has issued several warnings on the risks associated with using Bitcoin.\n\nSince the usage of Bitcoin is restricted to a small portion of the Indian population, the RBI is watching how the technology evolves.\n\nHowever, the concerns raised by the MP in Parliament could force the RBI into coming out with concrete views on Bitcoin.', 'Bitcoin prices fell below $1,000 this morning as support for the digital currency waned.\n\nPrices had hit a low of $969.35 by the time of reporting, having started the session at an average of $1,029.95, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data indicates.\n\nAt press time, the average price of bitcoin was $977, a fall of over 5% for the session. Since the start of trading, markets had peaked at an average of $1,032.34.\n\nBitcoin’s price also dipped below the $1,000 mark over the weekend, hitting a low of roughly $947, before recovering the following day. Prices revived to above $1,115 yesterday, but have again since declined.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear what’s driving this market dip. One factor could be lingering concerns over the prospects of a bitcoin hard fork, which could result in two wholly separate blockchains.\n\nStill, sell orders now outnumber buy orders, data from BFXdata shows, with sells accounting for 53% of trades in the last hour and 55% of trades in the last 24 hours on the Bitfinex platform.\n\nThe market move stands in contrast with developments from earlier this month.\n\nAs of mid-March, the bitcoin price had stayed above $1,000 for over a month, its longest ever period above that level.\n\nPool image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'The IRS has previously asked Coinbase, the leading wallet for digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum\'s ether, to provide information about customer data. Advocates of cryptocurrencies largely saw this move as a violation of the supposed freedom and privacy associated with the unregulated currencies, and many customers preferred not to have their account information and transaction history made available to the government. Coinbase itself worked to fight off the IRS request. Now, according to an affidavit filed by the IRS with San Francisco federal court, it appears that a mere 802 people in total have reported Bitcoin holdings for 2015. (See our indispensible Bitcoin IRS Tax Guide for Individual Filers)\n\nAre Bitcoin Users in Violation of the Law?\n\nAccording to the affidavit by the IRS, the agency ""searched the MTRDB for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015."" This form allows for reporting of property related to Bitcoin. The affidavit continues, ""those results reflect that in 2013, 807 individuals reported a transaction"" on this form, while in 2014 only 893 reported such transactions, and for 2015 the number dropped to 802 individuals. The IRS seems to believe that the vast majority of Bitcoin holders are not filing the form with their agency, which could be in violation of tax law.\n\nCoinbase, for its part, responded to news of the affidavit by saying that it has not yet handed over customer information. Juan Suarez, a lawyer for Coinbase, said that the digital wallet company ""remains concerned with the indiscriminate and over-broad scope of the government\'s summons and we have produced no records under the summons,"" according to a report by Bitcoin.com. The wallet company and the IRS are reportedly in discussions about what customer information the exchange would entail. The request for information was approved by the California federal court in November of 2016.\n\nNot the First IRS Concerns\n\nThe IRS has previously stated its opinion that Bitcoin users may not have fully complied with the tax laws in question. That is the reason why the agency has requested Coinbase user records as far back as 2013. Bitcoin users have responded by indicating that their requests for guidance by the IRS have gone unheeded, making the reporting process more difficult.\n\nCoinbase CEO and founder Brian Armstrong had harsh words for the IRS\' subpoena. ""Asking for detailed transaction information on so many people, simply for using digital currency, is a violation of their privacy, and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective. The IRS incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes.""\n\nThe ways that digital currencies like Bitcoin will continue to be integrated into the broader financial and tax worlds are often unclear, and the ending to this particular part of the story certainly remains to be seen.', ""As we approach the highly anticipated BlockShow Europe 2017, Cointelegraph has met with Charlie Shrem, one of the twenty big-name speakers of the event, to discuss the hottest Blockchain news.\n\nHowever, one eyewitness is better than two hear-so's, as they say, and therefore we’d recommend to grab your conference tickets already now before they get pricey and/or sold out.\n\nBut for now, let’s do a recap of the Blockchain-related stories that have surprised us the most in the last few weeks.\n\nA very confusing story of one “Blockchain-inspired” consortium\n\nAfter $59 mln research R3 Consortium, which was originally designed to leverage Blockchain technology in a private, centralized environment for harmonizing global banking, eventually found out that they do not need it.\n\nShrem comments:\n\n“To me, I do not understand the difference between the private Blockchain and Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. I mean do understand the differences, but the whole point of a Blockchain is to have as many people as you can to better working on the Blockchain to make sure that someone can’t change the past, or double spend or things like that. If all of the minors are being controlled by one company or two companies, then what’s the point of having a Blockchain? If they can reverse whatever they want. The immutability of a blockchain is the most important thing, without that there is no point in having a Blockchain. They looked at it, they figured they can’t work with it, and they moved on.”\n\nHmm, banks hate Bitcoin but spread Blockchain love?\n\nSince the rise in popularity of Bitcoin, restrictions within some states targeting the cryptocurrency has been a recurrent event. For some reason, the banking system does not always take kindly to Bitcoin. Do they hate Bitcoin?\n\nShrem says:\n\n“Banks just don’t want to admit that Bitcoin is amazing. They don’t hate it, they just don’t take it seriously. They are not afraid of it. They just don’t think that Bitcoin is something to even care about. And I don’t think we could make them take it seriously, I think that Bitcoin is already serious. And over time as banks see losing customers and people start using Bitcoin financial system, then they will say that Hey, we actually need to take it seriously. It took 30 years for people to take the internet seriously. So people thought that the internet was a joke for how many years? I think it’s the same thing.”\n\nIn the footsteps of the Internet\n\nThe Blockchain is often touted as the next Internet. A technology so important that it will revolutionize the way we live our lives. It is true that we are only scratching the surface trying to explore all the potential of Blockchain, but there is no lack of interest in it amongst big technology companies, financial institutions, governments and members of the public.\n\nWhat will it take for Blockchain to get to the level of Internet? Can they be compared at all? What steps does it need to assume a similar significance?\n\nShrem says:\n\n“As people just start using it, it will only take time. And I think that over time it’s going to be successful. It may take many years but it will be good.”\n\nBlockchain-based is the new sexy\n\nWhile Bitcoin, and particularly Blockchain, awareness and interest are on the rise, in the global scheme of things these are still relatively novel and new technologies. Bitcoin averages about 300,000 transactions per day at present, compared to Visa’s approximately 150 mln daily, indicating an adoption gulf before digital currency reaches wide use as the money of the future.\n\nAs such, marketing and educational efforts are critical to the advancement of digital currency. What are the ways to educate the general public? Is word of mouth the best marketing strategy?\n\nShrem shares his opinion:\n\n“We can educate the public by continuing to show that Bitcoin is amazing and that it is here to stay. And as long as we do that, as long as we continue to grow and do all these things, it’s just going to do well. Whatever we do now, we also need to come to an agreement to make sure that the Blockchain can handle everything.”\n\nPower to the people!\n\nUntil very recently, Blockchain has been mostly associated with Bitcoin – the digital currency built on top of it. Not trying to underestimate the importance of the latter, it is fair to say that Blockchain technology is much more than digital money. Backing e-government platforms with Blockchain can solve a number of issues that arise when dealing with public authorities nowadays. Citizens feel so disconnected from their governments and think the general level of state bureaucracy is unbelievable.\n\nTherefore, digitization of state services in general and especially the integration of Blockchain in this sphere is an interesting process to follow. Should global governments be embracing Blockchain?\n\nShrem says:\n\n“They definitely should. There is a lot of different applications for Bitcoin and Blockchain. You can look at social media, you can look at putting health records on Blockchain, elections on the Blockchain, there is all these things that you could do on the Blockchain.”\n\nEstonia seems to be more open to embracing Blockchain. The level of digitization of the public sector in Estonia is much higher in comparison with the state of digitization in Western Europe. Why So?\n\n“Places like Estonia have a lot of good developers, a lot of young people, they are hungry to do good work and to grow technology, whereas in the US, for instance, people are just not interested in changing the world.”\n\nAnd remember that you have a unique opportunity to hear a lot more Blockchain stories, learn the latest trends in the industry and get a sneak peek into the era of massive Blockchain implementation - all in one day at BlockShow Europe 2017 in Munich on April 6. So, get your tickets now!"", ""BTCC, a major bitcoin exchange and trading platform operator in China, officially launched its first mobile application, “Mobi,” introducing various features and products including Twitter payments and the company’s signature bitcoin-based Visa debit card.\n\n\n\nWith its private blockchain, Mobi allows smartphone users to gain access to over 100 currencies including bitcoin, gold and reserve currencies such as USD, and allows users to instantly convert, store or transfer funds globally to other smartphone users. Mobi accounts are simply linked to users’ mobile numbers and therefore a smartphone is all that is needed to use the app.\n\nThe main feature of BTCC’s Mobi app is the BTCC bitcoin debit card, which operates just like a normal bitcoin wallet. Funds in the wallet are pegged to the debit card and balance is automatically deducted when users make payments at retail points of sale (POS) that accept Visa or withdraw cash via bank ATMs.\n\nIt is BTCC’s first initiative to target a global consumer base and expand its services outside of China. Both the Mobi wallet and the debit card are available in 15 languages and can be utilized in any country across the world.\n\nBTCC announced:\n\n“Mobi comes with an optional Visa debit card. The debit card is linked to users’ Mobi accounts, and allows them to withdraw cash in any currency at ATMs worldwide or spend their funds at any retail points of sale that support Visa. The debit card automatically deducts funds from customers’ wallet balance.”\n\nSince the launch of Xapo’s bitcoin Visa debit card in late 2014, the popularity of physical bitcoin cards has continued to rise. As bitcoin companies started to drift away from manufacturing bitcoin ATMs due to high operating costs and manufacturing fees, venture capital–backed companies such as South Korea’s Coinplug and global payments service provider BitPay began to develop unique products to meet the demands and necessities of their consumers.\n\nEssentially, the launch of the BTCC bitcoin debit card eliminates the necessity of bitcoin ATMs and offers higher liquidity to daily users within China. According to LocalBitcoins, its over-the-counter and peer-to-peer trading volumes have increased exponentially in the last three months due to the intensified Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies in China.\n\nToday, for instance, it was revealed that Chinese bitcoin exchanges regularly request users to submit relevant information on deposits and withdrawals with detailed explanations on the origins and the outflows of transactions.\n\nBTCC’s bitcoin debit cards will allow Chinese users to utilize bitcoin with ease, without undergoing strictly regulated channels to make simple purchases and transfers. More important, in regions wherein bitcoin ATMs or services aren’t available, Chinese bitcoin users will simply be able to cash out their funds via bank ATMs.\n\nIn a Reddit discussion, a BTCC representative explained how Mobi is different from Xapo:\n\n“We support 100+ currencies, so for the debit card, if you have money in your USD wallet, the card will deduct funds from the USD wallet for purchases. If you don't have money in your USD wallet, we will automatically convert bitcoin into USD when you use your card.”\n\nWirex, the largest bitcoin debit company in Asia, recently secured a $27 million investment from Japan’s SBI Investment to focus on the development and expansion of their bitcoin debit cards. Bitcoin companies within the Asian market are particularly focused on improving usability of bitcoin and introducing the digital currency to the mainstream market.\n\nBTCC’s introduction of bitcoin debit cards to its Chinese user base will position China to compete with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over the bitcoin ATM and debit card markets.\n\nWith multi-currency support, BTCC is eyeing a global expansion of their services, including the bitcoin debit card. Although Wirex is focusing on the Japanese market, BTCC will compete with startups including Wirex and Coinplug in the Asian market to obtain a truly international user base.""]"
03/25/2017,"['Is there a correlation between the price movements of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and crypto assets?\n\nThe answer to that question varies quite a bit based on which asset – and which time period – you look at, according to a recent CoinDesk analysis of CryptoCompare data through February 2017.\n\nIn some cases, the answer is relatively simple. Cryptocurrencies have repeatedly entered periods where several have moved in tandem.\n\nFor example, alternative protocol assets rallied following the SEC\'s 10th March rejection of a proposed bitcoin ETF, after suffering widespread losses roughly one month earlier.\n\nYet in other instances, bitcoin\'s losses have resulted in gains for alternative cryptographic assets.\n\nOne key factor analysts have cited as influencing these price relationships is major events in the cryptocurrency space, like the rise and fall of distributed organization The DAO or the SEC\'s ETF rejection.\n\nLeading up to this event, bitcoin prices surpassed $1,300, reaching an all-time high, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Following the ruling, bitcoin prices plunged nearly 30%, while other digital currencies experienced a rally that pushed some to fresh, all-time highs.\n\nEther, for example, surged more than 200% in the week or so after the SEC shot down the proposed fund, according to CoinMarketCap. Likewise, the price of monero rose more than 100% since the ruling at points, while ether classic also saw notable gains.\n\nBut how do they compare on a longer timeline? Let\'s review the findings from our data:\n\nBTC and LTC: Birds of a feather\n\nThe most objective way to examine the price relationship that exists between bitcoin and other digital currencies is to examine the available data. Using this information, market observers can get a far better sense of exactly what these relationships look like.\n\nFor some currency pairs, looking at quarterly data is sufficient, as doing helps convey a strong sense of the relationship between the two digital assets in question.\n\nBTC/LTC (litecoin) is a great example, as price data reaching back to the final quarter of 2013 shows six quarters where the pair\'s correlation surpassed 0.7, and three quarters where it exceeded 0.8.\n\nThis strong, positive relationship makes sense, as litecoin is to some extent a \'spin-off\' of bitcoin, using similar technologies and designs.\n\nIt\'s important to keep in mind that bitcoin and litecoin prices have not always had a strong relationship, as their correlation has at times broken down. ARK Invest\'s Chris Burniske has noted that leading up to the SEC\'s decision on the proposed Winklevoss ETF, the two digital currencies moved in different directions.\n\nBitcoin and XRP: Total opposites\n\nAnother example of a currency pair with a relatively straightforward relationship is BTC/XRP, whose correlation remained below 0.2 during every quarter in 2015 and 2016.\n\nWhen averaging all available price data, the currency pair\'s correlation falls to 0.02.\n\nThe two currencies are quite distinct, a situation noted by cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff, and this situation might help explain their weak price relationship. Bitcoin and litecoin have differing value propositions and target separate audiences from XRP.\n\nMiguel Vias, head of XRP markets at Ripple, offered a different take on BTC and XRP\'s price relationship.\n\n""I think that markets view XRP as a very stable digital asset, so they feel safe parking funds in XRP when they exit other assets. If someone wants to get out of BTC, but doesn\'t want to necessarily move into fiat, he or she moves the value into XRP,"" he said.\n\nBitcoin and ETH: A changing story\n\nFor other digital currencies, a deeper dive is needed to understand the situation.\n\nWhile quarterly price data for BTC/ETH (ether) shows some modest correlations as high as 0.57, looking at seven-day averages paints a more vivid picture.\n\nWhen viewed through this more short-term lens, correlations have reached as much as 0.98 during some periods. In the seven-day period 1st–7th August, 2016, the BTC/ETH price relationship remained above 0.90.\n\nHowever, the correlation between these digital currencies fell sharply at times, reaching as little as 0.04 during seven-day periods in August and October 2015.\n\nETC, XMR: Confusing cases\n\nEther classic is another cryptocurrency that has had a varied relationship with bitcoin. The correlation between the two has fallen to as little as 0.004 and risen to as much as 0.96, according to CryptoCompare data ranging back to July 2016.\n\nThe BTC/ETC pair displayed a particularly strong relationship early this year, surpassing 0.90 during several seven-day periods in January. However, their correlation has repeatedly fallen to very low levels, declining below 0.1 on many occasions and reaching as little as 0.004 in January 2017.\n\nThe BTC/XMR pair has had a similar story to that of BTC/ETH and BTC/ETC, as its seven-day price correlation has approached zero and surpassed 0.9 repeatedly.\n\nThis weekly relationship became particularly strong earlier this year, surging to 0.94 in January. In contrast, the pair hit a patch in February 2016 where five straight seven-day sessions produced an average below 0.2.\n\nThese two digital currencies have largely different situations. While bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to scale, monero has focused far more on ensuring the privacy of its users. While bitcoin was originally designed to offer users privacy in their transactions, its pseudonymous nature has made its users vulnerable to identification.\n\nMonero, on the other hand, has done a far more effective job of providing user anonymity through ring signatures and stealth addresses.\n\nAs a result, this digital currency is building widespread adoption on the darknet.\n\nSummary\n\nThe digital currencies examined in this article have highly dynamic price relationships. Sometimes they move in tandem, while other times they move in opposite directions. In certain cases, their correlation is very low.\n\nIn certain instances, the markets develop clear trends where many cryptocurrencies move either higher or lower over specific periods of time. During others, these digital currencies may display little or no price correlation.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency space becomes more mature, however, the individual digital assets that compose this market may very well progress in terms of carving out their own individual niches, a development that could cause their price determinants to change over time.\n\nShould these digital currencies successfully differentiate themselves in the eyes of traders, their correlations could deteriorate further.\n\nFollow the leader image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'Bitcoin exchanges are preparing for a potential hard fork execution of Bitcoin Unlimited. While most major Bitcoin exchanges including BTCC, Bitstamp and Bitfinex have clarified their stance on the hard fork contingency, some regional exchanges such as Korbit and HitBTC haven’t come to a consensus in regards to hard fork support.\n\nOn March 24, Cointelegraph spoke to HitBTC about their questionable statement released to their users about the Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork.\n\nIn their statement, HitBTC wrote:\n\n“Bitcoin Unlimited has been listed on the platform and is available for trading from March 24. The exact date of the hard fork is currently unknown and BTC and BTU withdrawals are temporarily locked due to the probable replay attack which may occur after the split. Withdrawals will be unlocked soon after the hard fork is complete.”\n\n“Sooner or later their Blockchains will be split”\n\nCointelegraph immediately reached out to HitBTC as the BTU token has yet to be released since the hard fork hasn’t been executed and, according to experts, it is actually very far from being forked.\n\nHitBTC attempted to clarify their stance but offered a very ambiguous response instead:\n\n“Currently there are 2 existing systems - Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited. Both systems have daemons and nodes. At the moment they are using one [common] Blockchain. But sooner or later their Blockchains will be split and fully independent. If you look at Coin Dance, you will see real blocks with BTU, so BTU does exist.”\n\nBTU simply doesn’t exist as of yet because the hard fork hasn’t been executed. Bitcoin miners signaling Bitcoin Unlimited support is very different from creating blocks with BTU. Bitcoin Unlimited tokens are credited to users by wallet platforms or Bitcoin exchanges when they are introduced to the network by the way of a hard fork.\n\nHowever, if the hard fork isn’t executed, there is no way that users can trade it because the tokens do not exist.\n\nTherefore, the announcement of HitBTC in regard to enabling BTU trading can be considered as a controversial and questionable move by the exchange, as the community is well aware that BTU tokens aren’t available yet.\n\nWhat is HitBTC selling or crediting users with?\n\nIf the exchange is allowing users to trade BTU which doesn’t exist, what is HitBTC trying to accomplish? The first sentence of the statement of HitBTC read: “HitBTC, known for its cutting-edge technology, is giving you an opportunity to get Bitcoin Unlimited before the hard fork occurs.”\n\nAnyone with the slightest understanding of hard forks and the Bitcoin protocol understands that Bitcoin Unlimited tokens can’t be created or distributed to the network without executing a hard fork. Therefore, how is HitBTC providing a way for users to get Bitcoin Unlimited before the hard fork occurs?\n\nMore importantly, what happens if the hard fork doesn’t occur? Then the derivative-like product which HitBTC is offering to users is rendered worthless by the market.\n\nBitcoin exchanges must respect the market and users and be responsible enough to make reasonable decisions to support the network and community.', 'Bitcoin price made a nice downside move recently below $950 against the US Dollar, and now BTC/USD could extend declines in the near term.\n\nKey Points\n\nBitcoin price failed to gain traction, and moved below the $1000 level against the US Dollar.\n\nThere are two bearish trend lines with resistance near $1040-1060 formed on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD.\n\nThe price might correct higher in the near term, but broadly remains under a bearish pressure.\n\nBitcoin price made a nice downside move recently below $950 against the US Dollar, and now BTC/USD could extend declines in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Price Resistance and Barriers\n\nThis past week, I mentioned that BTC price might soon escalate declines against the US Dollar. The price did move down, and broke a couple of supports like $1020 and $1000. The price traded as low as $888 from where there was a minor correction initiated. The price declined in a proper downtrend with 3-waves from $1140. First, there was a decline to $950, and then a correction towards $1120. Now, the price declined in the third wave below the $940 level towards $888.\n\nAt the moment, the price is correcting higher, and already moved above 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1119 high to $888 low. However, there are many resistances waiting on the upside near $1004 and $1040. First, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1119 high to $888 low is at $1004. Then, there are two bearish trend lines near $1040-1060 on the 4-hours chart (data feed from SimpleFX) of BTC/USD. Also, the 100 simple moving average (4H) is around the same trend line resistance near $1040.\n\nSo, we can say that there is a major resistance formed near $1040-50 where one might consider selling if the price moves higher.\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is now well placed into the bearish slope.\n\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is correcting higher, but remains below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $900\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1050\n\nCharts courtesy – SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", 'While many expected bitcoin to replace the use of credit cards and replace the banking system in 2013, the cryptocurrency has faced challenges as a payment system since it has not been able to safely accommodate its growth, according to Nasdaq.\n\nBitcoin is currently dealing with some issues as a payments platform, mainly because the system is experiencing growth at a rate faster than it can safely scale.\n\nStephen Pair, a co-founder of BitPay, said customer service inquiries have increased due to transaction confirmation delays. BitPay has also witnessed higher transaction fees for its own transactions, causing the company to stop covering bitcoin network fees on invoice payments.\n\nBitPay Responds To Payment Delays\n\nBitPay has become more creative in designing user experience for delayed payments. Delays are often an opportunity to explain the way the bitcoin network works and direct people to wallets with dynamic transaction fees.\n\nCopay and BitPay wallet users have largely escaped transaction delays since their wallets dynamically calculate transaction fees.\n\nOne method for addressing transaction delays and increased transaction fees is the Lightning Network. Its caching layer would allow for improved versions of features such as immediate transactions at no cost that people have associated with bitcoin.\n\nPair said BitPay is exploring all possible scalability solutions. He is not surprised bitcoin has to scale. He is surprised that while short-term throughput bumps were expected, changes for on-chain throughput were expected a few years ago.\n\nThe slow pace of increased throughput was not foreseen, he said. A scalability limit will be reached at some point that will be addressed by solutions like Lightning Network.\n\nBitPay Will Stick With Bitcoin\n\nBitPay has studied alternatives to the bitcoin blockchain and concluded none are compelling, Pair said.\n\nSome observers suspected BitPay and similar companies might switch from bitcoin to altcoins or permissioned blockchains on account of the high U.S.-dollar-denominated fees and network congestion.\n\nWhile Pair acknowledged there are scaling issues, the company continues to witness more consumers using the existing technology.\n\nHe said bitcoin is the most cost effective, secure and fast means of value transfer on the Internet.\n\nBitPay sees itself as a payment innovator. Consumer and business-to-business payments are no different on BitPay’s platform and the bitcoin network.\n\nTony Gallippi, BitPay co-founder, noted at the recent Distributed: Markets fireside chat that the company’s transaction count more than doubled in the last year. Much of the growth was in digital goods and video games.\n\nGallippi said the Steam digital distribution platform’s acceptance of bitcoin was a source of growth for BitPay, and that there is much overlap between the bitcoin and gamer communities.\n\nPair said BitPay is also witnessing growth in bitcoin’s use for B2B money transfers. He said bitcoin is a fantastic solution for such transfers, particularly for global payments where bank transfers are inefficient and slow.\n\nAlso read: BitPay CEO on safe bitcoin scaling: soft fork first, hard fork next\n\nB2B Payments Embrace Bitcoin\n\nB2B companies are using the BitPay platform for billing settling international payments with a lot of suppliers, Pair said during the fireside chat.\n\nGallippi noted there has been an increase in bitcoin’s use for payment disbursements.\n\nHe said it is not easy to pay people on a regular basis in the majority of countries. It is hard to pay people in places where a lot of apps are being developed, such as India, Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\n\nFor app stores or digital marketing companies, Gallippi said BitPay can receive one payment from the business and then disburse payments in bitcoin to all of the endpoints.\n\nBitPay built the product for its need to pay its employees in bitcoin, Pair said. There are now a lot of Fortune 500 companies asking BitPay to solve similar payment issues.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Strong claims need strong proof, so when the founders of NeuroMesh described their bitcoin-based product as an ""unhackable botnet"", there were a lot of questions to be asked.\n\nStill, the claim has already been backed by such accolades as a second-place prize in the MIT $100k startup challenge and a shortlist position in the ongoing Atos IT Challenge 2017 – both of which lend weight to the credibility of the project.\n\nFounded by Greg Falco, a PhD candidate at MIT studying cybersecurity, and Caleb Li, an MBA student at the same institution, NeuroMesh is seeking to find solutions to security issues in the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nIoT \'vaccine\'\n\nThe pair saw what they say is a gap in the market for a security product that would specifically work within the confines imposed by low-power, limited-storage devices.\n\nNeuroMesh\'s idea is to mimick the same tactics hackers use when trying to compromise machines in the first place – installing lightweight code that hijacks the kernel and then dials out to a command and control (C&C) server, adding the machine\'s resources to a botnet directed by the bot \'herder\'.\n\n""We wanted to create a vaccine for IoT devices by first installing our own security software on the kernel,"" said Li. ""It\'s like playing \'King of the Hill\', so we become the only ones that can control the device.""\n\nOne of the main points of vulnerability for a botnet is an attack on the C&C server, something that\'s often observed when competing hackers try to knock their rivals\' botnets offline and commandeer the devices.\n\nNeuroMesh\'s solution is to send commands to devices secured by their technology via OP_RETURN codes in the bitcoin blockchain – code that allows for the transmission of arbitrary data (such as \'Mined by Antpool\', \'Happy halving day\' or in one case, the text of an encyclical letter by Pope Francis).\n\n""That means we can actually send out a blacklist of IP addresses that these IoT devices shouldn\'t talk to over the bitcoin blockchain,"" Falco explained, adding:\n\n""Usually [with botnets] you could shut down a central server where the command is coming from, but with the blockchain we don\'t have to worry about that because it\'s entirely decentralized.""\n\nNew research twist\n\nIn practical terms, this involves a C&C server connected to a bitcoin wallet address which can sign transactions. In turn, IoT devices in the NeuroMesh net would run an SPV client which reads only transactions signed by NeuroMesh, and execute the commands contained in the OP_RETURN data.\n\nBecause data is propagated between bitcoin nodes in a decentralized manner, in theory reading these commands does not give any further information about the location of the server which originally issued them.\n\nDr Michael Siegel, Associate Director of MIT’s IC3 cybersecurity consortium and a research advisor for the NeuroMesh project, says that Li and Falco\'s work comes out of a tradition of research into secure communication between distributed systems.\n\n""It\'s a clever use of a small piece of code that can run on many types of devices,"" Siegel told CoinDesk.\n\nHe continued:\n\n""It\'s a great idea: not totally new, but, in the IoT space, the combination of what they\'re doing with botnets, blockchain and central command is something new they\'ve established, and appears to be an extremely secure environment for managing small distributed devices.""\n\nFalco also confirmed that the uniqueness of the NeuroMesh offering is in finding a new use for existing practices.\n\n""While what we\'re doing is new from a commercial standpoint, there\'s been several case studies of white-hat security researchers doing what we\'re doing to close vulnerabilities in a system,"" he said.\n\nOther risks\n\nRoman Sinayev, a security software engineer who designs anti-malware systems at Juniper Networks, is familiar with the concepts behind the NeuroMesh project (although he\'s not seen the software in action).\n\nAssuming the code is written without any exploitable errors, then the result would be a secure communication channel, Sinayev said.\n\nFurther, he pointed out that blockchain isn\'t required to hide communications.\n\n""[A]nother way would be any kind of P2P programme like BitTorrent,"" he said. ""You could also use many different proxy servers and change the IPs, or you could use some intermediate service – embed information in pictures on a public channel, for example.""\n\nWithout having seen the code, Sinayev stressed that it\'s impossible to verify that the NeuroMesh product works exactly as described. However, he suggested that (as with all security software) best practice would be to have an independent audit once the product is finalised.\n\nOn a similarly cautionary note, MIT\'s Dr Siegel pointed out that technology is not always the weakest point of a system, saying:\n\n""Underlying this is a very secure system with sound technology and difficult to break security. But this doesn\'t stop humans from doing really dumb things! On the end of it, you\'ll have someone who controls the passwords and controls access, and that person could always do something stupid.""\n\nEven factoring in human error, the bitcoin network has proven to be extremely resistant to malicious activity, and it\'s this property that Falco and Li are hoping to tap into with their IoT product.\n\nLi said:\n\n""We call it \'unhackable\' because to date, the bitcoin blockchain hasn\'t been hacked.""\n\nWorld baby image via Flickr\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Attendees will also learn how they can utilize the technology when it comes to constructing their own applications.\n\nSonya Kuhnel, managing director of the Blockchain Academy, said that there is a call for blockchain skills in South Africa with Botswana pegged to see an increase in demand too.\n\nShe said:\n\nThis is an extremely interesting space to be involved in and provides many opportunities for incumbents and individuals to experiment with this emerging and disruptive technology.\n\nEarlier this month, a Blockchain Academy was launched in the south Indian state of Kerala where it will endeavor to research and provide consulting with blockchain technology. Along with providing training and education in South Africa and India, the Blockchain Academy, established in 2015, does so too in Zimbabwe with clients ranging from Barclays, legal firms and entrepreneurs.\n\nAfrica’s Blockchain Development\n\nThe progress of blockchain in Africa is continuing at an accelerated pace as they become more embracive of the technology.\n\nThis can be seen through the African financial system, which is realizing the potentials it holds particularly when it comes to reducing the cost of banking transactions. The governor of the South African Reserve Bank also revealed that the bank was open to digital currencies and blockchain, with many speculating that of the African nations, blockchain will take off first in South Africa. While the global banking consortium led by R3 saw its first African member join ranks in Absa Bank, which is one of South Africa’s largest banks.\n\nThe blockchain expansion that Africa is experiencing is set to continue as more organizations embrace the technology for what it is known for: transparent and efficient that delivers an effective solution for many sectors.\n\nAlso popular in Africa is the use of the digital currency, bitcoin, which is helping to grow many cashless societies on the continent.\n\nOnly recently, BitPesa, a major bitcoin payments startup that was launched in Kenya in November 2013, raised $2.5 million in a Series A round of funding. Such an amount is expected to help the company’s growth with an emphasis in Nigeria, which is BitPesa’s largest market.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Bitcoin is probably one of the best inventions of the humanity in today’s modern world. The universal and decentralized nature of Bitcoin is capable of erasing geographical boundaries and political differences to create an open economy. A Swedish investment company, Brave New World Investments is trying to do just that by making use of the versatile cryptocurrency.\n\nFounded by Mairtin O’Duinnin and Mikael Johansson, Brave New World Investments seek to offer investors an opportunity to secure gains from the markets that are deemed untouchable for political reasons. Through the company, investors, especially the ones in Europe can now put their money in the Iranian market. Brave New World Investments acts as an investment company, into which the stakeholders will be investing their crypto-funds.\n\nThe model of Brave New World Investments is entirely built around Bitcoin. The company accepts cryptocurrency investment and converts it to Iranian Rial — legal tender of the Islamic Republic of Iran for investing in equities on the Tehran Stock Exchange. The ground realities in Sweden influenced the company’s decision to use Bitcoin entirely for operations after the banks decided not to offer their services fearing an impact on their US-Swedish business relations.\n\nThe company on its website claims to have all the required regulatory checks in place including anti-money laundering directives to ensure the business is run by the book. Brave New World Investments seeks the participation of European shareholders, Bitcoin community members, and Persian angel investors on the platform, enabling the company to invest in a diverse portfolio in Iranian stocks.\n\nThe investment opportunity presented by the company is attractive as the United States has eased the economic sanctions on the country. The easing of sanctions is gradually opening up the international markets to Iranian companies. Eventually, there will be more capital flowing into Iran and those who have invested in the companies early on, potentially stand to gain good returns.\n\nThe Brave New World Investments is in the process of creating an Iranian bank account to facilitate equity investments and the absence of any sanctions between Iran and the European Union or Sweden, makes it a legitimate operation. With a new opportunity opening up through the Brave New World, investors in Europe are expected to give it a try in the coming days.\n\nThe article was edited on March 28, 2017\n\nRef: Finance Magnates | Image: Shutterstock', 'Bitcoinowy rollercoaster – analiza obecnej sytuacji\n\nBitcoin jest z nami ju? 8 lat, przez ten czas nie brakowa?o wzlotów ani sytuacji kryzysowych. Obecnie znale?li?my si? w punkcie, który warto przeanalizowa?.\n\nRok 2017 rozpocz?? si? bardzo optymistycznie. Prawie dwuletni trend wzrostowy przynió? nam ATH, czyli najwy?szy kurs w historii - 1350$ (Bitstamp) za 1 BTC. Przebicie szczytu sugerowa?o kontynuacj? trendu oraz wp?yn??o bardzo pozytywnie na nastroje graczy i inwestorów, którzy przygotowani byli na now? ba?k? lub przynajmniej du?y wzrost. Zamiast tego kurs zacz?? spada?, ale „bycze” nastroje pozosta?y, lecz przenios?y si? na inne kryptowaluty.\n\nBardzo silna hossa na Bitcoinie zosta?a zastopowana przez 3 wydarzenia”\n\nW styczniu Chi?ski Bank Centralny skontrolowa? chi?skie gie?dy bitcoinowe, czego efektem by?o wprowadzenie prowizji i wy??czenie handlu z d?wigni? a nast?pnie w lutym wstrzymanie wyp?at w bitcoinach, które nie dzia?aj? do dzi? i nie wiadomo kiedy zostan? przywrócone. Dodatkowo chi?ski rz?d wprowadzi? surowe restrykcje na gie?dach, skutecznie zniech?caj?c tamtejszych inwestorów i spekulantów. Chi?skie gie?dy, które dotychczas robi?y za „ przewodnika stada ” dzi?ki najwy?szym obrotom (boty i brak prowizji) zosta?y praktycznie wyeliminowane z gry pozostaj?c pod nadzorem rz?dowym . Kurs oczywi?cie zareagowa? spadkiem, który dzi?ki silnej hossie szybko zosta? skorygowany. Winklevoss ów o utworzenie 10 lutego ameryka?ska komisja nadzoru rynków gie?dowych SEC odrzuci?a wniosek braci Tylera i Cameronaów o utworzenie bitcoinowego funduszu inwestycyjnego . Na decyzj?, która mog?aby bardzo mocno podnie?? poziom kursu czeka?a ca?a spo?eczno?? bitcoinowa. Samo wyczekiwanie i optymizm, mia? zapewne równie? wp?yw na nowe ATH tu? przed og?oszeniem decyzji. Reakcja kursu na odrzucenie wniosku by?a do przewidzenia, a spadek kursu by? do?? znaczny (grubo ponad 200$), jednak dzi?ki silnej hossie podobnie jak w przypadku Chin, szybko zosta? skorygowany. Trzecim i najwi?kszym ciosem zadanym Bitcoinowi, a w?a?ciwie jego kursowi, jest straszenie Hard Forkiem, czyli podzia?em Bitcoina na dwi odr?bne waluty: Bitcoin Core i Bitcoin Unlimited o czym dalej.\n\nNieko?cz?cy si? problem zmiany wielko?ci bloku oraz próba rewolucji.\n\nJak wiemy i jak sami mo?emy odczu? w wyd?u?onym czasie potwierdzenia naszych przelewów oraz wi?kszymi prowizjami, sie? Bitcoina zapycha si?. Obecna pojemno?? bloku (1MB) zosta?a wprowadzona przez Satoshi Nakamoto wy??cznie w celu ochrony przed spamem transakcyjnym i w przysz?o?ci mia?a zosta? zwi?kszona w razie potrzeby. Obecni deweloperzy Bitcoina nie zgadzaj? si? jednak z tym podej?ciem i nie zamierzaj? zwi?ksza? bloku. Szukaj? lepszych rozwi?za? i próbuj? by? m?drzejszym od twórcy Bitcoina, który by? zwolennikiem samoregulacji sieci. Niestety Satoshi nie doko?czy? projektu przez co rozmiar bloku pozosta? sztywno ograniczony.\n\nO co chodzi developerom Bitcoin Core?\n\nG?ównym argumentem za niezwi?kszeniem rozmiaru bloku jest du?y przyrost bitcoinowej ksi?gi transakcyjnej czyli Blockchaina, który ju? w tym momencie ma ponad 100GB, z czego tylko ostatni rok to prawie 40GB. W obecnej chwili taki rozmiar nie stanowi jeszcze problemu, jednak patrz?c przysz?o?ciowo na ci?gle rosn?cy przyrost u?ytkowników Bitcoina (równoznaczne z przyrostem blockchaina) istnieje obawa, ?e post?p technologiczny, mo?e nie nad??y? za przyrostem blockchaina. Doprowadzi? to mo?e do zmniejszenia liczby nodów w sieci przechowuj?cych ksi?g? transakcyjn? a co za tym idzie ich centralizacj? w r?kach wi?kszych podmiotów zamiast typowych u?ytkowników, tak jak to si? sta?o w miningu, gdzie du?e farmy praktycznie wyeliminowa?y górników „domowych”.\n\nCzy obawa Core jest s?uszna? Je?eli Bitcoin utrzyma swój przyrost u?ytkowników na obecnym poziomie to zdecydowanie nie. W tym tempie rozwój technologiczny a dok?adnie wzrost pojemno?ci dysków i mocy obliczeniowej spokojnie nad??y, za przyrostem ksi?gi transakcyjnej. Je?li jednak Bitcoin ma wej?? w krótkim terminie do mainstreamu, co oznacza?oby wzrost obecnej liczby u?ytkowników o nawet kilka czy kilkana?cie tysi?cy procent, wtedy tak, obawa jest ju? uzasadniona.\n\nWizj? Bitcoin Core jest przeniesienie mikrotransakcji do Lighting Network. Przepustowo?? oraz pojemno?? sieci Lighting jest o kilka rz?dów wi?ksza ni? Bitcoina, zwi?ksza si? równie? anonimowo?? transakcji. Ca?o?? pracuje „na Bitcoinie” i korzysta z jego mocy. Lighting jest wi?c swoistym rozszerzeniem Bitcoina, znacznie zwi?kszaj?c jego mo?liwo?ci. Oczywi?cie nie za darmo, transakcje nie s? np. zapisywane w ksi?dze transakcyjnej. Lighting bardziej nadaje si? do mikrotransakcji, które obecnie mog? „za?mieca?” ?a?cuch Bitcoina.\n\nDeweloperzy Core nie chc? zatem zwi?ksza? rozmiaru bloków, aby utrzyma? lekki blockchain spychaj?c ma?e transakcje do Lighting Network. Problem w tym, ?e zwi?kszenie rozmiaru bloku jest bardzo potrzebne ju? w tej chwili to raz, dwa deweloperzy Core narzucaj? swoj? wole u?ytkownikom Bitcoina, co jest niedopuszczalne. Lighting jak najbardziej jest bardzo dobrym rozwi?zaniem, ale nie kosztem upo?ledzenia Bitcoina. Core wr?cz wymusza na u?ytkownikach korzystanie z Lighting, gdy? na przepe?nionym Bitcoinie wyd?u?a si? czas potwierdzania transakcji i rosn? prowizje. To tak, jakby podnie?? ceny benzyny i zakorkowa? miasta, aby zmusi? na si?? ludzi do korzystania z komunikacji miejskiej.\n\nNajlepszym rozwi?zaniem by?oby wprowadzenie automatycznej regulacji bloków i Lighting Network oraz da? ludziom wybór z czego b?d? korzysta?. Znikome prowizje oraz bardzo du?a szybko?? transakcji i wi?ksza anonimowo?? sprawi, ?e Lighting Network na pewno nie b?dzie si? „kurzy?” a sukces Lighting praktycznie jest zapewniony przez czynnik ekonomiczny. Nie ma potrzeby upo?ledza? Bitcoina.\n\nAby wprowadzi? Lighting Network niezb?dna jest aktywacja SegWit i tu pojawi? si? problem, gdy? za tym rozwi?zaniem opowiada si? tylko oko?o 30% górników a, aby aktywacja si? powiod?a potrzebna jest zgoda 95% mocy sieci.\n\nDodatkowo developerom Bitcoin Core wyros?a opozycja w postaci Bitcoin Unlimited, za któr? ju? w tym momencie opowiada si? oko?o 40% mocy sieci, czyli wi?cej ni? SegWit. Tu pojawia si? teoretyczne zagro?enie rewolucji i Hard Forka co skutkowa?oby podzia?em Bitcoina na 2 waluty.\n\nCzy mamy si? czego ba??\n\nO tym, ?e mniejszo?ciowe forki nie s? niebezpieczne pisa? Gavin Andresen. Sytuacja równie? nie jest nowa. Bitcoin prze?y? ju? jeden „bunt” w wykonaniu Bitcoin XT czy te? Bitcoin Classic, które sko?czy?y si? niepowodzeniem. Kopalnie równie? gro?? nie pierwszy raz. Wszystko wskazuje równie? na to, ?e i tym razem b?dzie podobnie, przynajmniej je?li chodzi o Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited nie zyska? zbyt du?ego entuzjazmu w spo?eczno?ci, ale nie dlatego, ?e przeciwstawili si? Core i chc? zwi?kszy? rozmiar bloku. Developerzy Bitcoin Unlimited wydaj? si? by? ekip? amatorsk?, ich kod zawiera? wiele krytycznych b??dów, które teraz wychodz? na ?wiat?o dzienne. Same rozwi?zania Unlimited s? po prostu s?abe, dodatkowo nie wspierany jest potrzebny SegWit. Mimo, i? opozycja do Core jest potrzebna, aby ostudzi? ich zap?dy „dyktatorskie”, Unlimited wydaje si? by? z?ym do tego kandydatem.\n\nZ obecn? moc? na poziomie 40% Unlimited nie ma szans na przeprowadzenie skutecznego Hard Forka. Nawet osi?gni?cie 51% mocy niewiele zmieni, gdy? HF na tym poziomie by?by bardzo niekorzystny dla Bitcoina. Dopiero przy mocy wi?kszej ni? 75% (idealnie 95%) Hard Fork w wykonaniu Unlimited mia?by szanse powodzenia i racje bytu a na to nie ma szans.\n\nDodatkowo wi?ksze gie?dy opowiedzia?y si? za wspieraniem Bitcoin Core. Bior?c pod uwag? ma?y entuzjazm spo?eczno?ci oraz bitcoinowej infrastruktury Unlimited skazany jest na pora?k?. Próba Hard Forka przy mocy niewiele wi?kszej ni? 51% doprowadzi?aby prawdopodobnie do du?ego zamieszania oraz ostrego spadku kursu co prawdopodobnie doprowadzi?oby kopalnie opowiadaj?ce si? za Unlimited na skraj bankructwa.\n\nNa dzie? dzisiejszy ryzyko, roz?amu Bitcoina jest wi?c bardzo ma?e. Nawet gdyby Unlimited osi?gn?? sensown? moc, zanim aktywuje HF da spo?eczno?ci i infrastrukturze bitcoinowej czas na przygotowanie si?, inaczej z góry skaza?by si? na niepowodzenie (brak infrastruktury wspieraj?cej danego forka). Obecna panika widoczna w kursie jest wi?c nieuzasadniona i ma charakter czysto psychologiczny motywowany strachem.\n\nTu dochodzimy do punktu wyj?cia, je?li Unlimited nie ma szans a SegWit tym bardziej to nie ma szans na jakiekolwiek zmiany i rozwi?zanie obecnego kryzysu.\n\nDeweloperzy Core maj? ju? rozwi?zanie tego problemu, niestety na zasadzie ciosu poni?ej pasa. Bicz na kopalnie nazwany UASF zak?ada, ?e je?li mi?dzy 1 pa?dziernika a 15 listopada tego roku, SegWit nie zostanie aktywowany, wszystkie bloki które nie b?d? zawiera?y informacji o wspieraniu tego rozwi?zania b?d? odrzucane przez w?z?y, a w?ze? który taki ""z?y"" blok przes?a?, b?dzie banowany co doprowadzi do szybkiego wprowadzenia SegWit na si??. Bloki kopal? nie zgadzaj?cych si? b?d? odrzucane, a co za tym idzie kopalnie b?d? stratne.\n\nSi?owe rozwi?zanie zdecydowanie jest nieetyczne, ale pozostaje pytanie czy gorsze ni? brak jakichkolwiek zmian. Miejmy nadziej?, ?e do tego nie dojdzie a w mi?dzyczasie pojawi si? kompromis mi?dzy kopalniami wspieraj?cymi Unlimited i developerami Core.\n\nCo dalej z kursem?\n\nWydaje si?, ?e „bycze” nastroje oraz hossa zosta?a przerwana przez trzy opisane wy?ej ciosy, a szczególnie wizj? podzia?u sieci. Nastroje inwestorów jednak nie zmieni?y si?, lecz przenios?y si? na inne rynki. Tam gdzie dwóch si? bije trzeci korzysta. Z zamieszania wokó? Bitcoina korzystaj? inne kryptowaluty, które dzi?ki ma?ej wcze?niejszej kapitalizacji prze?ywaj? najwi?ksz? hoss? w swojej historii. Szczególnie na warto?ci zyska?y Dash i Ethereum i mówimy tu o wzro?cie nawet o 1000% czyli typowej ba?ce spekulacyjnej. Tu jednak na inwestorów czyha du?e niebezpiecze?stwo. Jak wszystkie ba?ki tak i te w ko?cu p?kn?, takie jest niezmienne prawo rynku o czym doskonale wiedz? u?ytkownicy Bitcoina, którzy prze?yli ju? trzy takie ba?ki. Podczas gdy na Bitcoinie w krótkim czasie straci? mo?na oko?o kilkana?cie procent i wi?cej, w przypadku napompowanych altcoinów mo?e by? to nawet wi?kszo?? inwestycji. Zalecamy wi?c du?? ostro?no?? i rozs?dek.\n\nWracaj?c do kursu samego Bitcoina trend wzrostowy nie zosta? prze?amany i utrzymuje si? w dolnej granicy kana?u wzrostowego z ma?ym oko?o 100$ zapasem. Je?li trend nie zostanie prze?amany najbardziej prawdopodobna w obecnej sytuacji wydaje si? konsolidacja z zakresem oko?o 800-1100$ utrzymuj?ca si? przez kilka tygodni lub miesi?cy. Trzeba równie? pami?ta?, ?e rynek Bitcoina jest bardzo emocjonalny i podatny na ró?ne wydarzenia, które trudno przewidzie?.\n\nWraz ze wzrostem mocy sieci opowiadaj?cej si? za Bitcoin Unlimited mo?emy spodziewa? si? wzrostu strachu przed HF i dalszych spadków. Spadki mog? za? zmusi? kopalnie „neutralne” (oko?o 30-40%) do opowiedzenia si? za któr?? ze stron „konfliktu” lub wycofania si? Unlimited, dlatego wiele mo?e zale?e? od najbli?szych tygodni.\n\nMo?liwe scenariusze:\n\nUnlimited zdobywa powy?ej 51% mocy – prawdopodobny du?y spadek kursu, samo zdarzenie ma?o prawdopodobne Kopalnie neutralne opowiadaj? si? za Core – prawdopodobny wzrost kursu lub dalsza konsolidacja Kopalnie neutralne opowiadaj? si? po stronie Core i Unlimited w równym stopniu – prawdopodobna dalsza konsolidacja Konsensus mi?dzy kopalniami i Core oraz uzgodniony HF i zwi?kszenie bloku – prawdopodobny du?y wzrost kursu Unlimited wycofuje si? – prawdopodobny wzrost kursu Brak jakichkolwiek zmian – prawdopodobna konsolidacja lub niewielkie opadanie kursu. Przy „si?owym” wprowadzeniu SegWit - prawdopodobny wzrost kursu Wy?onienie si? nowej implementacji bazuj?cej na zmodyfikowanym Bitcoin Core z wi?kszym blokiem. Du?a szansa na przychylno?? wi?kszo?ci kopalni. Mo?liwy wzrost kursu.

They stand poised to improve the oversight of international markets by supplying policymakers with real-time data on financial flows and asset class risks.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
03/26/2017,"['Since hitting a record-low of $177 in January 2015, Bitcoin is up almost 600%.\n\nOn March 2, 2017, it reached a new high of $1,268 per unit—thus surpassing the price of an ounce of gold for the first time ever.\n\nSo, what’s the driving force behind this parabolic rise?\n\nThe More Dimwitted Governments Act, the Better It Is for Bitcoin\n\nSince the beginning of last year, almost all Bitcoin trading has originated from China. This trend coincides with the introduction of capital controls. Since Beijing first enacted the controls in March 2016, over 90% of Bitcoin trading has been done through yuan.\n\nDeutsche Bank\n\nIn its short history, Bitcoin’s price has risen during episodes of monetary folly—as we’ve seen when similar capital controls were enacted in Cyprus and Greece in 2013 and 2015, respectively.\n\nYou could say it acts as a kind of “fear gauge” of public faith in fiat currencies and central banks.\n\nA 2016 study found that 20% of Bitcoin users owned the currency because they “didn’t want banks and governments controlling their money.” This was the second-most cited reason for owning it behind “investment purposes.”\n\nIn that sense, Bitcoin is comparable to gold. However, in many ways they are polar opposites.\n\nBitcoin Is a Store of Volatility\n\nGold has been a wealth preservation tool and a store of value for 2,500 years. Bitcoin was created in 2008 and has experienced large downside moves ever since. In the first week of 2017, Bitcoin dropped by over 30%.\n\nA major reason for Bitcoin’s volatility is its small market size. The average daily trading volume (ADTV) of Bitcoin is $32 million. In comparison, the ADTV of the largest gold ETF ( GLD ) is $845 million.\n\nThis chart shows just how small the market for Bitcoin is when compared to gold.\n\nGoldmoney, Bloomberg, FRED\n\nGiven the low ADTV, it’s impossible to buy $2 million worth of Bitcoin on any given day without moving the market. It is estimated that it would take only $50 million to dominate the Bitcoin market for five minutes. As such, there is huge potential for manipulation.\n\nThere have been attempts to expand the size of the market with the creation of a Bitcoin ETF. This would add liquidity and ease to investing in Bitcoin.', 'With a hard fork looming, BitGo, a multi-signature bitcoin wallet, has advised its customers what to do in the case of a new chain, whether it is Bitcoin Unlimited, which BitGo deems unsupportable, or a supportable option such as Segregated Witness.\n\nBen Davenport, co-founder and chief technical officer, advised users in a recent blog what actions BitGo will take and gave recommendations on what they should to in the event of a hard fork. BitGo did not assign a high probability of a hard fork until recently.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited Unsupportable\n\nBitGo will not support Bitcoin Unlimited, which it does not consider supportable. It will support Segregated Witness, (SegWit) which it consider safe and tested in the core code.\n\nBitGo believes any near-term fork will be contentious and bad for the bitcoin ecosystem. Brand dilution and user confusion will remove billions of dollars from the bitcoin market capitalization, Davenport noted.\n\nSegWit, on the other hand, will provide additional block space in the near term.\n\nBitGo cannot predict how the scenario will unfold, but the company will move as quickly as possible to provide solutions to protect customers’ interests.\n\nUnsupported Hard Fork = Altcoin\n\nAny hard fork introduced without industry-wide consensus will be an altcoin, regardless how much hash power that coin has. The majority of bitcoin exchanges share the same view, Davenport said.\n\nIf a hard fork were executed in a supportable manner, BitGo would support it with an API as soon as possible.\n\nTo support a hard fork, according to Davenport, it must meet the following:\n\n1. The hard fork has to be coordinated by a clear on-chain mechanism and have a grace period between activation and launch.\n\n2. It must provide strong two-way protection, whereby transactions are only valid on one of the two chains. Minus this measure, users can safely transact separately with splitting techniques that place an excessive burden on the end user.\n\n3. It has to offer “wipe out protection,” so that once it forks, it remains permanent. The new fork’s software should not be capable of producing a reorganization back to the original chain as it will wipe out the new chain.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited does not meet any of these criteria. In addition, there are problems with “emergent consensus” that can lead to ongoing network splits and reorganizations of arbitrary length chains based on the way miner groups establish consensus parameters.\n\nThere are also concerns about the quality of the peer review process and the general code of Bitcoin Unlimited. Because of this, BitGo will not support a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork in its current form.\n\nBitGo will change its position on Bitcoin Unlimited if it makes changes to make the fork supportable.\n\nWhat Users Should Do\n\nDavenport recommends users take the following actions if the Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork launches.\n\n1. Pause any outgoing transaction activity from BitGo. Otherwise, transactions can occur on both chains.\n\n2. Keep in close contact with BitGo for assistance in moving coins safely or in splitting coins. BitGo will help customers split their coins, but it cannot determine how long this will take.\n\n3. Once a hard fork has resolved itself back to a single chain due to it being abandoned by miners, or a splitting plan has been deployed, it will be safe to transact again on the original chain.\n\nShould there be a supportable fork, BitGo recommends the following steps.\n\n1. Continue to safety transact on the original network with the BitGo API. Users will not be able to transact on the new fork immediately. Transacting will not affect the coins on that side of the fork.\n\n2. Be ready for block times on the original network to increase significantly, due to an increased load on the network. Execute only necessary transactions and be ready for possibly higher fees for a number of weeks due to the extended number of blocks.\n\n3. Transact the value on the new coin by waiting for BitGo to add support for the new coin, or use the two keys with software built by others. BitGo cannot commit to any time frame for supporting the new coin.\n\nAlso read: Here’s why a hard fork can’t work\n\nOther Concerns\n\nMalicious forking that undermines the existing minority chain with excess hash power is also a possibility. This can create a chain of empty blocks or a working chain suddenly experiencing a chain reorganization many blocks deep. BitGo considers this to be the same as a 51% attack on the bitcoin network.\n\nIn such a case, BitGo recommends halting all bitcoin activity, including outgoing transactions and crediting incoming deposits. One cannot make normal assumptions about block confirmations to finalize a transaction.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', ""The divide within the Bitcoin community is becoming wider as the necessity for Bitcoin scaling becomes much more pronounced.\n\nA fork of Dash, Private Instant Verified Transaction, (PIVX) claims to have embarked on a process to change what it describes as the “centralized” nature of the voting process within the industry.\n\nCurrently running a “Masternode” system which it inherited from Dash, Eric Stanek, Team Member at PIVX infers that Satoshi’s original intent was that millions of individuals will be mining away on their GPUs, therefore power within the community will be truly decentralized. Rather what is obtainable today is power being centralized to a few massive mining farms.\n\nBitcoin divide\n\nWith the introduction of both Segregated Witness and Bitcoin Unlimited and the consensus nature of Bitcoin governance, a lot of users may still be very unclear about the decision-making process within the community. Hence the shade of confusion hovering above the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nMichael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins, explains it this way:\n\n“These are certainly unsettling times for Bitcoin, and we are witnessing history being written before our eyes. I think it's important to note that over the long term, this likely won't be the last divide within the Bitcoin community, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing - innovation is usually a byproduct of these types of situations.”\n\nBeing a system that is based on proof of work, the decision-making process lies in the hands of miners within the decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem. It is the miners whose votes will determine the next turn for Bitcoin.\n\nThe partial centralization of Bitcoin\n\nVogel explains that the ability to vote for changes to Bitcoin is essentially proportional to the computing power that each miner contributes to the Bitcoin network. This explains the fact that Bitcoin is based on Proof of Work (PoW). Vogel also notes that there is no preset voting period, so miners can vote for changes to Bitcoin at any time. In theory, this is a very elegant and unique way of handling the evolution of Bitcoin, although it does mean that the interests of miners guide the direction of Bitcoin.\n\nThis explains why statements credited to top miners within the industry regarding Bitcoin scaling usually have a significant impact on both Bitcoin price and its general behavior.\n\nThe comparison between Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) and other services such as DASH’s Proof of Service (PoS) and PIVX Proof of Stake (PoS) also exists in some quarters.\n\nA common scenario in both cases, however, is the possibility of a partial centralization of the system by early adopters who may actually be a smaller fraction of the entire users of the given system.\n\nAn example in Bitcoin is the situation where mining has become more difficult and less profitable that in the previous years, therefore new participants aren’t necessarily attracted to mining. A larger percentage of participants within the system, who will definitely be affected by the end result of the voting process will have no say in determining the future of the environment within which they are participating.\n\nBack to the future\n\nIn its attempt to change the status quo and create a governance system where everyone has a voice, Eric Stanek says that PIVX is working on a proposal that will only require a YES or NO response from members of the community.\n\nThis, according to him will influence the content of the PIVX manifesto and would be factored in early enough in order to avoid such a scenario as is presently experienced in Bitcoin and Dash where development has gone so far that changing the system has become almost impossible.\n\nFlexible\n\nFor systems that operate by Proof of Service (PoS) like Dash, which is more flexible as for the purpose of decision making, only members of the community who own Masternodes can vote. This system also sidelines smaller investors, who actually make up the majority of the community.\n\nOne may argue that the patterns employed by these communities are reasonably appropriate, owing to the fact that only major investors whether in “Work” or “Stake” will be more critical about issues that concern their respective communities, therefore would appear as delegates in these democratic settings."", 'Bitcoin price is pulling up from its slide but is also approaching the descending channel resistance at $1050.\n\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price recovered from its slide late in the week as dollar demand dipped on the failure to repeal Obamacare.\n\nA few more gains could be in the cards for bitcoin price as it makes its way up to the channel resistance near $1050.\n\nIf the top of the channel keeps gains in check, bitcoin could fall back to support or the previous lows at $900.\n\nBitcoin price is pulling up from its slide but is also approaching the descending channel resistance at $1050.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA on this time frame so the path of least resistance is to the downside. Also, bitcoin price already appears to be finding some resistance at the 100 SMA, which suggests that it could be ready to slide back down to the channel support. Still, a larger pullback faces a couple of roadblocks at the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point and channel resistance.\n\nStochastic is turning higher to suggest a return in buying pressure. RSI is on its way down but appears to be stalling around the middle, suggesting that range-bound conditions could come into play. Nearby support is located at $950.\n\nMarket Events\n\nAlthough bitcoin price has more than a few factors dragging it down recently, the dollar’s slide towards the end of the previous week seems to have played a bigger role on BTCUSD movement. After all, Congress initially pushed back a vote on the healthcare bill when they realized they didn’t have enough votes then later on decided to withdraw the proposal.\n\nThis signals that the Trump administration could have trouble pushing its agenda to lawmakers, leading investors to speculate that it would take much longer than initially anticipated to see tax reform or financial deregulation to come to fruition. Also, the lack of fiscal stimulus could have repercussions on the central bank’s tightening time line, leading market watchers to price in lower odds of a June hike and set their sights on September instead.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Investor interest in Fa...', ""Bitcoin has been trading between $1114-887 this week, according to the BLX, in extremely volatile market conditions with intense bearish momentum. The Network Hashrate gained 3.24% on March 3rd, and has increased 42.48% year to date.\n\nThe most important fundamental news this week has been the back and forth exchange between the Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) and Bitcoin Core (BC) factions. BU miner signalling continues to gain ground, up 10% this week. Nodes however, remain heavily in BCs favor.\n\nMeanwhile, the previous quarterly futures contract from OKCoin closes this week. Below is a chart showing the quarterly contract open dates (orange), the previous quarterly moving to biweekly (blue), and the previous quarterly contract closing (yellow).\n\nVolatility during these three weeks has previously signaled a bullish exhaustion, and a bearish upcoming quarter. Stability has signaled accumulation, and the bottom of bullish continuation. The spot price has been extremely volatile in this time period, which indicates a bearish upcoming quarter.\n\nAt the same time, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) continues to apply stricter Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering requirements. Traders using chinese exchanges are now required to register for accounts in person, or withdraw their current balances. It’s unlikely that domestic Chinese exchange volume will return to previous levels anytime soon, and LocalBitcoin volume will continue at historic levels.\n\nJapan therefore continues to be the market leader in volume, with 50% of total bitcoin volume traded in the past 24 hours. Japan recently became very accepting of Bitcoin as a currency, recognizing it as legal tender.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nDue to the enormous selling pressure over the last week, the bull trend beginning in 2015 is currently being threatened. Let’s gather some evidence on high time frames to assess the safety and validity of the longstanding bull trend.\n\nFor the first time in the entire trend, the monthly candle is a risk for a bearish engulfing candle with a few days left to close.\n\nThere is also the possibility of a Cup and Handle, a bullish continuation chart pattern, forming. However, there are a few caveats and conditions.\n\nFirst, Cup and Handle patterns in traditional markets typically have an age expiration, and this formation is far past that expiration. Second, the ideal volume profile is one with a descending nature, which is definitely not the case here (not shown). Third, the Cup and Handle remains valid as long as the handle low closes above the 0.50 fibonacci retracement level. The smaller the pullback, to say the 0.618 fibonacci retracement level, the higher the probability of bullish continuation. Fourth, the measured target for continuation is taken from the cups horizontal resistance to the low and projected upward, again from the horizontal resistance. This yields a target of ~$2,100 with a 1.618 fibonacci extension of $1,789. It should be noted that upon breaking the horizontal resistance at ~$1,200, there is typically a retest of the horizontal as support. Overall, this pattern has many months yet to complete, but has begun to form and is worth watching.\n\nOn the weekly time frame, a powerful trend indicating system is Heikin-Ashi (HA) candles, which use open and close data from the previous period, and open and close data from the current period.\n\nAn open and a close above the previous period suggests strong momentum of the given trend. An open and a close within the bounds of the previous period suggests a slowing of trend. A color flip from green to red or red to green indicates the possibility of the beginning of a new trend and the end of the previous trend.\n\nDepending on the exits and stops, the second consecutive green weekly candle after a red candle has been an excellent entry this entire trend. A bullish continuation is likely should two consecutive green weekly HA candles occur.\n\nOn the daily time frame, two indicators provide further details after a large drop: Ichimoku Cloud and Pitchfork.\n\nIchimoku Cloud uses moving averages and dynamic support and resistance to make projections of key zones, as well as capturing 80% of any given trend. As long as the price remains above the cloud, sentiment remains bullish. Price in the cloud indicates a neutral trend, and below the cloud indicates a bearish trend.\n\nWhen the Tenkan (T) is over the Kijun (K) sentiment is bullish. K over T would indicate bearish sentiment. When the Lagging Span (LS) is above the cloud and above the price sentiment is bullish, below the cloud and price would indicate bearish sentiment. The best entry signals for the cloud occur when trend is obvious, but 1 or 2 of the signals have yet to become confluent with a higher timeframe trend.\n\nSince the trend began in late 2015, price has only closed below the cloud once, in early August. This was due to selling pressure created when the Bitfinex hack became public knowledge. Within 35 days the trend corrected, and returned above the cloud. After this most recent 30% selloff, price was again at risk pf closing below the cloud, a bearish trend indicator.\n\nYesterday’s candle closed as a dragonfly, which typically indicates that bearish momentum has been exhausted. Price also remains in the cloud which, is classified as a neutral trend indication. The TK lines are touching and uncrossed, a long exit signal if you were still long from the previous bullish TK cross on February 7th. As a whole, the indicator is signalling a trend reset, an opportune time for profit taking.\n\nA bullish re-entry signal would include price above cloud, bullish TK cross, and LS above price and cloud. All of these conditions will probably take a month or more to complete. Including the OKCoin quarterly contract theory, it may take another three months of price stability before bullish momentum continues.\n\nWith the Pitchfork indicator, shown below on a Bitstamp, each diagonal of the Pitchfork can be thought of as a PRZ or support/resistance line. The upper blue diagonal zone being ‘most overbought’ or the top bounds of the trend and lower blue diagonal zone being ‘most oversold’ or the bottom bounds of the trend.\n\nPrice briefly closed in the lower bounds of the Pitchfork and is currently retracing closer to mean. The red median line remains the high probability target of the immediate move over the next few weeks.\n\nWhen diagnosing the health of a trend, the 50 day and 200 day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame is very valuable. Much like the Bitfinex hack and subsequent trend reset in August, price bounced from the 200EMA. Again, this suggests trend continuation over trend reversal.\n\nAdding an oscillator to the mix, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), determines market momentum. Divergences occur when price action does not match momentum.\n\nA bearish divergence is created when price makes a higher high but RSI does not. This suggests weakening of bullish momentum. A bullish divergence is created when price makes a lower low and RSI makes a higher low. This suggests weakening of bearish momentum.\n\nDivergences suggest trend reversal, however, divergences can continue growing until the reversal becomes obvious and should be thought of as a lagging indicator.\n\nThere are hidden divergences, which require further explanation. A hidden bullish divergence is created when price makes a higher low and RSI makes a lower low. This indicates, despite an increase in bearish momentum, bearish pressure is being exhausted.\n\nA hidden bearish divergence is created when price makes a lower high and RSI makes a higher high. This indicates, despite bullish momentum, bullish pressure is being exhausted. Over the course of this trend, hidden bull divergences on the daily time frame have been a strong indication of bullish continuation.\n\nThe current hidden bullish divergence holding would indicate strong bullish continuation from this point forward.\n\nLasty, on the four hour time frame, there is currently a completed and active bullish butterfly harmonic pattern. Harmonic patterns typically have a target zone of the 0.50-0.618 fibonacci retracement zone. A secondary target of the diagonal resistance from the previous double top is also a viable target.\n\nSummary\n\nBU hard fork fear, uncertainty, and doubt remains ever-present, until, if, or when it happens. Long term holders will see this as a price blip in the grand scheme of things, whereas risk-averse traders would do better staying out of the market for now, until BU, SegWit, or both are activated. With a 30% drop from all-time high, price is beginning to show signs of a bottom and trend reset. This may precede a period of relative stability over the next three months, followed by bullish continuation to $1,789-$2,100 by year’s end."", 'BitX, that had recently re-branded itself as Luno, says the move will enable it to become a ‘more consumer friendly brand’, but South African entrepreneur Marcus Swanepoel, who founded this Singapore-based digital currency exchange, points out that the new name has more to it than meets the eye. “Luno means ‘moon’ and represents the shared sense of excitement we and our customers have about this new industry. It also reflects our responsibility in helping people safely escape the gravity of the existing financial system. The moon also emphasises Bitcoin’s greater potential of open and equal financial access: no matter who you are or where you’re from, every night we all still see the same moon. It is one of the world’s only constants, and in many ways it is the world’s one true leveller,” he said in an interaction with this portal. The startup, that is backed by Naspers Group, Digital Currency Group and Venturra Capital, currently has more than 40 staff distributed over Singapore, London and Cape Town, with most of the engineering and operations in the latter. Swanepoel also highlighted the potential of Bitcoin ETFs: “There are already a number of these in the pipeline, and when one observes what physical gold ETFs did for the price of gold by opening it up to new sources of liquidity, one can easily guess what might happen to the Bitcoin price when these launch.” He also highlighted the increased institutional interest, with some hedge funds publicly taking large positions in Bitcoin. “The ‘real’ money hasn’t even began to start playing in this space, and it is poised to happen. Can you imagine what would happen if just one sovereign wealth fund had to take even just small position in Bitcoin?,” he added. Edited excerpts:\n\nWhat led to the rebrand from BitX to Luno?\n\nWe founded BitX in early 2013 to bring the power of digital currency to the world. We believe that decentralised digital currencies like Bitcoin will fundamentally change how the world views and uses money: cheaper, faster and safer transactions; more privacy and financial freedom; a significantly better user experience; and ultimately, more equality by giving everyone in the world access to the same financial system.\n\nWe changed our name to Luno to better show who we are and where we’re heading. Luno means ‘moon’ and represents the shared sense of excitement we and our customers have about this new industry.\n\nAt the same time, it also reflects our responsibility in helping people safely escape the strong gravity of existing financial systems. Finally, the moon also emphasises Bitcoin’s greater potential of open and equal financial access: no matter who you are or where you’re from, every night we all still see the same moon. It is one of the world’s only constants, and in many ways, it is the world’s one true leveller.\n\nHow much do you expect this to drive growth?\n\nFrom our perspective, re-branding to Luno enables us to become a more consumer-friendly brand and place ourselves as one of the leading digital currency companies worldwide.\n\nWith the launch, we also announced expansion into Europe as well as the ability to buy Bitcoin using your credit card. We expect the combination of these announcements to significantly supercharge our growth this year as we double down on educating the market better and launching a range of new features through the year.\n\nJapan has legalised virtual currencies. In terms of regulations, what would you like to see in Singapore?\n\nMost countries around the world are now unsure of how to regulate Bitcoin. This is normal as happens with all new disruptive technologies. Some countries though are taking more of an initiative in regulating the currency. The state of New York has something called a BitLicense which is its regulatory framework for digital currency companies.\n\nLike you mentioned, Japan recently passed a bill that mandates the regulation of bitcoin and virtual currency exchanges by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The central bank of Singapore (i.e. Monetary Authority of Singapore) also has proposed a new regulatory framework for payments providers in the city-state, a move that would bring digital currency exchanges under its oversight.\n\nSo as you can see, there are steps being made to bring all of this under the regulatory umbrella in different ways based on how each country views Bitcoin. We are working very proactively with a number of governments and regulators around the world to help create local policy, provide education, and make sure the needs of all stakeholders are met.', 'Brave New World Investments AB, a new firm registered in Sweden, is now accepting deposits in bitcoin which it converts to Iranian Rial and invests in equities on the Tehran Stock Exchange. It does this on behalf of its European shareholders while also searching for angel investors among the Persian and bitcoin communities in Europe.\n\nThe team behind the venture is Mairtin O’Duinnin and Mikael Johansson, both with experience in finance and technology in Europe and the Middle East. Brave New World is the first known company in Sweden to incorporate without a bank account and handled all the initial funding in bitcoin. It was prevented by the Swedish banks due to fears their U.S. operations would be affected by the American financial sanctions if the banks allowed Swedish-Iranian business.\n\nJohansson commented to Finance Magnates about the business: “We got to think of the venture as the sanctions against Iran were starting to get dismantled in early 2016. However, due to U.S. financial sanctions still in effect against Iran, none of the Swedish banks wanted to help us – despite there being no relevant sanctions against Iran in Sweden or European Union stopping us.\n\nInstead of giving up the idea we side-stepped the Swedish banking system and funded it on the blockchain – which the Swedish company registration accepted – after many meetings. Now we simply do not have a Swedish bank account (however we do have an Iranian bank account for the equity investments). We pay our bills, shareholder dividends, Iran deposits – everything – in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are no sanctions in Sweden or in the European Union obstructing Swedish-Iranian investments, so we are not breaking any laws in our jurisdiction. We religiously follow anti money laundry directives set by the relevant institutions of Sweden and the European Union. Due to the current U.S. sanctions, the company will not have U.S. operations nor U.S. investors for an indefinite future.”\n\n(Source: financemagnates.com)', 'In a recent announcement, the European Parliament (EU) released a new directive related to the anti-money laundering (AML) issue that focuses particularly on digital currencies, even if the EU considers it to be marginal but with a possibility to increase in the future.\n\nAML vs. freedom?\n\nThe EU Directive 2015/849 - that requires Compliance by June of 2017 - wants to avoid potential money laundering. This is the fourth to address this issue, with the first directive enacted back in 1991.\n\nThe EU’s definition of money laundering has been changed among the different directives and the latest one is focused on Bitcoin and digital currencies with the goal of a new regulation for wallets and cryptocurrencies admins.\n\nFrom this perspective, it is impossible not to link this directive to the continuous wrong association of Bitcoin to illegal activities.\n\nAs I wrote in a recent article, can regulation be a good answer to AML-related issues? Regulating or being afraid of something because it might be used for illegal activities is like blaming fiat currencies because they are used to buy drugs or weapons.\n\n?ash money and digital currencies, in fact, have a few characteristics in common, especially if you consider their anonymous status. And AML existed even before cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnonymous digital currencies\n\nOne of the major cryptocurrencies benefit is its free and anonymous status, considering that they are not controlled by any central bank and that transactions are executed through encrypted systems thanks to the Blockchain.\n\nAlso, we have to say that Bitcoin is not so anonymous as most people believe; instead we can say that ZCash and Monero completely hide their user’s data.\n\nThat said, the most recent directive issued in July indicates that digital currencies ""don’t possess the legal status of currency or money"" and ""cannot be anonymous.""\n\nThe EU went on to say:\n\n“The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes. In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies taking up and their potential benefits to spread. The inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without exchange platforms or custodian wallet providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.”\n\nThe EU Parliament also suggested the creation of a central database to register users’ info and wallets addresses, as well as a self-declaration form for the users of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBehind this move, the Parliament explained that the main goal is to ""monitor the use of virtual currencies in order to identify suspicious activities.""', 'A world without gambling scams – that\'s just the latest big idea being tested on the ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhile much of the news lately has been on the platform\'s increasing enterprise use, the project is still a predominantly open-source community, one fueled by the ideas and hard work of entrepreneurs the world over.\n\nTake DAO.Casino, a project based in Russia that\'s building a decentralized platform for gambling games. The DAO.Casino ecosystem seeks to reward users for participating in the platform (whether they\'re developers or players), and ethereum distributes funds depending on the value they bring to the ecosystem.\n\nThe developers claim the platform will help protect users from gambling scams by ensuring that those running are operating accordingly.\n\nYet, even while the platform has laudable intentions, DAO.Casino must be licensed, and that means it must seek approval from regulators.\n\nThis raises questions around online gambling regulation, and it seems regulators are only in the early stages of thinking about blockchains and how they might mitigate scams.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission told CoinDesk that it does not have a position on using blockchain technology as a way to regulate online gambling.\n\nGambling legislation remains a matter for member countries in the EU, she said.\n\nThe UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), likewise, warns gamblers and operators about the use of digital currency, but has no specific comments on the blockchain.\n\nTim Miller, the UKGC\'s executive director, told CoinDesk:\n\n""We think that by far the best way for consumers in Britain to protect themselves from scams is to check they\'re gambling with an operator licensed by us.""\n\nIn this context, an interesting disagreement seems to emerge. Namely, who should users trust, cryptography or authority?\n\nNew authority\n\nStill, it remains unclear how much of a problem gambling scams are.\n\nStats from the UK, for example, show that 29% of the gambling market share is now online. Yet, concrete figures on the amount of people affected by online gambling scams and fraud are hard to come by.\n\nThe founders of DAO.Casino describe the traditional gambling infrastructure as being far too closed off and opaque.\n\nFor example, this month, bookmakers in the UK and Ireland are seeing a boost in online bets placed thanks to the Cheltenham races, but there have been allegations around the use of software to restrict gamblers and curtail their winnings.\n\nIn DAO.Casino\'s blockchain alternative, developers need to create games on smart contracts on the platform, yet after that, there is a more democratic review.\n\n""After that, somebody from the community or from the foundation makes an audit of your logic of your game,"" explained Ilya Tarutov, CEO of DAO.Casino.\n\nHe believes this creates greater trust among the community and encourages more users to play and gamble.\n\nWaiting game\n\nFaced with this prospect, regulators seem to suggest that there\'s little evidence that gambling scams are a pervasive problem.\n\nThe European Commission stressed that it makes recommendations on common principles for protecting consumers online, and that an expert group regularly discusses new technologies. Blockchain, it said, may be a future issue.\n\nThe spokesperson did however raise questions around how DAO.Casino presents itself.\n\n""We are certainly aware that there are many rogue websites out there and we know that regulators are facing huge challenges ... but the suggestion that all of ‘traditional’ gambling is unfair is not one we have come across before,"" she said.\n\nShe added:\n\n""Conversely, I am sure the proposed platform will raise regulatory questions for the relevant national authorities.""\n\nFor now, though, DAO.Casino is moving ahead, with about 1,000 test users.\n\nTarutov is seeking approval from the government of Curaçao to operate the games. The Caribbean island has granted licenses to bitcoin gambling site MegaDice for example.\n\nBecause of this, he stressed that the platform only in ""testing mode"" so far:\n\n""When we have a license we will start promoting it.""\n\nFor now, it seems, this means larger questions implied by blockchain may go unanswered.\n\nSlot machine image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

03/27/2017,"[""Bitcoin price reached $1,030 in most global Bitcoin exchanges such as Bitstamp and Bitfinex earlier today, recovering from the March 24 drop which occurred due to speculations on the likelihood of Bitcoin Unlimited being executed as a hard fork solution.\n\nLast week, a severe bug was exploited by Bitcoin Unlimited developers and as a result, the software’s lead development team released a closed patch to fix the bugs in the Bitcoin Unlimited software. The majority of the community was outraged by the incompetent move of the Bitcoin Unlimited development team in releasing an undisclosed update on its software.\n\nAs a result, the support for Bitcoin Unlimited decreased significantly in terms of both hash power and node count. More importantly, the decline of Bitcoin Unlimited increased support toward Segregated Witness. Bitcoin investors including Alistair Milne emphasized that support for SegWit has never been this high prior to the second bug exploitation of Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nWhat if I told you that signalling for SegWit has never been this high? #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/UcbI41q2KO — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) March 26, 2017\n\nHow increasing SegWit support & Bitcoin Unlimited decline affect price\n\nSince early March, Bitcoin price has continued to fluctuate wildly due to the unclarity in Bitcoin hard fork contingency. While the vast majority of the Bitcoin industry including wallet platform operators, Bitcoin exchanges and node operators expressed their strong support for the Bitcoin Core development team and its scaling solution SegWit, miners in China such as Bitmain’s Antpool signaled Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nUsers, businesses and miners are seeing some level of clarity in the Blockchain increase debate as the support for Bitcoin Unlimited is dwindling. Although it is still too early to speculate if the declining support for Bitcoin Unlimited will translate to SegWit support, the majority of the community currently believes that this will, in fact, be the case.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin and Blockchain startup Prasos CEO Henry Brade noted that the Bitcoin Unlimited team is seeing a conflict of interest between the industry and their group of miners. Bitcoin Unlimited doesn’t want to be listed as an altcoin or an alt asset but most exchanges have already announced that if BTU is introduced to the market, it will be listed as an alt-asset.\n\n“BU can't do a fork without splitting into an altcoin. BU doesn't want to be an altcoin. Thus I see a high likelihood of no fork,” said Henry Brade.\n\nIf the support toward SegWit increases in the upcoming weeks and the door for two-layer scalability solutions such as Lightning and TumbleBit opens, it is highly likely that Bitcoin price will reach a stability point in the near future."", 'Indian bitcoin exchange Zebpay has refuted recent media reports in the country that have supposedly claimed bitcoin has been declared ‘illegal’ by the Indian government.\n\nOn Friday, Indian politician Kirit Somaiya, a politician belonging to India’s ruling party, the BJP, labelled bitcoin a “hypothetical currency” and more pointedly, questioned if it was a “pyramid ponzi scheme”. The politician, who is also a member of the Indian parliament, raised his concerns to India’s financial regulators including the country’s central bank, the RBI (Reserve Bank of India).\n\nThe story has since made the rounds in Indian news media, with some reports claiming that the cryptocurrency had been declared “illegal” by the government.\n\nTackling these media reports, Zebpay, among the largest bitcoin exchanges in the country, dismissed such claims. In a blog today, Zebpay wrote:\n\nNo, that is not true. Nothing has changed regarding bitcoin’s legal status in India this week. In our opinion, bitcoin is not illegal. Bitcoin is legal under all existing laws. It’s business as usual at all Indian bitcoin exchanges including Zebpay.\n\nThe bitcoin exchange then addressed the politician’s ponzi concerns directly, with bitcoin’s growing interest and adoption in a country of over a billion residents.\n\n“Just like the [Indian fiat] Rupee is not a ponzi, neither is bitcoin,” wrote Zebpay, pointing to the abuse of the cryptocurrency by certain ponzi schemes.\n\nZebpay wrote:\n\nThe well-meaning MP [Member of Parliament] wants to do his job of protecting the people from becoming victims of such ponzi schemes. It’s a misunderstanding of the technology that made him remark that bitcoin is ponzi.\n\nZebpay has recently addressed a number of multi-level marketing and pyramid schemes that have notably chosen bitcoin as their operational currency.\n\nNot content with the lack of regulation from the government, the Indian bitcoin industry established a self-regulatory body in February this year. The Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DAFBI) will address regulators’ concerns with bitcoin by engaging them and explaining digital currencies like bitcoin and blockchain technology. The body will also warn bitcoin investors and adopters of ponzi schemes operating with bitcoin in India.\n\nThe increasing media coverage of bitcoin in India comes at a time when awareness and adoption of the cryptocurrency have never been higher in the country, following November’s unprecedented and controversial demonetization drive.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'LocalBitcoins narrowly set a new global all-time high last week as price volatility saw just over $32 mln traded.\n\nThe P2P marketplace, which operates in markets throughout the world and has seen a surge in usage in recent months, has seen trade volumes increase on an almost weekly basis.\n\nA dip earlier this month was counteracted by data for the seven days ending March 25, with the service’s Chinese sector contributing over 54 mln yuan to the total.\n\nIn the week prior, China itself set a new all-time trading record as regulatory noises from the central bank sent traders rushing to do business on comparatively unregulated P2P marketplaces.\n\nA repeat trend is being seen across the world in Mexico, meanwhile, with data from the country’s biggest exchange Bitso making for impressive reading.\n\nLast week saw the exchange handle 3,660 BTC, with the first week of March seeing a record 4,870 BTC, broadly in line with universal increased activity prior to the Winklevoss ETF decision.\n\nCommenting on the figures, vocal Bitcoin Core proponent Avatar-X added that weekly volumes for Mexico as a whole “is at least” $10 mln at present.', 'About The Author\n\nJoseph Young is a finance and tech journalist based in Hong Kong.

In this groundbreaking milestone, the owner of a roof solar panel sold a few kilowatt-hours of excess energy to a neighbor utilizing an Ethereum blockchain smart contract. Fueling this development via the Brooklyn microgrid was the startup company LO3 Energy.\n\n\n\nToday power and utility companies all over the world are now exploring various ways to implement blockchain technology. Doing so could upend existing models of how energy and utility markets function. Applied on a broader scale, it could be the spark that transforms these legacy industries.\n\nSo what sort of problems is blockchain technology expected to address in this space? For starters, the technology is seen as a means of overcoming some of the entry barriers that restrict the delivery of electricity to more customers. Here the blockchain infrastructure could foster a more open and transparent mechanism for codifying transactions in the energy realm involving both generation and consumption.\n\nSecond, blockchain technology can provide companies in these industries with a more efficient way to record and process data, potentially leading to a more synchronized global distribution of energy. Customers would also be afforded a more streamlined and accurate experience in terms of managing their bills and access to the activity taking place on their accounts.\n\nThird, the archaic and costly function of meter reading could effectively be eliminated while at the same time boosting the accuracy of bills.\n\nFinally, blockchain integration can provide a more effective system for assessing energy sources and determining how that affects the pricing passed on to the consumer. Better technology tools provide more accurate energy utilization and service data, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the end customer.\n\nThe broader implications of this would include increased industry competition leading to lower prices, streamlined energy distribution, reduced energy waste and better relationships between utility companies and their customers.\n\nFor a deeper perspective on blockchain technology’s emerging impact on the power, utilities and energy markets, Bitcoin Magazine turned to Thierry Mortier, Global Leader of Technology and Innovation for Power and Utilities at Ernst & Young (EY).\n\nMortier says that the power sector is in the midst of shifting from a centralized model to a more distributed model. He believes that in the future new digital peer-to-peer platforms will emerge to eliminate the middleman and seamlessly connect energy producers directly with the end power user.\n\n“Blockchain technology will help facilitate this process by allowing transactions to be recorded between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. It can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically. The technology promises to radically speed up transactions and cut costs by establishing trust and the transfer of value without the involvement of traditional intermediaries.”\n\nMortier goes on to note that, aside from some early demonstrations, the applicability of an energy blockchain is still largely theoretical. He points to how blockchain enthusiasts are drawn in by the growing complex web of transactions, the need to balance the geographical mismatch between supply and demand, and significant security and trust concerns given the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices.\n\nSays Mortier: “Over 200 blockchain use cases have been identified already. Most pilots are still in early stages across the energy value chain, primarily in the area of peer-to-peer energy trading. EY is working with companies in the power and utilities sector to develop use cases and prototypes.”\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned April 2016 development, where residents in Brooklyn, New York, successfully traded renewable energy using a smart contract on the public Ethereum blockchain platform, he says that in Australia, several pilots are under way, allowing residents in Perth and South Western Australia to buy, sell or swap excess solar energy with anyone connected to the Western Power network.\n\nFurthermore, he says that Germany, with Berlin as the global hub of the technology, has a strong presence, as does the U.K., building on the early investment of the financial services sector in the technology. “Blockchain maturity seems to be driven by company ambition rather than any national advantage at this stage,” says Mortier.\n\nHe is especially excited about the emergence of pre-programmed “smart contracts” that can trigger transactions automatically.\n\n“These smart contracts, for example, can be set to allow prosumers to feed surplus energy into the grid through a blockchain-enabled meter. The flow of electricity is automatically coded into the blockchain, and algorithms match buyers and sellers in real time based on preferences. Smart contracts then execute when electricity is delivered, triggering payment from buyer to seller. Removing financial transactions and the execution of contractual commitments from central control brings a whole new level of decentralization and transparency that the industry has never had before.”\n\nMortier also touts the rapidly growing prominence of energy trading, an area he says appears to be moving toward a commercial solution more quickly than many of the others.\n\nIn conclusion, Mortier says that there has been significant interest in tracking and tracing resource types (green gas, for example) and in the peer-to-peer, prosumer-led trading. But, outside of Bitcoin applications, he laments that there is a lack of proven use cases, with difficulties involving security, scalability and frequency of transactions as factors that need to be overcome.\n\n“In three to five years’ time, it is quite possible that blockchain [technology] will radically change the way parts of the power industry operate. To get there, blockchain [technology] must overcome competition from existing solutions and prove its attractiveness to users. Only if its applications have tangible, monetary or timely advantages will blockchain [technology] be able convince enough participants to ditch their legacy systems for this new platform.”', 'Internet users in Venezuela have finally quantified what it truly means to have a rare Pepe, buying and selling Pepe-themed, bitcoin-linked trading cards as a way to escape the economic control of their socialist government.\n\nThe idea of images of the popular green frog being “rare” started off as a joke on 4chan, where users would claim that their images of Pepe were rarer and more valuable than everyone else’s. It escalated into people selling their collections of Pepe on eBay, with bids reaching up to almost $100,000 before eBay took it down.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThere were never any serious transactions however, with everyone involved enjoying the ironic humour of the situation. More recently, a group of redditors have been “trading” memes of any shape and size on /r/MemeEconomy, attempting to create a stock market in meme popularity. But, it turns out that rare Pepe collecting online is now a serious business.\n\nSometime last year, an unknown individual began issuing “official” rare Pepe trading cards using the Counterparty platform to link them to bitcoin, in an attempt to poke fun at another online trading game called Spells of Genesis. Today, these cards can be exchanged for the equivalent of thousands of US dollars on Counterparty’s decentralised exchange.\n\nThis is due to a creation of artificial scarcity in the cards (as one would expect trading cards to have). Anyone can issue their own rare Pepes, but these are then verified by the official Rare Pepe Foundation, and linked to a certain piece of the bitcoin chain via a practice known as coin colouring. Whomsoever owns that particular bitcoin key address owns the Pepe associated with it. All verified rare Pepes can be viewed in a complete directory of them.\n\nThis is in particular use in Venezuela. Developers of a game called Rare Pepe Party that would utilise some of these cards have claimed that they are needed to keep their company afloat. “We’re based in Venezuela, and our business has been saved by bitcoin many times,” the developer, who wished to remain anonymous, told Crypto Insider.\n\nAccording to them, around 80% of offices in the vicinity of theirs have been closed down in the past year, with even the biggest businesses still around losing up to 90% of their employees. “In that timeframe, thanks to bitcoin related business, we’ve grown our employee base from just 5 to 10 (we’re still a small company),” said the developer. “We’ve air-conditioned our office. Year-over-year we’ve been improving, so we’re banking big on bitcoin and now over Counterparty assets.”\n\nHowever, bitcoin is not completely safe in the South American nation. Venezuela’s equivalent of secret police, SEBIN, have been targeting people using bitcoin and bringing them up on or extortion and bribes, especially bitcoin miners, according to the developer. “Anything bitcoin related is a big no-no here at the moment… this week I got wind of at least two mining operators getting knocks on their doors.”\n\nJack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

In addition, the short-term 100 SMA is just above the channel support at the $1000 major psychological level, adding to its strength as a floor. A larger correction could last until the 200 SMA at $990.\n\nStochastic is heading south so bitcoin price might follow suit. This suggests that the current resistance around $1050 is likely to keep gains in check. RSI is also turning lower to indicate that sellers are in control of price action. Stochastic is already approaching the oversold area to indicate exhaustion among bears, possibly drawing buyers back to the game once the oscillator turns back up.\n\nIf selling pressure is strong enough, bitcoin price could break below the channel support and head to the next area of interest at $950 or the previous week low closer to $900. On the other hand, a strong return in buying pressure could spur a break past the resistance to start a steeper rally.\n\nMarket Events\n\nDollar weakness has allowed bitcoin price to recover somewhat after the US Congress failed to pass a bill on healthcare reform, something that is necessary to fund their other fiscal policy changes. However, bitcoin price is also dealing with downside pressures of its own, particularly when it comes to the network hard fork.\n\nExchanges and payment platforms continue to warn their clients of the potential risks from this change, with Circle warning that bitcoin services could be disrupted for an extended period of time if incompatibilities arise.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

We said that if we see a close above the 1000 level on the intraday charts, it would almost certainly precede a run through the 1020 region and perhaps as high as 1030. Parallel to our standard intraday strategy, then, we set up a secondary trade in line with this assumption. Specifically, we’d get in long on a close above 1000 and target the 1020 level to the upside.\n\nAs things turned out, this trade played out pretty much to the letter. Shortly after we set up our key levels, price started to run, and we got in two separate trades on the back of the action. The first was a long towards 1010 on a close above in term resistance, and the second was the above discussed 1000 cross entry.\n\nBoth trades played out in our favor, and we’ve managed to make the best of a bad situation (some overarching bearish sentiment) as a result.\n\nWith any luck, we’ll get a return to the upside momentum this evening. Price is currently in something of a consolidation phase, and we’re expecting a breakout from this phase any time now.\n\nSo, take a look at the chart below to get an idea of our key levels this evening.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range we are going at now is defined by support to the downside at 1012, and resistance to the upside at 1030. Tight range, tight targets and stops.\n\nIf we get a close above resistance, we’ll get in long towards 1038. Stop at 1028. Conversely, a close below support will get us in short towards 1005. Stop at 1015 on this one to kill risk.\n\nLet’s see how things play out.\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

So far, we know some forks resolve on their own, but others, fueled by deep rifts in a community, can cause a network to permanently split, creating two blockchain histories — and two separate currencies.\n\nAlong with that, there has also been confusion about the various types of forks, how they get activated and the risks they pose.\n\nTo clarify, we\'ve assembled quick rundown on how different forks work.\n\nThe basics\n\nBefore we get into the classifications, it\'s worth noting that bitcoin forks already occur quite regularly.\n\nA byproduct of distributed consensus, forks happen anytime two miners find a block at nearly the same time. The ambiguity is resolved when subsequent blocks are added to one, making it the longest chain, while the other block gets ""orphaned"" (or abandoned) by the network.\n\nBut forks also can be willingly introduced to the network. This occurs when developers seek to change the rules the software uses to decide whether a transaction is valid or not.\n\nWhen a block contains invalid transactions, that block is ignored by the network, and the miner who found that block loses out on a block reward. As such, miners generally want to mine only valid blocks and build on the longest chain.\n\nFollowing are some of the more common forks and their traits.\n\nHard fork\n\nWhat is it? A hard fork is a software upgrade that introduces a new rule to the network that isn\'t compatible with the older software. You can think of a hard fork as an expansion of the rules. (A new rule that allows block size to be 2MB instead of 1MB would require a hard fork).\n\nWhat happens? Nodes that continue running the old version of the software will see the new transactions as invalid. So, to switch over to the new chain and to continue to mine valid blocks, all of the nodes in the network need to upgrade to the new rules.\n\nWhat can go wrong? The problem comes when some sort of political impasse arises, and a portion of the community decides to stick by the old rules no matter what. The hash rate, or network computing power, behind the old chain is irrelevant. What matters is that its data (and ruleset) is still perceived to have value, meaning miners still want to mine a chain and developers still want to support it.\n\nThe ethereum DAO hard fork was a perfect case study of how a community can split over rules. Now, we have two blockchains using a variant of the software – ethereum and ethereum classic, both of which boast a different ethos and a different currency.\n\nSoft fork\n\nWhat is it? A soft fork, by contrast, is any change that\'s backward compatible. Say, instead of 1MB blocks, a new rule might only allow 500K blocks.\n\nWhat happens? Non-upgraded nodes will still see the new transactions as valid (500k is less than 1MB in this example). However, if non-upgraded nodes continue to mine blocks, the blocks they mine will be rejected by the upgraded nodes. This is why soft forks need a majority of hash power in the network.\n\nWhat can go wrong? When a soft fork is supported by only a minority of hash power in the network, it could become the shortest chain and get orphaned by the network. Or, it can act like a hard fork, and one chain can splinter off.\n\nSoft forks have been the most commonly used option to upgrade the bitcoin blockchain so far because it\'s argued they present a lower risk of splitting the network. Past examples of successful soft forks include software upgrades like BIP 66 (which dealt with signature validation) and P2SH (which altered bitcoin\'s address formatting).\n\nUser-activated soft fork\n\nWhat is it? A user-activated soft fork (UASF) is a controversial idea that explores how a blockchain might add an upgrade that is not directly supported by those who provide the network\'s hashing power.\n\nThe idea with UASF is that instead of waiting for a threshold of support from mining pools, the power to activate a soft fork goes to the exchanges, wallets and businesses who are running full nodes. (In bitcoin, a full node, even if it is not a mining node, is still responsible for validating blocks.)\n\nWhat happens? The majority of major exchanges would need to publicly support the change before it could be written into a new version of code. After that, the new software (which has an activation point in the future) gets installed on nodes that want to participate in the soft fork.\n\nWhat can go wrong? This method requires a much longer lead time to work than a hash-power-triggered soft fork. In fact, it\'s believed it may take as long as a year or more to write the code and get everyone ready.\n\nFurther, if the majority of miners end up not ‘falling in line’ and activating the new rules, they could use their overwhelming hash power to split the network.\n\nCurrently this idea is theoretical and has not been implemented.\n\nTable setting via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

03/28/2017,"['US Securities and Exchange Commission, hereinafter SEC, officially rejected its second Bitcoin ETF proposal. SolidX, which was long considered as the rival ETF proposal to the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN, was denied for the lack of investor protection and overseas Bitcoin trading regulation.\n\nNearly identical reason to the rejection of COIN ETF\n\nSEC denied the approval of the SolidX ETF for the identical reasons to that of the Winklevoss twins’ COIN ETF. In its official document, the SEC stated that SolidX lacks surveillance sharing agreements and investor protection for the buyers of the ETF.\n\nBitcoin as a decentralized financial network and peer-to-peer protocol can’t be regulated. Businesses launched on top of the Bitcoin network can be regulated by the government but the network itself isn’t possible to control or manipulate.\n\nTherefore, unlike centralized financial networks, it is virtually impossible for an ETF provider to agree to surveillance sharing agreements. It is more difficult to trace down the origin and the flow of Bitcoin transactions in contrast to other financial tools or assets involved with existing ETFs in the market.\n\nThe SEC wrote:\n\n“[SEC didn’t] find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange- traded products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter. First, the exchange must have surveillance sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.”\n\nEnd of all ETF talks?\n\nBased on the response of the SEC in regard to the denial of SolidX, it can be concluded that Bitcoin ETFs will not be approved nor introduced to US public markets anytime soon. In their document SEC noted the lack of regulation in overseas trading as one of the major reasons for the denial of SolidX.\n\nThat is a component which ETF providers can’t improve upon or alter, and thus, if that is a real concern for the SEC, then until the global Bitcoin exchange market becomes as strictly regulated as the US market, ETFs will not be introduced in the US.\n\nStill, Bitcoin price is showing resilience toward the SEC ruling. When the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF was denied, Cointelegraph reported that price fell from around $1,200 to $960 within minutes. The community has realized that Bitcoin ETFs aren’t necessary for mainstream adoption and for Bitcoin to grow as a digital currency, digital gold and a settlement system.', 'An Indian minister, while replying to a question in writing in the upper house of the Indian Parliament - The Rajya Sabha - has said that the use of Bitcoin in India is not authorized by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and could potentially land users on the wrong side of the anti-money laundering provisions present in the Indian law.\n\nMinister declares Bitcoin to be illegal\n\nThe Minister of State for Finance, Arjun Ram Meghwal, has filed a written reply to a question in the Parliament according to India’s The Hindu newspaper:\n\n“The absence of counter parties in usage of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, for illicit and illegal activities in anonymous/pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws.”\n\nAbsence of sanction from monetary authorities\n\nOne of the reasons that the Indian government is terming Bitcoin illegal is that it has no approved sanction from any central bank or monetary authority.\n\nThe minister, in his reply to the Parliament, further said, as reported by The Hindu: “No regulatory approval, registration or authorisation is stated to have been obtained by the entities concerned for carrying on such activities.”\n\nIs the government rattled by its botched up demonetization?\n\nIt should be kept in mind that the Indian government carried out a botched up demonetization that wiped out 86 percent of the Indian currency in circulation in November 2016. The aftermath of the demonetization was disastrous and people were left standing outside of cash machines for weeks.\n\nIn the wake of this demonetization process, the interest in Bitcoin in India rose considerably. According to India Today, the user base of Bitcoin in India has expanded 250 percent since November 2016.\n\nThe Indian media has been casting aspersions on the use of Bitcoin for laundering so-called black money and there are people in India who believe that cryptocurrencies pose some sort of threat to the country.', 'A group of Canadian Bitcoin players has united under Bitcoin Embassy leader Francis Pouliot to fight a hard fork.\n\nIn a letter written on behalf of sixteen businesses titled ‘Statement on Hard Fork by Canadian Economic Nodes,’ Pouliot announced outright that the local community “unequivocally opposes the Bitcoin Unlimited network split proposal.”\n\n“We strongly believe that a hard fork, as actively considered by Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic, would cause massive disruption in our ability to onboard new Bitcoin users and would create irreparable damage to Bitcoin and to our businesses,” he wrote.\n\nIt is unclear to what extent individual signees support Segregated Witness implementation.

As exchanges worldwide sign up to a consensus which would treat Bitcoin Unlimited’s chain as a separate asset, two are even allowing users to trade between BTC and BCU.\n\nPouliot meanwhile outlines criteria which should be fulfilled by a hard fork in order for it to be considered “non-contentious.”\n\nThat method echoes that of payment provider BitGo, which earlier this month provided its own list of requirements while stating Bitcoin Unlimited “fails all of them.”', 'Digital currency exchange startup ShapeShift has closed a $10.4m Series A.\n\nLed by Berlin-based Earlybird Venture Capital, the round included participation from Lakestar, Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital and Access Venture Partners, the firm said today. Existing ShapeShift backers, including FundersClub, Digital Currency Group and Erik Voorhees (the company’s founder and CEO) also took part in the round.\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to expand the exchange\'s engineering team, a move that would come ahead of two exchange-related products set to be released later this year.\n\nIn interview, Voorhees said that many of those hires would come on the engineering side, both in preparation of those launches as well as an anticipate rise in volume. According to ShapeShift, platform growth has averaged 48% per month in the last three years, seeing an average monthly trade volume of about 50,000 bitcoins spread across 40 digital currencies and assets.\n\nAlthough tight-lipped about the exact nature of future ShapeShift products, Voorhees indicated that both were new types of exchange, one built entirely around smart contracts.\n\nMore broadly, Voorhees spoke to the exchange\'s clear vision of the potential diversity of cryptocurrency tokens, which was less well understood by the industry in 2014.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""What we saw when we started was that tokens were going to become a widespread phenomenon. We believed there would be blockchain tokens representing all sorts of value beyond currency, and that\'s become increasingly true, which is why ShapeShift\'s frictionless exchange is important.""\n\nVoorhees also said that ShapeShift\'s policy of not holding any customer assets or other details helped to give confidence that the effect of any hacks or other breaches would be minimal.\n\n""We take consumer protection to a new level by not endangering them in the first place,"" he said. ""In the hack we suffered a year ago, it was the first exchange hack where customers weren\'t at risk either in funds or personal information.""\n\nThe funding coincides with a broader uptick in interest for alternative cryptocurrencies, with this market experiencing a recent boom some suggest is a sign it is developing into a new asset class.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in ShapeShift.\n\nImage via Shutterstock', ""It seems like the Bitcoin market and industry are rejecting Bitcoin Unlimited almost unanimously for the same reason: security and decentralization. Even miners are making the move to Segregated Witness, including the world’s largest Bitcoin miner and leading Blockchain company Bitfury.\n\nBitfury makes its move, selects SegWit\n\nBitfury is in support of SegWit. On March 26, Bitfury mined its first SegWit block with Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 148 that contains the SegWit signal tag. BIP 148 is a proposal entitled “Mandatory activation of segwit deployment” released on March 12 introduced for miners as a way to signal their support for SegWit.\n\nShaolin Fry, the author of BIP 148, explained:\n\n“Segwit increases the blocksize, fixes transaction malleability, and makes scripting easier to upgrade as well as bringing many other benefits. It is hoped that miners will respond to this BIP by activating Segwit early, before this BIP takes effect. Otherwise this BIP will cause the mandatory activation of the existing segwit deployment before the end of midnight November 15th 2017.”\n\nShortly after the SegWit (BIP 148) block was mined by Bitfury, Bitcoin India mined block 458716 containing the same tag, also signaling support for SegWit.\n\nPreviously, Bitcoin Unlimited supporters noted that businesses and users are in favor of SegWit because the solution doesn’t affect their profitability and revenues and that the miners are in support of Bitcoin Unlimited as the software guarantees high profitability for miners.\n\nHowever, this reasoning is starting to be questioned by some of the largest mining pools in the market, including Bitfury and Bitcoin India.\n\nBitfury is in support of SegWit for many reasons, like every other SegWit supporting organization across the market. However, since mid last year, Bitfury has continued to emphasize the importance of off-chain scaling and two-layer solutions such as Lightning.\n\nAlso, Bitfury executives including the company’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) Alex Petrov have released various reports and test results of SegWit, as shown in Whale Panda's blog post.\n\nWhy Armory rejected Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nAlmost every business and platform operator within Bitcoin have rejected Bitcoin Unlimited due to security and decentralization issues.\n\nSpecifically, prominent Bitcoin wallet platform Armory’s lead developer Andrew Chow, better known as Goatpig, stated that Armory doesn’t approve Bitcoin Unlimited’s philosophy on allowing miners to vote whichever block size best suits the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nGoatpig wrote:\n\n“I disagree with BU's primary principle that the block size should be decided by user and miner vote. I disagree with the block size hard cap on the grounds that it is a magic number. Voting on a magic number does not improve upon this limitation. The only acceptable solution in my eyes is an algorithmic one. To imagine a technical metric is best discovered by popular vote is wishful thinking at best.”\n\nMore to that, a more obvious issue is that the Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork is contentious and dangerous in nature, as it will inevitably lead to a split chain if it is ever forked."", 'Bitcoin has long been the transaction currency of choice for drug dealers and extortionists, but this month, the IRS has upped the game. Just as tax evasion finally took down Al Capone, now the IRS is looking for tax evaders and other tax cheats who have been using Bitcoin in an attempt to hide their tracks.\n\nThe IRS recently subpoenaed customer records from Coinbase, a leading Bitcoin exchange. However, the subpoena is but the latest skirmish in a years-long war against criminals who have been leveraging Bitcoin for a wide variety of nefarious purposes.\n\nThe specifics of the IRS subpoena, however, make one thing clear: the majority of Americans who trade in Bitcoin are likely breaking the law.\n\nCoupled with Bitcoin’s popularity among ransomware extortionists and all manner of other cybercriminals, we must now face a chilling realization: the underlying value of Bitcoin really has little if nothing to do with its artificial scarcity or popularity as a medium of speculation.\n\nOn the contrary – the only reason Bitcoin has value to anyone is because of the underlying value as a medium of exchange for lawbreakers. If we could flip a switch and eliminate all illegal uses of Bitcoin, there would be nothing left of the cybercurrency.\n\nZach Copley\n\nThe ‘John Doe’ Summons\n\nThe most recent order from the IRS to Coinbase is a ‘John Doe’ summons, which means that the IRS isn’t naming any particular Coinbase customers, but is rather issuing a blanket request for information about a large number of individuals – even though the IRS may not have any suspicions about all of them.\n\nIn response, Coinbase says that while it has a policy of complying with all legal orders (of which this is one), it believes this one overreaches, and is thus fighting it in court. “Suffice to say, we feel the IRS’s subpoena is overly broad and incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes,” writes Coinbase Cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong in a blog post. “Asking for detailed transaction information on so many people, simply for using digital currency, is a violation of their privacy, and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective.”\n\nThe IRS, however, is on firm ground with the John Doe summons. “The IRS uses John Doe summonses to obtain information about possible violations of internal revenue laws by individuals whose identities are unknown,” the agency says. “The IRS not only has a suspicion that the John Doe class includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law – it knows that the class in the past included such violators, and very likely includes others,” it continues.\n\nSuch noncompliance, in fact, may not always be intentional. It’s likely many Bitcoin enthusiasts are inadvertently running afoul of IRS’s guidance that Bitcoin is property, not currency. As a result, every Bitcoin interaction is potentially taxable individually, leading to a paperwork headache for active Bitcoin traders.\n\nBe that as it may, the IRS has reason to suspect virtually all Bitcoin traders have fallen into this trap. According to the IRS, it “searched the MTRDB [Modernized Tax Return Database] for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015.” Form 8949 is the one that Bitcoin traders must use to report their activity. “Those results reflect that in 2013, 807 individuals reported a transaction.” Furthermore, the number for 2014 is 893 and for 2015, it dropped to 802 individuals.\n\nGiven the number of US citizens to conducted at least one Bitcoin transaction in 2015 probably numbers in the tens or hundreds of thousands, 802 is a mere drop in the bucket. The IRS is quite justified in presuming, therefore, that the vast majority of American Bitcoin traders are breaking the law.\n\nRationalization to the Rescue?\n\nArmstrong’s exhortation that the IRS summons implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes is thus an overstatement. More worrisome, however, is his opinion that taking a legal action to enforce tax law is a violation of privacy.\n\nThe blogosphere, in fact, is rife with related rationalizations. The most extreme Libertarian proponents of Bitcoin are against taxes and the IRS in general, and even for those individuals who allow for the necessity of taxation, many believe that they are justified in using Bitcoin to evade more onerous legal constraints like the ‘Bitcoin is property’ guidance.\n\nAnother fallacious line of reasoning: the IRS is overstepping because they’re looking for a needle in a haystack. “It amounts to nothing more than asking for large amounts of hay in the hope they might find a needle,” opines Michael Beckerman, President and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Coinbase as well as companies like Alphabet Google , Facebook , and Amazon.com .\n\nSuch arguments, however, do not sway the IRS. “The IRS not only has a suspicion that the John Doe class includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law,” the agency says. “It knows that the class in the past included such violators, and very likely includes others.”\n\nCharles Stross, popular author and blogger, summed up the situation nicely. “Bitcoin is pretty much designed for tax evasion,” he quips.\n\nTax Evasion Merely the Nail in Bitcoin’s Coffin\n\nRunning afoul of the IRS, however, is merely the focus of the latest news. The fact remains that Bitcoin is enormously popular for all manner of criminal enterprises, from illegal drug dealing to extortion cons.\n\nThe most popular con, in fact, is ransomware. The US Justice department reports that ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 to an average of 4,000 per day, with extortion amounts ballooning to $209 million for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $24 million for all of 2015.\n\nWhile there is broad agreement that most of today’s ransomware extortionists demand payment in Bitcoin, there remains disagreement as to whether Bitcoin is the primary cause of the rapid growth in ransomware attacks.\n\nIs Bitcoin in fact tied to the growth of ransomware? “It’s helping. I think that’s definitely true,” says David Emm, Senior Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab. “The existence of effectively anonymised payment mechanisms definitely plays into the hands of cybercriminals.”\n\nMaya Horowitz, Threat Intelligence Group Manager at Check Point Software Technologies agrees. “It makes it much easier to avoid law enforcement,” she says.\n\nAnd while it’s true that Bitcoin is not fully anonymous, many criminals are simply using a Bitcoin-based money laundering operation known as a ‘mixing service.’ “If you want your money in one wallet but you don’t want anyone to be able to trace it back and know how you got it, then you take it though a mixing service – like money laundering – and then it all eventually gets back to you after being mixed with other money,” Horowitz says. “It’s pretty standard for Bitcoin.”\n\nCue the Rationalization Again\n\nOnce again, however, there are a number of voices seeking to diminish the connection between Bitcoin and ransomware – or criminal enterprise in general.\n\nOne argument: if it weren’t for Bitcoin, bad guys would simply use something else. “The reality is cybercriminals will always use what is available to them,” explains Greg Day, VP and CSO, EMEA at Palo Alto Networks. “In many ways they’re inherently lazy, so if Bitcoin wasn’t there they’d find a different process to channel funds through.”\n\nAnother argument: paper currency is just as bad, so why all the fuss about Bitcoin? “The U.S. government should find it awkward to regulate bitcoin on the grounds that it facilitates illegal transactions,” opines William J. Luther, Assistant Professor of Economics at Kenyon College and an adjunct scholar at the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. “Its own currency — and the $100 bill in particular — has done so for years.”\n\nAnd then there’s the argument that Bitcoin isn’t really anonymous in the first place. “If you catch a dealer with drugs and cash on the street, you’ve caught them committing one crime,” says Sarah Meiklejohn, a computer scientist at University College London. “But if you catch people using something like Silk Road, you’ve uncovered their whole criminal history. It’s like discovering their books.”\n\nSilk Road, of course, was the Bitcoin-driven clearinghouse for illegal drugs and stolen credit cards (and other contraband) that law enforcement shuttered in 2014. Bitcoin – and Bitcoin-related crime – have only flourished since.\n\nBitcoin-centered ransomware is so popular among the criminal element, in fact, because it is dead simple. Any modestly skilled bad actor can simply download the software off the Dark Web, create a Bitcoin wallet, and send out phishing emails to find gullible targets. The number of such extortionists and the typically modest ransoms are usually sufficient to avoid law enforcement investigations – a gamble such criminals are obviously willing to make.\n\nIs that Bitcoin in Your Wallet? Didn’t Think So\n\nFor the readers of this article who are law-abiding citizens, the cold reality is that there is little reason to get involved in Bitcoin in the first place. “Bitcoin transactions are not very useful in casual purchases, thus there has been little mainstream consumer adoption,” admits Mikko Ohtamaa, CTO of Gibraltar-based cybercurrency trader TokenMarket. “Bitcoin shines in anonymous online payments and most day-to-day and/or point-of-sale payments don’t require this level of anonymity or the complexity it brings along with it.”\n\nThe final question for law-abiding, tax-paying citizens who may be interested in speculating in Bitcoin: does the fact that the cybercurrency is primarily used for criminal purposes taint it for other uses, a la blood diamonds?\n\nSuch a question of morality is beyond the scope of this article, but important food for thought for anyone interested in using Bitcoin for legal purposes.\n\nIntellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

In a bid “to improve access to financing for SMEs in Africa,” the move allows Bitbond borrowers in the four countries to “withdraw loans into their mobile money or bank account in as little as 20 mins,” according to Bitbond’s announcement.\n\nThe partnership connects borrowers in Africa with the German peer-to-peer (P2P) lender, Bitbond, using their mobile phones. Bitcoin-based mobile payments provider, BitPesa, provides the loan within minutes.\n\n- Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond Founder & CEO\n\n\n\nCalling itself “the first global marketplace lending platform for small business loans,” Bitbond has been offering P2P lending with bitcoins since July 2013. The growing business connects individuals and fixed-income investors from around the world with small businesses, and claims the title of the very first German regulated financial services provider that uses blockchain technology.\n\nThe tech firm has since raised funds on three separate occasion, including €200,000 in 2014, €600,000 the following May, and another US $1.2 million in February this year. The funds have allowed the platform to facilitate over 1,650 loans to small businesses in over 120 countries so far.\n\nLoans on the platform can be denominated in US Dollars, Euros or directly in Bitcoin. To fight borrower fraud, the service only lends to registered businesses, which are subject to credit checks. Fraud is a problem faced by every company in the industry, including BTCJam. The risk management process appears to be helping the platform stay on the right side of regulators too, a problem that forced BitLendingClub to close late last year.\n\nIf a borrower fails to pay back a loan, Bitbond has a routine that gets increasingly aggressive, advancing from gentle reminders over various platforms to passing the loan to international collection agents after 90 days.\n\n- Bitbond\n\nBitpesa was the first Bitcoin startup in Africa, having launched in 2014, and is now one of the largest. While the company initially focused on remittances, their services have been expanded to include international trade, Business to Business purchases, and freelance worker payments. The platform uses Bitcoin to transfer funds between 85 countries, while focusing on four main African markets. Recipients get local currency to their mobile, or bank account, within minutes.\n\nThe company has also had a few fundraising rounds, including $1.1m in 2015, and a $2.5m round earlier this year. The funds have allowed the Bitpesa platform to attract 6,000 users, and facilitate over 17,000 transactions.\n\nHowever, the startup ran into issues with mobile money giant SafariCom in Kenya. SafariCom has been targeting this mobile rich user base for almost a decade. The company provides a mobile-phone based money transfer and microfinancing service launched in 2007, called M-Pesa. In March 2013 Safaricom reported that M-Pesa had 15.2 million customers, with revenue from the service increasing 22.8% during 2014.\n\nSafariCom also provided services to Bitpesa. The telecoms giant suspended its services last November, stating that Bitpesa dealt in bitcoin, and should obtain approval from the Central Bank of Kenya before the services could resume. Kenyan courts sided with Safaricom on the basis that Bitcoin is not considered money in the country, so Bitpesa is now not allowed to use the words “money remittance” or “money transfer” in its business there.\n\n- Justice Joseph Onguto\n\nThe new partnership may provide Africans with sorely needed financial freedom. The 2016 African Prosperity Report report found that small to medium size enterprises (SMEs) on the continent are, ""priced out of the market by tight credit constraints and excessive and inappropriate government regulations.""\n\nMarubeni Research Institute states that only 24 percent of SMEs have an outstanding loan: ""The main reasons for financial exclusion are low and volatile incomes, lack of proper documentation, complex financial products and services, illiteracy, and inadequate infrastructure combined with the long distances to financial institutions.""\n\nHowever, a report by International Finance Corporation (IFC) shows that 96 percent of Nigerian businesses are SMEs, a core market for the new platform. SMEs account for around 53 percents of businesses in the U.S. while it’s around 65 percent in Europe. ""SMEs are a very important part of the Nigerian economy,"" states Professor Banji Oyelaran-Oyeyinka.\n\nThe International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship Research outlines several factors holding back “micro, small and medium enterprises” in Nigeria. The report reveals that only 4.2 percent of 17.2 million MSMEs have been able to access loans or overdrafts from financial institutions while new entrants or start-ups find it practically impossible to access funds from banks.\n\nKenya, too, is another major economy desperately in need of SME loan assistance. A June 2016 joint report, by FSD Kenya and Growth Cap, states that banks don\'t understand the needs of SMEs and therefore do not best serve them. Consequently, ""There was a significant use of informal sources of funding for establishing the initial businesses, ranging from using credit terms from suppliers through to moneylenders and chamas, from friends and family to the entrepreneur\'s’ own funds.""\n\nThe report states that an informal, cooperative community pool called a Chama is used by many to invest savings in East Africa, and is particularly popular and prevalent in Kenya. A study commissioned by Invest in African (IIA) and Strathmore Business School states that money from family members and personal savings are the most popular sources of capital and finance.', 'Update: BTCChina provided CCN with a more-accurate notice detailing the upgraded KYC system.\n\nBTCChina, a Shanghai-based bitcoin and digital currency exchange has announced the upgrade of its know-your-customer (KYC) identification verification system amid the ongoing withdrawal ban on Bitcoin and Litecoin deposits.\n\nAs one of the so-called ‘big three’ Chinese exchanges, BTCChina enforced the suspension of BTC and LTC withdrawals in mid-February, following regulatory pressure to comply with KYC norms by the People’s Bank of China, the country’s’ central bank. The exchange followed suit after OkCoin and Huobi, two of the other major exchanges, who suspended withdrawals a week prior to BTCChina.\n\nBTCChina revealed that it would upgrade its customer verification system to adhere to anti-money laundering norms enforced by Chinese authorities upon the bitcoin trading industry. The temporary suspension on withdrawals would last a month, BTCChina said at the time. More pertinently, the exchange added that the suspension would be lifted if its systems are upgraded before the 30-day period.\n\nAll three exchanges released a statement on March 8, confirming that bitcoin withdrawals were postponed indefinitely, only to resume after regulatory approval.\n\nOn Friday, however, BTCChina revealed the upgrade of its customer identification system that adhered to KYC guidelines. The exchange is now urging all of its users to complete verification procedures.\n\nThe new KYC requirements seek existing users’ names, identity card number, bank card number and mobile phone number.\n\n“All users need to re-complete [fill] the above information before [resuming] normal recharge, cash withdrawals and other activities,” the notice read.\n\nNotably, however, the notice added:\n\nBitcoin and Litecoin [withdrawals] are still paused.\n\nWhile undoubtedly frustrating for Chinese users with bitcoin deposits in centralized exchanges, the implementation of upgraded KYC systems are looking a likely step toward resuming withdrawals in the near future. Traders and investors haven’t been dissuaded in the meantime, turning to alternative decentralized peer-to-peer trading platforms like LocalBitcoins that have seen record trading volumes in China following the withdrawal freeze.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'It seems not too hard to say where would rest the rising price of BitcoinPlus, the biggest gaining alternative currency in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nIt took the market by storm on Monday, March 27, rising from about $5 to $131 within a 12-hour period.\n\nThough it has since corrected to about $40-50, its fast rise comes as Bitcoin price regained its position above $1,000 after dipping to its lowest almost since the year’s start.\n\nBitcoinPlus’ inexplicable rise has hardly affected the Bitcoin price. Rather, other altcoins such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash and Monero as well as several others took the fall as the new currency has managed to reach the top five in terms of 24-hour trade volume.\n\nBitcoin’s adoption continues to show signs of an increase, with LocalBitcoins’ global weekly volume hitting a new all-time high in the week ending March 25 at $32 mln.\n\nSpeculations abound\n\nSlightly behind BitcoinPlus is BitcoinDark. They both moved at a very fast and questionable pace, raising questions among some cryptocurrency enthusiasts on few forums on how to lay hands on a few coins especially for trading purposes.\n\nAt some point, BitcoinPlus lost about 40 percent of its value in just a minute, a situation that could sometimes be linked to a single investor buying a huge chunk of the currency and selling everything at once.\n\nWith its limited supply - currently there are around 94,000 coins in circulation - and few people still into it, the lower supply to demand ratio could work both ways.\n\nIt could rise in price to pass Bitcoin as the supply is relatively small, provided demand increases. On the other hand, the low supply could make the price decrease quickly with just a few sales and not much buyers.\n\nOn which side it will end would be determined by the ability of BitcoinPlus, which uses the TOR Network to keep users’ IP address hidden at all times, to hold its grip on its market and not fade away in a similar fashion as it rose.\n\nBitcoin Plus - XBC is a hybrid Proof of Stake (POS) and Proof of Work (POW) coin - meaning that things can be moved along manually by switching on Proof Of Work for a short period if the network ever has an issue.

03/29/2017,"['BITCOIN\n\nAnother day, another application for a bitcoin exchange trade product (ETP) junked in the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has denied a new request to bring to market a new product built to track the digital currency.\n\nIntercontinental Exchange Inc. has been seeking to list and trade the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, an ETP that would trade like a stock and track the digital asset’s price, on an affiliate of the New York Stock Exchange. But in a filing, the SEC said it has rejected SolidX’s application on grounds similar to those used in the Winklevoss ETF decision.\n\n“The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter. First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated,” the SEC wrote in its filing.\n\nThis is the second time that the commission has turned down a bitcoin-tied ETF.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, the SEC rejected the proposal of investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to list their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an ETF created essentially to provide exposure for commodity buyers to bitcoin.\n\nAt the time, the commission said “it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.”\n\nSEC’s announcement dampened the dreams of investors and the rest of the digital currency community—leading to a price drop of about 18 percent from nearly $1,300 to $1,060. But bitcoin has since recovered back to around $1,200 level.\n\nThere is still one remaining bitcoin ETP proposal that’s waiting a decision from the SEC—Grayscale Investments LLC’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is backed by early bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group.\n\nCurrent bitcoin price\n\nBitcoin traded at $1,044.37 on Wednesday morning.\n\nComments', 'There has been a protracted debate on the actual identity of Bitcoin, whether it should be regarded as a currency or a commodity.\n\nWith reasonable support on each side of the debate based on its inherent characteristics, a huge segment of the ecosystem is of the opinion that Bitcoin can, and should be regarded as both a currency and a commodity.\n\nWhatever definition attached to Bitcoin, the constant variation in price offers an opportunity for investors to make a profit by trading the cryptocurrency, either as a long term investment or in a speculative short term pattern.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin trading?\n\nBashir Aminu, Bitcoin trader and convener of online crypto group Cryptogene, explains the basic Bitcoin trading process as follows:\n\n“If you buy Bitcoins at one price and then sell them for a higher price, you make a profit of the difference between those two prices, less any commission that you paid. However, if the price goes down, you will be in the uncomfortable position of having to either sell them at a loss or hold and hope the price goes back up while risking higher and higher losses if the price continues to drop.”\n\nThere are two major types of traders in the Bitcoin market, they are ‘long term’ traders and ‘short term’ traders. Each of these group of traders are classified by how long they may wish to hold onto a given position of trade.\n\nLong term traders are usually involved in studying price trends over long periods of time. This informs their decision to buy and hold Bitcoin also over long periods with the hope of taking profit at a price higher than their original entry point. With Bitcoin still in its developmental stages, a lot of users suggest that this is a good time to buy.\n\nThis suggestion is based on the assumption that with increasing use case scenario and more adoption, demand for Bitcoin and its associated technology will increase, thereby creating more demand for the cryptocurrency which will automatically cause an eventual increase in value. Glimpses of this have been observed with the surge in Bitcoin price which coincides with a boost in its market capitalization and volume of trade.\n\nOn the other hand, short-term traders analyze the intraday behavior of Bitcoin price and seek to take advantage of the swings in price. These traders thrive in market volatility, a factor that is presently characteristic of Bitcoin.\n\nIn its early stages, the swings in Bitcoin price was usually so huge as every little event within the crypto space had very serious impact on the price of the cryptocurrency. As adoption grows and Bitcoin becomes more stable, price volatility has reduced considerably and experts think it is a better time to trade the cryptocurrency, compared to an earlier time.\n\n“Bitcoin is certainly safer to invest in now than it was a couple of years ago”, says Aminu.\n\nTrading rules\n\nAminu describes Bitcoin trading as extremely profitable if you play your cards well. According to him, it all depends on the market movement pattern. He tells Cointelegraph that Bitcoin value rises and falls dramatically throughout each trading day, jumping in whole dollar amounts. A phenomenon which he identifies as very risky when misjudged.\n\nBased on his trading experience, Aminu outlines a set of rules for newcomers who may wish to profit from the Bitcoin market as follows:', '(Reuters) - Switzerland-based ShapeShift, a digital currency exchange, said on Wednesday it has raised $10.4 million in capital from both U.S. and international venture capital investors to fund future expansion.\n\nShapeShift instantly exchanges digital currencies such as bitcoin for other online tokens without using conventional currencies such as dollars or euros. The company has grown an average of 48 percent per month since launching just under three years ago, it said in a statement.\n\nThe Series A funding was led by Berlin-based Earlybird. Other new investors include Lakestar, Access Venture Partners, Pantera Capital and Blockchain Capital. Previous ShapeShift backers FundersClub and Digital Currency Group also participated.

If they do, they will diverge from the current Bitcoin protocol to split off to a new blockchain. This could also result in two separate currencies, by many exchanges referred to as “BTC” and “BTU.”\n\nHowever, it increasingly seems that not everyone in favor of a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork wants to settle for a coin-split. Instead, several prominent Bitcoin Unlimited proponents have indicated that it may be better to ensure only their chain survives. This is probably also the only chance it has to be widely considered the “real” Bitcoin rather than a “spinoff altcoin.”\n\nTo ensure that only one chain survives, they have suggested that the (original) Bitcoin blockchain can be made unusable.

The former lead developer wrote:\n\n“It would be even more destructive to mine an 11-block-long empty chain, then wait until the slow chain gets 9 blocks until announcing it to the network. Or keep them guessing; choose a chain length at random, from 1 to some secret N, and orphan that many blocks at a time. Allow a couple normal blocks, then do it again.\n\n“It would be impossible for exchanges to know how many confirmations were safe for deposits and would be a nightmare for their withdrawal accounting.”\n\nAdditionally, he said he wasn’t sure whether such an attack would be immoral or not.\n\n“I’m not even sure this kind of thing should be considered immoral — majority hashpower acting selfishly for their own economic benefit (both short and long term) is the basic incentive structure that makes Bitcoin work.”\n\nAnd last weekend, Andresen on Twitter further distanced himself from a moral endorsement of such an attack. Instead, echoing comments he made on Reddit, Andresen claimed to have merely been exercising adversarial thinking.\n\nPointing out all the ways majority hashpower might mess with a minority chain is good adversarial thinking; don't shoot the messenger. — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) March 25, 2017\n\nThough he did add that an attack is very likely to happen.\n\n@h_msln no, not just a thought exercise, it is very likely to happen.\n\n\n\nWhether is is moral or not is the thought exercise. — Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) March 26, 2017\n\nBTC.TOP Pool Operator Jiang Zhuoer\n\nBTC.TOP is a relatively new Chinese mining pool. Launched in late 2016, the pool currently controls some 5 percent of hash power on the Bitcoin network.\n\nBTC.TOP is operated by Jiang Zhuoer, a former employee at China Mobile in Shanghai. Much like several other small mining pools that have appeared over the past six months, BTC.TOP has been signaling support for Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nIn an interview with Cryptocoins News in March, Zhuoer was the first who explicitly said a 51% attack against the original Bitcoin blockchain, if it were to survive after Bitcoin Unlimited miners split off, is on the table.\n\n“We have prepared $100 million USD to kill the small fork of CoreCoin, no matter what [proof-of-work] algorithm, sha256 or scrypt or X11 or any other GPU algorithm,” he said, of course referring to the continuation of the current Bitcoin protocol as “CoreCoin.”\n\nThe different hash algorithms mentioned by Zhuoer refer to a potential proof-of-work algorithm change Bitcoin users could deploy if the chain is attacked; a “nuclear” defense some Bitcoin Core developers have suggested may be proposed in such a scenario. (Whether this should still be considered “Bitcoin” or yet another spinoff altcoin is subject to different debate.)\n\n“Show me your money,” Zhuoer added. “We very much welcome a CoreCoin change to [proof of stake].”\n\n(If no proof-of-work algorithm succeeds in deterring the attack, a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm — where coin holders rather than miners vote on the longest chain — may be an alternative solution. But since this is unproven and perhaps insecure, this seems highly unlikely.)\n\nBitcoin Unlimited Chief Scientist Peter Rizun\n\nPeter Rizun (better known as “Peter R”) refers to himself as the chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, and has been one of the driving forces as the project’s secretary.\n\nLast week, Rizun, along with bitcoin.com business developer Jake Smith, visited the offices of Coinbase and BitPay to promote Bitcoin Unlimited. Coming back from these visits, Rizun published a blog post on Medium. The message Rizun said he had gotten from these companies is that a hard fork to larger blocks should be “decisive and absolute.”\n\nRizun described three levels of “anti-split protection” that could accomplish this. The first is an explanation of how mining would probably be unprofitable on the original Bitcoin chain — decreasing the odds of the chain surviving in the first place.\n\nThe second level, however, is a type of 51% attack on a minority of miners. Once a majority of hash power signals support for Bitcoin Unlimited, Rizun wrote, the majority could reject (“orphan”) any blocks that do not signal this support.\n\n“Miners will orphan the blocks of non-compliant miners prior to the first larger block to serve as a reminder to upgrade. Simply due to the possibility of having blocks orphaned, all miners would be motivated to begin signaling for larger blocks once support definitively passes 51%. If some miners hold out (e.g., they may not be paying attention regarding the upgrade), then they will begin to pay attention after losing approximately $15,000 of revenue due to an orphaned block.”\n\n(It should be noted that this attack can be trivially subverted. Especially now that the attack is known, miners can, and probably will, signal fake support. Indeed, at least one small pool has literally “signaled support” with a poop emoticon.)\n\nIf the original Bitcoin blockchain survives even after these two levels, Rizun explained that a subset of miners in favor of Bitcoin Unlimited could disrupt this chain by exclusively producing empty blocks on the original chain. This would prevent any and all transactions from confirming as long as the attack is ongoing.\n\n“To address the risk of coins being spent on this chain (replay risk), majority miners will deploy hash power as needed to ensure the minority chain includes only empty blocks after the forking point.”\n\nAnd in line with the strategy described by Gavin Andresen:\n\n“This can easily be accomplished if the majority miners maintain a secret chain of empty blocks — built off their last empty block — publishing only as much of this chain as necessary to orphan any non-empty blocks produced on the minority chain.”\n\n(This attack can be waited out until the attacker’s funds run out, and perhaps dismantled altogether. Discussion on potential strategies is ongoing on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. And of course, there is the potential of a proof-of-work algorithm change.)\n\nWhile noting that he doesn’t necessarily endorse the strategy, Rizun predicted that a coin-split would be avoided in this way: a “safe upgrade procedure,” he later noted on Reddit.\n\nRizun also submitted his ideas to the Bitcoin-development mailing list. (Where it was, unsurprisingly, forcefully dismissed.)\n\nBitmain Co-CEO Jihan Wu\n\nJihan Wu is the co-CEO of Chinese ASIC-hardware producer Bitmain. AntPool is Bitmain’s mining pool, and BTC.com, another mining pool, is a subsidiary of Bitmain.\n\nWu is a vocal proponent of Bitcoin Unlimited as well, and announced to Bloomberg that he would switch the hash power in his pool to Bitcoin Unlimited in anticipation of a hard fork — which he has since indeed done. (Though, notably, BTC.com has not.)\n\nAnd in an interview with Forbes, Wu said he wouldn’t rule out attacking the Bitcoin blockchain, or, “undermining Core” as it is described in the article.\n\n“It may not be necessary to attack it,” he said. “But to attack it is always an option.”\n\nThanks to Libbitcoin lead developer Eric Voskuil for feedback."", 'Demand for bitcoin is growing in Europe’s 12th largest country and so is its bitcoin ecosystem. According to data collected by Coin Dance, trading volumes at peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins have increased substantially in Romania in the last 18 months.\n\nLocalBitcoins, however, is not the only bitcoin exchange that has witnessed a surge in demand. Local Romanian digital currency exchange CoinFlux has recently announced that $23.8 million (100 million RON) worth of digital currency has been traded on its exchange since the company’s inception in December 2015.\n\nCoinFlux was founded by former fund manager Vlad Nistor. It enables Romanians to buy and sell bitcoin, ether, litecoin and ethereum classic for the Romanian leu and the euro. While several altcoins are on offer, most of CoinFlux’s trading volumes are centered around bitcoin and ether.\n\n“Most of our transactions in the last quarter involved bitcoin (89 percent), but we have witnessed an increase in interest in other currencies, especially ether,” Nistor stated.\n\nLooking forward, Nistor told Bitcoin Magazine: “Until now, we have been focused on our core market in Romania. We have joined one of the best accelerator programmes in Romania, MVP Academy, with the aim of receiving support as we develop our strategy to expand our services into other European Union countries.”\n\nNistor said that the current stance of Romania’s regulators toward bitcoin and digital currencies is one of caution. “The Romanian National Bank is reserved about bitcoin, as is the European Central Bank. I think this is the reasonable position to take as the only monetary issuing authority in the country. They\'ve issued several statements warning users about digital currencies, also stating that they will not permit risky products that could undermine consumer protection or the banking sector.”\n\nAs the demand for bitcoin is growing in Romania, so is the country’s bitcoin ecosystem. On March 24, 2017, Bitcoin Romania, a bitcoin exchange and bitcoin ATM network operator, announced that it is partnering with local money transfer operator Smith & Smith to offer bitcoin purchases at 70 physical locations throughout the country. The new service will allow bitcoin users to deposit or withdraw cash in exchange for bitcoins without needing to attach their bank accounts to Bitcoin Romania’s online trading platform.\n\n“Ever since we launched, we wanted to make bitcoin trading easy, both in term of processing time and in terms of proximity to customers,"" said George Rotariu, CEO of Bitcoin Romania. ""We are happy that we can improve our online platform services and, besides existing options like instant bank transfers and our country-wide ATMs and terminals network, we added instant cash and withdrawals through our partners Smith & Smith. We are counting on the experience and safety offered by Smith & Smith and we are sure that this collaboration will be successful both for us and especially for our customers.”\n\n“The locations of Smith & Smith agencies make it possible for all the users from all over the country to successfully finalize their trading actions. Given the fact that these agencies are located in over 60 towns, we offer our customers the possibility to easily [access] one of these locations.”\n\nAs Romania’s tech startup scene is growing, so are its entrepreneurs’ activities in the Bitcoin space. Aside from Bitcoin Romania and CoinFlux, other notable startups that are working on bringing bitcoin to Romania include mobile bitcoin wallet Coinfetti and bitcoin exchanges BitcoinxRomania and BtcXchange.', 'The path forward for bitcoin prices isn\'t clear, market analysts say.\n\nWhile some described the market to CoinDesk as bearish overall, other observers offered a more optimistic stance about the prospects for future price developments. Their input comes as bitcoin prices have largely traded rangebound in the last few days, fluctuating between $1,010 and $1,060, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\n\nWhile bitcoin prices reached an all-time high of more than $1,300 earlier this month in the lead up to the US Securities and Exchange Commission ruling on the bitcoin ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss twins, they have fallen since. Interestingly enough, bitcoin prices were little changed when the SEC shot down a bitcoin ETF proposed by SolidX.\n\nOthers highlighted that sentiment has, for better or worse, changed in recent days. Much of the attention seems to have squared on the prospects of a possible bitcoin hard fork – and the resulting tension that has taken hold.\n\n""The market has seen a switch in sentiment from hope of ETF approval to the ugliness of internal fighting,"" said Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare.\n\nFork blues?\n\nSome analysts pointed to this ongoing dilemma when providing their overall bearish views of the market. One lingering concern is that a fork could drive down prices sharply, prompting some to hedge their bets ahead of any possible disruption.\n\nAccording to Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, the situation is becoming a key driver of that bearishness.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n""Bitcoin is a very fundamental market right now: the price is going down because the dev project is imploding in near civil war.""\n\nNot all agreed with this assessment, however. OTC trader Harry Yeh struck a more practical outlook, arguing that bitcoin\'s upside has been limited as a result.\n\n""We see this as being priced in now and don\'t foresee major prices moves past $1,200 in the near term,"" he said.\n\nTim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, offered similar sentiment, telling CoinDesk that ""hard fork concerns are capping upward movement"". However, he also emphasized that ""solid BTC fundamentals, interest and growth potential"" were creating a floor for prices.\n\nWhile Enneking offered a moderate assessment of the situation, a handful of analysts insisted that bitcoin\'s long-term trend was bullish. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, stated that the digital currency\'s recent pullbacks in price represent a ""healthy correction"".\n\n""The additional uncertainty surrounding the potential hard fork also acts as a price dampener,"" he added.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', 'As a Japanese Cabinet-signed law recognizing virtual currencies like bitcoin as a legal method of payment goes into effect on April 1, bitcoin companies and adopters are short on answers about accounting standards specific to cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn February 2016, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country’s financial regulator, looked into proposals to consider legislative revisions that would recognize bitcoin and digital currencies as equivalents to conventional currencies. The revision, if approved, would see bitcoin as “fulfilling the functions of [a] currency.”\n\nCome March, the Japanese cabinet passed a set of bills recognizing virtual currencies like bitcoin to contain asset-like-values that can be used to make payments and be transferred digitally. Fundamentally, bitcoin and digital currencies are to be officially recognized alongside fiat currencies, fulfilling a similar purpose.\n\nAmending the Payment Services Act to include digital currencies as payments is related to a separate bill passed by Japan’s legislature in May 2016, one which mandated the regulation of digital currency exchanges by the FSA in Japan. CCN previously reported on an early draft of the proposed regulations in 2015.\n\nBitcoin and virtual currencies will be officially recognized as payments starting Saturday. However, the accounting framework for the use of digital currencies is still about six months away, leaving adopters and bitcoin companies in limbo.\n\nAs reported by Nikkei, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan has, on Tuesday, decided to consider the development of an accounting framework for digital currencies. It is expected to take up to six months to reveal a viable accounting method, the report adds.\n\nWith today’s accounting guidelines in Japan, virtual currency holders can table it as inventory while issuers can deem it a liability. That’s the closest a company or an individual can get to considering digital currencies on a balance sheet, however. Since there is no specific instruction or method of accounting to consider bitcoin and other popular currencies like Ether and Litecoin in Japan, many adopters leave their digital currency holdings off their books entirely, the report adds.\n\nThe report highlights the example of the accounting model set upon reward point programs, commonly offered by the likes of airlines. The accounting of rewards points sees them recognized when they’re redeemed while their entire value is booked as a liability, under International Financial Reporting Standards. This could have an adverse effect on companies’ operating profits, particularly those that richly reward customers. The report reveals that Tokyo-based e-commerce giant Rakuten’s net profit fell in the fiscal year 2016 due to costs of a promotional campaign with aggressively high reward points.\n\nChikako Suzuki, a partner at PwC Aarata told the publication of the “risk that companies that hold virtual currency could turn out to have distorted valuations or that huge losses surface suddenly.”\n\nAs it stands, companies and adopters of digital currencies like bitcoin remain without guidance in Japan, a market that is now among the largest bitcoin exchange markets in the world.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'Why is Ethereum sudden rise?\n\nDuring the last month, Ether, or the digital asset that fuels the whole Ethereum blockchain, has grown more than 300%, reaching its all time high of about $60 a few days ago.\n\nAt present time, Ether has a value of $50.59 with a market capitalization of $4,469,204,016, the second most important cap right after Bitcoin ($16,278,519,837).\n\nBut why this sudden rise? Why the younger brother of bitcoin rose so much during the last few days?\n\nAs often happens in the financial markets, the answer is not only one, but a combination of many factors that more or less affect the trading.\n\nLet’s see the most crucial facts.\n\nBitcoin potential fork\n\nIn period of political and economic uncertainty, people often decide to invest in non traditional assets.\n\nFor example, when Donald Trump was elected president, investors started to buy bitcoins and the stronger demand drove the digital currency price.\n\nThe same thing happens when bitcoin faces a period of crisis, so that altcoins (or how all the other digital currencies besides bitcoin are defined) start to become the new alternative.\n\nIn fact, during those days Bitcoin is facing a great issue: the block size debate.\n\nJust for those who don’t know, the block size debate is an open discussion about the possibility to increase the size of the blocks which the bitcoin blockchain is composed by, in order to have faster transactions and maybe lower fees.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the bitcoin community and developers are deciding how to proceed and how to implement a soft or hard fork.\n\nIn the latest case, this would lead to a disruptive event that would also open the door for a new digital currency to steal part of the Bitcoin-related interest.\n\nOf course, this issue is causing a growing insecurity among investors that are opting for safer and more stable (right now, at least) digital assets such as Ethereum.\n\nAs you can see, in fact, bitcoin price is falling down and the Ethereum one is rising. This cannot be considered only a coincidence.\n\nSEC rejected Bitcoin ETF\n\nAnother important news that drove the Ethereum price is the one occurred on March 10th, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected a rule change that would have allowed the creation of the first Bitcoin ETF to begin trading on the Bats BZX Exchange.\n\nThe initial hope about the approval of Winklevoss’ proposed ETF pushed bitcoin as high as $1,327, hitting its all-time high. But the denial caused a collapse - momentary, at least - of the bitcoin price with a drop of $300, so investors began to favor Ethereum.\n\nWe have to say, in fact that the greatest part of Ether trading volume comes always from Bitcoin/Ether trades.\n\nEthereum Enterprise Alliance\n\nAnother main factor that is influencing the Ether rally is that its underlying technology - the Ethereum blockchain - is reaching much interest among big companies.\n\nIn fact, a new working group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was recently created in order to connect large enterprises to technology vendors with the main goal of working on new projects with the use of the distributed ledger.\n\nMajor companies that are involved in the Enterprise launch include JPMorgan, IBM, Microsoft and Intel among the others.\n\nOf course, this move added more legitimacy to the ether digital asset.\n\nAlso, we need to tell that this new Enterprise Ethereum Alliance requires ether to be transferred and stored in order to get full access to the applications that use Ethereum.\n\nIn fact, we should remember that any application or contract need an ether transaction to be correctly executed and stored in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nMore Ethereum tokens and ICOs\n\nClarified briefly how the so-called dapps can work on the Ethereum blockchain and having this in mind, we also need to say that recently there are more and more projects, tokens and ICOs launched on the network.\n\nThe Ethereum digital assets, in fact, recently hitted a market capitalization of about $260 million ($262,877,525 USD according to March 24th data) with projects like Golem, DAO and Augur and more coming soon.\n\nFor example, Brave Browser is going to launch a new ICO later this year for its project of a new web and mobile browser that reward users that decide to switch on ads.\n\nAlso, Storj decided to move its tokens from Counterparty to Ethereum because of its active development, speed in executing transactions and negligible fees.']"
03/30/2017,"['Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin\'s public ledger of past transactions. In the early days of Bitcoin, mining was performed by individual computers running the Bitcoin nodes as they compete to solve algorithmic problems while confirming transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nThe fastest computer to solve a particular problem is rewarded with a specific amount of Bitcoin, and that is how new coins are introduced into the ecosystem, hence the term “Bitcoin Mining.”\n\nIncreasing difficulty\n\nAs time passed, “Bitcoin halving” factors in, technology improves and more efficient mining equipment developed. This gave rise to increased mining difficulty as the rate of competition skyrocketed.\n\nInstead of having millions of individual computers independently mining Bitcoins across the globe as is assumed to have been the original intention of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, what is obtainable nowadays is the installation of massive mining farms.\n\nA Bitcoin mining farm is usually comprised of a huge number of processors, known as mining pools. These pools are interconnected to compete as a single unit in the transaction processing competition on the Bitcoin Blockchain. This, in essence, automatically makes it extremely difficult for small independent miners to carry out mining profitably.\n\nReturn on investment (ROI)\n\nOne major factor that determines the viability of Bitcoin mining is the return on investment (ROI).\n\nJure Pirc sees Bitcoin mining in 2017 as a very challenging adventure. He notes that every person or company that decides to invest in Bitcoin mining must understand that the current ROI time for the most efficient miner on the market ""Antminer T9"" is between 9-11 months. However, ROI time varies with energy and cooling costs. Therefore, countries with affordable electricity and a cooler climate hold a big advantage when it comes to mining profitability.\n\nNetwork difficulty\n\nAnother important factor to mention is that the ROI calculation is also based on the prevailing network difficulty which keeps increasing as time goes on.\n\nConcerning mining hardware equipment, Pirc says:\n\n“I get quite a lot of requests to assist and advise with setting up Bitcoin mining operations and almost always the end result is that it makes more sense to set up a GPU mining rig where a user/miner has a lot more choice.”\n\n“When it comes to choosing the currency one wishes to mine, while with Bitcoin ASIC devices the only choice is to mine SHA256 based cryptocurrencies. There are a few of these out there that are still in the proof of work phase,” Pirc adds.\n\nFor newcomers to the Bitcoin ecosystem, Pirc thinks that the individual mining process could be a very complex adventure.\n\nUnpredictable enterprise\n\nBlockchain Research Specialist Sean Brizendine describes the profitability of Bitcoin mining in 2017 as an unpredictable phenomenon considering the parameters involved in it.\n\nHe says:\n\n“Bitmain sells an Antminer T9-12.5TH/s for $1,205 beginning April 10 (pre-paid). So you’re looking at $204.84 a month, with electricity costing $93.60, meaning that the profit after electricity is around $111.24 a month.”\n\nIn Brizendine’s opinion, Bitcoin mining is not a particularly great investment but for the purpose of maintaining the network, he advises holders of a lot of Bitcoins to run at least one miner, regardless of the little profit.\n\n“Right now I would personally buy and run one Bitcoin miner to support decentralization and contribute to the strength of the Bitcoin network and also invest heavily into buying the Bitcoins and holding them in a cold storage hardware wallet like a Trezor or KeepKey,” he concludes.\n\nIt all depends on Bitcoin price\n\nAaron Foster, co-founder and CEO of TheBitPoint, explains that Bitcoin mining profitability depends on Bitcoin price. Given the scaling situation, if not resolved one way or the other he thinks that returns will be in the negative. Even worse, a hard fork with two chains, giving rise to the mining of either BTU or BTC.\n\nFoster also notes that the lifespan of the hardware must be put into consideration, figuring out how long before a mining device becomes obsolete:\n\n“The best way to profit from Bitcoin for the smaller investor is with the buy and hold strategy for now. Unless you can get some ant miners cheaply and have really cheap or free electricity.”\n\nTeam mining\n\nFred Gondzar, president/CEO of Healthy Wealth, LLC, is of the opinion that being part of a mining club is the best approach for anyone who wants to earn rewards from the complex environment of Bitcoin mining. He speaks from the standpoint of a participant of such arrangements and claims to receive his dividends on a daily basis.\n\nGondzar says:\n\n“From my perspective, it is a good idea to be involved in Bitcoin mining, however, not as an individual but as a member of a Bitcoin mining club that is mining on a large scale. I am in a couple of groups that are mining like that, and it is paying me daily, so I am in favor of it.”\n\nClearly, Bitcoin mining in 2017 could be a complex adventure which depends on several factors. However, with proper planning and a conducive environment, individuals can still benefit from the Bitcoin ecosystem through mining.', 'Amir Taaki, a well-known developer within the Bitcoin community as the creator of Dark Wallet, spent nearly four months fighting in Syria against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) while trying to introduce the local community to Bitcoin.\n\nWith Bitcoin and Kalashnikov\n\nIn early 2016, Taaki disappeared from the Bitcoin scene and traveled to Syria to fight against the terrorist group ISIS. With the Kurdish People\'s Protection Units [YPG] military group, the anarchist hacker stood at the front line and actively engaged in the war against ISIS. In an interview, Taaki stated:\n\n""When I discovered Rojava [the term Kurds use to refer to northern or Syrian Kurdistan] I felt I had to go there. At first, I was completely scared - I thought I was going to die. I got sent to the frontline. I had no training, and I was given a Kalashnikov. I learned how to use a gun on the way, another Western fighter showed me. I found myself on the front with a gun, I had to fight. But I wanted to go elsewhere, where my skills would be useful.""\n\nWho is Amir Taaki?\n\nTaaki, who is best known as the creator of DarkMarket and operator of Bitcoin exchange Bitcoinica, was one of the most important figures in the early stages of Bitcoin development. In fact, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper, who wrote the book Digital Gold, initially planned on focusing the narrative of his book on Taaki and his involvement with Bitcoin.\n\nAt one point, Taaki was one of the four main developers to write off the Bitcoin code. During that time, Taaki also introduced DarkMarket, an anonymous marketplace which operates like Tor’s darknet marketplaces, which allows users to purchase or sell items with full anonymity. The platform was based on a technology called Dark Wallet, that essentially allowed users to make anonymous Bitcoin payments, for financial privacy.\n\nHowever, in August of 2012, the Bitcoin exchange Bitcoinica, which Taaki took over, was hacked. The hack led to the loss of $228,000 worth of Bitcoin and one Bitcoin was equivalent to $10 at the time of the hack. Prior to the August 2012 hack, Bitcoinica also lost more than 40,000 Bitcoins in a security breach. In total, based on the current Bitcoin price, Bitcoinica was responsible for the loss of $66 mln worth of Bitcoin.\n\nMany executives and CEOs of existing Bitcoin companies suffered from the hacks of Bitcoinica. Two of the many victims were Kraken CEO Jesse Powell and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver.\n\nThe anonymity and intrigue of developers like Taaki ultimately attracted more attention to Bitcoin and added more unique characteristics to Bitcoin. As Popper wrote:\n\n""Bitcoin\'s survival early on depended on young programmers like Amir who had the naive hubris to think that they could change the world, and the programming skills to begin laying the groundwork for that change.""\n\nSupport for revolution\n\nThe motive of Taaki wasn’t his opposition against ISIS. The reason why Taaki left the UK to fight in Syria was to bring peace in the Middle East with his abilities to create a decentralized and fair economy. Like he did for Bitcoin, Taaki aimed to contribute in creating an alternative financial infrastructure for the local people and thus, develop a lasting economy.\n\nTaaki said:\n\n""My main goal with going to Rojava was not because I opposed ISIS, it\'s because I support their [the Kurds\'] revolution. I support their politics and their struggle. It is the only solution for lasting peace in the Middle East. They\'re trying to create a people\'s economy. To establish a decentralized economy, you need decentralized money. Rojava\'s under embargo, so there\'s no way to move money in or out. So we have to actually create our own Bitcoin economies. Now we have a technological tool for people to freely organize outside the state system. Because it is a currency not controlled by central banks.""\n\nUpon his return to the UK, Taaki was immediately arrested by local police. Currently, he is on police bail and awaiting for the investigation to close.', 'The vast majority of respondents favored SegWit over Bitcoin Unlimited. 75.4 percent of the Blockchain and Bitcoin experts community expressed their support for Segwit activation and 70.5 percent of the community turned down Bitcoin Unlimited.\n\nThe survey was conducted by 21 Inc, a Bitcoin company which operates a micropayments marketplace and pay-by-completion network. The respondents included Blockchain, Bitcoin and Ethereum executives and influencers, for example, Blockstream CEO Adam Back, Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, Coins.ph CEO Ron Hose, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, and Litecoin creator Charlie Lee.\n\nThe results of the survey\n\nThe main purpose of the survey was to evaluate the popularity of certain digital currencies and their applications, and the possibility of either Segregated Witness (SegWit) or Bitcoin Unlimited of being activated.\n\nDo you want miners to activate Bitcoin Unlimited?\n\nDo you want SegWit to be activated by miners?\n\nAre you in favor of a non-SegWit-based blocksize increase, via hard fork or otherwise?\n\nThe support rate for SegWit and the Bitcoin Core development team significantly increased after the two bug exploitation cases of Bitcoin Unlimited. The hashrate support for SegWit particularly began to increase after the Bitcoin Unlimited team released a closed source update to their code to immediately resolve an issue derived from a bug exploitation. The majority of the community rejected such development philosophy of Bitcoin Unlimited, which is evident in the support rate of SegWit shown below.\n\nThe most compelling part of the survey was when the community was asked about a potential non-SegWit blocksize increase solution. Surprisingly, 49.2 percent of the community stated that they are in favor of a non-SegWit based blocksize increase solution and they intend to support it if introduced in the future.\n\nAlternatives to SegWit & Bitcoin Unlimited\n\nCurrently, most businesses, companies and organizations within the Bitcoin industry are rejecting Bitcoin Unlimited due to its contentious nature. If forked, it will inevitably lead to a split chain and lead to both economic and technical issues which will be difficult to deal with in the future.\n\nHowever, there exist non-contentious hard forks that are well measured and planned. An example of this is Ethereum Classic’s recent hard fork execution to eliminate Ethereum’s original inflationary monetary policy and add a Bitcoin-like monetary policy that provides its token ETC with scarcity and rarity. Essentially, Ethereum Classic’s hard fork was a move by its development team to promote its token as a digital currency, rather than an asset designed solely for development.\n\nAs reported by Cointelegraph earlier this month, ZCash CEO Zooko Wilcox also provided his criteria of a safe and non-contentious hard fork. In the chart shown below, Wilcox explained that not all hard fork solutions are dangerous and a hard fork could allow a network to update more efficiently than a soft fork solution if executed properly.\n\nEthereum on the rise\n\nThe same survey also asked the community on their portfolio of digital currencies. The top three digital currencies were Bitcoin at 98.4 percent, Ethereum’s Ether at 65.6 percent and Zcash at 37.7 percent.\n\nWhich of the following applications of digital currency is exciting to you?\n\nInterestingly, each currency has their own merits. Security-focused Bitcoin enables users to settle payments within a secure peer to peer protocol with transparency.\n\nEthereum, which prioritizes flexibility and functionality, allows users to send fixed-fee payments without having worry about Blockchain congestion. Lastly, ZCash permits users to send and receive transactions with full anonymity, providing the community with an unprecedented level of financial privacy.\n\nThe popularity of Ethereum coincided with the community’s interest in the smart contract. With the emergence of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and the involvement of some of the world’s largest corporations and financial institutions, the hype around Ethereum and its smart contract-based protocol are increasing rapidly.', 'Dash, a digital currency and an alternative to Bitcoin, has announced two partnerships in Europe and Russia.\n\nBitPanda, formerly known as Coinimal, has added a buy option for Dash on its online brokerage, while Moscow’s exchange, MaRSe, has integrated the digital currency in the “wake of a historic price rise and sustained market demand”.\n\nDaniel Diaz, VP of Dash business development. says BitPanda offers “multiple payment options as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum integration”, while MaRSe is the “largest and most reputable Russian exchange for Bitcoin and now Dash, so we expect trading volumes to increase”.\n\nThe partnership with BitPanda will allow anyone in Europe to purchase Dash with Visa, Mastercard, Sofort, SEPA, Neteller, Skrill and EPS/Giropay.\n\nAccording to Dash, MaRSe previously worked exclusively with Bitcoin, but added Dash due to “community demand”. People are now able buy and sell Dash for rubles, with the exchange rate tied to the current exchange rate on BTC-e.\n\nDash likes to flash the good news and adds that its token valuation has increased from $11.21 to $90.40, an approximate 800% increase in Q1.', 'TumbleBit, which has been touted as the answer to anonymized transactions on top of Bitcoin’s protocol, is to be introduced to Stratis Group’s soon-to-be-released Breeze Wallet, introducing new privacy features to Bitcoin users and the Stratis platform.\n\nStratis is a Blockchain development platform that permits developers and enterprises to test and deploy Blockchain-based applications, equipping programmers with a Blockchain building interface using C# and the Microsoft .NET Framework.\n\nAfter years of production on different components to create a digital currency wallet for enhanced privacy protection, Stratis developed the Breeze Wallet.\n\nThe first Bitcoin wallet to address privacy issues\n\nWithin two months the wallet is expected to be released. When it is, it will become the first Bitcoin wallet to address privacy issues in Blockchain transactions while working with the Bitcoin protocol without requiring any forks.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Chris Trew, founder and CEO at Stratis, said that the Breeze Wallet will serve as a typical Bitcoin wallet for desktop computers, but combines the innovative TumbleBit solution and privacy enhancements.\n\n“Connected through a TumbleBit tumbler, Breeze Wallet users can mix their coins without needing to trust each other or the tumbler with their coins or their privacy,” he said.\n\nTheir goal, according to Trew, is to offer a truly trustless and decentralized privacy protocol on the Stratis Blockchain, which has its own token, the Stratis token, and its private chains. It will also work with financial service regulators on creating regulatory compliant Blockchain solutions using the Stratis Privacy protocol.\n\nUtilizing TumbleBit\n\nIntroduced by Ethan Heilman, Leen AlShenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg, as an unlinkable payment hub, TumbleBit utilizes cryptographic techniques to ensure that the Tumbler doesn’t violate anonymity, steal Bitcoins or print money by issuing payments to itself.\n\nBy replacing on-Blockchain payments with off-Blockchain puzzle solving, Alice can send payments faster to Bob, with transactions completed in seconds. In the TumbleBit white paper, the authors explain it like this:\n\n“Alice A pays Bob B by providing B with the solution to a puzzle. The puzzle z is generated through interaction between B and T and solved through an interaction between A and T. Each time a puzzle is solved, one Bitcoin is transferred from Alice A to the Tumbler T and finally on to Bob B.”\n\nTrew explains that different ideas were looked at before deciding that TumbleBit was the best fit for their future goals as it is fully compatible with the Bitcoin’s protocol.\n\n“The team behind Stratis carefully evaluated the different concepts and technological options to deliver a truly trustless and secure privacy solution that would meet the requirements of enterprise and consumers worldwide,” he said.\n\nFull block SPV\n\nIn order to ensure the privacy features that the Breeze Wallet is promising, it will be introducing the Full Block Secure Payment Validation System or the Full Block SVP.\n\nTo aid the Stratis team to build the Breeze Wallet to the TumbleBit specifications, Adam Ficsor, one of the contributors to the TumbleBit research paper and the official implementation of TumbleBit NTumbleBit, is helping them with the creation of the full block SPV wallet in C#.', 'Bitcoin has progressed from being only a nerd\'s version of gold years ago.\n\nBitcoin has undergone a lot of ups and downs in its brief history.\n\nOnline trading school Investoo.com has created an infographic detailing the major Bitcoin crashes since it was introduced.\n\nBitcoin is both a cryptocurrency and an electronic payment system invented by an unidentified programmer, or group of programmers, under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. It was introduced on 31 October 2008 to a cryptography mailing list, and released as open source software in 2009.\n\nInvestoo.com notes Bitcoin\'s journey has been long, from the first Bitcoin transaction, which resulted in the kick-off of the Bitcoin blockchain on 3 January 2009, to the recent moves by Chinese authorities to restrict Bitcoin transactions.\n\nEarlier this year, the People\'s Bank of China launched spot checks on the country\'s three largest Bitcoin exchanges to look into a range of possible rule violations, amid increasing government efforts to stem capital outflows and relieve pressure on the yuan.\n\nCirculation record\n\nStanko Saponja, an analyst at Investoo.com, notes that when Bitcoin was introduced in 2009, one Bitcoin was equivalent to $0.00076.\n\nIn December last year, the total value of all Bitcoins in circulation hit a record high of above $14 billion. However, in January this year, the dramatic rally in digital currency came to a spectacular end with a plunge of up to 20% as China\'s yuan rose sharply.\n\n""In 2013, the price briefly exceeded $1 200, and this was followed by a crash in the price of Bitcoin, sending it down to below $250 soon after,"" Saponja notes. ""This has led some sceptics to claim this price rise, too, is a bubble.""\n\nHe points out the size and computing power of the Bitcoin mining network, which confirms and validates transactions, has risen exponentially since then, and the number of users, merchants, and exchange volume has grown similarly.\n\nAccording to Saponja, the rapid rise in 2013 is now attributed to fraudulent trading and price manipulation that exploited illiquid and immature markets, and which eventually led to the famous collapse of the primary, and corrupt, Bitcoin Exchange.\n\n""Bitcoin has gone from being just a nerd\'s version of gold years ago, to now being another thing people do to try to hold onto their wealth,"" he says.\n\nSaponja says in 2015, Bitcoin rose modestly, from $313 to $431, a 37% rise, kicking off a year of steady growth throughout 2016. The price surged 122% in 2016, making it one of the top trades of the year (from around $400 to just under $1 000), he adds.\n\nInvestoo.com notes 2016 saw relative price stability in Bitcoin, as its price rose steadily, and with lower volatility than had been experienced in the past, and it also gained wider acceptance and legitimacy as a means of payment.\n\n2017 prospects\n\nSome analysts predict 2017 will be another banner year, while others are more sceptical, calling this recent rise a bubble that is waiting to burst (current price is 1 BTC = $1 023.38 – 27 March 2017).\n\n""My opinion is that demand for Bitcoin as a currency is also likely to continue to grow in 2017, again as China has promised to restrict capital outflows and to devalue its currency in order to protect exporters.""\n\nDescribing the major drivers of Bitcoin, Saponja says increased demand came from China as capital controls tightened and regulators continued to devalue the yuan systematically.\n\nChina and India have both been big buyers as part of a broader global landscape that has pushed Bitcoin\'s acceptance further along, he notes.\n\n""Chinese investors have bought Bitcoins as the yuan has lost its value, while the surge in India has been driven thanks to the government\'s decision to retire some currency denominations. In most countries, companies that trade Bitcoins onto the local currency would be regulated, as more and more larger corporations start offering Bitcoin as a payment alternative.""\n\nBad guys\n\nNonetheless, he says Bitcoin has sometimes attracted the wrong types of people – those looking to prey on others who fall under the spell of a never-ending upward trend for Bitcoin\'s price.\n\n""Whether it\'s illegal online marketplaces, pump-and-dump schemes or shady crypto exchanges, they all create a black cloud over the industry. And, every time there is another Bitcoin robbery or scam, it draws attention from the mainstream.\n\n""The bad actor problem creates a consumer protection issue for Bitcoin. When people learn about Bitcoin and are lured to products and services that do not follow best practices, as opaque as they may be in this industry, that\'s a problem. According to some analysts, the five biggest threats facing Bitcoin are the centralisation of Bitcoin, fraud, regulation, poor mobile platform support, and confidence.""\n\n\n\nSign up for our FREE newsletters in one easy step Subscribe NOW!

In addition, the 100 SMA dynamic support lines up with the short-term triangle bottom, adding to its strength as a floor. A pullback could still find support at this level, which also coincides with the broken channel resistance.\n\nStochastic is on the move up so bitcoin price could follow suit. RSI is also turning higher after spending some time moving sideways, also indicating that buyers are regaining the upper hand. This could be enough to take bitcoin price at least to the triangle highs at $1060 and beyond.\n\nHowever, if this proves to be a fakeout and traders quickly book profits at the end of this week and quarter, bitcoin price could fall back inside the longer-term channel and resume its selloff back to support at $850 or halfway there until $950.\n\nMarket Events\n\nProfit-taking is expected by the end of this week as it also closes out the first quarter of 2017. As such, most investors are likely to book their winnings and close out their positions to crunch the numbers.\n\nAlthough the dollar gained across the board versus its forex counterparts yesterday, it seems that risk appetite surged along with it so bitcoin price took advantage. The cryptocurrency is also drawing some support from uncertainties surrounding US fiscal policy and the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Reports that several exchanges are rejecting Bitcoin Unlimited, which is the newer version of the software, is renewing confidence that existing bitcoin will not lose its value.\n\nCharts from SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

For short and mid-term investment, is it too late to buy the mentioned digital currencies?\n\nIssuance rate\n\nDash and Ether are different from most digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Monero in the sense that they have unique monetary policies.\n\nEthereum, for instance, is actually an inflationary token because it operates on top of a concept called the “Issuance Rate.” The Issuance Rate represents the number of Ethereum tokens or Ether that will be created within a year. In 2017, the issuance rate of Ether is 14.75 percent.\n\nMaking the creator rich\n\nDash is a controversial cryptocurrency because over two mln Dash - previously known as Darkcoin - was instantaneously mined in the first 30 hours of launch. Homero, a Bitcoin trader and cryptocurrency trader, wrote:\n\n“During the first day 2M coins were mined, and as of today, less than 3k are mined daily. Even if there were no features/community at the time, he didn’t relaunch and decided to keep his instamine, claiming that the community told him to do so. Having a fair launch is very trivial for the future of a coin, because a premined coin has only one future : to make the creator rich.”\n\nBitcoin and Monero, on the other hand, were launched and mined with complete transparency and legitimacy and because of their open processes. They continue to be two of the most respected and appreciated cryptocurrencies currently in existence.\n\nTrading and price\n\nSince Bitcoin and Monero are based on a fixed supply of coins, it is quite evident that the value of the two coins will continue to rise until their supplies are maximized. In other words, Bitcoin price will continue to increase until it hits its 21 mln supply cap. Even when the supply cap is reached, if the demand of the currencies continues to increase, its price will maintain an upward trend.\n\nFor Ethereum and Dash, the second and third largest cryptocurrencies in the world, it is difficult to predict their price trends due to their unique monetary policies.\n\nFurthermore, Ether is considered as an alt-asset instead of a digital currency because the Ethereum network uses gas or Ether to power decentralized applications, hence the necessity of an inflationary monetary supply.\n\nBetting on usability\n\nIn general, cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Monero, Dash and Ethereum are all at their early stages. For both short and mid-term investors, it is important to recognize and evaluate the technical backgrounds and usability of these cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum developers or users will argue that the price of Ether will continue to increase so long as the development community remains active.\n\nConclusively, it is not too late to invest in cryptocurrencies that have potential to grow and evolve.', 'There has always been an interesting correlation between bitcoin and virtual reality. Several people have been working on bringing bitcoin to the VR ecosystem sooner or later. The Steam store now has the Bitcoin VR program listed, which will introduce even more people to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. An intriguing concept, that much is certain.\n\nOn paper, the Bitcoin VR game is quite geeky. In fact, it is something that may not even appeal to that any people in the end. However, it is an intriguing educational concept that introduces people to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Keeping in mind how Steam started accepting bitcoin some time ago, Bitcoin VR is quite an intriguing addition for sure.\n\nThe objective of this particular Steam game is quite simple. Users can see bitcoin transactions occur in real time on the blockchain within a VR environment. It has to be said, the video looks quite interesting, to say the least. Immersing oneself within the bitcoin ecosystem through a beautiful graphical environment is quite nifty. It remains to be seen how many people will decide to be part of this experience, though.\n\nBitcoin VR Is An Intriguing Game\n\nIt is worth noting Bitcoin VR is about more than just watching transactions take place. Users will see block confirmation effects, which makes the interaction even more interactive. It is also possible to see all Counterparty token transactions. For example, when a new Spells of Genesis card is bought or sold, that will be visible within the VR environment as well. Additionally, there is a mini-game to be played within Bitcoin VR.\n\nBringing bitcoin to the mainstream is quite challenging, to say the least. Venturing into the VR business may be the right way to go, though. It allows for a more interactive experience while creating stunning visuals. Bitcoin VR will become available for purchase on the Steam store less than a day from now, yet it will be interesting to see how many people download it. Keep in mind users need to own an HTC Vive to play this game properly.\n\nAll things considered, it is good to see people get creative when it comes to bitcoin. Although anyone in the world can see all bitcoin transactions in real-time through their browser, a VR experience can be quite powerful as well. Bitcoin VR is definitely worth keeping an eye on, especially for those who own a virtual reality headset. Spreading the world about bitcoin is important, and videogames are a good a medium as any.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock', 'Tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. There is great interest by financial intermediaries and technologists around the world in figuring out how to move real-world assets onto blockchains to gain the advantages of Bitcoin while keeping the characteristics of the asset.\n\nWhy Tokenize “Real World” Assets?\n\nOur world is full of assets: stocks, real estate, gold, carbon credits, oil, etc. Many of these assets are difficult to physically transfer or subdivide, so buyers and sellers instead trade paper that represents some or all of the asset. But paper and complex legal agreements are cumbersome, difficult to transfer and can be hard to track. One solution would be to switch to a digital system along the lines of Bitcoin but linked to an asset.\n\nCommodity exchanges have largely done away with physical paper by substituting electronic transactions and standardized agreements, but the overhead of these systems is enormous and they generally rely on trusted participants. Startups and major financial companies around the world are now racing to develop systems for the next phase of this evolution: tokenizing assets. But why would someone want a digital token that represents a physical asset and how can that be done?\n\nImagine Jane is a diamond wholesaler who owns $15 million of diamonds. Diamonds are difficult to transfer to buyers because they require security and careful inspection to ensure that a fake isn’t introduced somewhere in the supply chain. Joe would like to invest a few thousand dollars in diamonds but doesn’t want to deal with the hassle of physically receiving them. and in any event, Joe would ideally like to own a small piece of many diamonds to diversify his diamond position, since diamonds come in a variety of grades and cuts, and demand changes over time for each type.\n\nIt’s not worth Jane’s time to find Joe and sell him a couple diamonds; she just wants an easy way to subdivide her diamond stock and sell fractional pieces of it to a variety of people. Joe wants to be able to easily trade his fractional ownership to other people (rather than just with Jane). This ability to make all parties happy in such a scenario is the promise of blockchain tokens that represent real-world assets and an opportunity to democratize ownership of interesting asset classes.\n\nThere are many proposed methods for taking real-world assets and “putting them on a blockchain.” The goal is to achieve the security, speed and ease of transfer of Bitcoin, combined with real-world assets. This is a new form of an old concept: “securitization” (turning a set of assets into a security), and in some cases the tokenization is of securitized assets. The rest of this article explores the types of assets that can be put on blockchains and some of the models being piloted by startups, financial intermediaries and governments.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nMany assets are what lawyers refer to as “intangible.” They exist only due to the operation of law and there is no physical object. Examples of intangible assets include patents, carbon credits, brand names, copyrights, etc. Intangible assets, lacking a physical form, may be easier to combine with digital blockchain-based systems.\n\nThe challenge with intangible assets is ensuring that the blockchain system’s model of asset transfer lines up with the real-world legal model of transfer. There may also be jurisdictional differences that can make transfers difficult (although similar, copyright laws differ around the world). That said, intangible assets are often easier to tokenize than physical objects because there are fewer concerns regarding storage and shipment.\n\nFungible Assets\n\nLawyers make a distinction between assets that are fungible and those that are not. A fungible item is one that can be replaced by another identical item. Think wheat, gold or water. Fungible assets are much easier to convert to tokens because they can generally be broken down into smaller units (like bitcoin), and a token can stand for a group of objects (e.g., a pile of gold) rather than a set of individual objects (e.g., a warehouse full of unique works of art).\n\nAssets that aren’t fungible require an abstraction layer in order to tokenize. For example, a company that will group the assets together and offer them as a package. This is the method used for securitizing mortgages, whereby a set of mortgages that have unique characteristics are bundled together into a group of mortgages with approximately similar characteristics.\n\nFungible assets are typically easier to tokenize because the general set of tokens are linked to a general set of interchangeable asset components (e.g. 10kg of gold).\n\nTransfers of Ownership vs. Transfer of Limited Rights\n\nThere are many kinds of transfers of assets and many types of asset rights. Sometimes only limited rights connected to an asset are transferred, such as a lease to use land for a limited time rather than a transfer of land ownership. Thousands of years of property ownership has led to a wide variety of types of ownership and control such as holding property on behalf of another person (“bailment”). The details depend on the jurisdiction, type of law (common law vs. civil law), asset, and the rights intended to be transferred.\n\nSome intangible assets can be licensed out to millions of people at once, such as music rights. When a customer “buys” a song from iTunes, they’re not gaining ownership over the song (a change in ownership), they’re purchasing the right, a license, to listen to the music under certain conditions.\n\nBlockchain projects can generally be divided into those that involve tokenizing partial rights, like music licensing, and those that involve tokenizing full ownership, e.g. selling real estate.\n\nThe Key Legal Issue: Ensuring Token Consistency\n\nIn a digital system like Bitcoin there is always consistency. Transactions obey the rules of the software and there are no exceptions. In the real world, there are often exceptions. Gold bars are stolen, houses burn down, music samples turn out not to be properly licensed, diamonds fail to be delivered — humans sometimes don’t obey the rules. Therefore the key challenge for any system that involves tokenizing real-world assets is to ensure that the digital token stays linked to the real-world asset.\n\nImagine a token that represents a fractional interest in a set of gold bars in a vault. If a gold bar is taken from the vault, how will that be reflected in the digital token? Who will make sure that the token value stays linked to the gold bars that should be in the vault, rather than the gold bars that are in the vault? Who will bear the risk and how?\n\nIf the buyer of a token can’t be sure that the token is properly linked to the real-world asset, then the value of the token will fall or become zero (if no one has faith in it).\n\nLegal Models\n\n1. Licensing\n\nMusic licensing relies heavily on paperwork and trust. Musicians hope that sales of their music and merchandise are properly calculated and reported to them. As streaming and digital downloads eliminate physical sales of media containing songs, the music would appear to be a great candidate for tokenization. If music ownership was represented on a blockchain, the many participants in creating the music could have their shares set electronically. The dream would be to have every listen of their music require “unlocking” and payment, with payment then being distributed to the appropriate holders. The holders could then transfer their interest in the music (e.g., if the drummer wants to convert their ownership to a down payment on a house) to someone else, who would then receive the payment stream.\n\nMore accurate reporting would be a benefit to everyone, but there are other changes that tokenization could trigger. Tokenization of music ownership could allow new business models such as investing in music creation by the public. If a new band could sell 20 percent of their new song to fans, what would that do to the creation of music? How would that affect intermediaries?\n\nAn example of music ownership/licensing tokenization is SingularDTV.\n\n2. Trading Systems\n\nImagine a group of companies that want to trade oil with one another. Normally they’d exchange paperwork and keep their own lists of trades. If they could move to a blockchain-based system for trading their oil, they could potentially reduce paperwork and have more robust record-keeping. There are many consortiums sprouting up that aim to replace paper trading systems with blockchain trading systems. They generally don’t aim to tokenize real-world assets directly, but rather to use a blockchain system to enable trading of real-world assets. This is a hybrid of the old paper record approach and the new blockchain approach. The tokens only have value within the context of a contractual system involving all of the past and future participants.\n\nAn example of this form of tokenization is the IBM-Natixis-Trafigura oil trading project. There are also tokenization schemes that involve limited use of property enforced by digital locks, such as Slock.it.\n\n3. Redemption\n\nImagine an art print by a famous artist with 1000 prints. The art prints could be tokenized by having ownership held by a company that has a standing offer to the public to redeem tokens for either a single art print or, if the redeemed tokens are less than a certain threshold, a fraction of the assessed value of the art print. Physical delivery of the prints could be made at a certain location or shipped to a specified address. In this way, buyers could obtain an easy-to-transfer token and third-party markets could transact in fractions of the art prints. This could potentially be a source of financing for the artist and a way for the broader public to participate in the art market.\n\nThe above model relies on the company holding the art to continue to offer redemptions. An obvious risk for token holders is that the company will no longer honor its commitment to exchanging the digital tokens for the real-world goods in its possession. Another issue would be how the company holding the artwork will be compensated for storage costs.\n\nAn example of this model in action for foreign currencies is Tether, although note that section 3 of the terms of service indicates that redemption is not guaranteed.\n\n4. Vaults & Smart Contracts\n\nImagine a vault of gold. The gold is owned by “Goldowner Inc.” and the vault is owned by “Vault Inc.” Vault Inc. has a sterling reputation and third-party auditors who verify the amount of gold in its vault.\n\nGoldowner Inc. could offer a digital token to the public that represents ownership of the gold and through a smart contract with Vault Inc. maintain a public off-chain registry that relates fractional interest in the gold with the tokens. For every token sold, Goldowner Inc. transfers ownership to Vault Inc., who holds it on behalf of the token owner. Vault Inc. guarantees redemption of gold by anyone who can prove ownership through a digital signature.\n\nGoldowner Inc. can take advantage of the fact that Vault Inc. is trusted (and audited). Owners of the tokens rely on Vault Inc.’s representations and not on Goldowner Inc. (even though Goldowner Inc. is the token issuer).\n\nObviously there are many risks in the above example that wouldn’t exist if the gold was a digital item that could be transferred electronically. Gold has a physical embodiment that requires physical storage (which also costs money). So why tokenize the gold? One advantage would be that buyers of the tokens could know that they are the only person who has received the token, whereas a buyer of a paper certificate has no way of knowing that the same certificate hasn’t been sold to multiple people.\n\nTwo examples of gold tokenization startups are Vaultoro and Orebits. There are also many related projects that seek to use digital tokens to track real-world items moving through supply chains, where the token is used for provenance rather than value.\n\nIntersection With Global Securities Laws\n\nSelling a fractional interest in an asset to the public (without permission from the government) is often prohibited by securities laws. Given the global-by-default nature of blockchains, this can pose a problem for the entities involved in the tokenization, or the operators of marketplaces where these tokens are traded. These issues are particularly complicated because they often involve overlapping jurisdictions (e.g., a Chinese seller and American buyer).\n\nDigital tokens are linked to real-world assets and ultimately involve a real-world entity that has value and can be tracked down by the relevant regulator. This makes it harder to avoid regulation than a platform that is pitched as purely software, or that involves peer-to-peer activities (think BitTorrent vs. a store selling pirated movies).\n\nSome forward-thinking regulators are contemplating legal changes that will enable asset transfers to be accomplished through digital token transfers. The U.S. State of Delaware has already begun legislative efforts to enable companies to use blockchains for their books and records regarding shareholders. These efforts are part of a move away from the complicated indirect securities ownership scheme in the United States that requires intermediaries. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the largest U.S. intermediary, currently has custody of over $37 trillion worth of shares.\n\nFor an example of the failings of the current indirect ownership system for shares, see last month’s Delaware Court of Chancery decision: In Re: Dole Foods Company, Inc., C.A. No. 8703-VCL. For an interesting look at the challenges involved in debt markets, see the 2014 New York Times Magazine article “Paper Boys.”\n\nThe Centralization Issue\n\nOne of the main advantages to Bitcoin over non-blockchain systems is that it’s decentralized. But real-world assets generally have a single owner, or a small group of owners.\n\nMany of the models for asset-backed tokens involve an open offer for redemption by a company that holds the real-world asset. The entire token can fail if the central asset holder fails.\n\nThe challenge for any tokenization scheme is how to connect the single owner of the real-world asset with the many owners of the token. How can the risk of centralization be mitigated? The answer is typically a combination of clever digital token schemes, contracts, insurance, auditing and third-party guarantees.\n\nOne answer to the problem of centralization is to rely on a centralized party that has trust because it is the relevant government authority that decides who owns what. Sweden’s land registry system has been piloting a blockchain-based property transfer system. Britain’s Royal Mint is also pursuing a digital token plan that relies on its status as a trusted central party.\n\nLegal Changes Needed?\n\nIt will not be possible to move some types of physical assets onto blockchains until statutory changes enable digital transfers. In some countries there are legal rules in place that require transfers to take place using a certain form or be registered in a certain way with the government authority that is not amenable to a token-based system. For example, secured lending laws may give priority ownership to a person who lends money and registers that interest over someone who possesses a token indicating ownership.\n\nTokenizing real-world assets is a challenging problem that requires innovative solutions that go beyond technology. In some cases this will require legal reform, and in other cases it will involve clever combinations of existing legal rules, new business structures and new digital token systems.\n\nThis guest post was contributed by Addison Cameron-Huff.

03/31/2017,"[""The question mark over the legality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in India is taking an interesting shape.\n\nWe reported not too long ago that the Indian Minister of State for Finance, Arjun Ram Meghwal, had issued a written reply to a question in the upper house of the parliament, which had led to a lot of consternation.\n\nIt would appear that the Indian Bitcoin industry is now taking steps to rectify the situation.\n\nDABFI is petitioning the Indian government\n\nDigital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI) has created an online petition, the link of which was sent to their customers today through text messages. This petition is asking the Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit R Patel and S. Selvakumar of the Ministry of Finance to “announce Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies as legal.”\n\nThe petition then goes on to state the benefits of the technology behind Bitcoin and makes a powerful point urging the finance minister and others to “stop bad actors, not the technology.”\n\nWhy create a petition?\n\nThe recent events in India have been causing a lot of questions about the status of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies in India. Before Arjun Ram Meghwal even answered his question, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Kirit Somaiya, who is also a member of the Indian parliament, had raised concerns about Bitcoin being a Ponzi scheme.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has too in the recent past issued several warnings to Bitcoin users. We asked Zebpay, A DABFI member, why DABFI created this petition. In an emailed response, Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay, says: “Bitcoin is not illegal as per any existing laws. However, there is a perception in India that Bitcoin is illegal. This is also due to the press release from RBI, India's central bank.\n\nTo clear this, it would be great if the government proactively regulates Bitcoin like in many other countries. Bitcoin’s current legal status and RBI's circulars are posted on zebpay.”\n\nFor now, Indian Bitcoin industry is self-regulated\n\nIn the email to Cointelegraph, Goenka reveals that the Indian Bitcoin industry is self-regulated and they are voluntarily following KYC norms and use regular banking channels for making payments.\n\nRecently, the industry formed the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI). One of the aims of the DABFI is to educate stakeholders including the government about the potential of cryptocurrencies in India. Other than Zebpay, Unocoin and Coinsecure are also members of DABFI.\n\nWill the petition succeed?\n\nGiven the negative commentary in Indian media regarding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the recent statements of various members of government and parliament, it is an interesting question if the petition would be successful in getting Bitcoin to be declared as legal.\n\nHowever, as far as Zebpay is concerned, the legal status of Bitcoin is clear. We asked them if they think the government will pay heed to their request.\n\nGoenka says in response:"", 'Fred Wilson, the venture capitalist known for backing Twitter (twtr) and Tumblr, has made a big bet on blockchain cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin—and he thinks regular investors should buy some too.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at a conference hosted by StockTwits, the social network for stock traders, Wilson said the equivalent of a Wall Street bank now exists for the digital currencies, in what is otherwise a Wild West: Coinbase, the Bitcoin and Ethereum brokerage that has recently come under fire for the apparent failure of its investors to disclose their profits to the IRS.\n\nCoinbase was Wilson’s very first investment in Bitcoin and now has a reported valuation of more than $400 million. “They’re like J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs for blockchain,” he said at the event, called Stocktoberfest East.\n\nNot only has Wilson’s Union Square Ventures backed several blockchain companies, but the VC has also personally bought cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as a bit of Litecoin, representing “some small percentage of my net worth,” he said.\n\n“If I were a trader, a stock trader or hedge fund person, I might think of having 5% of my assets in something like this,” Wilson added. “It’s still early days; I don’t think you want to go all in on it, but I think you want to be in it.”\n\nEarlier that day, he said, a retail investor had emailed him wanting to invest in private startups, wondering how to put money into Union Square Ventures. But Wilson had to inform the man, who made $50,000 a year, that he was not wealthy or experienced enough to qualify as an “accredited investor” and was therefore prohibited by law from investing in startup companies before they went public.\n\nWilson was able to give him an alternative recommendation: Buy Bitcoin instead. “The cool thing,” Wilson said about Coinbase, is that “anybody can buy”—accredited or not.\n\nThe accessibility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, however, has also raised questions as to whether the average investor should own the assets, which are not only unusually volatile but vulnerable to risks including theft via cyberattack, leaving many Bitcoin buyers burned.\n\nYet that’s where Coinbase has an advantage, and why blockchain investors will see it as a safe haven akin to Goldman Sachs (gs) or J.P. Morgan (jpm) in a world of robber barons, Wilson said.\n\n“If you look at what they are world class at, it’s security, trust, safety, fraud—all these things that frankly banks are good at,” he said. “If you go back to the 19th century, banks got robbed a lot, and the truth of the matter is, most companies like Coinbase have gotten robbed, because it’s pretty easy to rob these companies—you hack in, you take the Bitcoin, and you get in the car and you drive away.”\n\nThat’s not to say that other problems won’t arise among Bitcoin traders on Coinbase, just as they did in the early days of Wall Street, and still continue to a lesser extent. “We’re going to have all the same things that happened—we’re going to have pump and dump, front-running, all the things that people did,” Wilson acknowledged. “There are some people who are going to use it as a way to defraud people. But I think a lot of people should do it for the right reasons.”', ""Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting tomorrow.\n\nThe country's legislature passed a law, following months of debate, that brought bitcoin exchanges under anti-money laundering/know-your-customer rules, while also categorizing bitcoin as a kind of prepaid payment instrument.\n\nIt's a debate that began in the wake of the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that shuttered after months of growing complications and, in the end, revelations of insolvency and alleged fraud.\n\nAccording to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, that law goes into effect on 1st April, putting in place capital requirements for exchanges as well as cybersecurity and operational stipulations. In addition, those exchanges will also be required to conduct employee training programs and submit to annual audits.\n\nYet there may be more work to come in this area.\n\nFor example, Nomura Research Institute's Yasutake Okano indicated in a May 2016 report that other Japanese laws may need to change to account for the tech, including the Banking Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.\n\nReports indicate that other groups in Japan are moving to plug some of those gaps as well.\n\nAccording to a report from Nikkei, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan decided earlier this week to begin developing standards for digital currencies like bitcoin. Its work mirrors other efforts being undertaken elsewhere, including Australia, which began pushing for such standards late last year.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, with miners racing for the chance to mint new bitcoins as a reward.\n\nThe ten plaintiffs alleged losses of over 2,000 bitcoins, an amount worth more than $2m at press time. Yet they hit a roadblock last year, after US District Judge Joseph Rodriguez questioned whether the New Jersey court actually had jurisdiction in the matter.\n\nAs reported at the time by the New Jersey Law Journal, the judge focused on the question of whether mining contracts sold by Lab Rat constituted ""bonds"" as argued by the plaintiffs. Rodriguez also moved to deflect a bid by the defendants to have the suit dismissed.\n\nA new court order indicates that the years-long legal effort is now progressing.\n\nOn 30th March, Rodriguez sided with the plaintiffs, stating in an opinion that they had successfully argued that the court does, in fact, have jurisdiction over the case.\n\n""In light of the allegations set forth in the chart and the additional details provided in the proposed Second Amended Complaint, the Court is satisfied that it has diversity of citizenship subject matter jurisdiction and the amendment is not futile,"" Rodriguez wrote.\n\nJustice image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Because let’s face it — the news wasn’t exactly unexpected. Still, the SEC’s repeated calls for regulation and oversight are sobering given other developments brewing in the bitcoin space.\n\nHard fork, anyone?\n\nConcern among investors has grown amid signs of an impending split in the bitcoin space. While the debate stems from differing ideologies on block size, the controversy calls into question the ability of a digital currency without a central authority to update and innovate itself in any meaningful way.\n\nIf competing factions can’t come to an agreement on block size, how will the broader ecosystem be able to put systems in place to meet the SEC’s requirements, or, for that matter, make any major changes?\n\nGiven the market reaction to the second SEC denial, it appears that if technical in-fighting over block size can be kept to a minimum (we’ll see about that), the $1,000 milestone might actually remain a viable long-term benchmark value. Well, as long-term as bitcoin value can be.\n\nThe SEC still sits on one remaining bitcoin ETF proposal filed by Grayscale Investments LLC back in January, seeking to launch with some $500 million. Given the outcomes for the prior two, things look grim for the viability of their Bitcoin Investment Trust.\n\nAt the time of writing, one bitcoin was worth $1,023.68, down 1.61 percent from Wednesday’s (March 29) close. The estimated market cap is at just over $16.6 billion.\n\nEven with the recent internal strife and a price chart that could make even the most hardened of sailors seasick, investors haven’t been scared away from putting faith (and capital) into the broader digital currency ecosystem.\n\nEarlier this week, digital currency exchange startup ShapeShift announced the close a $10.4 million Series A venture funding round led by Berlin-based Earlybird Venture Capital. The Series A included participation from Lakestar and Blockchain Capital, among others.\n\nFounded in August 2014, ShapeShift’s platform allows users, without signups or logins, the ability to exchange any of the 35 digital currencies it supports — including bitcoin, Zcash, ether and dash — for any other.\n\n“What we saw when we started was that tokens were going to become a widespread phenomenon,” founder and CEO Erik Voorhees told CoinDesk. “We believed there would be blockchain tokens representing all sorts of value beyond currency, and that’s become increasingly true, which is why ShapeShift’s frictionless exchange is important.”\n\nShapeshift will reportedly use the Series A funds to grow its engineering team — an important move to support two new exchange-related products coming to market later in 2017 as well as to handle transaction volume growth.\n\nIn the past three years, ShapeShift has reportedly averaged 48 percent growth month on month with a monthly trade volume near 50,000 BTC ($51.2 million) across the currencies and assets its platform supports.', 'In the 1990s, entry of personal computing provided individuals and groups to communicate and interact anonymously, without the fear of state censorship.\n\nThe idea, now known as the Internet, created an opportunity for the free flow of information and virtually erased the concept restrictive sovereign borders. Numerous ventures sprung out and many decimated during the \'Dotcom crash\', but Internet still stayed relevant and gained significance.\n\nSuch is the case now that a life without Internet is unimaginable — the idea of free exchange of information is bulletproof.\n\nOver past decade, another idea with immense potential for disrupting the society germinated and is growing roots. That idea — free flow of money — is called Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, world\'s first decentralised digital currency, took birth in the aftermath of subprime mortgage crisis in 2008.\n\nDuring the global meltdown, confidence in government-backed currencies and their ability to manage the economy and the supply of money hit rock bottom. The crisis of faith dwelled as the US government used millions of taxpayer money to bail out banks after the \'quantitative easing\' measure was adopted by the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn the process, money was being printed to provide stimulus to an ailing economy but the oversupply of currency backed by very little economic growth led to a global recession from which many countries are still recovering.\n\nIt was around this time a paper under the pseudo name of Satoshi Nakamoto was published describing the concept of Bitcoin.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin may be in a bubble but it\'s about to disrupt the concept of money. Here\'s why\n\nIn the paper, Satoshi said that the problem with traditional currency is the requirement of trust to make the system work.\n\n""Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible,"" Nakamoto had said.\n\nThough the guidelines on which the bitcoin network was established, in theory, seems guarded from any sort of manipulation and as a result provides a currency which is portable, unforgeable and free from any central authority.\n\nNo doubts about the fact that bitcoin as an idea is revolutionary but it is yet to be seen whether it is bulletproof like the internet.\n\nAndreas Antonopoulos, global bitcoin expert says that it is bulletproof from the outside as it is very hard for forces outside of the network to interfere with bitcoin but it does face risks from the inside.\n\nWhat he meant was that you can have propaganda and sowing of division, internal fights within the community that can damage at least the short term prospects of the technology, primarily by stalling its development.\n\n""You can\'t turn off bitcoin but you can confuse its developers and users with enough acrimony and division, dissent and infighting so that they don\'t spend enough time making it better and writing new code because they are too busy fighting on internet forums,"" he told Moneycontrol.\n\n""Just like any social movement, any revolutionary movement, any grass-root movement, from environmentalism to feminism to labour unions, has had infiltrators and provocateurs who go in and cause trouble to disrupt the system, bitcoin does to,"" he added.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin faces \'civil war\' that may split it into two, but it may be good for currency\n\nIt has been observed in the past that crackdown by various countries on bitcoin exchanges, banning its use has damaged its value time and again but despite that, there has been steady acceptance of it which reflects in the appreciation of its value on global exchanges.\n\nWhile some countries in the world have listed the legal framework under which Bitcoin businesses function, the regulatory landscape remains contentious in many.\n\nThis uncertainty around the status and treatment of Bitcoin in the economy is a real deal breaker for many new potential users of the currency. If declared illegal, it will leave investors without remefy and helpless.\n\nAndreas points out the like the internet, bitcoin as a whole cannot be regulated as it is not constrained within the borders of one nation. He said that businesses based on the idea of bitcoin can be subjected to regulation but the whole network itself cannot be.', 'About The Author\n\nMark is a 24 year old cryptocurrency entrepreneur. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and has been involved with it ever since. He used to mine bitcoins and altcoins but now focuses on blogging and educating others about digital currencies.', ""Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast, project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM.\n\nIn this opinion piece, Hagelstrom takes on the private vs public blockchain debate, arguing that, while bitcoin may be a more interesting technology, private blockchains offer real business utility.\n\nI'm sure reading the comments on this piece won't be pretty...\n\nThere are countless blog posts describing what a blockchain is, and particularly what private blockchains are, but you may notice the funny fact that none of them agree with each other.\n\nI won't try to give another definition. Instead, I will try to add some more fuel to the fire. Private blockchains make sense, and yes, I intend to argue that point even though I consider myself a bitcoin maximalist.\n\nNow, let me address some of what I expect will be your key arguments:\n\n'Private blockchains are not as secure as the bitcoin blockchain'\n\nSure, so what?\n\nHave you ever thought that the level of security needed for an open and anonymous network is not the same needed for one where all the participants are known and have some level of trust between each other?\n\n'You need a token to incentivize miners to secure the network'\n\nOf course, but only if you want to use proof of work. When transactions are not anonymous, you might want to use a simpler consensus mechanism.\n\nAfter all, you only want to keep the data consistent between nodes and be able to detect if someone doesn't follow the rules.\n\nIn bitcoin, miners need an incentive to invest resources independent of the transactions they will be validating and securing. After all they don't even know who is transacting and what those transactions are for.\n\nOn the other hand, in a private blockchain, participants are incentivized by the goal established on that particular business network. If they think that by achieving multi-organization integration on a particular process will bring them cost reduction, that is incentive enough to play their role on the network.\n\n'There isn’t real immutability without proof of work'\n\nWe agree again. But, we need to distinguish between tamper-proof and tamper-evident systems.\n\nIf grouping data in blocks and chaining them through hashes makes it possible to detect that someone changed history, it might be enough if I am able to identify the one who did.\n\nRemember, we are not talking about anonymous members, so things might be easier when there are contracts in place that govern what happens when someone cheats.\n\n'Those use cases can be solved by traditional databases'\n\nTechnologically speaking, probably.\n\nBut, governance is usually the hardest issue to tackle on intra-organizational integration projects. Implementing a traditional database, even a distributed one, means that the organizations need to agree on:\n\nWho will own the data Who will be the central authority to change or delete that data Who will own the application layer that runs the business logic that validates the transactions when recorded.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nBut, if we can have a decentralized system where everybody can have a copy and only append new data validated by the rest of the members of the network, a very big obstacle is removed.\n\n'That technology is not really interesting'\n\nOK, but big companies don't implement new tech because it is 'cool' or 'interesting'. The whole point of investing in technology is to achieve some kind of efficiency in their business.\n\nIf running a multi-company business process can help them to reduce manual steps or validations, costs and risks, or even create new revenue streams, it might be enough to go for it.\n\nIn fact, their duty to their shareholders is to improve their bottom line, not having the coolest technology on the block.\n\n'Do you think that private blockchains are as revolutionary and world-changing as bitcoin?'\n\nDefinitely no.\n\nBut, as I said before, as long as we can achieve efficiencies or an interesting return of investment, it is still a very attractive technology for enterprises.\n\nIn the meantime, we can all keep learning about the technology, test new functionalities and grow the ecosystem with human and monetary resources.\n\nYou never know, some of that, directly or indirectly, might even end up benefitting bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

Another week complete in our bitcoin price trading efforts, and one that – as we noted this morning – has been a pretty rough ride. We were hoping for a it of a win on the outside lane today, something that we could go into the weekend on a high with. As it turns out, we got exactly that.\n\nWe entered long on a break of resistance to the upside at 1051 earlier today, and set a take profit up at 1061. Price ran up pretty quickly towards our target, and we managed to get a take profit hit just recently. It’s a quick $10 profit on the position – nothing spectacular, but nothing to scoff at, and as we always say, a profit is a profit.\n\nThis brings us to our final analysis for the week, and as far as restating some of the levels go, it’s a relatively simple outline. Basically, we’re going to take this morning’s range, and shift it up in line with the trade from which we managed to draw a profit today.\n\nSo, to see what this means for our key levels, take a look at the chart below. It’s a five-minute candlestick chart and it’s got our range overlaid in green.\n\nAs the chart shows, the range we’re going for this evening is defined by support to the downside at 1051, and resistance to the upside at 1063. We’re not going to try and be too fancy here, so just breakout entries to close out the period.\n\nSpecifically, if we see price break through resistance to the upside, we’ll be in long towards 1075. A stop on the trade at 1060 will take us out if price reverses. If we see a close below support, we’ll be in short towards 1040.\n\nHave a good weekend!\n\nCharts courtesy of SimpleFX\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.
