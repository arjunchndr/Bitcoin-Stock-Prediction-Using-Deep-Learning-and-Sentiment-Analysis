12/01/2017,"['Bitcoin has been on a volatile roller coaster this past week. The cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $11,395 on Nov. 29 before losing over one-fifth of its value, dropping as low as $9,000 at one point on Nov. 30.\n\nDespite the drop, bitcoin is still up over 900 percent year-to-date. So what exactly is bitcoin and how is it being used?\n\nHere are five things to know about bitcoin:\n\n1. Bitcoin is a form of currency. Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, which is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to control its creation and secure transactions, independent from a central bank. These encryption techniques make it very difficult to create any kind of counterfeit form. According to bitcoin.org, “Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.” People can purchase bitcoins or fractions of a bitcoin through online exchanges or from an individual and store them in a virtual wallet. There are hundreds of thousands of retailers that accept bitcoin and millions of dollars worth of bitcoins are exchanged daily throughout the world.\n\n2. The creator is somewhat of a mystery. In 2009, a proof of concept was published in a cryptography mailing list under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. In this paper bitcoin was called “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” The first 50 bitcoins were mined, the process by which bitcoins are created, on Jan. 3, 2009 -- considered to be Bitcoin’s birthday -- by Nakamoto, who is said to have left the project in 2010. The community grew and other developers took over. But ever since the inception of bitcoin, there has been an ongoing debate over the identity of Nakamoto. No one has been able to identify who or what Nakamoto is, but some have tried.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nIn 2014, Newsweek claimed that a California man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto was the creator, but he firmly denied it, claiming he hadn’t even heard of bitcoin. There was then speculation around Nakamoto’s neighbor Hal Finney, a computer scientist who was the first recipient of a bitcoin transaction. Finney described his initial involvement via a forum post on bitcointalk.org, saying, “Satoshi’s true identity has become a mystery.” In the post Finney reveals that he was diagnosed with ALS in 2009 and that at the time of his post in 2013 he was “essentially paralyzed.”\n\nOthers believe the creators could be the men behind bitcoin’s precursors, Nick Szabo and Wei Dai, who created Bit Gold and B-Money, respectively. In 2016, an Australian man named Craig Wright claimed to be Nakamoto, but could not provide proof. And then a week ago, a former SpaceX intern blogged “Elon Musk probably invented bitcoin,” but Musk flatly denied it.\n\nStill, whomever or whatever Nakamoto is, they are believed to own about 1 million bitcoins, which would be worth around $10 billion.\n\n3. There is a finite amount. There are only 21 million bitcoins that can ever be created and because of this fixed supply, if the demand goes up, so will the price. Not all of the 21 million have been mined yet, but once they are, that\'s it. However, each bitcoin can be divided up to eight decimal places and, according to bitcoin.org, “potentially even smaller units if that is ever required in the future.” Additionally, bitcoin transactions can be done in smaller units called “bits” and there are 1 million bits in one bitcoin. Currently, the total value of all existing bitcoins is more than $20 billion.\n\n4. Bitcoin has some high-profile critics and investors. Billionaire Warren Buffett has been an outspoken critic of bitcoin. He dismissed the cryptocurrency in a 2014 CNBC interview when he urged people to “stay away from it.” He went on to say, “It’s a mirage basically.” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is also a critic, who once called bitcoin “a fraud.”\n\nBut despite the naysayers, there are still many supporters. Some notable investors include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper. Even Richard Branson has spoken positively about the cryptocurrency. He recently invested in a blockchain bitcoin wallet start-up, which is basically a piece of software to store and use the cryptocurrency.\n\n5. Bitcoin futures will be trading on three exchanges. On Dec. 1 the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced that it will allow bitcoin futures trading on three exchanges: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), the CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE) and the Cantor Exchange (Cantor). This means investors will be able to bet on bitcoin without actually buying the cryptocurrency.\n\n“Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is a commodity unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past,” CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said in a statement.\n\nThe CFTC, however, reminded investors to ""be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts.”\n\n“Market participants should take note that the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority,"" Giancarlo said. ""We expect that the futures exchanges, through information sharing agreements, will be monitoring the trading activity.""', 'The wait is over for regulated bitcoin futures contracts (at least in the U.S.), and markets are reacting strongly to the news.\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap, bitcoin (BTC) moved above $10,500 after the news this morning that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFCT) had approved the listing of three such products from CBOE, CME Group and Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nAt press tine, the world\'s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had added 3.9 percent on the news, bringing gains to 11 percent over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe chart above shows:\n\nThe falling trendline has been breached.\n\nA higher lows pattern has been established.\n\nThe relative strength index is bullish (above 50.00) and rising.\n\nAs such, it appears bitcoin could revisit $11,000 with the position push. However, the longer duration charts favor consolidation as discussed here.\n\nIt\'s also possible the move may have been largely factored in already. (The CME Group talked about their plans to list BTC futures on Nov. 1. Since then, BTC has appreciated by 69 percent.)\n\nOne of the big reasons behind the rally to record highs above $11,300 has been a possible surge in the inflow of yield-hungry institutional money into bitcoin via the derivatives market.\n\nView\n\nWhile 1-hour chart does favor further upside, caution is still advised as the good news may have been priced-in. Also long duration charts signal bull market exhaustion.\n\nAs noted here, consolidation followed by a 1-hour close above $10,850 on the back of stronger volumes could yield a more sustainable rally.\n\nAlso, a risk of ""sell the fact"" (bitcoin rallied on CME rumor, could be sold/profit taking on confirmation of the rumor) trade cannot be ruled out.\n\nBalloon image via Shutterstock\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Please conduct your own thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency.', '(Bloomberg)—Two U.S. exchanges, including the parent of the venerable Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are racing to embrace bitcoin, dragging federal regulators into a realm skeptics call a fad and fraud.\n\nThe development shows how some big financial players are moving to co-opt the volatile cryptocurrency and lure more mainstream investors into the market, even before regulators have agreed on just what bitcoin is.\n\nCME Group\'s contracts will debut Dec. 18. Cboe Global Markets didn\'t announce a start date. Both got the green light Friday after going through a process called self-certification—a pledge to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the products don\'t run afoul of the law. The news pushed bitcoin\'s price higher.\n\nThe moves are a watershed for Wall Street professionals—including institutional investors and high-speed traders—who\'ve been eager to bet on cryptocurrencies and their wild swings, but worried about doing so on mostly unregulated markets. The new products are subject to CFTC oversight. CME, Cboe and Cantor Fitzgerald\'s Cantor Exchange—which is creating another kind of bitcoin derivative, binary options—promised to help the agency surveil the underlying bitcoin market.\n\n""Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is a commodity unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past,"" CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo said in a statement today. ""We expect that the futures exchanges, through information sharing agreements, will be monitoring the trading activity on the relevant cash platforms.""\n\nTrading in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is largely unregulated, and that\'s the point. Bitcoin was introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a way of avoiding governments and central banks. Now with its meteoric rise and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies, banks, brokers and mainstream investors want in. And they want regulation, something they\'ll get plenty of in a market like CME or Cboe\'s.\n\n""The launch of the futures will actually make the market healthier,"" Cboe President Chris Concannon said in an interview after the news broke today. ""It will create pricing equilibrium in the market. Clients who are holding bitcoin now have no way to hedge their risk. These products allow them to hedge, and to take opposing views. More importantly, it brings a wave of regulatory oversight.""\n\nRelated:\n\nChicago is buying into bitcoin in a big wayBitcoin plans for CME Group include safeguardsBitcoin bubble makes dot.com fever look rational\u200b\n\nU.S. financial regulators have struggled for years to agree on what, exactly, bitcoin is and what risks it might pose. That\'s left its enthusiasts and financial professionals unsure which government agencies might try to police the rapidly growing market. In addition to the CFTC, there\'s the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department\'s FinCEN, which tracks illicit payments.\n\nThe CFTC declared in 2015 that it would treat bitcoin as a commodity. ""But the IRS says it\'s property, the SEC said now some digital currency is a security, and FinCEN says digital currency is a \'money-like instrument,\'"" said Adam White, general manager of GDAX, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by Coinbase. His company is trying to work with all of them, he said, while offering his own definition: ""It\'s a new asset class.""\n\nAfter today\'s announcement, exchanges and the CFTC will have to keep tabs on that underlying market, according to Jeff Bandman, who until June advised Chairman Giancarlo on financial technology issues.\n\n""It\'s well understood that bad actors can take actions in the spot market for a commodity where the reward or payoff is the derivatives market and vice versa,"" Bandman, who now runs Bandman Advisors, said in an interview before today\'s announcement. ""This would represent a new opportunity for mischief.""\n\nARE ETFs NEXT?\n\nThere are other ways the new futures could spur more vigorous oversight of the cryptocurrency. The contracts, for example, could make it easier to create an exchange-traded fund tied to bitcoin—even after a previous attempt was knocked down.\n\nThat could enlist the SEC. In March, the agency rejected a bitcoin ETF proposed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss—the co-creators of the Gemini exchange—saying necessary surveillance-sharing agreements were too difficult given that ""significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated."" Cboe is basing its futures on prices from Gemini.\n\nYesterday, a top SEC official weighed in. David Shillman, associate director in the agency\'s division of trading and markets, said a strong bitcoin futures market could make the regulator more comfortable approving bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMany mainstream investors and their brokers—lured by bitcoin\'s meteoric rise this year—wouldn\'t mind some government oversight to head off potential abuses. But regulating these futures only works so well if the underlying market isn\'t safe.\n\n""The problem with the futures contracts is they are regulated derivatives that are based off underlying trading in unregulated markets,"" Richard Johnson, a market-structure analyst at Greenwich Associates who specializes in blockchain, said before today\'s announcement. ""That does create a potential problem.""\n\nEver since digital currencies began emerging, U.S. regulators have faced a big dilemma: The laws that empower watchdogs and delineate their areas of responsibility were written decades ago when money was minted on paper, companies turned mainly to the stock market for capital, and commodities came from farms, mines or wells. Many authorities have held back, studying what to do.\n\nCME Chief Executive Officer Terrence Duffy sped up that process in October when he disclosed his plan for futures. His announcement of an imminent product caught some CFTC officials by surprise, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe problem among regulators is that they each have roles with bitcoin, but that there\'s too little coordination, said Justin Slaughter, a former top aide to a CFTC commissioner who now consults on financial technology and regulation as a partner at Mercury Strategies.\n\n""It\'s been very scattershot, it\'s been somewhat confused,"" he said.\n\n\u200b', 'Forget the Dow’s big rally or booming tech stocks, there’s a much wilder investment story happening.\n\nBitcoin started the year worth less than $1,000. It then stormed past $11,000 — a staggering jump of over 1,000%.\n\nSo how does the virtual digital currency work — and what’s behind its meteoric rise?\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Many of its backers saw it as a simple global payment system for anyone to use.\n\nUnlike the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen, digital currencies such as bitcoin aren’t issued by central banks like the Federal Reserve. Instead, they are “mined” by computers using complex algorithms.\n\nPayments in bitcoin can be made without traditional middlemen such as banks and without the need to give your name.\n\nThat made bitcoin popular with criminals and others who wanted to move money anonymously. But its price has taken off this year as mainstream investors have become interested.\n\nWhy have prices gone crazy?\n\nSome experts say the biggest force pushing bitcoin prices higher this year has been … higher prices.\n\nInvestors have been buying as they fear “they’re missing the party” or “losing out on a quick profit,” said Stephen Innes, head of Asia trading at online broker Oanda. “Intense media coverage” in recent months has also convinced more investors to pile in, he added.\n\nArthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong’s Bitmex, an exchange for trading financial instruments based on bitcoin, said the digital currency is in a “positive feedback loop.”\n\nIn other words, investors see the price is increasing and want a piece of the action, moving prices higher still.\n\nThe sentiment has been backed up by indications that bitcoin is getting greater mainstream acceptance. Next month, investors should be able to start trading bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThat would give the virtual currency more legitimacy among professional investors.\n\nWho’s buying it?\n\nFor much of this year, it’s mom-and-pop investors who have been buying in.\n\nMany are in Japan and South Korea, where recent regulation changes have made it easier to trade bitcoin, according to experts.\n\nBut the biggest gains from the virtual currency’s massive rally are likely to be concentrated among a relatively small number of investors.\n\nWhen you invest in bitcoin, you don’t have to buy a whole unit. According to research site BitInfoCharts, the vast majority of bitcoin accounts contain just 0.1 bitcoin (about $1,000) or less. Just 3% of more than 20 million bitcoin accounts hold one bitcoin or more.\n\nBig institutional investors such as hedge funds and assets managers have largely stayed on the sidelines. But some experts predict they’ll move into the market in the coming months, despite skepticism from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nSome industry insiders are incredibly bullish. Hayes predicts prices could hit a mind-boggling $50,000 by the end of next year, driven by the flow of money when institutional investors “pull the trigger” on investing in the digital currency.\n\nWith a total value of around $175 billion, the bitcoin market is small compared with more established assets.\n\n“This is a drop in the ocean compared to the trillions transacted daily” in currency and stock markets, said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Just a small amount of mainstream investors’ money would make a big difference to bitcoin prices, he said.\n\nBut some finance industry veterans are wary.\n\nOanda’s Innes, who has worked in currency trading for decades, referenced a famous piece of investment advice from Buffett: “Be fearful when others are greedy.”\n\n“Following the herd rarely produces large scale gains,” Innes said.\n\nInvestors were given a reminder of bitcoin’s unpredictability on Wednesday. After topping $11,000, it plunged more than $2,000 before recovering some of those losses.', 'This week has been a rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin – and could signal an equally unpredictable future.\n\nWhat happened this week?\n\nThe eight-year-old cryptocurrency has pulled in droves of investors in recent months. But this week it hit record-breaking highs, soaring over $10,000 (£7,493) in value. At the start of 2017 a Bitcoin was worth just $1,000.\n\nAnd yet within 24 hours of hitting the benchmark it had climbed past $11,000 before losing nearly 20% of its value, to just barely $9,000.\n\nThis rollercoaster ride, and resulting headlines, prompted the Bank of England to warn “investors should do their homework” on Bitcoin: some say the currency is peaking and based on nothing but a speculative bubble, while others feel it could have further to rise.\n\n“This week is no different,” says David Yermack, professor of finance and business transformation at New York University. “Bitcoin has always been very volatile. Anybody who invests should have a large amount of risk tolerance.”\n\nRemind me, what exactly is it?\n\nTen years ago, the idea of a futuristic, invisible currency – one that’s not linked to any government and that lives on the internet – might have been dismissed as a possible line from The Matrix or Blade Runner.\n\nBut that’s what it is: a digital alternative to notes or coins. It’s still not an official currency as it’s not issued by any government. It can be used as payment online and can be transferred digitally, avoiding the bureaucratic quicksand of banking hours, transaction fees, and waiting periods. The total nominal value of every bitcoin in existence – the first type of digital currency of its kind – is now over $167 billion.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nSome say breaching the $10,000 mark signals a new chapter for Bitcoin.\n\n“We’re in the second inning of a nine-inning baseball game,” says Ronnie Moas, founder and director of research at Standpoint Research, who specialises in investment, stock, and cryptocurrency recommendations. “What do you think is going to happen when this goes mainstream?” He thinks it could end up being as lucrative as Amazon or Google stock, and for him it is worth risking a decent sum in Bitcoin, rather getting caught on the sidelines. “In the direction we are headed, there are going to be 200 million people trying to get their hands on a few million Bitcoin.”\n\nWhen it was at $1,000, it had no credibility – now people are saying ‘this looks interesting’ – Ronnie Moas\n\nMoas believes the $10,000 mark is “basically a stamp of approval,” almost like a celebrity endorsement. “When it was at $1,000, it had no credibility – now people are saying ‘this looks interesting’.”\n\nNot everyone is so bullish. “It’s a bubble that’s going to give a lot of people a lot of exciting times as it rides up and then goes down,” Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz told Bloomberg.\n\nBitcoin’s relevance to the average person on the street, however, is still a little intangible. Although there are a handful of exceptions, you can’t use Bitcoin in most shops because its legal status varies by country. In many places, the cryptocurrency’s semi-anonymous nature stokes fears of money laundering or an increased sale of illegal goods.\n\nGovernment intervention?\n\nWhile some think Bitcoin is the future of money, others think that the party will inevitably screech to an halt once governments get serious about trying to regulate it.\n\nRight now? “It’s a total mess,” says Tadge Dryja, research scientist at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, when describing the decentralised nature of Bitcoin – meaning, there is no central body like a government or bank that oversees its distribution or use.\n\nDryja and his team are working on systems that will make Bitcoin safer and easier for Bitcoin holders to use in the future. But as it stands he describes the digital currency as “dangerous.”\n\n“I guess the best analogy is that of gold: governments can regulate the institutions that deal with it but not the metal itself. They can’t decide if it’s going to weigh less or be purple instead of yellow. They will have to regulate what is regulate-able.”\n\nThat’s why some think eventual regulation will burst the bubble.\n\nKenneth Rogoff is a professor of public policy and economics at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. He thinks that there could be a broad international crackdown, and that even in countries like Japan or Australia which have gone to great lengths to legalise bitcoin, it won’t be further legitimised because governments cannot allow people to make big transactions in ways that can’t be traced.\n\nIt’s just nonsense to think that we’ll reach a situation where everything is done in cryptocurrency and that no one pays taxes – Kenneth Rogoff\n\nAt the moment, he says governments are sitting back and letting Bitcoin foster technological innovation. But while Rogoff predicts that Bitcoin will struggle as more competitors emerge (Bitcoin may be “the MySpace of cryptocurrencies,” he says), the regulation issue is what will prove the ultimate challenge.\n\n“It’s just nonsense to think that we’ll reach a situation where everything is done in cryptocurrency and that no one pays taxes,” Rogoff says. He says in the currency game, “the government makes the rules and they can keep changing them until you can’t win.\n\n“The fundamental thing is that governments will pull the rug out at some point,” he says. “It will take some international coordination. I don’t think [Bitcoin] will be worthless – there may be some rogue states that support it.”\n\nBut for now? The past week’s volatility could signal the “beginning of a really wild ride,” for Moas.\n\nWhether it soars or crashes though, one thing’s for certain, Dryja says: “There will be plenty of jobs for lawyers going forward.”\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

""It doesn\'t serve any socially useful function.""\n\nRobert Shiller, who won a Nobel for his work on bubbles, said the currency appeals to some investors because it has an ""anti-government, anti-regulation feel.""\n\n""It\'s such a wonderful story,"" he said at a conference in Lithuania, according to Bloomberg. ""If it were only true.""\n\nWall Street titans were getting in on the action, too.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg that the currency serves as ""a vehicle for perpetrating fraud."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on CNBC that it ""seems like a bubble.""\n\nThe digital currency previously attracted the derision of JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, who called it a ""fraud"" that would ""eventually blow up."" Warren Buffett has warned of a ""real bubble.""\n\nRelated: Bitcoin at $11,000: What the heck is going on?\n\nThe criticisms have done little to temper bitcoin\'s (XBT) meteoric -- if wild -- rise this week.\n\nThe virtual currency powered above $11,000 for the first time on Wednesday, capping a jaw-dropping rally of more than 1,000% since the start of the year. But it then plunged by more than $2,000, providing a stark reminder of its extreme volatility.\n\nIt was trading at $10,700 on Friday.\n\nSome experts argue that the gains in recent weeks have been driven in part by the expectation that more major investors -- like hedge funds and asset managers -- are gearing up to start investing in the digital currency.\n\nCME Group, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said Friday it will list bitcoin futures in mid-December. Nasdaq, meanwhile, plans to launch bitcoin futures next year. Futures allow traders to bet on the future price of assets like currencies and metals.\n\nBlankfein acknowledged that the currency could have potential if volatility drops.\n\n""If it works out and gets more established ... we\'ll get to it,"" he said.\n\nThere appears to be substantially more enthusiasm for bitcoin in Silicon Valley, where tech luminaries Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen are among its backers.\n\n-- Daniel Shane contributed reporting.', 'With a bank, the coins and notes you hold in your hand are your connection to the currency system; with gold, you can hold your ounce in the palm of your hands, even stocks and bonds have certificates. When it comes to Bitcoin, they are ethereal.\n\nFor many everyday users of Bitcoin, their only connection to their asset, their money, is the exchanges. These applications, companies, websites essentially, are the only tenuous link between people and their digital assets.\n\nThus, when there are problems with the exchanges, it is little surprise that a degree of panic sets in. Coinbase, one of the biggest and fastest growing exchanges, suffered outages as the frenzy of FOMO rallied adoption to new high levels.\n\nWhen people were met with outages and delays, it sparked panic, in two senses. More FOMO was met, and people fell back to the fear that Bitcoin can collapse - or pop - anytime. This prompted a rather large sell off.\n\nThe importance of exchanges\n\nWith parallels being drawn between the latest rally, and the boost in 2014 because of the mainstream adoption take up, it is important to see the role of exchanges back then, and how they play their part today.\n\nIt was in 2014 when some of the heavy hitters of exchanges, like Coinbase, burst onto the market, making the buying and selling of Bitcoin far easier and much more of a pleasant user experience.\n\nAgain, in today’s Bitcoin economy, the exchanges are the lifeblood of the network and the market, and even comparable to the central nervous system for if there is a problem at these centers, things often go pear-shaped quite quickly.\n\nCatalysing the drop\n\nOnly hours after soaring past $11,000 - a price that represents a gain of more than two-fold since September - Bitcoin plunged nearly 20 percent in less than 90 minutes. Many are now pinning this latest drop to outages experienced on Coinbase, and others.\n\nTraffic swelled during the US online hours yesterday as investors fought to get on the rocketship seemingly headed to the moon; however, Coinbase could not keep up.\n\nCoinbase tweeted that traffic on its platform hit an all-time high at eight times the peak demand experienced in June. Access remained unavailable to some users.\n\n“Issues in the exchanges add to it without a doubt,” said David Mondrus, chief executive of Trive, a Blockchain-based research platform. “When you have a lack of ability to exit, then people dump in order to exit faster.”\n\nBitcoin’s Achilles heel\n\nIt has been interesting to see how recently not much has phased Bitcoin in terms of negative press. News of Russia’s ban and the emergence of the Crypto Ruble, Jamie Dimon’s ongoing vitriol, and other factors barely even left a scratch on the digital currency. However, when issues affect the exchanges, it seems that is where the market can be hit hard.\n\n“Bitcoin trading isn’t for the novice investor,” said John Spallanzani, chief macro strategist at GFI Securities in New York, who does technical analysis on the cryptocurrency. “Corrections are fast and furious and you can get run over just like in the movie.”', 'Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has said high volatility means it\'s too early for the bank to consider a bitcoin strategy.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on Nov. 30, Blankfein said, if a cryptocurrency can rise or fall 20 percent in a day, it ""doesn\'t feel like a currency, doesn\'t feel like a store of value.""\n\nHe continued:\n\n""If it works out – and it gets more established, and it trades more like a store of value, and it doesn\'t move up and down 20 percent, and there is liquidity to it – we\'ll get to it.""\n\nBlankfein\'s comments follow recent statements from Goldman Sachs\'s global head of commodities research, Jeff Currie, who said on Wednesday that bitcoin is a commodity similar to gold, adding that the lack of liquidity is driving its volatility.\n\nLast month, Blankfein also said that he is ""open to bitcoin."" However, he indicated he still has a ""level of discomfort"" with the cryptocurrency, as he does with anything new – a stance that was echoed in Wednesday\'s Bloomberg interview.\n\nLloyd Blankfein image via Fortune Live Media/Flickr\n\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market--that they expect to have up and running by the end of Q4-each contract will represent five Bitcoins.\n\nIf a trader is selling their contract, they are called a short speculator, if a trader is buying a contract, they are called a long speculator.\n\nAlthough there is often a minimum number of contracts that a trader must purchase, to keep this example simple, let's say Bob wants to buy one contract and the price is $50,000 ($10,000 per Bitcoin).\n\nBefore Bob owns the contract, Bob will need to deposit the initial margin. The initial margin is often called a “good faith” deposit. Similar to a down-payment, a good faith deposit is a deposit into a trader’s account that shows that the trader intends to follow through with their contract. The initial margin is a percentage of the total contract that is often around five to 10 percent of the total contract. If Bob’s initial margin is 10 percent, Bob will own the contract after he deposits $5,000 into his trading account.\n\nNow let’s assume Bob deposits $5,000 to buy the contract and is a long-speculator, meaning he believes/hopes Bitcoin price will rise above the spot price he paid for his contract--10,000 per Bitcoin.\n\nCME Group has set the tick--the minimum price movement of the trading instrument--for their Bitcoin contracts at $5.00. This means that if Bitcoin price increases by $4, Bob will not realize a gain/loss on his contract, because $4 is below the minimum tick. However, each time Bitcoin price increases by $5, Bob will gain/lose $25 on his contract (because each contract is composed of five Bitcoin)\n\nThe day after Bob Purchases his contract, let’s say Bitcoin price rises by $100 . Because Bob owns one contract, the minimum tick is $5, and with each tick Bob earns $25, Bob will gain $500 on his contract (20*)(25)=$500.\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin price declined by $100 during the trading day, Bob’s would lose $500 on his contract and Bob will see the funds in his trading account diminish.\n\nLeverage\n\nKeep in mind, Bob only paid $5,000 to become the owner of a contract worth $50,000. The $40,000 that Bob did not have to pay is borrowed money, in other words, Bob’s Bitcoin contract is leveraged. Because futures contracts are highly leveraged, investing in futures is considered very risky.\n\nNow let’s imagine that after four weeks the Bitcoin index (price) increases by five percent or in other words, 500 index points. After four weeks, Bob has earned a profit of $5.00(500)=$2,500 viz. Bob has earned a 50 percent profit on his initial deposit. On the other hand, if the indexed declined by five percent Bob will lose $2,500, a 50 percent loss on his contract.\n\nThe more contracts a futures trader owns, the greater that trader’s risk. If the price decreases by a significant amount it is possible for Bob to lose even more money than he initially deposited for the initial margin.\n\nBob’s initial margin was 5,000 dollars, now instead of Bitcoin price rising by 100, let’s say Bitcoin price falls by $1,100, Bob’s account will be credited $5,500 at the end of the trading day. Now remember, Bob’s initial margin was $5,000. Because of his $5,500 dollar loss, he will be 500 dollars in debt to CME Group and will have to pay out of his own pocket to bring is trading account balance back to zero.\n\nIf Bob suffers a loss or a series of losses that deplete his initial margin to an amount lower than the maintenance margin--the lowest amount of money the broker allows Bob’s account to reach before requiring Bob to replenish his account-- Bob will receive a margin call from his broker, telling him to deposit the sufficient amount of funds to return him to the initial margin amount.\n\nTo mitigate some of the risk involved with Bitcoin’s volatility, the CME Group has placed price limits on Bitcoin Futures. Bitcoin futures will be subject to price fluctuation limits of seven percent, 13 percent, and 20 percent. When the price of a contract fluctuates +/- 7% to the prior settlement price--the price that Bitcoin was valued at when the market closed the previous trading day-- a two minute monitoring period will begin where contracts will continue to trade, however, within the +/- 7% boundary. If at the end of that two minute monitoring period, the price is still at the limit down or limit up, a two minute halt on trading will begin. During the two-minute halt traders will be able to create market orders, however, they will not be fulfilled until the two minute halt period is over. Afterwards, the price limit will expand to 13 percent without a halt period and will be hard capped at 20 percent without a halt period. However, If the price fluctuates to 20 percent, trading for the rest of the day must occur within the +/- 20% limit.\n\nCME Group’s Bitcoin Futures are currently pending regulatory approval, however, if approved, CME will be launching their futures before the end of Q4. CME’s decision to launch Bitcoin futures will most likely cause a number of big banks to keep their eye on Bitcoin. The CBOE has already discussed plans to launch a Bitcoin futures market, and Nasdaq expects to launch their Bitcoin futures market in the first half of 2018. It is likely that many institutional investors are going to be keeping an eye on CME to see how Bitcoin futures pan out."", 'An illustration of a Bitcoin sign in Hong Kong. Investors\' interest has been piqued by the cryptocurrency\'s surging value\n\nAt Melt Bakery, a hole in the wall that sells ice cream sandwiches in New York\'s upscale Manhattan neighborhood, you can pay for your guilty pleasure in bitcoin.\n\nAnd while a few swipes of a mobile app are all it takes to fill your electronic wallet, the novelty, for now, comes at a hefty cost.\n\nMelt is one of several small stores in America\'s biggest city now accepting the bitcoins, hailed by some as the future of currency.\n\nInvestors\' interest has been piqued by the virtual currency\'s surging value while industry insiders see it as an alternative instrument for consumers who want to shop online but don\'t have access to traditional instruments like a credit card.\n\nIt has even triggered an expanding ATM network that lets people turn their cash into bitcoins, and their bitcoins back into cash.\n\nAt Melt\'s checkout counter, each transaction can take several minutes to process and trigger varying fees.\n\nThat means a $5 chocolate ice cream sandwich cost $9.29 for a recent bitcoin purchase.\n\n- Gift cards -\n\nA man walking past a signboard in Tokyo informing customers that Bitcoin can be used for payment, as more and more major companies now accept virtual currency\n\nThough its presence is growing, bitcoin use is still far from widespread at the storefront level.\n\nA New York chiropractor who released a statement in 2014 announcing he would accept bitcoin payments has yet to receive any.\n\nNick Allen, head of product development at the Blockchain Technologies startup, acknowledges such use is limited.\n\n""It\'s just for promotion,"" said the 24-year-old.\n\n""Bitcoin will never be used largely in real life. Transaction fees are too high and an owner is not able to track the transactions made by its employees.""\n\nFor his part, Allen converts his entire income into the currency which he then uses to do all his shopping online, including basic groceries.\n\nHe buys store gift cards on an online platform where, he says, vendors ""want bitcoins more than they want gift cards.""\n\nIn just a few clicks, he can buy $100 worth of takeout food delivered by UberEats for just $36.\n\nBut he found himself in a bit of a bind during a recent trip to Amsterdam, where, without a credit card and just 200 euros ($238) in cash, he couldn\'t find anywhere to convert his bitcoins.\n\n- Buy tickets, sofas -\n\nMore and more major companies now accept virtual currency, including Bitcoin but also others, as a valid form of payment -- from booking a flight on Expedia to a new sofa from retailer Overstock.\n\n""We are a big believer that it is good for us,"" said Overstock\'s president Jonathan Johnson. ""It is another way for customers to spend money at our stores and it is cheaper for us because we don\'t have to pay a credit card transaction fee.""\n\nThe firm initially converted all its bitcoins into dollars, but now retains half in order to pay suppliers, and to take advantage of its surging value.\n\nA bitcoin was worth about $1,000 at the start of the year, but is now more than $10,000.\n\nAt a small grocery store in Harlem, Matthew, a former financier who now works in tech and who gave his first name only, said he bought his first bitcoins in 2016 and was now withdrawing his profits from an ATM.\n\n""Buying bitcoin at an ATM is the easiest and safest way to do it,"" he said, adding he did not entirely trust other platforms.\n\nInvestors make up 25 percent of the userbase of Coinsource, a nationwide bitcoin ATM network, according to its manager, Sheffield Clark.\n\nValue of bitcoin in 2017\n\nThe majority of users see the currency as ""a medium of exchange to buy things online,"" explains Clark, who adds that in the future, bitcoin will likely complement rather than replace real money.\n\nIt is especially useful for those who ""may not have access to a PayPal account or access to traditional financial services such as a credit card or debit card account,"" he adds.', 'Bitcoin\'s price hit a new record this week, soaring above $11,000 on Wednesday morning. The price has been a roller coaster since then, with the price briefly dropping to $9,000 later on Wednesday before regaining much of its lost value in recent days.\n\nThe currency\'s astonishing gains—it was worth less than $1 in early 2011—has caused a lot of people to wonder if they should be paying attention to the technology. Coinbase, a popular service for trading dollars and bitcoins, now says it has more than 13 million users. While almost everyone has heard of Bitcoin at this point, many people are fuzzy on the details: what is a bitcoin, exactly? How do I buy some? What would I use it for?\n\nWe\'re here to help. Read on for a beginner\'s guide to bitcoin. We\'ll explain what Bitcoin is, how it works, and what ordinary people should know about the technology.\n\n1) What\'s a Bitcoin?\n\nThe term Bitcoin actually refers to two different things. Capital-B Bitcoin is a payment network—like MasterCard is a payment network. Lower-case bitcoin refers to the currency of the Bitcoin network—much like MasterCard uses dollars in the United States.\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin different from MasterCard, PayPal, and other payment networks that existed in 2008 (when Bitcoin was invented) is that Bitcoin was the world\'s first payment network that\'s completely decentralized. The MasterCard network is operated by MasterCard Inc., but there\'s no Bitcoin Inc. in charge of the Bitcoin network. Rather, it\'s a peer-to-peer network that maintains a shared transaction ledger called the blockchain.\n\nInventing a new currency was an unavoidable consequence of making the Bitcoin network fully decentralized. On a conventional payment network, the network owner promises to redeem balances for conventional currencies like dollars or euros. But there\'s no Bitcoin company, so there\'s no one to guarantee that Bitcoin balances will have any particular value. Instead, bitcoins float against conventional currencies, with their value determined by supply and demand.\n\nAnd no, those physical ""bitcoins"" you see in a lot of pictures aren\'t what a bitcoin ""really"" looks like. Bitcoins are just entries in the Bitcoin blockchain. If you own some bitcoins, that means you have some cryptographic private keys stored on your computer, on an external drive, or printed out on a piece of paper somewhere. These keys allow people to spend bitcoin balances in much the same way that the password to your bank\'s website allows you to spend the balance in your bank account. But you can\'t withdraw bitcoins from the network the way you withdraw physical currency from your bank.\n\n2) If Bitcoins aren\'t tied to a conventional currency, how did they get so valuable?\n\nGood question! When the Bitcoin network was first created in 2009, bitcoins were barely worth anything. Bitcoin lore holds that the very first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurred in May 2010, when one early Bitcoin user paid another user 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas. At the time, Bitcoins were trading for less than a penny each.\n\nBut as the Bitcoin community grew, the currency\'s value steadily climbed. By the time I started paying attention to Bitcoin in April 2011, its value had climbed to $1. This was at the start of the first great Bitcoin bubble. Media coverage of Bitcoin attracted new users, which caused the price to rise. The rising price, in turn, attracted more media interest. The value rose to more than $30 by June, before it crashed and fell to $2 before the end of 2011.\n\nThis cycle repeated two more times in 2013. In May 2013, Bitcoin\'s price briefly rose above $250, before falling by about 80 percent. Then in late 2013, Bitcoin\'s price rose above $1,000 before once again crashing by 80 percent. The current boom—which has taken the currency from a low of $200 in early 2015 to a high above $10,000 in recent days—is the fourth major Bitcoin boom.\n\nEach of these booms—and, for that matter, most bubbles throughout history—has been driven by the same basic publicity-price feedback loop. As an Internet writer, I\'ve seen this process first hand. During times when the price is rising, there\'s a lot of traffic to be had writing about Bitcoin, so reporters like me write articles (like this one!) about it. The articles cause more people to pay attention to the currency, and some of those people decide to buy. That pushes the price up even more, triggering more media coverage and more public interest.\n\nThis bootstrapping process has achieved something that most people—including me—would have thought was impossible a decade ago: a valuable currency that\'s neither backed by a commodity like gold or silver, nor by a powerful institution like a government or bank. On one level, Bitcoin\'s value is rising simply because more and more people are betting that its value will continue to go up over time. The question, of course, is whether they\'re right about that.', 'The announcement by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) paves the way for CME and CBOE to become the first traditional U.S. regulated exchanges to launch trading in bitcoin-related financial contracts, a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency that could lead to greater regulatory scrutiny, as reported by Reuters.\n\nRead alsoBitcoin soars above $8,000 to all-time highBitcoin, which had been trading at around $10,150 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP before the news, jumped to as high as $10,513 in the 20 minutes that followed, leaving it up more than 5 percent on the day.\n\nIt has been a volatile week for the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency. On Wednesday, bitcoin smashed through $10,000 before rocketing past $11,000 less than 12 hours later to an all time-high of $11,395, and then plunging around 20 percent in the hours that followed.', 'As a wave of good sentiment washes over the perception of Bitcoin, naysayers still abound - banking establishment.\n\nThe latest ramblings from a banking head came at a conference this week in China., Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau reacted to the market volatility after Bitcoin hit the $11,000 milestone:\n\n“We need to be clear: Bitcoin is in no way a currency or even a cryptocurrency. It is a speculative asset. Its value and extreme volatility have no economic basis, and they are nobody’s responsibility. The Bank of France reminds those investing in Bitcoin that they do so entirely at their own risk.”\n\nAmerica gears up for mainstream trading\n\nWhile the Bank of France remains bullish on their stance of cryptocurrencies, America is gearing up for mainstream trading of Bitcoin this month.\n\nOn Friday, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission granted permission for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange to forge ahead with plans to launch Bitcoin Futures.\n\nAfter a week of seesawing Bitcoin prices, the market reacted positively to the news and prices stabilized, hovering around the $11,000 mark on Saturday.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether there will be an about turn in the perception of high profile banking figures towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon hit out at Bitcoin a month ago, all while the bank announced their plans to launch Bitcoin futures on the CME. Trading is expected to get underway mid-December, so we should be hearing from Dimon in the next two weeks.\n\nPwC accepts Bitcoin\n\nPriceWaterouseCoopers’ Hong Kong offices announced that they’d started receiving payments for their accountancy services in Bitcoin this week.\n\nWhat is the reason for their decision? To embrace new technology, according to their Asia-Pacific Chairperson Raymund Chao.\n\nBankers the last to change their tune?\n\nIt’s becoming increasingly clear that big banks around the world are threatened by the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Heads of the industry are constantly warning against or hitting out at the likes of Bitcoin.\n\nSome are well-informed, cautioning against un-educated trading. Others seem completely oblivious to the underpinning Blockchain technology and uses of virtual currencies.\n\nTheir reactions seem like death throes, as they fight against the coming revolution in the way we do transactions and approach the current financial system.\n\nAs more financial institutions embrace cryptocurrency, pressure will continue to mount on the banking establishment. The question is when will they start playing a different tune?', 'The Big Bang Theory attempted to tackle the increasingly hot topic of cryptocurrency last night, but while Sheldon may be a genius in the world of physics, he still has a lot to learn about Bitcoin.\n\n“The Bitcoin Entanglement” follows the gang through a well-trodden (if not internet lore-based) fable of a forgotten Bitcoin fortune. Digital currency fans initially rejoiced that mainstream viewers and people forced to watch the show in hospitals and at DMVs would be introduced to Bitcoin in primetime. (The show is averaging between 12 and 17 million viewers per episode this season.) Perhaps it would lead to market gains. And, if Big Bang Theory writer Chuck Lorre and his team felt that Bitcoin deserved 19 minutes of bazinga, perhaps it was a sign that it had already broken pop culture barriers.\n\nInstead, the episode was a lesson in “be careful what you wish for.” Over-enunciated factoids about cryptocurrencies barely covered the basics, and more often than not, lines of dialogue spread strange misinformation about Bitcoin. From a real-life nerd to a bunch of fictional ones, here are the things the show got right, and what they took severe liberties with.\n\nScreengrab via CBS\n\nHoward: “I can’t believe a single bitcoin is worth about $5000 now.”\n\nAt the time of this writing, a single bitcoin has reached $10,000 per coin. Of course, TV shows are written months in advance, so it would have been impossible for Lorre to predict the Bitcoin (BTC) rate. Luckily, the per-coin buy-in went higher—not lower. One issue with continuing this price-based line of thinking is that it perpetuates the idea that in order to be a crypto investor, you have to buy a whole coin. Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, can be purchased in pieces and parts, all the way to the eighth decimal place. The smallest unit of bitcoin, or 0.00000001 bitcoin, is called a satoshi.\n\n“It’s a new online currency that’s been created. It’s just like actual money, except you can’t see it, hold it, or spend it on anything.”\n\nSheldon’s explanation to the gang in 2010 isn’t far off, except that in 2010, Bitcoin holders could most definitely spend it on things. Outside of the dark web, a few merchants began accepting the currency, and fans of the coin (like Sheldon) would have been aware of these groundbreaking transactions. For example, a farmer in Massachusetts accepted bitcoins for alpaca socks.\n\nScreengrab via CBS\n\n“There’s a limited amount, and we find it, not by tunneling into the earth, but by using a computer to solve complex mathematical problems.”\n\nFor the uninformed, this quote from Sheldon is actually pretty accurate. BTC does have a controlled supply: Experts do not think that the number of bitcoins in existence can exceed 21 million.\n\nSheldon opts out of Bitcoin mining, because,“This may have some unprecedented tax implications. We may be on the phone with the IRS for hours.”\n\nIn 2010, it’s unlikely that early small-time miners declared capital gains of BTC. The value of Bitcoin was still being figured out, and crypto markets were in their infancy. Worse off, perpetuating the myth that the IRS calls citizens to demand payment only breathes life into recent IRS scams. FYI, phone calls from the International Revenue Service are unlikely. Sounds like something a nerd might know.\n\nScreengrab via CBS\n\nMining Bitcoin in 2010\n\nAccording to Leonard, the nerds apparently mined “a buncha” Bitcoin for a time in 2010. Bitcoin’s public blockchain ledger was started in 2009, so it’s a little bit hard to believe that the gang was already mining it the following year. But, Sheldon is a supergenius after all, and the first miners were able to use their CPUs (central processing units) on regular computers to mine coins.\n\nLeonard and Howard “write a program” to mine Bitcoin on Howard’s laptop, again very impressive. This program appears to take mere seconds to generate the coin for the boys. At the time, however, it would take most CPUs days and massive amounts of energy to slowly build amounts of coin.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nComputer programs are transferable by magic\n\nIn between shrill offstage yells from various female characters in the cast, the fellas realize that Howard’s computer keeps crashing due to the “Asian pornography” Howard has downloaded on his Dell. Leonard suggests they should use his laptop instead and plops his laptop onto Howard’s computer. You know, like nerds do. Somehow, this transfers the program and the bitcoins they are about to mine.\n\nIt’s worth noting here that private keys (long strings of random encrypted characters) are stored on hard drives and not on bitcoins. Meaning, that it would be difficult to transfer the coins via a program this easily.\n\nScreengrab via CBS\n\nSheldon steals the coins and puts them on a Flash drive\n\nOk, so let’s assume that Leonard’s computer (which he gives away to his girlfriend) lacks basic security. Let’s also assume that when Leonard gives the computer away, he does not wipe any of the data off of it. In the dark of the night, Sheldon hacks Leonard’s girlfriend’s laptop and puts the coins onto a Flash drive. It’s worth noting here that in this process, a copy of the coins would still be stored on the physical laptop. In order for the coins to not be available on the laptop, Sheldon would have had to create a new wallet saved on the Flash drive and move the coins onto that wallet, and that transaction would have been shown on the old wallet.\n\nEven more curious, why didn’t Leonard and Howard write down the encrypted keys that would allow them to restore their Bitcoin wallets when the currency was mined? Even in 2010, this was the strongest protection against hackers and lost data. When Sheldon downloads the gang’s bitcoins onto a USB stick, he would have to know these private keys. If you can get past that, even though Sheldon has a photographic memory, he doesn’t bother storing a backup of the wallet and loads it onto an easily lost Flash drive connected to his friend’s keychain. All of this seems unlikely.\n\nScreengrab via CBS\n\nWiping bitcoins into oblivion\n\nIn the episode’s finale, Stuart, the comic book store owner, finds Leonard’s Batman flash drive on the floor of his shop. Unbeknownst to Stuart, that USB contains “a buncha” Bitcoin. In real life, those bitcoins would be encrypted and would require a password to wipe the data. Stuart claims he’s going to clean the USB and sell it for $10. But without a password, even one that Sheldon created, this is far-fetched. And, even if Stuart succeeded at wiping the drive, Leonard and Howard’s bitcoins can be claimed if they can simply find their private keys.\n\nGains from this widely watched episode have yet to be seen on the markets. And overall, it’s hard to believe that a genius like Sheldon, who has apparently made strides in the field of physics, can’t find anything interesting about Bitcoin’s technology besides seeing it as a practical joke and a way to ire the IRS.', ""It's been a funny old year for Bitcoin, the digital currency - or cryptocurrency, as it's sometimes known - that uses pretty impressive encryption techniques to verify the transfer of funds.\n\n\n\nAfter lying almost worthless for years and years, it blasted through to $11,395 (£8,450) recently to hit a record high. Former JP Morgan equity strategist, Tom Lee, even claimed that Bitcoin's value will soar to $25,000 (£19,000) per unit within five years.\n\nWith all this hype there have been some haters, with some warning about its threat to financial stability and potential for criminal exploitation. But it's been very good news for Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss - yep, those ones who sued Mark Zuckerberg, claiming he stole their idea of Facebook, the ones played by Armie Hammer in The Social Network, and the ones who do all the rowing - having just become the world's first bitcoin billionaires.\n\nCredit: PA\n\n\n\nThe twins, who attended Harvard University with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, made a $11million (£8m) bet on Bitcoin over four years ago, which ballooned over 10,000 percent after last week's price surge. It's said to be the first billion-dollar return made by a cryptocurrency investor, marking a huge landmark for the controversial asset.\n\nIts recent rise has made many people very rich, even making millionaires out of some of its early backers - though Tyler and Cameron can claim that they've been made the richest, which isn't a bad brag to have to your name.\n\nHowever, the Winklevoss twins aren't the only savvy fellas to have capitalised on the rise in the value of Bitcoin. One 18-year-old-student, Erik Finman, suddenly found himself worth a massive $1m ($1.3m) thanks to the Bitcoin business, having invested in the coins that, just seven years ago, were practically not even worth the shit on your shoe.\n\nIt all began when the school drop-out (he quit when he was 15 years old) received a $1,000 (£790) gift from his grandmother, which he spent on Bitcoin. He sold that, two years later, for $100,000 (£79,000). He set up an online education company, called Botangle, in 2015 and was offered either another $100,000 or 300 bitcoins to sell the company. He chose Bitcoin, when it was worth just $200 per coin.\n\nCongrats on all being so filthy rich, guys!\n\nFeatured Image Credit: PA"", 'Adrian Kemp of HoustonKemp Economists speaks to Reuters in their office in Singapore November 24, 2017. Picture taken November 24, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su Reuters\n\nBy Jeremy Wagstaff and Byron Kaye\n\n(Reuters) - Police and security agencies have so far only taken an interest in blockchain - the distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin - for tracking criminals hiding illegal money from banks.\n\nBut that\'s changing as some civilian, police and military agencies see blockchain as a potential solution to problems they have wrestled with for years: how to secure data, but also be able to share it in a way that lets the owner keep control.\n\nAustralia, for example, has recently hired HoustonKemp, a Singapore-based consultancy, to build a blockchain-based system to record intelligence created by investigators and others, and improve the way important information is shared.\n\n""They\'ve been trying for years to come up with a centralized platform, but people are reluctant to share information,"" said Adrian Kemp, who runs the consultancy, which was awarded a A$1 million ($757,500) grant by AUSTRAC, Australia\'s financial intelligence agency, and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.\n\nBlockchain\'s appeal for data sharing is threefold.\n\nIts ledger, or database, is not controlled by any single party and is spread across multiple computers, making it hard to break. Once entered, any information cannot be altered or tampered with. And, by using so-called smart contracts, the owner of information can easily tweak who has access to what.\n\nIt\'s a sign of how far blockchain technology has come within a decade since the publication of a pseudonymous paper describing bitcoin and the blockchain ledger that would record transactions in it.\n\nBitcoin has since become the preferred currency not only of libertarians and speculators, but also of criminal hackers. The bitcoin price is volatile, and hit record peaks late last month.\n\nGovernments are already exploring ways to store some data, such as land records, contracts and assets, in blockchains, and the financial industry, too, has experimented with blockchain technologies to streamline transactions and back-office systems, though with limited success.\n\nSECURING SHARED DATA\n\nThe closest most law enforcement agencies have come to the blockchain has been working with start-up firms to analyze it for evidence of criminal deals.\n\nBut in the past year or so that attitude has begun to change.\n\nThe United States Air Force (USAF) has funded research into how blockchain could ensure its data isn\'t changed. In May, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded a grant to the company behind an encrypted chat program to make a secure messaging service based on the blockchain.\n\nAmendments to a recent U.S. Senate defense bill require the government to report back on ""the potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies"" and how foreign governments, extremists and criminals might be using them.\n\nBritain, too, is exploring several uses of the blockchain, say consultants and companies working for several departments.\n\nCambridge Consultants, a UK-based consultancy, said it had worked with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, a UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) agency, on using a blockchain to improve the trustworthiness of a network of sensors on, for example, security cameras.\n\nThe UK\'s justice ministry is looking at proving that evidence - video, emails, documents - hasn\'t been tampered with by registering it all on a blockchain, according to a blog post on its website.\n\nMarcus Ralphs, a former soldier and now CEO of ByzGen Ltd, which makes blockchains for the security sector, said he was working on projects with the MoD using blockchain to track the status and level of individuals\' security clearance. Other work included helping the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) improve the way work permits are issued and records stored.\n\n""PASSING THE BUCK""\n\nThese are early days.\n\nKemp says there\'s no guarantee his project will be deployed more widely. And some who have worked with AUSTRAC are skeptical, saying such projects have more to do with agencies turning to the private sector because they\'re running low on resources and ideas.\n\n""The government is just looking to pass the buck on to private industry,"" said Simon Smith, a cyber private investigator who has worked on cases involving AUSTRAC.\n\nMany police forces and armies aren\'t ready for the technological and mental leap necessary.\n\nThe Police Foundation, a UK think-tank focusing on policing and crime, is pushing British police to explore the blockchain, but its director, Rick Muir, said ""we are still at the stage of \'what is blockchain?\'.""\n\nNeil Barnas, a USAF major who last year wrote a thesis on the potential of blockchain in defense, said U.S. military and security agencies were slowly waking up.\n\nThe problem, he says, is that military minds are more inclined towards centralized systems than the decentralized ones that blockchain\'s distributed ledger embraces.\n\nThat said, blockchain\'s association with the criminal underworld has not dented its appeal to those who see its potential, said ByzGen\'s Ralphs.\n\n""The negative narrative around it has not at all watered down or diluted interest of the people we\'ve been engaging with,"" he said.\n\n($1 = 1.3201 Australian dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Jeremy Wagstaff and Byron Kaye; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)', '', 'Legendary billionaire hedge fund investor Mike Novogratz stated that there may be a bubble in bitcoin in certain regions but the cryptocurrency itself isn’t a bubble.\n\nAs CCN previously reported, Novogratz noted that bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market could become the biggest bubble “of our lifetimes.”\n\n“I think this [crypto] is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes by a long shot. To be fair, this is a bubble and there’s a lot of fraud mixed in. We look at tons of projects. And some get funded, and they literally look like Ponzis,” said Novogratz.\n\nNovogratz further emphasized that there were many bubbles in the past around innovative and revolutionary technologies such as the Internet. The dotcom bubble for instance overvalued projects by significant margins, with several companies selling at billions of dollars by owning a domain or an online business.\n\nBut, the Internet itself was evidently not a bubble. It has transformed every industry in the world by revolutionizing communication and processing of information. There was a bubble around Internet, as demonstrated by the dotcom era, however the technology itself was not a bubble, a fraud, or a scam.\n\nThe dotcom era surrounding the Internet technology is similar to non substantial and scam-like projects surrounding bitcoin and the global cryptocurrency market. There exists many fraudulent companies within the cryptocurrency market and projects that operate like ponzi schemes structurally, but there are also a few projects that genuinely compliment bitcoin by providing technologies or solutions the Bitcoin blockchain network currently lacks, like Ethereum.\n\n“Historically, manias or bubbles happen around things that fundamentally change the way we live. If it’s the railroad bubble or the Internet bubble, it really changed the way we live,” said Novogratz.\n\nFurthermore, as Citigroup’s recent research revealed, if some analysts decide to describe bitcoin itself as a bubble, virtually every technology, company, and asset tha demonstrate significant gains are also bubbles. Throughout the past two decades, analysts claimed Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, UK properties, second hand cars, and other forms of investments are “bubbles.”\n\nThe Citigroup research paper emphasized that if bitcoin is considered a bubble, everything else is a bubble as well.\n\nIn regions like South Korea, the third largest bitcoin market behind the US and Japan, a short-term bubble has formed because of the tendency of the country’s traditional finance market to invest in any popular asset which rises in value at an exponential rate. Korbit founder and CEO Tony Lyu said in an interview with Nathaniel Poppers that South Korean investors tend to “join the party” once others are invested.\n\nOver the past few weeks, kids and teenagers in the South Korean bitcoin market have purchased the cryptocurrency with the funds of their parents without their authorization and ultimately suffered major losses as the price of bitcoin corrected.\n\nMiddle-aged and old investors who have no underlying knowledge in cryptocurrencies and bitcoin have started to invest in bitcoin out of pure speculation, without any regards to the future growth trend of bitcoin and its use case.\n\nIn the mid to long-term, these short-term buys and small bubbles will dissipate, through price corrections. If bitcoin itself is a bubble, it should not be able to withstand major corrections that occur at least two times on a monthly basis, as investors and the market fail to adapt to the increasing value of bitcoin. Bitcoin has suffered many corrections throughout its nine-year history and through that, it is rapidly evolving into a more mature and liquid store of value.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:']"
12/03/2017,"['Bitcoin continues one of the most dramatic price runups of any asset in living memory, posting prices above $11,800 this morning after starting the year below $1,000 per digital token. In its early years, skeptics with little knowledge of blockchain technology were quick to dismiss Bitcoin as a fleeting trend. But as knowledge spreads and prices chase new highs, the skeptics have become more nuanced – and even if you love Bitcoin, they’re often worth listening to.\n\nHere are a few of the most notable bear sentiments being aired as Bitcoin’s rip-roaring rampage continues.\n\nBlockchain without Bitcoin?\n\nAt last week’s Consensus: Invest conference in Manhattan, some of the greatest minds in asset management came together to talk cryptocurrency. On a “Bulls and Bears” panel, Raoul Pal of the Real Vision financial news network repeated a favorite saw of today’s more informed bears – that while blockchain database security is a revolutionary technology, those blockchains will ultimately be privately managed by enterprises. That would eventually drive the value of public blockchains like Bitcoin to zero.\n\nBut the idea of a private blockchain at least partly misunderstands the core security premise of the technology. Cryptocurrency payouts attract a decentralized swarm of hosts who ensure the honesty of a shared ledger, without necessarily having a stake in its contents. Andreas Antonopoulos, long one of the smartest commentators in the space, has dismissed private blockchains as a fundamentally inefficient replacement for an old-fashioned database. Once real-world blockchain applications are up and running, most will likely be hosted on one of the trusted public blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nWhat the Fork\n\nNot exactly a bear, Mike Novogratz has said that cryptocurrency is in a bubble, even while also starting a large fund specifically to invest in it. Novogratz has made a point that is far too rare in this realm – that not all cryptocurrencies are created equal, and not all of them will win. As an example, Novogratz has said he believes Litecoin, the 6th largest cryptocurrency, “doesn’t add enough new stuff to replace Bitcoin.”\n\nThe specific point is highly debatable – Litecoin has recently proven it can innovate and improve faster than Bitcoin. But the broader point is solid, particularly when it comes to recent “forks,” in which server operators split from an existing cryptocurrency and create copies of its code and assets. Forking spreads network resources thinner and thinner, and over time, if they don’t prove that they offer competitive innovations, forks like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Ethereum Classic will crash.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nNo Underlying Value\n\nJack Bogle, Vanguard founder and father of the index fund, was a maverick in his day, so you might think he’d have a kind word for Bitcoin’s innovation. But you’d be wrong.\n\nLast Tuesday at a Council on Foreign Relations event, Bogle advised listeners to “avoid Bitcoin like the plague,” and went on to lay out a common sentiment among crypto-skeptics.\n\n“There is nothing to support Bitcoin except the hope that you will sell it to someone for more than you paid for it.”\n\nWith all due respect to a titan, Bogle is fundamentally wrong, and this line of criticism should have been buried years ago. Cryptocurrency prices certainly have little relationship to underlying value right now, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing there at all. Cryptocurrency networks include vast amounts of bleeding-edge hardware, and they’re being managed by thousands of highly trained engineers and business developers. Bitcoin has the potential to grow into something of obviously huge value – a truly unhackable and totally open global financial network.\n\nIf Bitcoin were a public corporation instead of a decentralized swarm, it would probably have some extremely aggressive short-sellers right now (actually, the fact that it’s hard to short cryptocurrency is a good reason to be wary of it). But noone would say its assets had no value.\n\nA Tool for Criminals\n\nOne of the perennial critiques of cryptocurrency was reiterated this week by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who has bigger things on his mind than a bubble – he thinks Bitcoin is morally dubious, and bad for global governance and the macroeconomy.\n\n“Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention [and] lack of oversight,” he told Bloomberg last week, “So it seems to me it ought to be outlawed, it doesn’t serve any useful social function.”\n\nStiglitz is right that much of Bitcoin’s early momentum was based on either lawbreaking or capital flight, and the scale of its ongoing use for tax evasion is likely massive. He’s also right that it isn’t currently useful for its core purpose – payments – thanks to network congestion, high fees, and extreme volatility.\n\nBut the long-term above-board applications for totally unhackable, distributed ledgers are still waiting in the wings: cryptocurrency could eventually run everything from cloud computing to ride-hailing to health records. And Stiglitz misses a crucial point – it would be very, very hard to regulate cryptocurrency out of existence. Its servers can be moved to any friendly jurisdiction (much like old-fashioned offshore tax shelters), and its traffic signature can be easily disguised.\n\nThat’s not a moral defense, but it’s a fact. Regulatory pressure in jurisdictions like the United States and Europe could absolutely keep away institutional investors and even hedge funds, whose future entry to the market is increasingly priced into the current crypto-surge. But its shady underbelly nearly guarantees that cryptocurrency as a whole will never drop to zero value.', 'CME Group, the $51 billion US-based financial institution and the world’s largest options exchange, is set to finalize the integration of its bitcoin futures exchange by December 17, and open bitcoin futures for trading by December 18.\n\nCME Receives Approval From CFTC\n\nIn an official announcement, Terry Duffy, CME Group Chairman and CEO, revealed the company has received the approval from the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to list bitcoin futures and provide infrastructure around bitcoin options, derivatives, and futures contracts.\n\nIn the first few weeks of operation, traders on CME’s bitcoin futures exchange will be limited to initiating trades with an initial margin of 35 percent. Various risk management tools have been implemented onto CME’s bitcoin futures trading platform, given that it is a strictly regulated exchange overseen by the CFTC.\n\nDuffy stated:\n\n“Though we have worked through a lengthy, comprehensive process with the CFTC to get to this point, we recognize bitcoin is a new, uncharted market that will continue to evolve, requiring continued collaboration with the Commission and our clients going forward. At launch, our new Bitcoin futures contract will be subject to a variety of risk management tools, including an initial margin of 35 percent, position and intraday price limits, and a number of other risk and credit controls that CME Group offers on all of its products.”\n\nThe CME bitcoin futures platform rely on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) to obtain the global average price of bitcoin based on Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. These four cryptocurrency exchanges are well-regulated within the US and Europe, and are fully compliant with the regulatory frameworks established by respective governments within the two regions.\n\nCME’s Impact on Bitcoin’s Mid-Term Growth\n\nOn November 14, CCN reported that the UK-based $100 billion hedge fund Man Group has announced its official plans to invest in bitcoin and commit to the bitcoin market upon the completion of CME’s bitcoin futures exchange launch.\n\nMan Group CEO Luke Ellis told Reuters:\n\n“Conceptually digital currencies are an interesting thing. It’s not part of our investment universe today – it could be. If there is a CME future on bitcoin, it would be.”\n\nLarge-scale hedge funds with a market valuation of over $10 billion typically have a minimum investment threshold in the range of $300 to $500 million. Hence, if large-scale hedge funds like Man Group invest in the bitcoin market, tens of billions of dollars in institutional money will flow into bitcoin, increasing liquidity of the digital currency.\n\nEllis and executives of other major hedge funds such as Fidelity Investments, a US-based investment firm with $3.23 trillion assets under management, have expressed optimism in regards to the decentralized structure of bitcoin and its transparent nature which enables it to operate as a robust store of value and a fair monetary system.\n\n“There is a big difference between a digital currency and a traditional currency…Traditional ones are supported by governments who have armies and tax men that can make people follow their rules, and digital ones don‘t. But that doesn’t invalidate digital currencies at all,” said Ellis.\n\nAs large sums of institutional money flow into the bitcoin market and companies within the traditional finance sector continues to adopt bitcoin, in the mid to long-term, the mainstream adoption of bitcoin will inevitably surge at an exponential rate.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement:', 'The twin brothers who sued Mark Zuckerberg, claiming he stole the concept for Facebook are now billionaires after investing their lawsuit settlement in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency surpassed a record high of $11,700 on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss bought 1 percent of all currently mined bitcoin for a price of $11 million in 2013. Since then, the $11 million crypto-bet has ballooned by almost 10,000 percent, making the twins the first bitcoin billionaires.\n\nRead more\n\nThe brothers first gained notoriety in 2006 after launching legal proceedings against Mark Zuckerberg, claiming the Facebook founder was a phony who stole their idea for the now-ubiquitous social media platform. In 2009, the Winklevoss twins received a settlement from Facebook valued at more than $65 million.\n\nThe twins used part of their settlement money to invest heavily in bitcoin. In October 2015, the brothers launched Gemini, a bitcoin exchange described by the Financial Times as “one of the first regulated and licensed digital currency exchanges in the developed world.”\n\n“We wanted to build an exchange that was similar to Nasdaq or NYSE for digital currency,” Tyler told the FT in an interview. “We wanted something that both Wall Street and Main Street felt comfortable with.”\n\nThe twins describe bitcoin as “better than gold.” The cryptocurrency, which was introduced in 2009 as an alternative to government-controlled fiat, has enjoyed a meteoric rise in value over the last year.\n\nNow up more than 12-fold for the year, one bitcoin was selling at below $1,000 on January 1. It remains to be seen whether Mark Zuckerberg will claim credit for the twins’ wise investment.', 'The problem with writing about Bitcoin is that the subject has become so emotional. The very name inspires triumph, greed, resentment, or fury. Triumph from those handful of hodlers (yes, really) who are watching the destiny they long foretold actually come true before their eyes. Greed from those hundreds of thousands of newbies who just bought in. Those two groups are, of course, bitcoin believers.\n\nResentment from those who wish they were hodlers, or who had what would be millions of dollars’ worth today pass through their hands back in the early days. (As someone enmeshed in the outskirts of the San Francisco hacker scene I know more than a few of those.) And fury from those for whom Bitcoin represents tech bros busy fiddling with some kind of bullshit libertarian Internet money while all around us Rome is burning:\n\nFuck your block chain\n\nFuck your crypto currency\n\nFuck your imaginary techno utopia built out of my burning worldhttps://t.co/bzR7lMcP78 — Molly Sauter (@OddLetters) November 2, 2017\n\nThose people are, to understate, bitcoin skeptics. But wait, it gets worse! Bitcoin doesn’t just inspire strong emotions, it also seems to attract vast hordes of EDPs. (Emotionally Disturbed Persons; a term of art among the NYPD, according to an ex-cop friend.) The bad faith, and (generally correct) assumption of bad faith, among bitcoin conversationalists on Reddit is really something even for Reddit. Even many of the cryptorati are, shall we say, not always exactly redolent of good faith.\n\nBut let’s at least try to take a step back from the emotional minefield of day-to-day valuations, and difficult personalities, and take a long-view look at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Even their most vicious critic would have to admit that they have had a truly extraordinary run over the last eight years. A good question to ask is: where will Bitcoin be a decade from now?\n\nThe usual answers are “worth trillions, taking over the world’s entire financial system”; “a disused, half-forgotten, especially wasteful fad, the Pet Rock meets Ponzi scheme of the twenty-teens”; “banned, illegal, used only by criminals and in rogue nations, hence mostly worthless”; and “basically entirely replaced by some better, more efficient, 2.0 cryptocurrency.”\n\nSo let’s ask a few more interesting questions:\n\nIs permissionless programmable money a fad which will go away? I really don’t think so. Programmable money is too useful for people to give up on entirely, and permissionless money would now be very, very difficult to ban. (Transactions can be fully anonymous, and while you could ban exchanges, exchanges are not actually necessary any more.) It might possibly settle into a relatively minor niche, but it’s not going away.\n\nIs Bitcoin going to become the dominant global currency for daily transactions? I really, really don’t think that’s going to happen either, for numerous reasons, some of which I can’t believe I actually have to spell out to Bitcoin true believers, such as: Bitcoin is deflationary and a little inflation is actually not a bad thing; fiat may technically be a four-letter word but only libertarians think it’s an obscenity, and fiat currencies are not “backed by nothing,” they’re backed by the strength of the economies they denominate; governments are extremely powerful entities who get to dictate much of the future within their borders; most people don’t actually want to use Bitcoin, and there’s no real reason for them to start; credit and cryptocurrencies are, as noted bear and former blockchain COO Preston Byrne points out, currently a very bad and dangerous combination, and will never be the best of bedfellows; etc etc etc.\n\nWill financial institutions make more and more use of blockchains and programmable money? Well, yeah. To pick a single very simple example: a credit card transaction involves five different parties, most of whom maintain their own separate copy of the transaction in their own database; it would be more efficient in many ways to use a shared database; a blockchain is actually quite a good type of shared database to use for this kind of transactional behavior; blockchain technology is now widely available.\n\nWill financial institutions around the world wind up using Bitcoin as the global settlement currency? Almost certainly not. Why would they? The big selling point of Bitcoin compared to another distributed system is that it’s permissionless. Major financial institutions are quite comfortable with requiring permission; in fact they very much prefer it. (This is why the “intranet vs. Internet” analogy does not apply, unless Bitcoin becomes everyone’s day-to-day currency, which, again, nuh-uh.)\n\nWill Bitcoin be replaced by a better cryptocurrency? This, if you ask me, is the most interesting question here, the one whose answer is not obvious. What Bitcoin has introduced to the world is, essentially, digital scarcity — but you’ll notice that there are a whole lot of blockchains and cryptocurrencies out there now … in short, ironically, we are seeing something of a glut of scarcity. Other chains can do things which Bitcoin can’t; ZCash’s powerful cryptographic anonymity, Ethereum’s Turing-complete scripting language. More chains are coming online every month. Is it really so unlikely that Bitcoin will be supplanted?\n\n…Actually, yes, is my answer, but with a caveat.\n\nFirst, Bitcoin is a complete, complex, highly engineered cryptographic, economic, and software system and network, now thoroughly battle- and time-tested, with enormous mindshare and a thriving ecosystem. Betting on some new idea with a whitepaper is a bit like deciding that a dude folding paper airplanes for kids will one day beat Boeing; maybe, but awfully unlikely. Second, thanks to the immense — horrifyingly immense — number of watts poured into it by miners every hour, it is, by far, the scarcest of all our digital scarcities.\n\nThat second point is a little wobbly, though. First, Bitcoin’s power consumption is a big and growing problem, and any true believer who pretends it isn’t is delusional. Yes, the estimate that made the rounds recently is probably wildly off, but as its valuation grows, its power consumption will grow too, as miners are more and more incentivized. This is very bad PR, and new initiatives like the Lightning Network won’t help (though the halving of block rewards will.) Second, even if Bitcoin succeeds, as Rusty Russell points out, people will want to change it e.g. to add a little inflation to its limit of 21 million coins, and I think it’s much more likely that they’ll succeed than he does.\n\nOn the gripping hand, though, if Ethereum’s mooted move to Proof-of-Stake (which essentially replaces the cryptographic number-crunching those miners perform with game theory) proves that PoS actually works, or if Bram Cohen’s Chia takes off … well, then I can certainly imagine a future in which Bitcoin’s pre-eminence is threatened. (I don’t usually write about vaporware but Cohen’s previous paper airplane was responsible for about a quarter of all Internet traffic for a decade, so I’m willing to make an exception here.)\n\nSo what are we left with? Permissionless cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin will possibly-to-likely remain the most prominent, aren’t going away, but will be used in limited albeit significant circumstances: as digital gold; as an international transfer currency for individuals and small businesses; to skirt and avoid the law and the taxman; but not really on an everyday basis, except in nations whose own currencies have been seriously debased. Does that mean its current valuation is justified in the long term? I can give you a very firm answer for that: ¯\\_(?)_/¯.\n\nDisclosure, since it seems requisite: I mostly avoid any financial interest, implicit or explicit, long or short, in any cryptocurrency, so that I can write about them sans bias. I do own precisely one bitcoin, though, which I purchased a couple of years ago because I felt silly not owning any while I was advising a (since defunct) Bitcoin-based company. Furthermore I am the CTO of the consultancy HappyFunCorp, and we are building a nonzero number of blockchain projects, so I suppose there’s some implicit indirect interest there, if you squint.', 'Bitcoin’s extraordinary price surge means its market capitalization now exceeds the annual output of whole economies, and the estimated worth of some of the world’s top billionaires.\n\nWith the debate over its bubble status still raging, the flagship cryptocurrency continued its march higher on Monday, solidifying above $11,000 and bringing its climb this year to more than 1,000 percent. With market tracker Coinmarketcap.com putting the total value of all bitcoins in circulation at $190 billion, it’s come a long way from August, when one coin could buy you a hefty supply of avocados.\n\nHere are five things that have been eclipsed by bitcoin in terms of market capitalization:\n\nNew Zealand’s GDP\n\nThe South Pacific nation’s farm-and-tourism-led economy is valued at $185 billion, according to World Bank data as of July, putting it some $5 billion below bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s market cap is also bigger than the likes of Qatar, Kuwait and Hungary.\n\nGoldman Sachs, and UBS\n\nBitcoin’s run-up has even seen it valued more highly than two of the world’s most influential banks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s market cap was $97 billion as of Friday, while Zurich-based UBS Group AG came in at about $67 billion. Add those numbers together and it still falls short of bitcoin.\n\nLloyd Blankfein Photograph: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg\n\nBoth financial heavyweights have taken a hands-off approach to the digital currency, with Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein saying it’s too early to draft a bitcoin strategy and UBS -- the world’s biggest wealth manager -- saying it won’t allocate it in portfolios because of the threat of a government crackdown.\n\nBoeing\n\nIt may make jumbo jets but Boeing Co.’s market cap of $162 billion is also less than that of a digital currency that didn’t exist 10 years ago. The Chicago-based company, which describes itself as the world’s largest aerospace firm, is more than a century old and employs 140,000 people in more than 65 countries, according to its website. Rival Airbus SE fares no better -- it’s got a market value of 66 billion euros ($78 billion).\n\nFourteen Aircraft Carriers\n\nIf bitcoin’s market cap could be used to buy military equipment, it would pack a mighty punch. The USS Gerald R. Ford, the first of a new class of nuclear-powered supercarriers, was delivered to the U.S. Navy in May. It cost an estimated $13 billion, so if investors put all their bitcoins together they would be able to buy a fleet of fourteen ships.\n\nThe USS Gerald R. Ford. Photographer: Ridge Leoni/U.S. Navy via Getty Images\n\nBill Gates, Buffett and the Queen\n\nThey sit atop Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, but even if Bill Gates and Warren Buffett pooled their fortunes they wouldn’t have enough to buy all the bitcoins in circulation. Gates is worth $90 billion and Buffett has $83 billion, according to the index. Not even Queen Elizabeth II could get them over the line if she brought her $383 million to the table. While we don’t know what he told Katy Perry, Buffett has called bitcoin a “real bubble” in the past.', 'Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has issued a warning on the high risks of investing in Bitcoin. He claimed that Bitcoin is a “speculative” asset and is neither a currency nor a digital currency.\n\nSpeaking at an event in China, Villeroy said that Bitcoin’s value and extreme volatility have no economic basis and those who invest in it do so entirely at their own risks.\n\n""Its value and extreme volatility have no economic basis, and they are nobody\'s responsibility. The central bank warned that those buying Bitcoin ""do so entirely at their own risk.""\n\nOther warnings over Bitcoin\n\nDe Galhau’s pronouncement reflected that of European Central Bank vice president Vitor Constancio, who earlier said that the investors who purchase Bitcoin at its current staggering prices are putting their money at a very high risk.\n\n""Investors are taking that risk of buying at such high prices.""\n\nSeveral well-known personalities in the world of finance have also issued their warnings due to the continuous upward trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. Among them is billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who claimed that Bitcoin is a bubble and that he does not know why it is very popular.', 'The same talk of Bitcoin being in a bubble has been dogging it since late 2013, and many time before and after that. The talk remains today as Bitcoin continues to smash barrier leaving the pessimists asking: ‘When will we hear the pop?’\n\nYet, Bubble or not, Bitcoin seems unperturbed about the negative press, only focusing on the huge adoption and the increase in promising market conditions. It is, however, even on the upswings, a scary ride.\n\nIt is probably prudent to understand what would happen if there was a catastrophic failure and the Bitcoin market did pop like all the others it has been compared to.\n\nRisk to the global economy\n\nThe obvious starting point would be to discuss what would happen to all those who invested loads of money into Bitcoin if it collapsed. That is simple though, they would lose money. It is more interesting to examine the effect on the global economy of this revolutionary monetary system.\n\nIn all honesty, if Bitcoin was wiped from the face of the earth, the global economy would barely even know it had gone. Bitcoin is minuscule in comparison to some of the other big market players out there. The residential real estate market is over 500 times bigger than the Bitcoin one.\n\nComparing the cryptocurrency market cap and the money involved - just over $350 bln - to the money that was in the dotcom bubble, it is nearly negligible.\n\nAdrian Lee, a senior lecturer in finance at the University of Technology in Sydney, explains in an Australian example:\n\n""So, it wouldn\'t affect the Australian dollar I\'d say because nobody really uses it at the moment. If you think about it, there\'s trillions of trading in the Australian dollar whereas Bitcoin is at most worth $200 bln at total, so it\'s hardly anything compared to the trillions in foreign exchange.”\n\nAdditionally, lessons seemed to have been learned in the property market bust of 2008, or it may be that Bitcoin is a different asset, but it is unlikely that there is much borrowing going on to buy Bitcoin.\n\nRMIT Professor of Economics Jason Potts adds:\n\n""There\'s very little evidence of anyone borrowing money to buy cryptocurrency and if I was a bank or a lender, there\'s no way I would loan out money to do that.""\n\nCould it be the spark?\n\nBitcoin’s bigger scope of effect, even for the naysayers, is not that grand. Many are calling Bitcoin a bubble because of its size, and the speed of its adoption. But as expressed earlier, Bitcoin is tint, and it is still in the early adoption phase.\n\nPotts goes on the explain why Bitcoin collapsing would not even scratch any of the global markets or lead to a bleed which would have damaging repercussions. At the same time, he is essentially confirming Bitcoin is too small, and too young, to be a bubble.\n\nPotts uses the analogy of Bitcoin being like email in 1994, indicating its early adoption phase, he then goes on to explain: ""The sort of people who would hold superannuation funds … they\'re not in this market and might not be for some time,"" he said.\n\nThat would limit the fallout to the wider economy in a worst-case scenario. ""If it crashed, it would only largely be those people who speculate on it, maybe people who use Bitcoin and maybe the exchanges may lose money. But then again the exchanges don\'t require much overhead to run it, so if it fell they\'d still be Okay,"" Mr. Lee chimed in.\n\nBubbles are for big boys\n\nThus, it seems clear that because Bitcoin collapsing cannot have any effect on the global market, it is too small to even collapse. The effect of Bitcoin’s demise would only affect those who have sunk money into it - a bit like a business venture. But when a business venture fails, it is not seen as a bubble, pop; it is something different.\n\nPerhaps the talk of bubbles needs to be left for now, while Bitcoin tries to catch up to markets that have, and can, pop, like the real estate market. That is not to say Bitcoin can’t collapse - but can it pop, not likely.', 'Markets and Prices\n\nThe price of bitcoin is once again breaking new all-time highs on Sunday, December 3, 2017. The decentralized currency has rebounded considerably as markets touched an average of US$11,800 after it dipped below the $10K region just five days ago.\n\nSee also: How to Buy Bitcoin When You’re Underage\n\nBitcoin’s Market Cap Is Steadily Approaching $200Bn\n\nThe bitcoin price train is moving northbound again, testing uncharted territories. Global trade volume has been high at roughly $5-7Bn traded every 24-hours for the past few days. At the moment one bitcoin is trading between $11,550-11,650 per BTC, and markets are up over 5 percent since yesterday. The top five currencies swapping the most BTC worldwide include JPY, USD, KRW, EUR, and USDT (Tether). Today’s trade volume is around $5.3Bn with Bitfinex, Bithumb, Hitbtc, GDAX, and Bitflyer capturing a vast majority of that share. Cryptocurrency proponents seem fairly optimistic right now as bitcoin has also helped push up the price of the top 14 digital assets, according to data website Coinmarketcap.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nLooking at both the weekly and daily charts clearly indicates buyers are currently commanding the market action right now. Order books show two pretty sizable sell walls at $12K and $12250, so watch for resistance and sell-off around those price regions. Today the Simple Moving Averages (SMA) have a pretty extensive gap after crossing paths on December 2. Now the short term 100 SMA is well above the long-term 200 trendline which indicates the path of resistance is still on the upside.\n\nCurrently, RSI levels and Stochastic have started moving back north after showing signs of an oversold market and buyer exhaustion yesterday. If bearish sentiment sets in, order books show some strong foundations between $11,000-11,250 range. If the $11K region is broken, further sell-off could bring the price significantly lower into the $10500-10800 areas. If bulls manage to keep the pressure going, they have to surpass the resistance above and just below $12K, and it looks like they are attempting to tackle these zones soon.\n\nCryptocurrency Community Sentiment: Optimistic\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts are thrilled about the price, and there are a few reasons why we might be seeing more demand this week. First off, bitcoin had crossed the $10K and $11K territories a few times this week for the first time. As soon as the currency hit these price milestones, mainstream media pushed out headline after headline with stories about bitcoin’s phenomenal rise. More so than ever before the mainstream masses are hearing about bitcoin from the likes of the of the Wall Street Journal’s front page or hearing about it on the #1 sitcom in the world The Big Bang Theory this past Thursday. In addition to this, bitcoiners got some more good news after BTC dipped down to $9,200 region. This is because both CME Group and Cboe announced the dates of their new bitcoin-based futures products. Bitcoin proponents and traders believe the price could go even higher when these derivative markets open, but some skeptics fear Wall Street players could manipulate the price.\n\nDigital Asset Markets, In General, Get Some Green Light Action\n\nAs we mentioned above the top fourteen highest cryptocurrency market cap coins are all in green. The total market cap of all the digital assets in existence is over $350Bn at the moment. Ethereum (ETH) markets are up 3.3 percent as one ETH is averaging around $480. The third highest market cap held by bitcoin cash (BCH) is up 12.2 percent right now with BCH prices hovering around $1,610 per token. Ripple (XRP) is also doing pretty well as markets have increased by 2.4 percent as XRP is around $0.26 at the time of writing. The number five position has been claimed by dash as the decentralized currency has performed phenomenally over the past two weeks. Dash is only up 1.7 percent at the moment but is currently averaging around $800 per token.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nMarkets are going wild right now, and it’s kinda tricky to watch some of the charts as order books are moving at a mile a minute. It’s safe to say that traders expect BTC to touch the $12K zone, but some spectators also believe a correction is overdue. The correction five days ago was deep, but some are expecting a bigger turnover on the next dip. For now, bulls have the market reigns, but the price may consolidate around the $11,200-11,400 range over the short term.\n\nBear Scenario: If bitcoin meets resistance and buyers get exhausted a drop below $11K could easily happen. Buy walls around the $11K through $11,200 regions are there but are small compared to lower foundations. If bears manage to push the price back down into the $10K price territory, we could see values between $10,500-10,800 and possibly lower.\n\nBull Scenario: Bulls have some work to do if they want to break the $12K region but that target is in sight. If buyers can keep the steam going and manage to crack the $12,000-12,250 zones, then some smooth sailing will take the price even higher. Fibonacci retracement at 61.8 percent shows prices could realize $12,700 if bulls can breach key resistance.\n\nWhere do you see the price of bitcoin heading from here?

Check our widget services.', 'Bitcoin is a bubble: it is the most popular expression about the cryptocurrency we have heard during last months. Every day we hear thoughts of the greatest financial magnates warning that the crypto mania is a classic example of a bubble which will burst soon.\n\nOk, let\'s assume it is just a bubble, but don\'t forget that it is not the only one. In our everyday life, we live in bubbles, many ideas and beliefs surrounding us are created artificially. Even the financial markets are heavily dependent on bubbles, where not the fundamentals decide the asset prices but the expectations and investors\' imaginations do.\n\nFirst of all, let\'s define what ""bubble"" means. In the financial world, we consider an asset is in a bubble if the people buy the asset just because they think the prices will go up and they will benefit from it, and therefore prices skyrocket making new unjustified highs.\n\nAnd here the tools of financial analysis are losing their position to the crowd\'s psychology. The only force moving the market is the public opinion about the asset. In this environment, it is quite silly to judge the market by financial understandings. In this market, we will see neither fundamentals moving the asset price nor the technical tools reversing the chart and so on.\n\nWe need to realize that not only financial knowledge is important to assess the market, but also we need to develop an understanding of bubble trading. It looks like a flying balloon which is going up until the winds don\'t disturb its way, or the storm hasn\'t burst it down. Since the weather is wonderful, we can be completely calm about the near future of the bubble. This approach would direct us to make our decisions based on psychology, not on financial analysis.\n\nWhen we think so, the puzzle starts to solve itself, and the prediction of future is going to be easier. Thus let\'s invent tools which would help us to understand the crowd\'s sentiment.\n\nThe crowd is bullish on all most popular cryptocurrencies. So we need to pay attention to those which attracts the most interest to predict the biggest gainers.\n\nFor my research, I will take the Top 10 of cryptocurrencies by their market capitalizations. The market capitalization is the most common measure to determine the total size of an asset, therefore it would be very beneficial to use it in any ratio.\n\nTotal monthly volume to the total market cap would be a very nice ratio to understand where the most money is circulating compared to their real sizes. It is a way to estimate which asset is the most attractive among the investors compared to their sizes. In this way, I am trying to introduce a new metric which would measure the percentage of interest in the asset.\n\nSo, for better understanding, let\'s illustrate two equal assets, whose prices are moving based on investors\' belief that they would go up. In a calm market environment, what we need the most is a measure of belief among the investors to predict which asset would move faster and would exceed its competitor. For that reason, I am suggesting to look at the volume, which is illustrating the size of the involvement of the crowd in the asset. On the other hand, when our assets are not equal and have a different portion of the market, we need a new metric which would show us the involvement of the interest compared to the real size of the asset.\n\nFrom this point, Bitcoin Gold is the most active, which means the asset has the most interest among traders and the price doesn\'t stand exactly where it must be. Last month total volume of transactions was 2.5 times bigger than the market cap of the currency, which is why we were witnesses of big volatility. In a month, Bitcoin Gold has more than a 360% surge. The move was mainly contributed by the news that the Bitcoin split is delaying. However, Bitcoin Gold has attracted the crowd as a nice alternative for Bitcoin, and last month\'s actions suggested traders that Bitcoin Gold can stand as a safe haven for Bitcoin.\n\nSource\n\nBitcoin\'s last month total volume was 1.35 times bigger than the market cap, which is not an impressive result among its rivals. When we look at the aforementioned chart, we notice that the average monthly volume to market cap ratio is 136%; that means Bitcoin has average interest among traders and is not the most attractive at all. The biggest cryptocurrency makes new surprises hitting new record highs; however, it is obvious that Bitcoin is moving slower than its main rivals.\n\nIn other words, cryptocurrencies\' party has just begun, and we must participate in it for not to be late. The financial behemoths are just starting to be involved in this market, which means great liquidity and less volatility. They will increase the power of the financial analysis tools in the show, but until they are not present completely, we need to find alternative options.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.', '""Why did the market go up today?""\n\n""There must have been more buyers than sellers.""\n\nThat piece of circular logic is a sort of laconic joke among traders, equivalent to saying: ""I have no idea."" Naturally, prices will only rise if the enthusiasm of buyers outweighs the fear of sellers.\n\nAt the same time, it captures a worthwhile nugget of wisdom about where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will head now they\'ve had sign-off from U.S. derivatives regulators to begin integrating with the world\'s futures and options markets.\n\nThat\'s because to date, the logistical difficulties of investing in bitcoin have represented a barrier to entry that\'s tended to keep matters firmly skewed toward buyers. For the most part, those prepared to look past day-long transaction times and risks of a Mt. Gox-style heist have either had an abiding faith in the cryptocurrency, or at the very least a misplaced confidence that past performance is a guarantee of future returns. With an increasing number of such buyers, it\'s no surprise that prices have been rising so fast.\n\nBuyer Beware Bitcoin has spent far more of its time in overbought territory as measured by relative strength indexes Source: Bloomberg, Gadfly calculations\n\nYou can actually measure this skew, at one remove, by looking at technical indicators. Momentum oscillators like the relative strength index suggest whether an asset is overbought or oversold by comparing the magnitudes of up days and down days. Over the past three years, bitcoin has been in ""overbought"" territory about 20 percent of the time and ""oversold"" just 3.3 percent of the time -- a far sharper tilt toward buyers than seen in spot gold, WTI crude, or the S&P 500 Index.\n\nA futures market ought to change that. Bitcoin\'s clunky infrastructure has hitherto been one of its most salient features, but that more or less disappears with derivatives: One of their key advantages, as Gadfly has argued before, is their ability to replace the Rube Goldberg mechanisms of real-world trading with smooth, centralized exchange and clearing operations.\n\nThat\'s likely to bring in a much more diverse group of investors. Protected by the ability to hedge some of that pricing risk with options, those who argue that $10,000 is a ridiculous price for something that cost $1,000 a year ago will finally have a decent way of putting their money where their mouth is, by short-selling.\n\nIt\'s tempting to regard that as the end of the story. Futures trading mushrooms; professional investors come in to break up the bitcoin bugs\' little game; sanity returns to financial markets.\n\nIn truth, it\'s likely to be more complicated than that. To be sure, a bitcoin derivatives market is likely to become vastly larger and more liquid than the underlying blockchain-based trade -- that\'s the nature of futures and options. The $376 billion notional value of gold derivatives outstanding at the end of June, for instance, is equivalent to about 10 times the 953 metric tons of physical gold purchased in that quarter.\n\nBut size isn\'t everything. For all that liquidity is meant to aid in price discovery, futures take their cue from the spot market as often as the other way around, as Bloomberg\'s macro strategist Cameron Crise argued Monday. And just as a derivatives market is likely to bring in more short-sellers, it could get more longs into the trade, as well. That could drive prices up further, particularly as investors rotate out of the much larger equity, debt and commodity markets into the crowded crypto space.\n\nSwing Time Bitcoin\'s weekly price changes are far more dramatic than any other market traded asset Source: Bloomberg, Gadfly calculations\n\nThe more likely immediate effect will be not on prices, but volatility. To date, bitcoin has operated with no guardrails, rising at double-digit rates in three out of the past five weeks and gaining as much as 17 percent in a day last Monday. A futures market ought to take the edge off that in two ways: Firstly, by tripping the 20 percent daily trading limits already incorporated in the CME Group Inc. futures contract; and secondly, by unleashing a wave of automated buy and sell orders whenever it crashes through key levels, helping to cancel out the effect of the underlying move.\n\nBitcoin\'s one-day gain last Monday +17%\n\nStill, don\'t expect to see a dramatic bursting of bitcoin\'s bubble. A year after spot gold\'s nominal peak at $1,900 an ounce in September 2011, it had fallen only 11 percent and even now it\'s only a third lower than its record. The narrative of gold\'s strength took two decades to demolish after its 1980 peak and another decade to build back up, and it still holds a lot of currency.\n\nBitcoin may not be very different. A one-third fall like gold has suffered may sound dramatic -- but in the weird world of bitcoin, it would only return things to the levels of three weeks ago.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.']"
12/04/2017,"['Already have an account?\n\nLogin', 'A bitcoin big short is building.\n\nThe planned introduction of bitcoin futures contracts at CME Group Inc., Cboe Global Markets Inc. and Nasdaq Inc. will make it much easier to bet on a decline. Hedge funds, which have largely stayed on the sidelines, are waiting for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s futures market to open for a fresh opportunity to bet against the cryptocurrency, according to more than a half dozen people trading the assets.\n\n“The futures reduce the frictions of going short more than they do of going long, so it’s probably net bearish,” said Craig Pirrong, a business professor at the University of Houston. “Having this instrument that makes it easier to short might keep the bitcoin price a little closer to reality.”\n\nBloomberg’s Sonali Basak discusses betting on bitcoin futures. (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nBitcoin has gained millions of percent since it started trading in 2010. An investment of $1 at the beginning would now be valued at more than $1.4 million. A dollar invested in the S&P 500 stock index for the same period would now be worth less than $4 including reinvested dividends.\n\nSome see the bitcoin market as “one of the greatest shorting opportunities ever,” said Lou Kerner, a partner at Flight VC who invests in the cryptocurrency. “You have a lot of zealotry, and a lot of people, including me, who think it’s the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of mankind. You have a lot of people who think it’s a bubble and a Ponzi scheme. It turns out both of them can’t be right.”\n\nFor more: Bitcoin heads to Wall Street whether regulators are ready or not\n\nBitcoin has been especially volatile recently, plunging nearly 20 percent in less than 90 minutes on Nov. 29, to $9,009 after briefly topping $11,000. The price has since recovered, and was trading at more than $11,332.01 at 11:42 a.m. in New York on Monday, a 3.9 percent jump since Friday.\n\nCboe said Monday it will start trading bitcoin futures on Dec. 10, while CME’s contracts are set to debut on Dec. 18. Nasdaq is planning to offer futures in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. Cantor Fitzgerald LP’s Cantor Exchange is creating a bitcoin derivative, and startup LedgerX already offers options.\n\nAri Paul, co-founder of hedge fund BlockTower Capital and former portfolio manager at the University of Chicago endowment, said people are mistaken if they think the famously volatile cryptocurrency is a clear-cut short.\n\n“While some traders are eager to be able to short bitcoin and will do so when the futures are launched, there is a far greater amount of money eagerly awaiting the futures as a vehicle to go long,” Paul said.\n\n‘Small Potatoes’\n\nThere are limited ways to short bitcoin today, said Michael Moro, chief executive officer of Genesis Global Trading. The cryptocurrency trading platform has lent about $20 million to investors to take bearish positions, which were mostly to hedge existing bets, he said. Companies like GDAX, BitMEX and Bitfinex allow investors to buy assets on margin for short periods.\n\n“With the existing exchanges, no one can get in and short $1 million,” Moro said. “It’s really small potatoes on what you can do today. The CME guys open up a new frontier.”\n\nBitcoin’s 90 percent surge this year has drawn a range of reactions from Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon famously called the cryptocurrency “a fraud,” while bulls including Thomas Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors and hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz have predicted more rises.\n\nFor more: Novogratz says crypto will be biggest bubble of lifetime\n\nThe ability to short the currency is “an important part of the ecosystem,” said Novogratz, who recently began to raise $500 million to invest in cryptocurrencies. Novogratz, a bitcoin believer in the long term, has said short trades can be risky.\n\n“There is a lot of froth,” he said at a cryptocurrency conference last week in New York. “This is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes.”\n\nShort sellers essentially borrow a security, betting that the price will fall and they can pocket the difference when they return the holding. The strategy carries risks. Borrowing bitcoin can be difficult, and price swings sudden, said Moro of Genesis.\n\n“The concept is that this is such a volatile market that it’s going to scare a lot of investors away,” said Kerner of Flight VC.\n\nInvestors could get stung like those who bet against the internet bubble in the late 1990s, said Aaron Brown, a former managing director at AQR Capital Management who invests in the cryptocurrency.\n\n“People who shorted the internet in 1998 were right, but they went broke before they could collect any winnings,” Brown said. “One of the problems with it, if you believe it’s a bubble or a Ponzi scheme or whatever, it can go on for a long time.”\n\n— With assistance by Erik Schatzker', 'Is Bitcoin a huge bubble? Based on what many investors have been saying lately, you’d certainly think so. While this stance isn’t technically wrong, I can say with certainty it’s built on unsound logic.\n\nBitcoin is backed by $0 worth of assets, so based on this criteria, yes, a valuation of $11,000 per coin (as of 12/4) certainly qualifies as a bubble. But with this logic, even if Bitcoin’s value were $1, it would still be a bubble. If you are working with a model that deems something overvalued at any price other than $0, odds are your model is bad.\n\nBitcoin prices are driven by demand for a limited commodity. There are currently about 16 million coins in existence, and based on Bitcoin protocol, there can never be more than 21 million coins, ever. It’s truly Econ 101. There is a finite supply, and since Bitcoin has become a mainstream brand name, demand has increased, therefore driving up the price. By default, a non-asset backed currency trades purely on hype. That’s the beauty of a decentralized system, and it’s the thesis at the core of Bitcoin’s success.\n\nIf you are looking to draw a parallel to traditional assets, do not use currencies like the USD. Fiat currencies are backed by assets and the economic power of the issuing country. If a country’s economy sees outsized growth, its currency will appreciate. If the economy slumps, it’ll devalue. Since there is no economy behind Bitcoin, that model won’t work.\n\nInstead, compare Bitcoin’s valuation to the fine art market. Like Bitcoin, a great painting has no asset-backed value, but it is a scarce resource. Even my finest work is worthless because there is no demand for it. When an auction house estimates the value of a Picasso, it doesn’t do a fundamental analysis of what the paint, the canvas, etc., is worth. Instead, it attempts to predict the demand for the painting, which is the key driver of how much someone is likely to bid. The value is entirely backed by the demand for the painting. If the demand wanes, the price goes down. If the demand waxes, the price goes up.\n\nIf you want to figure out if Bitcoin is a bubble, first off, start treating it like the high-risk, speculative commodity it is. The price 50 years from now will depend entirely on its future demand, so ask yourself the following questions:\n\nWill currencies and assets be based on distributed ledger technology in the future? I think the answer is a fairly resounding “yes,” and if you think this is a “no,” you need to do more technical research.\n\nWill the currency of the future be asset-backed or demand-backed?\n\nThis is where things get tricky. Currently, a clear majority of cryptocurrencies are demand-backed. Little work has been done on the asset-backed side because it is much more challenging to launch an asset-backed currency, as it requires a large upfront investment to purchase the assets.\n\nIf you think demand-backed currencies are the future because perfect decentralization (which cannot be achieved if there are underlying assets) will make up for the downside of high volatility, your next question should be: Will the Bitcoin brand be strong enough for it to remain the dominant player in the space, or will its technical challenges erode its hold on the throne and allow a company like Ripple, Litecoin, or an entirely new player to win? I doubt there will be more than a handful of currencies out there 50 years from now, since there is really no point for more than a few.\n\nLong story short: Forecasting or evaluating Bitcoin prices based on fundamentals is silly since it doesn’t have any. When looking at demand-backed currencies, you are playing a game of forecasting hype. You have to consider the whims of the market and potential technology growth.\n\nBitcoin may be a bubble, but please stop saying it is because of fundamentals. You will have to make a stronger case if you want to convince me.\n\nStephan Goss is CEO of Zeeto, a questions-based data discovery company.', 'The Winklevoss twins, famously known for suing Mark Zuckerberg after claiming he stole their idea for Facebook, are now Bitcoin billionaires, according to a few reports. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss won $65 million from the Facebook lawsuit, and invested $11 million of their payout into Bitcoin in 2013, amassing one of the largest portfolios of Bitcoin in the world — 1 percent of the entire currency’s dollar value equivalent, said the twins at the time. Their slice of the Bitcoin pie is now worth over $1 billion after Bitcoin surged past $10,000 last week to now trade at $11,100, according to CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency has surged over 10,000 percent since the Winklevoss’ investment, when one coin traded at around $120.\n\n""If Bitcoin is a better gold or seen as a type of gold-like asset, then it could be in the trillions on a market cap,"" Tyler Winklevoss told CNNMoney in 2015.

I would be surprised if the committee doesn\'t have an inquiry next year.”\n\nThe EU and U.K. would join world powers like the U.S., Russia and China, who have all taken steps to crack down on the fast-rising currency in recent months.\n\nLast week, Coinbase, the largest digital currency platform, was ordered to hand over 14,000 accounts to the IRS after losing a federal lawsuit.\n\nSuch regulations come as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have hit record high valuations.\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of more than $11,000 per coin last week.

Many in the hearing noted the potential to use bitcoin to fund nefarious activities, but also lauded potential benefits.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, which could more immediately regulate digital currencies, has not given a clear position on if it plans to crack down on them, except in clear instances where certain coins are clearly frauds or operating as securities.', 'Can a crypto app be too easy and fun?\n\nThat might be the case on ethereum, where one project is proving so popular it\'s putting pressure on the network\'s technology. Best thought of as a decentralized Tamagotchi, CryptoKitties appears to be striking a nerve with new users, making ethereum fun and accessible to those who aren\'t in the tech nerd domain.\n\nAlready, the app, which uses ethereum\'s blockchain to create a public, shared history of cryptographically unique (not to mention cute and cuddly) fluffballs, is ethereum\'s most popular, with users having spent at least $3 million total on breeding, buying and selling the in-game items, up from $1 million just yesterday. And currently, the average cat is trading for $100 in ether.\n\nBut the application is clogging the ethereum network, putting transactions in a long-time limbo.\n\n""Due to network congestion, we are increasing the birthing fee from 0.001 ETH to 0.002 ETH. This will ensure your kittens are born on time!"" the CryptoKitties team stated in a tweet surrounded by siren emojis to express the direness of the situation.\n\nIn its short lifespan, CryptoKitties has grown to make up 20 percent of all ethereum computations, a number that seems to still be growing.\n\nWhile it\'s certainly not the sole culprit behind ethereum\'s lagging transactions, as ethereum developer Nick Johnson pointed out, it is one, and at the very least, it\'s where people are placing the blame for exposing ethereum\'s limits.\n\nJohnson continued, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""CryptoKitties is definitely a significant contributor to network congestion, and it may have been what pushed us over the edge from mostly-full blocks to full blocks in the last day or so.""\n\nMessy underbelly\n\nThe issue is a bit ironic, seeing how ethereum is touted as a world ""world computer"" that hosts unstoppable decentralized applications, replacing the internet.\n\nWith aspirations like that, it might seem strange that one app for trading otherworldly kittens could clog the network, but because of the way blockchains work – with every transaction needing all network nodes to process it – there are limits on the number of computations that can be done all at one time.\n\nNot only does that mean that an insane amount of kitty trading can slow down the network, but it can also add to the expense of using ethereum as well.\n\nAnd whether people are right to point fingers at the CryptoKitties app or not, it is laughable that kittens are bringing new awareness to the messy underbelly of public blockchains, including ethereum, bitcoin and many others – scalability.\n\nAs a tweet from coder Boris Kozak displays, the issue is well-established and there are many proposed fixes, including state channels, Raiden, sharding and Casper – ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin\'s and other developer\'s interest in moving ethereum to proof-of-stake – but all these solutions require major engineering work and are still unfinished.\n\n""It may also hasten the ethereum scaling crisis,"" tweeted BlockTower chief information officer Ari Paul.\n\nOthers made parallels to bitcoin\'s fierce scaling debates – which this year saw several groups split from the main bitcoin blockchain to create new versions of the protocol, in bitcoin cash\'s case raising the block size limit to allow for more transactions.\n\nJohnson Lau, Bitcoin Core contributor, quipped on Twitter:\n\n""We need Ethereum Cash or many kittens would be killed.""\n\nBlessing in disguise?\n\nIn short, ethereum has its work cut out for it.\n\nAnd as usual, whether or not you think CryptoKitties is a positive movement for the ethereum community is colored by whether you support the protocol in the first place.\n\nEthereum supporters have a reason to be excited that an app is finally showing what the platform is capable of, as outlined in a reddit thread, which lauds the game as a successful proof-of-concept.\n\n""I\'m glad smart contracts are productizing a variety of use cases beyond speculation,"" said The Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3) researcher Phil Daian, pointing to the bout of speculation generated by the thousands of initial coin offerings (ICOs) that have launched on the blockchain.\n\nAnd Buterin even chimed in, tweeting: ""I actually like the digital cat games. They illustrate very well that the value of a blockchain extends far beyond applications that would literally get shut down by banks or governments if they did not use one.""\n\nAnd, as far as scaling ethereum goes, many are glad it\'s bringing awareness to the issue – one ethereum user even called it a ""blessing in disguise.""\n\nMartin Köppelmann, founder of ethereum app Gnosis, echoed that sentiment, telling CoinDesk:\n\n""If it is that successful – and even if it increases fees, even better – it will reveal weaknesses of the current tech but ultimately make it better.

You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I\'m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don\'t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a \'breakfast platter\' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you\'re happy!\n\n“I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.\n\n“If you\'re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.”\n\nThe pizzas cost $25. The 10,000 bitcoin Hanyecz exchanged for them are worth $113,500,000 (£84,350,435).', 'Bitcoin’s extraordinary price surge means its market capitalization now exceeds the annual output of whole economies, and the estimated worth of some of the world’s top billionaires.\n\nWith the debate over its bubble status still raging, the flagship cryptocurrency continued its march higher on Monday, solidifying above $11,000 and bringing its climb this year to more than 1,000 percent. With market tracker Coinmarketcap.com putting the total value of all bitcoins in circulation at $190 billion, it’s come a long way from August, when one coin could buy you a hefty supply of avocados.\n\nHere are five things that have been eclipsed by bitcoin in terms of market capitalization:\n\nNew Zealand’s GDP\n\nThe South Pacific nation’s farm-and-tourism-led economy is valued at $185 billion, according to World Bank data as of July, putting it some $5 billion below bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s market cap is also bigger than the likes of Qatar, Kuwait and Hungary.\n\nGoldman Sachs, and UBS\n\nBitcoin’s run-up has even seen it valued more highly than two of the world’s most influential banks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s market cap was $97 billion as of Friday, while Zurich-based UBS Group AG came in at about $67 billion. Add those numbers together and it still falls short of bitcoin.\n\nBoth financial heavyweights have taken a hands-off approach to the digital currency, with Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein saying it’s too early to draft a bitcoin strategy and UBS — the world’s biggest wealth manager — saying it won’t allocate it in portfolios because of the threat of a government crackdown.\n\nBoeing\n\nIt may make jumbo jets but Boeing Co.’s market cap of $162 billion is also less than that of a digital currency that didn’t exist 10 years ago. The Chicago-based company, which describes itself as the world’s largest aerospace firm, is more than a century old and employs 140,000 people in more than 65 countries, according to its website. Rival Airbus SE fares no better — it’s got a market value of 66 billion euros ($78 billion).\n\nFourteen Aircraft Carriers\n\nIf bitcoin’s market cap could be used to buy military equipment, it would pack a mighty punch. The USS Gerald R. Ford, the first of a new class of nuclear-powered supercarriers, was delivered to the U.S. Navy in May. It cost an estimated $13 billion, so if investors put all their bitcoins together they would be able to buy a fleet of fourteen ships.\n\nBill Gates, Buffett and the Queen\n\nThey sit atop Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, but even if Bill Gates and Warren Buffett pooled their fortunes they wouldn’t have enough to buy all the bitcoins in circulation. Gates is worth $90 billion and Buffett has $83 billion, according to the index. Not even Queen Elizabeth II could get them over the line if she brought her $383 million to the table. While we don’t know what he told Katy Perry, Buffett has called bitcoin a “real bubble” in the past.', 'The market analytics continue reporting new Bitcoin records today, the cryptocurrency reached $11,700. Last week it was not clear what could cause the move higher, but over the weekend Bitcoin would break the psychological barrier of $11,000, and now the infamous cryptocurrency is flirting with the $12,000 mark.\n\nThe talk of Bitcoin being in a “market bubble” continues hijacking investors attention, however, the main point to discuss what would happen to all those people who invested money into Bitcoin if it collapsed. Obviously, they would lose money, but it’s more interesting to examine the effect on the global economy of this revolutionary monetary system.\n\nSunday’s record high for bitcoin came as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced the launch of the “petro”- a new cryptocurrency backed by oil reserves. Then the new regulations are being introduced by the governments of the UK and the EU. Amid concerns that Bitcoin is being used for money laundering and tax evasion, many governments are making plans to end the anonymity that Bitcoin provides.\n\nThe regulations being proposed would force any websites that accept Bitcoin to report any suspicious transactions. These new rules, also being considered by the UK and expected to come into effect in the first months of 2018.\n\nThis article is provided as a third party analysis and does not constitute any financial advice, which can only be provided by a certified financial adviser.', 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies to hit a two-week high on Wednesday, as market participants grew more optimistic about lawmakers’ progress on U.S. tax legislation.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Bitcoin (virtual currency) coins placed on Dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration picture, November 6, 2017.

Then, on Tuesday (Dec. 05), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) warned investors against betting on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n“So there’s only one thing we can do—watch it from the bank of a river,” Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, said at an event in Shanghai. “One day you’ll see bitcoin’s dead body float away in front of you.”\n\nThe Indian central bank, however, was more straightforward, “…cautioning users, holders and traders of virtual currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins regarding the potential economic, financial, operational, legal, customer protection, and security-related risks associated in dealing with such VCs.” The RBI’s Dec. 05 release reiterated the concerns it had raised twice before in December 2013 and February 2017.\n\nThese warnings come in the wake of bitcoin’s skyrocketing value—up more than 1,000% this year. In India, its price has almost doubled in a month, from Rs4.55 lakh ($7,070) on Nov. 01 to Rs8.6 lakh on Dec.05. The spike has led to a buying frenzy.\n\nIn fact, measures to curb the use of cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum across Asia. The central banks of Indonesia and Bangladesh have even barred the use of bitcoin as a payment tool. In September, China shut down bitcoin exchanges and banned initial coin offerings.\n\nOther regions, too, have raised red flags. On Nov. 29, the vice-president of the European Central Bank warned against investing in bitcoin at such high prices. The governor of the Bank of France cautioned against its potential hazards, as did Russian president Vladimir Putin and Germany’s central bank.\n\nMeanwhile, rallying past all warning signs, bitcoin is at a record high, having crossed the $12,000 mark today (Dec. 06).\n\nIn India, besides the RBI, the government, too, has made public its discomfort with bitcoin.\n\nOn Nov. 30, finance minister Arun Jaitley said India does not recognise virtual currency as legal tender. Earlier this year, a committee set up by his ministry had reportedly recommended banning cryptocurrencies over fears that they could be used to launder money and perpetuate frauds.\n\nYet, cryptocurrency exchange operators remain unfazed.\n\n“If India had to ban virtual currencies, they would have done that by now. In the last three years, the RBI’s statement has been the same: They are uncomfortable with it and people should invest at their own risk,” Vivek Steve Francis, CEO of Coinome, a cryptocurrency-trading exchange, told Quartz late last month.', 'After Jamie Dimon drew a line in the sand for JPMorgan, calling it a ‘fraud,’ the company has once again stepped over that line, praising the digital coin as a ‘new gold.’\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan believe that Bitcoin has changed its shape and that it could soon be joining gold as a reliable, long-term way to store wealth. Recent growth and recent changes have seen Bitcoin lean more towards being digital gold, and this is where JPMorgan see its value.\n\n“Potential to elevate cryptocurrencies to an emerging asset class”\n\nAccording to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the incredible spike in the value of Bitcoin is allowing it to start competing as an asset class; and seemingly at the same time drop out of the currency race.\n\nThere are changes afoot in the Bitcoin market, especially when it comes to making the digital currency easier to invest in. Panigirtzoglou said:\n\n“The prospective launch of Bitcoin futures contracts by established exchanges, in particular, has the potential to add legitimacy and thus increase the appeal of the cryptocurrency market to both retail and institutional investors.”\n\nStill chasing gold\n\nThere is an ongoing debate over which is more popular, and if one can kill the other when it comes to talking about investing in gold and Bitcoin. However, the precious metal may be steady and safe, thus not as exciting as Bitcoin, but it still holds a large chunk of influential sway.\n\nBitcoin still falls short of Gold’s $6 tln valuation, however, it is the speed at which it has grown which is more impressive. The huge growth spurt could make cryptocurrencies match or even surpass gold quite soon as an investable asset.\n\nGood news for banks\n\nAround the time Dimon was spurting his rhetoric on Bitcoin, there was a feeling that the banks and Bitcoin were in a battle royale. The one was being challenged by a young upstart of a digital currency, and losing ground.\n\nBanks were nervous of Bitcoin as a currency and how it could liberate people from the clutches of the government-backed fiat, however, that fight has died down somewhat as the future is now aimed at accumulating the valuable asset.\n\nInstead of a flying in the face of the institutionalized banking system, Bitcoin looks like it has outgrown its angsty teen stages.There is now a literal digital gold rush as the fear of missing out sweeps the globe.', 'Bitcoin hit news headlines this week as the price of one unit of the cryptocurrency passed $11,500 for the first time.\n\nAlthough it’s often referred to as new, Bitcoin has existed since 2009 and the technology it is built on has roots going back even further. In fact if you had invested just $1,000 in Bitcoin the year it was first publicly available, you would now be richer to the tune of £36.7 million.\n\nThose who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat its mistakes – so here is a brief history of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\n1998 – 2009 The pre-Bitcoin years\n\nAlthough Bitcoin was the first established cryptocurrency, there had been previous attempts at creating online currencies with ledgers secured by encryption.

It was posted by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains a mystery to this day.\n\n2009 – Bitcoin begins\n\nThe Bitcoin software is made available to the public for the first time and mining – the process through which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are recorded and verified on the blockchain – begins.', 'The Week of the Altcoins\n\nThis graph show how prices have changed since the midnight December 7th with prices at that point being rebased to 100\n\nPrices as of 11:59 PM UTC 13/12/17 (Source: coinmarketcap)\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen another week of volatility. Litecoin’s market cap has increased by over 200% as it becomes a popular alternative to bitcoin, as the latter has faced fears of increased regulation. XRP has also been riding the wave, seeing a 50% price hike from last week.\n\n1. Bitcoin Futures Live on Cboe\n\nThe Story\n\nPlans to launch bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange have gone ahead as contracts began trading at 23:00 GMT on Sunday. The contracts will allow investors to bet on the future value of bitcoin. On the news bitcoin’s price rose significantly.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThe contract allows individuals to bet on bitcoin’s price at a specified time in the future. Given bitcoin’s rise of over 1,000% this year, many investors are keen to get in on the action; CBOE’s Bitcoin futures contract will enable investors to do so without actually owning the cryptocurrency. Additionally, it will be possible to short sell the digital asset for the first time, allowing investors to profit from price falls.\n\nThe move suggests the cryptocurrency is now becoming a mainstream investment, however, Bitcoin remains to be traded on unregulated markets. Consequently, its price is likely to remain volatile.\n\nHigh Volatility\n\nIn an effort to ease volatility, the CBOE decided it would suspend trading for two minutes for price fluctuations of more than 10% and five minutes for more than 20%. In the contract’s first session, trading was stopped twice: once for two minutes and once for five minutes. While bitcoin remains traded on largely unregulated markets, it is questionable whether this policy will have any effect on the underlying cryptocurrency’s volatility.\n\nThe Future\n\nBloomberg’s Adam Haigh said the futures contracts was “an incremental step that allows Wall Street and indeed the professional finance community to make a bet either way on bitcoin.” The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is expected to list a similar contract next week, and Nasdaq has announced plans to host such trading too.\n\nLast week Revolut’s decision to facilitate the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could increase demand for the underlying asset.\n\nAllegations that 1,000 people own 40% of all bitcoins in circulation suggest its price could be manipulated by a relatively small number of individuals.\n\n2. 1,000 People Apparently Own 40% of Bitcoin\n\nThe Winklevoss twins invest $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. (Attribution: By cellanr [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Story\n\nRoughly 40% of the cryptocurrency is owned by 1,000 people, claims Aaron Brown, head of financial markets research at AQR Capital Management. In such an unregulated market, Brown said large holders of bitcoin could potentially be working together to orchestrate price changes. Given bitcoin’s recent spike, now could be a great opportunity for these users to part with a portion of their bitcoins, locking in the near 1600% price increase since the start of the year.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nBitcoin appears to be making its way into mainstream investing. Last Friday the US regulator gave the CME group and CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch bitcoin futures. Just yesterday, London-based digital banking company Revolut launched Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether trading for their users.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency becomes a more mainstream investment and demand for it rises, these bitcoin ‘whales’ will be able to part with their bitcoins for a hefty profit. This could leave new investors with an asset in the midst of a bubble.\n\nRoger Ver, a well known early adopter of bitcoin said, regarding ‘whales’ working together, “I suspect that is likely true, and people should be able to do whatever they want with their own money.”\n\nWhile the question of whether Brown’s allegation is true must be approached with scepticism, there is evidence of some very large investors in the space. Bloomberg recently reported that on November 12th, “someone moved almost 25,000 bitcoins, worth about $159 million at the time, to an online exchange.” Bitcoin’s market cap is roughly $270bn at the time of writing, but if this investor was to sell on a single exchange, it could potentially crash the market.\n\nLarge Bitcoin Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who gained fame for attempting to take control of Facebook, invested $11m in bitcoin back in 2013. This amount has many times over.\n\nTim Draper, a billionaire venture capitalist best known for his investment in Skype – during the companies early days – bought 30,000 bitcoins back in 2014. He has since invested in Tezos’ ICO.\n\nBarry Silbert, the founder of the Digital Currency Group, picked up 48,000 bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was worth $350 a piece.\n\n3. Ethereum Wallet Scam Closed Down\n\nThe Story\n\nDigital wallet provider myetherwallet.com announced yesterday that it had no affiliation with an iOS-based cryptocurrency wallet app using its name. The app, which became the third most popular on the finance section of the App Store, allows users to import and open a digital wallet to store ether. Fake digital wallets could lose investors their cryptocurrencies permanently, so it is important investors (and app stores) keep an eye out for scams.\n\nSecurity and Ethereum\n\nIn July, a developer error on the ethereum network meant a hacker pocket $31m worth of ether. While the technology is still in its infancy mistakes are bound to be made. However, several digital wallet hacks have emerged since cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and users need to take security seriously while safeguards are not in place.\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies security, the owness is with the users. Sending ether from a digital wallet means I am responsible for my transfers. If I make a mistake when typing in the amount, or address of the receiver, I cannot call my bank and ask them to void the transaction. Consequently, user’s wallets are being targeted by scammers.\n\nSo far there have been no reports that the fake wallet stole from anyone. The company may have simply used the name for its familiarity in the ethereum community.\n\nMyetherwallet.com have since announced the removal of the app from the iOS store.\n\n4. San Francisco ICO Closed Down by SEC\n\nThe Story\n\nSan Francisco-based restaurant reviewing app Munchee has been forced to stop its initial coin offering (ICO) and reimburse investors after regulators raised concerns over the company’s tokens not meeting securities regulations. Munchee was looking to obtain $15m to “improve an existing iPhone app centred on restaurant meal reviews and create an “ecosystem” in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens,” according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHowever, “in the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasized that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens,” they added. The regulator felt investors were led to believe they would gain a return on their tokens, however, the tokens did not meet the authority’s standards. The company was not fined due to its quick response to the SEC’s requests.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nLast week PlexCoin’s founders were charged with defrauding investors. This was the first time the SEC’s newly established Cyber Unit filed charges. The regulator issued a statement back in July saying ICOs will be subject to US security laws.\n\nBoth cases suggest a serious commitment to ensuring investors are not mis-sold securities, particularly in the ICO space.\n\n5. Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Not A Substitute for Gold\n\nSource: Tradingeconomics.com\n\nThe Story\n\nThe simultaneous rise of bitcoin and relatively poor performance of gold has provoked many to ask whether the two assets are in competition. The short answer is no, they are not.\n\n“Bitcoin has real potential, if it were to become digital gold it might have tremendous space to grow,” said Gabor Gurbacs, Vaneck Securities Director of Digital Asset Strategy. It is this sentiment which has put the two in contest. However, the investor pool for each is “vastly different”, according to Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.\n\nGold based exchange-traded funds are currently at close to their highest since May 2013, suggesting the metal remains part of investor’s portfolios, and not that investors have not cashed out and moved over to bitcoin. The reason this is not the case lies in comparing the function each asset serves and the investors it attracts.\n\nComparing Bitcoin and Gold\n\nBitcoin attracts more speculative investors looking for quick returns, while gold is often held as a portion of investment portfolios to spread risk. In times of economic downturn gold tends to go up in price, balancing any losses from stocks and bonds. The two assets currently serve distinct purposes. Consequently, bitcoin’s price rise is unlikely to have turned investors away from gold.\n\n6. Jamie Dimon Eases Hostility Towards Bitcoin After Futures Contracts Go Live\n\nSource: By Steve Jurvetson (Flickr: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Story\n\nSource: CNBC\n\n“I remain highly skeptical of it,” said JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon, when recently asked about bitcoin. “I’m open-minded to uses of cryptocurrency if properly controlled and regulated,” Dimon added. The executive, who famously called bitcoin a “fraud” appears to have softened his opinion just days after the bitcoin-based futures derivative began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nThis is the first time Dimon has spoken about bitcoin for two months. The timing of Dimon’s comments might suggest JPMorgan will offer the bitcoin derivative to its clients. The contract would allow clients to take long or short positions on bitcoin’s price.\n\nSimilar contracts will trade on the CME and Nasdaq exchanges in the near future.\n\n7. Cryptocurrency as Collateral for Loans\n\nThe Story\n\nA growing number of early cryptocurrency adopters, who have seen astronomical gains, will now be able to use their cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans. London-based Nebeus is helping third-party lenders create loans guaranteed by cryptocurrency collateral. The company created 100 of these loans on its first day and has made 1,000 more since says Nebeus’ Managing Director Konstantin Zaripov.\n\nGiven bitcoin’s market cap of almost $300bn, and a total cryptocurrency market cap of over $500bn, the market for these loans could be colossal. However, some worry that these assets are in a bubble, and their collapse makes these loans hugely risky for lenders.\n\nWhy It’s Important\n\nAround 40% of all bitcoins are held by 1,000 people, Bloomberg reported last week. Prior to this innovation, these users would only be able to cash in on their gains by selling their cryptocurrencies. “I can see a lending industry in the tens of billions of dollars,” said Aaron Brown, former managing director at AQR Capital Management.\n\nThe loans could attract attention from cryptocurrency miners, who earn tokens for processing blockchain network transactions. This group are typically ideologically attached to the idea of decentralised currencies, and such loans could allow them to hold on to their cryptocurrencies while they cover their overheads.\n\nHowever, bitcoin’s 1700% rise since the start of the year has caused many to stay clear. A collapse of these digital assets would leave lenders in a tough position.\n\nMust Read Articles\n\nBitcoin, Ripple and Cryptocurrencies: Here to Stay and Prosper\n\nIt is nigh on impossible to observe financial news without hearing about the rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which recently surpassed the $15,000 mark and is continuously setting new all-time highs. ..

His passion for finance and technology made him one of the world's leading freelance Bitcoin writers, and he aims to achieve the same level of respect in the FinTech sector."", '', 'There\'s a lot of excitement about Bitcoin right now, with the value of the cryptocurrency recently soaring above $11,000—more than 10 times its value at the start of the year. This has caused many people to wonder if they should be getting involved in the Bitcoin craze.\n\nBut it\'s important to keep in mind that participating in the Bitcoin economy comes with big risks. Over the years, the Bitcoin world has been plagued by hacks, scams, and abusive practices. Users who don\'t take appropriate precautions can lose everything.\n\nHere we present a short history of the Bitcoin world\'s most significant scams and hacks. It\'s worth noting that all of these attacks were against Bitcoin-related services, not the core Bitcoin software. As far as we know, the Bitcoin network itself is highly secure, though of course that\'s little comfort if you entrust your bitcoins to a third party that gets hacked.\n\nAlso, the list seems to skew toward older incidents. Users seem to have faced greater dangers of hacking and fraud in 2011 and 2012 than they do today.\n\nStill, the dangers haven\'t gone away by any means. The Bitcoin economy is still lightly regulated, and fraud is a constant danger. While it might seem tempting to buy some bitcoins in hopes they\'ll go up in value, the risks are high—perhaps too high for most people. If you do decide to acquire bitcoins, do your research and be careful.\n\nJune 2011: Bitcoin user loses $500,000 in bitcoin to hackers\n\nIn early 2011, Bitcoin had been a tight-knit community of hobbyists. Mining bitcoins was easier back then: people could generate thousands of bitcoins using a conventional home PC.\n\nThat\'s what allinvain, a user on the Bitcoin Talk forums, claimed to have done, amassing a fortune of 25,000 bitcoins. Bitcoins were worth pennies in 2010, but, by early June 2011, the price of bitcoins had soared to $20, making his bitcoins worth around $500,000.\n\nThen, on June 13, disaster struck for allinvain. ""I just woke up to see a very large chunk of my Bitcoin balance gone,"" he wrote. Allinvain believed that someone had hacked into his PC and stolen the bitcoins from his hard drive, transferring them to an account controlled by the hackers.\n\nIf those coins had not been stolen—and he\'d held on to them until today—they would be worth around $250 million.\n\nAugust 2011: Wallet service MyBitcoins disappears from the Web\n\nBitcoin wallet services offer to store bitcoins on users\' behalf. These were initially portrayed as a convenience to the customer, but many of them turned out to be either insecurely run or outright frauds (it can be hard to tell, since the frauds tend to claim they were hacked).\n\nOne wallet service that was popular in Bitcoin\'s early days, for example, was called MyBitcoin. In August 2011, the company disappeared from the Web, claiming the site was hacked.\n\nThis and similar experiences have made the Bitcoin community suspicious of online wallet services. With no real regulation, there\'s no way for users to verify that a wallet service is reliable.\n\nAn exception to this is client-side Web wallets like the one offered by Blockchain.info. In these services, customer data is only stored in encrypted form on the server. Data is encrypted on the client side with a customer-provided password. That approach makes users less vulnerable than traditional wallet services where the service provider has direct control of the bitcoins.\n\nMarch 2012: Hacked Web host leads to stolen bitcoins\n\nHackers exploited a vulnerability in the shared online web host Linode to steal at least 46,703 bitcoins—then worth more than $200,000—from several Linode users. That included more than 43,000 bitcoins stolen from Bitcoinica, an early Bitcoin exchange.\n\nBitcoinica suffered a second hack in May 2012 that cost the company another 18,000 bitcoins. It was then taken offline for a security audit. Bitcoinica didn\'t survive these incidents. In August 2012, the site was sued by several users seeking the return of $460,000 in deposits.\n\nOne lesson of the Linode debacle is that Bitcoin-related businesses have to be extremely careful when operating on shared hosting providers. Bitcoins are secured by encryption keys. If any third party—either other customers or rogue employees—has access to customer data, they will be able to read the encryption keys and use them to transfer bitcoins away from their owners.\n\nAugust 2012: Bitcoin Ponzi scheme is shut down\n\nThe Bitcoin Savings and Trust was a classic Ponzi scheme. Customers were lured in with a promise of high returns—seven percent per week—and new customers\' deposits were used to pay profits to previous customers.\n\nThe scheme shut down in August 2012, and a year later the government indicted organizer Tendon Shavers. The government accused him of raising more than 700,000 bitcoins from gullible customers. In 2014, a judge ordered Shavers to repay victims more than $40 million. The judge found the scheme had cost victims 265,678 bitcoins.\n\nSeptember 2012: More exchanges get hacked, shut down\n\nIn September 2012, a Bitcoin exchange called Bitfloor suffered a catastrophic attack. Attackers stole 24,000 bitcoins, then worth around $250,000. Bitfloor didn\'t have $250,000 in reserves, so the theft effectively made Bitfloor insolvent.\n\nBitfloor resumed operations a few weeks later, hoping to earn enough in fees to repay earlier customers. But the effort was unsuccessful; Bitfloor closed its doors for good in April 2013, leaving frustrated users in its wake.\n\nFebruary 2014: Hackers bring down the world’s then-largest exchange\n\nThe Bitcoin world\'s biggest financial fiasco was the collapse of Mt. Gox—then the world\'s leading Bitcoin exchange—in 2014. Operated by French-born CEO Mark Karpelès from a headquarters in Japan, Mt. Gox was the main way people bought and sold Bitcoins from its foundation in 2010 until February 2014. Then Mt. Gox announced that 850,000 bitcoins had gone missing—likely stolen by hackers, the company said.\n\nAt early 2014 prices, those bitcoins were worth around $450 million. Today, they\'d be worth $8.5 billion.\n\nIn July, US law enforcement officials announced they had arrested a suspect in the massive theft. A Russian man named Alexander Vinnik was the owner and operator of a competing Bitcoin exchange called BTC-e. The feds allege that he knowingly accepted stolen bitcoins from Mt. Gox and laundered them through his own bitcoin exchange.\n\nThe collapse of Mt. Gox left no shortage of angry customers. Ironically, the continued appreciation of Bitcoin\'s value means that the bankrupt company could eventually be able to repay its debts in full—with piles of money left over. Mt. Gox\'s assets and liabilities were frozen while the company worked through the bankruptcy process. The liabilities were frozen in terms of Japanese yen, while the company\'s remaining bitcoins have ballooned in value—from around $400 each at the time of the bankruptcy to around $11,000 today.\n\nObviously, Mt. Gox\'s former creditors believe they should be repaid in appreciated bitcoins, but Japanese law might not be on their side.\n\nJanuary 2015: Bitstamp exchange is hacked\n\nIn January 2015, the popular Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp reported that it had lost around 19,000 bitcoins, then worth about $5 million. The exchange survived the attack and remains a leading Bitcoin exchange today.\n\nAugust 2016: Another exchange loses 120,000 bitcoins to hackers\n\nIn August 2016, the Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex announced that hackers had stolen $77 million worth of bitcoins. The company foisted these costs on to users, forcing them to take a 36-percent reduction in the value of their deposits.\n\nBitfinex is still around, but there are big questions about the company\'s credibility. As the New York Times puts it, Bitfinex is an ""opaque operation that provides no information on its website about where it is or who operates the company.""']"
12/06/2017,"['Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At the start of the year Bitcoin was valued below $1,000\n\nBitcoin has breached the $16,000 mark, extending the digital currency\'s record-breaking surge.\n\nThe cryptocurrency began the year below $1,000 but continues to rise despite warnings of a dangerous bubble.\n\nAccording to Coindesk.com, Bitcoin reached $16,663.18 (£12, 358.35), having soared over 50% in a week.\n\nThe new high comes days before the launch of Bitcoin futures on two exchanges, including the world\'s largest futures exchange, CME.\n\nSpread betting firm CMC Markets said the rise had all the symptoms of a bubble market, warning ""there is no way to know when the bubble will burst"".\n\nWhat\'s behind the Bitcoin gold rush?\n\nUS regulator approves Bitcoin trading\n\nSteam stops accepting Bitcoin payments\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nThere are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency.\n\nUnlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks.\n\nA small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment.\n\nThe digital currency\'s rapid ascent from around $1,000 at the start of the year has put it in the spotlight.\n\nCritics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream.\n\nFinancial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks.\n\nThe UK\'s Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"".\n\nBut last week a US regulator agreed to let two traditional exchanges, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, begin trading in Bitcoin-related financial contracts.\n\nThe announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it will allow investors to buy and sell ""future"" contracts in bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price - was seen as a watershed moment for Bitcoin.\n\nCambridge Global Payments director of global product and market strategy Karl Schamotta said that move was behind the latest rally: ""The perception in households around the world that the CME and the CBOE are providing legitimacy to Bitcoin is really what is driving the massive rally here.""\n\nBut Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said the rise in Bitcoin\'s value was ""mostly motivated by fear of missing out and greed"".\n\nBitcoins are created through a complex computer process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world.\n\nA steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million.', 'With Bitcoin prices smashing through one milestone after another and mainstream financial institutions like CME Group, CBOE, and Nasdaq preparing to offer Bitcoin futures trading, you would think that investors would be beating down the doors to get in on the action. While many investors are rushing to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, just as many are shying away from the digital currency.\n\nAll of a sudden, or so it seems, Bitcoin hype is everywhere.\n\nAnd that makes me anxious. It doesn’t mean you should be, it just means we’re reaching a tipping point. We’ve seen this story before.\n\nWhen I think of a bubble, I think of the dot-com bust in the late nineties and the real estate crash that started in 2007. I think of people blindly pouring money into investments they know nothing about. I think of the taxi test where, if my taxi driver is telling me to make an investment in something, it’s time to get out.\n\nYet so far, the taxi cab drivers are not giving Bitcoin investment advice. At least not to me.\n\nBut Stephen Roach, Yale University senior fellow and the former Morgan Stanley chief economist has plenty of advice, and it’s not good news. He recently told CNBC:\n\nThis is a dangerous speculative bubble by any shadow or stretch of the imagination. […] I’ve never seen a chart of a security where the price really has a vertical pattern to it. And bitcoin is the most vertical of any pattern I’ve ever seen in my career.\n\nSomeone asked me if Bitcoin is priced too high and about to self-destruct. “How should I know?” I responded. I’ve been asked that question at Bitcoin $4000, $7000, $10,000 and now $14,000. You tell me, when is the implosion event?\n\nAnd yet, you must ask yourself why are investors still avoiding Bitcoin? I think I know why, and it’s not at all irrational.\n\n1. It’s too Volatile\n\nThe problem for most investors is that cryptocurrencies are too risky as they see values change shape from day to day. Many investors shy away from ventures that tend to be solid one day, liquid the next, then evaporate overnight. Bitcoin has a long history, but I don’t think you can call it stable\n\n2. ‘Missing the Boat’\n\nWould be investors feel they missed the Bitcoin boat several months ago and are either waiting for a correction or believe they’d be buying at the top of the market. As illustrated below, they feel the boat left the harbor several months ago, and unless it comes back, they are going to wait it out on the docks.\n\n3. People are Still Calling it a Ponzi Scheme\n\nBernard Ebbers, Bernard Madoff, and Bitcoin?\n\nAdmit it, you’ve heard it several times. But is it fair to lump Bitcoin and Ponzi in the same sentence? With major US exchanges like CME Group, CBOE, and Nasdaq getting ready to offer Bitcoin futures trading, it certainly doesn’t seem so.\n\nOf course, there is still a risk of fraud. There are scammers putting out misinformation and that have taken advantage of investors by launching Ponzi schemes that promise guaranteed high returns within 90 days. Even Bitcoin super-evangelist James Altucher claims 95% of the alt-coins are suspect.\n\nBut we know the crypto community is innovative and will find solutions – this too shall pass.\n\n4. Since no Country is Backing Bitcoin, They Don’t Trust It\n\nWhat happens if you get hacked? What happens if you lose your Bitcoin private keys? I know a few people that were mining Bitcoin several years ago left the keys on their hard drive and formatted it before selling the computer to another person. They lost millions and it can’t be recovered.\n\nLet’s face it, digital currency is just a set of zeros and ones circulating out there on the Internet and there isn’t any entity you can ask to honor it\n\n5. They Hear About all the Bitcoin Hacks and are Afraid to Buy It\n\nAnother major problem with Bitcoin is that when exchanges and wallets are hacked, it’s front page news. And we seem to witness a new hack almost every week.\n\nRecently, Bithumb, one of the largest Bitcoin currency exchange was hacked and more than $1 million in cryptocurrencies were lost.\n\n6. There are Very Few Places to Use It\n\nTry spending some Bitcoin at a local retailer. Try finding a local retailer that will accept it. What has your experience been? For years, businesses like Whole Foods, WordPress.com, Overstock, and Subway have accepted bitcoin as payment, but it’s clear that Bitcoin in its current form will not replace cash or credit cards.\n\nBitcoin is the proverbial turtle to the cash and credit hare. Today, you can pay a fee and wait 20 minutes for your Bitcoin transaction to clear or swipe a credit card and get an instant confirmation. Which would you choose?\n\n7. It’s Too Hard to Buy\n\nFor most people like me, we don’t want to spend hours or days setting up our own bitcoin wallet, we want to go to a site like Coinbase to handle most of the process for us. The trouble with Coinbase, at least for me, is that it took me several days to be verified and several more to transfer money into my account.\n\nAltogether, it took three times as long to set up as my business banking account. That’s not good.\n\nNote: there’s a new option that promises to do it quicker, I wrote about Ankorus’s solution here.\n\n8. It’s Unregulated\n\nUnlike every other securitized investment, Bitcoin is not regulated by any government or bank. For some, this is why they trade in Bitcoin, but for many investors, they remain on the sidelines because of the potential for fraud.\n\nWhy isn’t Bitcoin currently regulated? Because in April 2017, A US federal judge ruled that cryptocurrency is exempt from regulation due to an obscure law passed over 40 years ago.\n\nThe Monopoly Act, also known as HB 1010, exempts imitation money and was enacted during the Nixon Watergate scandal (you can’t make this up).\n\nThe act provided an unintended loophole for cryptocurrency – it reads in part:\n\nNo token, bill, virtual currency, or counterfeit money, whose purpose it is to parody legal tender or otherwise serve as a novelty, and where such can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, shall be subject to taxation, regulation, or licensing by any branch of government, but shall instead enjoy free and unrestricted exchange.\n\nSo in his interpretation of the law, the federal judge ruled that cryptocurrencies are by definition virtual currency, by virtue of a lack of a physical form and issuing bank. Therefore current financial regulations do not apply.\n\n9. Investors Don’t Understand It\n\nBitcoin is designed to limit human participation because humans have differing agendas. To limit human participation means something else must act in our place. Enter the blockchain.\n\nIf you don’t understand the blockchain, you’re not alone. In fact, many Bitcoin investors admit to not understanding blockchain technology which is the foundation of Bitcoin. If you’re in need of a refresher, I found a simple but informative video you can watch to get caught up.\n\nBut because Bitcoin and the blockchain are such major advancements, most people haven’t taken the time to understand them. Few colleges and universities offer cryptocurrency and blockchain courses and most crypto experts are huddled in their own communities and spend little time educating others.\n\nBottom line, if investors don’t understand the blockchain concepts or the risks involved, most won’t invest\n\n10. They (Mistakenly) Believe Only Criminals are Using It\n\nMost investors hear about new investment opportunities through their friends or the media. With Bitcoin, both are notoriously misinformed. To hear the media and government agencies tell it, the only things that Bitcoin is used for are paying for drugs, extorting fees or laundering money on the Internet.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, those things do happen – WannaCry and AlphaBay are proof enough of that – but the truth is that Bitcoin-related criminal activity has actually decreased. In an interview with CNBC, data analytics solutions provider Blockchain Intelligence Group stated that transactions related to illegal activity have fallen from roughly half of Bitcoin’s total transaction volume to about 20%.\n\nIn fact, criminals are beginning ditching Bitcoin in favor of other cryptocurrencies that offer greater anonymity and difficulty tracking transactions.\n\nOf course, investors aren’t hearing about enough success stories (save the ever-rising value of Bitcoin) to counter the negative stories. So, the negative narrative remains.\n\nSumming It All Up\n\nThese aren’t the only reasons potential investors are scared to invest in Bitcoin, but I keep hearing them repeatedly. The community is starting to take steps to address them but we have a way to go yet before we can alleviate them completely.\n\nAre there other factors keeping investors away from Bitcoin that aren’t on this list? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nImages courtesy of Mark Fidelman, Shutterstock, AdobeStock', ""But disagreements within the Bitcoin community are being watched closely by central bankers and financial industry executives. The titans of finance are monitoring Bitcoin’s successes and failures as they experiment with its technological concepts, like the ledger for recording virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain.\n\n$10,000 0 $16,602 2017 April July Oct. The price of Bitcoin has risen sharply in recent months. $15,000 10,000 5,000 0 $16,602 Jan. March May July Sep. Nov. The price of Bitcoin has risen sharply in recent months.\n\nMany large institutions have said they hope to integrate blockchain technology into their designs for the world’s future financial infrastructure, and those designs are likely to be influenced by what is learned from Bitcoin.\n\n“People are looking at this in part because they see the beginnings of a new financial system — a financial system that has a very different structure than the one we have right now,” said Neha Narula, the director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nMr. Lee and others hope Bitcoin can be used for payments someday, but he thinks that will most likely come from software that is built on top of Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin network itself.\n\nNot everyone agrees with Mr. Lee’s position. Many entrepreneurs and academics think virtual currencies will gain traction only if they are easy and cheap to send around. The disagreement has given rise to a host of Bitcoin competitors — including a separate virtual currency known as Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBut the community that has developed around the original Bitcoin has increasingly been united around a vision that is focused on its goldlike qualities, rather than its ability to compete with PayPal or Western Union.\n\n“The reason people own Bitcoin is because it’s a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,” said Jimmy Song, a developer who has contributed to the Bitcoin software. “You can send money to Africa in 10 minutes, but that’s not the main reason people buy it.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Bitcoin was introduced in 2008, the title of the paper written by its creator, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, called the currency an “electronic cash system.”\n\nThe Bitcoin software created a decentralized network of computers that anyone with internet access could join, making it easy to send Bitcoins between addresses. And Bitcoin first gained public notice because of its use as anonymous digital cash on black-market websites like the Silk Road.\n\nThe New York Times Explains...\n\nBut the number of people using Bitcoin to buy things was always small compared with the number of speculators buying it because of its scarcity. This was something the original software behind Bitcoin had also encouraged, by setting a limit of 21 million on the number of Bitcoins that would ever be released.\n\nThe increasing value of Bitcoin made it even less attractive as a way to pay for things. Most people don’t want to pay now with a dollar that could be worth twice as much next week.\n\nThere are also limits on the Bitcoin system’s capacity. A rule written into the Bitcoin software had established that the network could process only around five transactions per second — compared with the 25,000 transactions handled by Visa each second.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many early followers believed the system could expand to handle more transactions without sacrificing its status as a virtual commodity. This camp proposed a change to the Bitcoin rules that would have doubled the capacity of the system in November.\n\nBut Mr. Lee and other investors and programmers worried that quickly expanding the Bitcoin network would threaten Bitcoin’s independence.\n\n“To be a global money, you can’t have one bank or one country controlling the money, or even a handful of countries or banks,” Mr. Lee said. “If decentralization is jeopardized, most things fall apart with Bitcoin.”\n\nDecentralization is a result of Bitcoin’s unusual design, which allows users to keep and monitor the records of every single Bitcoin transaction, without any central authority.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf the number of transactions quickly increased, many Bitcoin aficionados believed, only large companies would be able to keep the records. What’s more, they believed the design of Bitcoin wasn’t well suited to competing with PayPal and Visa, because every transaction has to be recorded on thousands of computers around the world.\n\n“Anyone who looked at Bitcoin and saw ‘cheap payments’ likely doesn’t have much background in computer science,” said Ben Davenport, a co-founder of the virtual currency start-up BitGo and an opponent of doubling the network.\n\nThis argument prevailed, and in early November the plan to double the network capacity was called off.\n\nSince then, people interested in using virtual currencies to make payments have looked to Bitcoin competitors. Stephen Pair, the chief executive of Bitpay, a start-up that helps companies take virtual currency payments, said his customers were looking to move beyond Bitcoin.\n\n“If people can’t engage in commerce, it’s hard to imagine why they’d want to store their money in Bitcoin in the first place,” Mr. Pair said.\n\nMr. Pair believes it is irresponsible to suggest that a virtual currency that has been around for less than a decade could pose a credible challenge to gold. The conceit of Bitcoin as a good place to store money, he added, will be less convincing when the price of Bitcoin goes down, as it has in the past.\n\nOne alternative is Bitcoin Cash, which was created in August. The price of Bitcoin Cash has risen over 125 percent since the plan to double the capacity of the original Bitcoin was called off.\n\nBut there is no shortage of investors who have voted with their pocketbooks for the more cautious approach of the original Bitcoin.\n\nThe price of a Bitcoin has jumped 70 percent over the past month, to more than 10 times the price of an ounce of gold.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“I don’t think most people treat Bitcoin as something to buy because it’ll get feature X, Y and Z in the future,” Mr. Song said. “Mostly, people are investing because they believe it to be a good store of value.”"", 'Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — The booming stock market of the 1920s had the New York Stock Exchange.

Time\n\nA visual representation of the digital cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, alongside U.S. dollars on Dec. 7, 2017 in London, England. (Photo: Dan Kitwood, Getty Images)\n\nThe Bitcoin gold rush accelerated Thursday as the world\'s best-known digital currency barreled through $14,000, $15,000 and $16,000 in an extraordinary price run-up that now values the cryptocurrency at $271 billion, eclipsing Home Depot\'s market worth.\n\nBitcoin\'s surge — which many Wall Street pros claim is a speculative frenzy and financial bubble — has boosted the digital currency\'s market value so much that it\'s now worth more than 488 of the 500 U.S. companies in the Standard & Poor\'s 500 stock index. So, only 12 companies in the large-cap stock index have market values greater than Bitcoin, S&P Dow Jones Indices data through Dec. 6 show.\n\nAt its peak Thursday, Bitcoin jumped more than 25%, rallying $3,325 and hitting an intraday record of $16,568.92 per coin, just eight days after topping $10,000. At 4 p.m. it remained up more than 19% at $15,804. For the year, Bitcoin has surged more than 1,550%.\n\nFrom its low of $11,450 on Tuesday to its peak Thursday, Bitcoin rallied 45% in a roughly 48-hour span. There are now 16.73 million in circulation, according to coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin\'s market value is simply the number of coins out in the market times its price, which is constantly shifting.\n\nThe meteoric rise has caught the attention of Wall Street, which marvels at its steep and quick surge but fears the mania will end badly.\n\nJim Cramer, host of CNBC\'s investment show Mad Money, called Bitcoin\'s most recent spike ""parabolic"" and compared it to a rocket just after launch.\n\n""It has a Cape Canaveral feel,"" Cramer said Thursday morning on the cable business channel, referring to the well-known Florida rocket launch site. ""Maybe Bitcoin is going to Mars. Or Jupiter.""\n\nBut there\'s a growing chorus of Bitcoin watchers warning investors to steer clear of the surging cryptocurrency, despite the lure of quick riches.\n\n""It’s difficult to see anything move as Bitcoin has and not fear a devastating bubble bursting,"" warned Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, a New York-based foreign exchange firm. ""If speculation is playing as big a role in the latest moves as some suspect, then very interesting times may lie ahead.""\n\nBut Erlam says Bitcoin could rise a lot more ""before the bubble bursts.""\n\nMore: What\'s Bitcoin exactly, and should I invest in it?\n\nMore: Bitcoin\'s big swing at $11,000 launches renewed talk of bubble\n\nMore: Bitcoin\'s speculative fever makes rally in stocks look tame\n\nBitcoin backers view it as a currency and payment system of the future as well as a new kind of investment. They say it\'s an emerging alternative to the dollar, euro and yen and an investment such as gold, stocks or bonds.\n\nSkeptics say Bitcoin is impossible to value, wildly volatile and a speculative play that may never gain widespread acceptance.\n\nThe bullish thesis has gotten a boost in recent weeks after a U.S. security regulator gave the OK for options exchanges to launch bitcoin futures.\n\nSunday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange is set to become the first regulated U.S. exchange to offer Bitcoin futures trading. The move is seen as helping legitimize Bitcoin and paving the way for greater acceptance from large institutional investors.\n\nAnother plank in the bull\'s case is that there will be a limited number — 21 million — of Bitcoins created.\n\nBitcoin works off blockchain technology, akin to an anonymous digital ledger that is not regulated by any government or financial institution.\n\nBitcoin, which is now valued at $270.6 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com, is nearly one-third the value of Apple, the world\'s most valuable company, which was worth $867.8 billion as of Wednesday\'s close, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is fast-approaching the value of Walmart, which is $288.2 billion, and could soon eclipse Wells Fargo, currently $288.4 billion, and Bank of America, now at $298.7 billion. Bitcoin could overtake these iconic American companies if the momentum rally continues.\n\n""The Bitcoin rush is not over,"" Yann Quelenn, analyst at Swissquote Bank, an online bank in Switzerland, told USA TODAY via email.

The S&P 500 gained 0.29 percent and the Nasdaq 0.54 percent.\n\nStill to come was U.S. nonfarm payrolls, with investors looking for 200,000 new jobs in November and much talk wages might show some welcome strength.\n\nSterling which briefly rose as high as $1.3521 on the Brexit accord, two cents above its low of $1.3320 on Thursday, last traded at $1.3461 , down 0.1 percent for the day.\n\nIt was one of only a few currencies to gain on the U.S. dollar, which was otherwise broadly firmer.\n\nThe U.S. currency cleared 113.00 yen to reach 113.34, while the euro touched a two-week low at $1.1763. Against a basket of currencies the dollar held firm at 93.848.\n\nDIGITAL DARLING\n\nBitcoin crested above $16,666 on the Bitstamp exchange having doubled in value in just two weeks.\n\nBut within a few hours it dropped almost 15 percent from that level to as low as 14,239 in volatile trade, intensifying the debate about whether it is a bubble about to burst. It last stood at $15,641, down 6 percent on the day.\n\nThe largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange has been struggling to manage record traffic, with an imminent launch of the first bitcoin futures contract further fuelling investor interest.\n\nSome, however, warned the coming of futures might prove to be the downfall of the digital darling.\n\n“Dragging bitcoin into the futures market poses a risk of big players opening doors to short-selling hell,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.\n\n“Futures markets make it possible to short in decent size with a lot of liquidity, thus affecting the price discovery in the underlying asset market.”\n\nThe spectacular rise of the cryptocurrency has stolen some thunder from gold bulls, providing an asset that is also seen as a hedge against inflation and government interference.\n\nGold steadied at $1,258.10, having finally breached its recent tight trading range to hit a four-month trough at $1,245.60.\n\n“Demand for gold relative to supply has had centuries to reach an equilibrium,” noted Alan Ruskin, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank. “Bitcoin global demand is still finding its place relative to constrained/inelastic supply.”\n\nOil prices had gone the other way as a threatened strike by oil workers in Nigeria forced a bout of short covering.\n\nBrent futures were barely changed at $62.19 a barrel, having climbed 98 cents overnight. U.S. crude was off 4 cents at $56.65.', ""I'm sitting at my kitchen table at 6:31 p.m. ET on Friday, December 1, 2017. The price of Bitcoin is $10,790.58.\n\nIt's here that I'm reminded of something Warren Buffett's often said. Price is what you pay, value is what you get.\n\nSo what value does a Bitcoin buyer get in exchange for $10,790.58 of his or her hard earned U.S. dollars? That's what I'm going to attempt to answer in this article.\n\nBefore we can attempt to value Bitcoin, we first must agree on what it is. That turns out not to be so easy.\n\nIs Bitcoin a currency?\n\nDescribing Bitcoin as a currency seems like a natural place to begin. After all, I'm told some retailers accept Bitcoin as a method of payment. On closer inspection, however, comparing Bitcoin to a currency is like comparing lightening to a lightening bug (apologies to Mr. Clemens).\n\nAs the WSJ has noted, Bitcoin is the hottest currency that nobody is using. As Jeffrey Dorfman here at Forbes pointed out, there are two problems with Bitcoin as a currency.\n\nFirst, it's too unstable. Who wants to accept something for payment that could drop in value by 25% before you have time to pour a cup of coffee? Put another way, would you accept Bitcoin as payment for a car you were selling if you had to wait 60 days to convert it to dollars? I doubt it."", ""Many investors have said the most important factor driving the current enthusiasm is the entry of hedge funds and other institutional investors.\n\nThe path for large investors has been smoothed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange, which have been racing to roll out Bitcoin futures contracts. Most banks are already signed up with these exchanges and consequently can immediately begin trading the contracts. The options exchange has said it plans to start trading on Sunday.\n\nIt is still unclear how the arrival of Bitcoin futures will influence the demand for the digital tokens.\n\nWith a futures contract, banks can bet on the price of Bitcoin without holding the underlying Bitcoins. This is expected to bring many new players into the market who don’t want to deal with the complications of holding Bitcoins.\n\nBut the futures contract will also allow investors to short Bitcoin, or bet on the price’s going down, which has been hard to do until now. Some analysts think this could put downward pressure on the price. Other market participants have worried that Bitcoin futures could spread the risks of Bitcoin into the rest of the financial system.\n\nPeople still use Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to make ransom payments and buy illegal goods online, including synthetic opioids. But that activity has been on the wane since the authorities shut down some of the largest online black markets this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat role are smaller investors playing in the virtual currency markets?\n\nIndividual investors have been just as active as large investors.\n\nNowhere has the phenomenon of ordinary people buying virtual currencies been more visible than in South Korea, where several exchanges have storefronts to help new customers. This is all the more remarkable because just a year ago, Koreans showed almost no interest in these markets.\n\nSmall Japanese investors have also been investing in Bitcoin. They have been encouraged by laws passed this year that essentially legalized Bitcoin and allowed Bitcoin exchanges to get regulatory licenses.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Coinbase now has more account holders than Schwab, and it has struggled to keep up with the growth.\n\nChina used to be the most active country for Bitcoin trading and mining, but the authorities there have cracked down this year.\n\nWhat are the dangers of getting into this market?\n\nMany of the largest exchanges, including in South Korea, are essentially unregulated. The lack of oversight means that no one is checking that the exchanges are properly securing their customers’ money or that large players are not able to manipulate the price. One of the largest exchanges in the world, Bitfinex, has been hacked numerous times and provides little transparency about where it is keeping its money.\n\nEven regulated exchanges, like Coinbase in the United States, have not been battle tested like larger financial institutions, and their operations have gone down at key moments.\n\nOnce people buy Bitcoin or other virtual currencies, they are often targeted by hackers who have become experts at penetrating Bitcoin accounts. Bitcoin “wallets” are vulnerable to new kinds of attacks that are not a problem for ordinary financial accounts.\n\nMost important, in contrast to money in a bank account, when a Bitcoin is gone there is essentially no way to get it back and no insurance covering its loss.\n\nAre more people using Bitcoin to pay for things?\n\nWhen Bitcoin was released in 2009, it was described as a new kind of electronic cash.\n\nRecently, though, many programmers working on Bitcoin have said the system in its current form is not a particularly good way to pay for things. They argue that it is best designed to serve as a sort of scarce commodity, like digital gold, allowing people to keep their money outside the control of governments and companies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany people who want to use virtual currencies for online payments are looking to Bitcoin competitors, like Bitcoin Cash and Monero.\n\nWhat role are the other virtual currencies playing in this frenzy?\n\nEarlier this year, bullish sentiment was focused on Ethereum, a virtual currency network that is more adaptable than Bitcoin. The price of Ether, the virtual currency on the Ethereum network, has continued to rise in recent months, but not as fast as Bitcoin.\n\nMany investors were also putting their money into custom virtual currencies released by entrepreneurs in so-called initial coin offerings. These new virtual currencies have generally been designed to serve as the internal payment mechanisms on new software the entrepreneurs are building.\n\nThis fall, though, regulators have signaled that they are planning to crack down on coin offerings.\n\nWhere did virtual currencies come from, and how do they work?\n\nThe Bitcoin software was released in early 2009 by a mysterious creator who went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. The search is still on for the true identity of Satoshi.\n\nThe software released by Satoshi set out the basic rules for Bitcoin and the computer network on which it lives. Unlike other forms of money, which are controlled by governments and financial institutions, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers that no one institution controls. For more details, see our Bitcoin explainer."", 'Bitcoin prices are hockey-sticking on a hockey stick.\n\nThe cryptocurrency’s gains Thursday morning hit new heights, striking well above $18,000 across widely varying exchanges, coming to rest above $16,000 while the popular Coinbase exchange had been suffering major issues due to “record high traffic.”\n\nBitcoin was trading below $8,000 two weeks ago.\n\nThis is a truly, truly volatile game at this point; the swings didn’t appear as consequential when the market cap rested in the low billions, but as institutional pocketbooks push that cap to nearly $300 billion, the stakes are raised considerably.\n\nWhat’s further disturbing is how widely the prices are varying across exchanges — there doesn’t seem to be a stable consensus on where the price is. While bitcoin prices on Coinbase’s GDAX exchange approached nearly $19,000 (!!!) this morning, others had the price sitting at thousands of dollars less.\n\nThe price is currently trading at $15,499 on Bitfinex and $17,639 on GDAX. Coindesk’s bitcoin price index currently has the cryptocurrency trading around $16,000. These figures have probably swung by several hundred dollars since I typed this sentence.\n\nThe fact that even the most established exchanges are having trouble holding consensus on price isn’t great for buyers who can stand to lose (or gain) to exchange volatility on a currency that already has volatility baked into its ethos at this young stage.\n\nThe arbitrage opportunities appear to be significant here; generally, that alone is enough to correct the markets, but extreme congestion in both the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains are making it much harder to move bitcoin and ether between exchanges. For example, New York-based Gemini had temporarily suspended both bitcoin and ether withdraws this morning because the odds of a transaction actually processing were so low.\n\nSomething to always keep in mind:', 'Bitcoin’s value crossed the $15,000 threshold for the first time today, marking another milestone in its dizzying ascent. In recent months, the cryptocurrency has undergone a staggering increase in value; surging from roughly $3,500 in mid-September to its current price. And at the start of the year, a single Bitcoin was worth less than $800.\n\nWhat happens next is anyone’s guess, and most analysts are united only in their uncertainty over the cryptocurrency’s future. Bitcoin long ago stopped being useful for actually buying things (partly because of its rocketing value and partly because of achingly-slow transaction times), so the questions facing speculators are: is this a bubble? And if so, when will it burst?\n\nSome traders figure we’re getting close, and are preparing to short Bitcoin; that is, make bets that its value will decrease in the future. “[It’s] one of the greatest shorting opportunities ever,” cryptocurrency Lou Kerner told Bloomberg earlier this week. “You have a lot of zealotry, and a lot of people, including me, who think it’s the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of mankind. You have a lot of people who think it’s a bubble and a Ponzi scheme. It turns out both of them can’t be right.”\n\nAlthough the general trend for Bitcoin’s valuation is only up, the cryptocurrency has been extremely volatile. On November 29th, for example, its value fell 20 percent in less than an hour and half; dropping from over $11,000 a tick above $9000. For true believers, such blips are only temporary, but skeptics caution that any plunge could end up being permanent. After crossing $15,000 earlier today it’s value quickly dipped down to around $14,800.\n\nRead more: 2017 is the year cryptocurrency joined the financial system\n\nBitcoin’s skyrocketing valuation has also brought with it a new problem: energy costs. It takes enormous amounts of power to sustain the Bitcoin network, and, according to a report from Ars Technica, it’s estimated that the cryptocurrency currently consumes as much electricity annually as the whole of Denmark. Predicting exactly how this consumption will rise or fall in the future is difficult (it depends on things like the rate at which new bitcoins are mined and the number of transactions), but given that Bitcoin only currently has use as a speculative asset class, it seems unsustainable.\n\nMeanwhile, financial experts are struggling to make sense of the phenomenon as a whole. One analyst quoted by the Financial Times, Walter Zimmerman, suggests that the best way to look at Bitcoin is as an absurd video game with no boundaries. “Users of other currencies find utility in a stable value. But not here in Bitcoin world,” writes Zimmerman. “The reality of Bitcoin is that users are also players. And the objective of this game is the highest possible score.” But how much higher can it go?', 'Are Bitcoin and trading cryptocurrencies legal in India? The government has not come up with a definite answer but with multiple contradicting statements over the years. When it comes to the regulation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in India, there are three most relevant authorities where the word can come from— the Government of India, the Supreme Court or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Let’s analyze, what their views have been so far, and the direction in which we are headed.\n\nReserve Bank of India\n\nReserve Bank of India has so far come with two announcements related to the legal status of Bitcoin. The first one, issued on Dec. 24, 2013, warned people against the ‘potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to.’\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2017, the Reserve Bank reiterated its stance, stating that it has not given ‘any license/authorization to any entity/company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency. As such, any user, holder, investor, trader, etc. dealing with Virtual Currencies will be doing so at their own risk.’\n\nOn Sep. 13, 2017, Sudarshan Sen, RBI’s executive director, speaking at an official event said:\n\n""Right now, we have a group of people who are looking at fiat cryptocurrencies. Something that is an alternative to the Indian rupee, so to speak. We are looking at that closely.""\n\nHowever, he further added:\n\n""As regards non-fiat cryptocurrencies, I think we are not comfortable...non-fiat cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins, for example.""\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2017, RBI reiterated their warning for the third time.\n\nIndian Government and the Supreme Court\n\nAfter a long grey period, in June 2017, it was reported that the Govt. of India is considering regulating Bitcoin and granting it a legal status, after a govt. appointed committee gave it a positive nod. However, this never materialized.\n\nAn interdisciplinary committee formed in April 2017 by the Finance Minister of India, Arun Jaitley, had in its report submitted on Aug. 2nd, 2017, recommended banning all cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn November 2017, the Supreme Court ordered the government to respond to a petition filed in the Supreme Court pleading to regulate the flow of Bitcoin and ensure that this virtual currency be made accountable to the exchequer.\n\nA few weeks after this judgment, on Nov. 30 2017, the finance minister of India, Arun Jaitley, speaking at an event reiterated RBI’s stance:\n\n“...As far as the Indian government’s stance is concerned, we have not given any legitimacy to cryptocurrency. Yes, we have received the report, and it is under examination.”\n\nBlockchain—not Bitcoin\n\nSome of India’s largest banks, including ICICI, SBI, and Kotak Mahindra, have been utilizing Blockchain technology. RBI’s executive director had hinted that RBI is looking into creating its own cryptocurrency like the central banks of England or China. Soon after this, news broke out that the Govt. of India has plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency named ‘Lakshmi’ (named after the Hindu goddess of wealth).\n\nCurrently Bitcoin faces multiple challenges from existing laws in India, mainly from the RBI Act of 1934, the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999, and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002. Any legalization of Bitcoin or introduction of a new cryptocurrency, even if RBI controlled, will need an amendment in the RBI Act of 1934 and FEMA, at least.\n\nThe government has been taking a ‘wait and watch’ policy when it comes to cryptocurrencies— but it will prove to be disastrous, since, as we speak, more and more Users are trading cryptocurrencies in India. As per the President of Blockchain.com, Nicolas Cary, over 2,500 Indian Users trade cryptocurrencies every day.\n\nThe overall legal development in relation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in India, however, is taking a perceivable direction: ditch Bitcoin and adopt the technology behind it.', 'Some people kill time at the airport by browsing duty-free shops. I decided to shop for bitcoin.\n\nBut first, there are two things you should know about me: I tend to be almost as afraid of losing money investing as I am of flying. On some level, I figured one fear might cancel out the other.\n\nSo last Thursday, while waiting for a flight to Nashville, I pulled up a popular application called Coinbase that can be used to buy and sell bitcoin. The virtual currency had hit $10,000 for the first time a couple days earlier, before retreating somewhat. News of bitcoin\'s rapid rise was everywhere, including on CNN.\n\nRelated: What is bitcoin?\n\nFor 15 minutes at the airport, I refreshed the price of bitcoin over and over, watching as it gained and lost hundreds of dollars in a matter of minutes. I called out the price fluctuations breathlessly to my wife, who gently encouraged me not to be an idiot, before returning to her magazine.\n\nShe was in good company. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently called bitcoin a ""fraud"" and suggested people who buy it are ""stupid."" Warren Buffett called bitcoin a ""mirage"" in 2014 and warned investors to ""stay away.""\n\nAre you trading Bitcoin? We want to hear from you.\n\nAnd yet bitcoin has climbed more than tenfold since Buffett\'s warning. Earlier this month, one college friend casually told me over drinks he\'d made tens of thousands of dollars investing in another cryptocurrency. He said he hoped it would be worth enough one day to buy a house.\n\nWhen I saw the price of bitcoin fall to $9,500, I pressed buy, defying the wisdom of two finance titans and my wife. One hundred dollars, or 0.0101 bitcoins. (A few days later, I bought another $150.) By the time we got to our hotel, my stake had already gone up 10%. One week later, it was (briefly) up 100%. My wife\'s opinion of me has reportedly decreased by the same amount.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nIt\'s an investing frenzy, plain and simple.\n\nBitcoin cracked $1,000 on the first day of 2017. By this week, it was up to $12,000, and then it really took off: The price topped $17,000 on some exchanges Thursday, and $18,000 on at least one. Other cryptocurrencies have seen similar spikes, though they trade for much less than bitcoin.\n\nThere\'s a long list of factors people may point to in an attempt to explain this. Regulators have taken a hands-off approach to bitcoin in certain markets. Dozens of new hedge funds have launched this year to trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The Nasdaq and Chicago Mercantile Exchange plan to let investors trade bitcoin futures, which may attract more professional investors.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin plunges more than $2,500 after hitting new record\n\nYet a key reason the price of bitcoin keeps going up is, well, because it keeps going up. Small investors like yours truly have a fear of missing out on a chance to get rich quick. And when the value of your bitcoin doubles in a week, as it did for me, it\'s easy to think you\'re a genius. But you can get burned assuming it will keep skyrocketing.\n\nSome investors have likened the bitcoin hype to the dot-com bubble. Others, like Dimon, have said it\'s even ""worse"" than the Dutch tulip mania from the 1600s, considered one of the most famous bubbles ever.\n\nAs Buffett put it back in 2014, ""the idea that [bitcoin] has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view."" Bitcoin is not backed by a company\'s earnings, or the strength of a government and rule of law. There\'s also no interest or dividends.\n\nWhy would anyone want or need to use bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin serves as a new kind of currency for the digital era. It works across international borders and doesn\'t need to be backed by banks or governments.\n\nOr at least that was the promise when it was created in 2009. The surge and volatility of bitcoin this year may be great for those who invested early, but it undermines bitcoin\'s viability as a currency.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environment\n\nRight now, I can use my bitcoin holdings to pay for purchases at Overstock (OSTBP), or book a hotel on Expedia (EXPE). But if I use bitcoin to buy $25 worth of socks on Overstock today, and the price of bitcoin quadruples next week, I\'ll feel like those socks actually cost me $100. Then again, if bitcoin crashes, at least I\'ll always have the socks.\n\nRather than a currency, bitcoin is being treated more like an asset, with the hope of reaping great returns in the future.\n\nSo is there anything truly valuable about bitcoin?\n\nYes, the technology behind it.\n\nBitcoin is built on the blockchain, a public ledger containing all the transaction data from anyone who uses bitcoin. Transactions are added to ""blocks"" or the links of code that make up the chain, and each transaction must be recorded on a block.\n\nEven bitcoin critics like Dimon have said they support the use of blockchain technology for tracking payments.\n\nIs there a legal and legitimate way to invest in bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack.\n\nToday, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product.\n\nThere are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone.\n\nRelated: Millions of dollars stolen in bitcoin hack\n\nWith Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer.\n\nMy original $100 bitcoin purchase won\'t officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won\'t be able to sell at the earliest until Friday.\n\nIf the price plummets before then, I\'m out of luck. No socks for me.\n\n-- CNN\'s Selena Larson contributed to this report.', 'Currently, the cryptocurrency market has not taken its final shape yet. The regulation coming from local government authorities is quite basic, while many still doubt whether blockchain, as it is now, can be applied on a large business scale.\n\nFalse stories appear every now and again, boosting volatility, and some cryptocurrency exchanges are regularly hacked or go bankrupt. All this shows the high-risk nature of the digital coin market.\n\nStill, with all that, the total market cap of the cryptocurrencies exceeds $250B (it was just $40B earlier this year). Bitcoin, Ether, and Bitcoin Cash are the leaders, with $256B, $40B, and $22B respectively at the time of writing.\n\nSuggested Articles\n\nMajor Investing and Trading Instruments\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is by far the greatest driver of the market. The first bitcoin exchange transaction took place in September 2009, when 5,050 bitcoins were exchanged for US$5.02. To date, BTC broke through $14,500 and is now the most valuable asset on the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has become a profitable investment for many, but there are many who are just approaching this instrument, too. High volatility brings a lot of excitement and anxiety, but also allows the speculators to capitalize on short-term moves.\n\nEther (ETH) is the second most popular digital currency, and also second by market cap. Most of the market players regard it as an investment vehicle, not a speculative asset. Apart from these two cryptocurrencies, investors and traders use such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Bitcoin Gold, Litecoin, Dash, NEO, Monero, and IOTA.\n\nMajor exchanges offer cryptocurrency pairs trading, with BTC/ETH, DSH/BTC, and LTC/BTC being the most popular. To trade such pairs, one needs to thoroughly analyze the news and keep informed on the important events of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCurrently, not only professional investors but also general public becomes more interested in cryptocurrencies.\n\nTrading Bitcoin with a Broker\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get familiar with cryptocurrencies is opening a trading account with a major FX broker. Lately, upon cryptocurrency boom, more and more brokers have been offering digital currency trading to their clients. Trading conditions do not vary much from one broker to another.\n\nMore often than not, brokers provide access to cryptocurrency trading through MT4 and MT5 platforms. Let’s take BTC/USD for example. On average, the minimum position amount is BTC 0.1, with the spread of 0.30% or 0.40%, thus making it reasonable to trade on H1 and larger time frames. Leverage varies from 1:1 to 5:1, so you will need to deposit $200 to $1,000 in order to start trading. The broker usually takes a fee of 0.20% to 0.30% of the transaction amount.\n\nIt should be noted that bitcoin trading with a broker means trading contracts for difference (CFD’s) that enable taking profit in both rising and falling markets without physically owning the asset. For maximum security of your funds, we recommend you open accounts only with trusted brokers that are regulated by such prominent financial authorities as ASIC, CySEC, FCA, etc.\n\nTrading Strategy\n\nWhen it comes to bitcoin trading strategies, one should remember that, basically, BTC is a market asset, just like any other one. In this light, it can be influenced by the same fundamental and psychological factors as other financial instruments.\n\nYou surely remember that story of buying a pizza for a few thousands of bitcoins when the digital currency had been just introduced. Since then, however, Bitcoin price skyrocketed, so the buy-and-hold strategy is unlikely to bring you large profits now.\n\nAccording to a widespread opinion, there are very few historical data to rely on technical analysis when it comes to bitcoin, and that’s why one should invest time into studying news and learning how the market reacts to it. Such an opinion is reasonable, as, indeed, news and events do influence the cryptocurrency markets. Still, saying that tech analysis is not going to work is at least unjust, or even unwise. Using tech analysis is as feasible as with other financial instruments, for the trends in cryptocurrencies also form regularly and logically.\n\nBitcoin Auto Trading Strategies\n\nAnother way to trade BTC/USD worth mentioning separately is R Trader, which is a platform enabling trading across various markers. Apart from over 8,000 US stock market assets (equities and ETF’s), German and Swiss stock market instruments, indices, and FX, it also provides you with access to BTC/EUR, BTC/USD, LTC/BTC, ETH/BTC, and ETH/USD.', 'Song Jung-a and Bryan Harris in Seoul DECEMBER 7, 2017 40 A frenzied demand for bitcoin in South Korea has buyers in the east Asian nation now paying premiums of more than 20 per cent compared with international rates. The cryptocurrency on Thursday surpassed $14,000 as the global speculative boom showed no signs of slowing down. But nowhere is demand more acute than in South Korea, where a tech-savvy and trend-sensitive population has taken to bitcoin en masse. Many are now paying exchanges premiums worth as much as 23 per cent. By comparison, bitcoin in Japan — the spiritual home of the cryptocurrency and a key market — is being traded at a premium of between 7 per cent and 9 per cent. “Many Koreans are curious about new technology, so they easily embrace things like bitcoin. The country has advanced IT networks so people have easy access to stock and derivatives trading. The same is true with virtual currency trading here,” said Lee Tai-ki, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Finance. “Such a high premium cannot last long because people will soon take advantage of the arbitrage and buy bitcoin in US exchanges in dollars and sell it in Korea.” Koreans prefer to use bitcoin exchanges in Korea rather than the US because they need to convert Korean won into US dollars to buy bitcoin. They need to pay commissions for the currency conversion and they must have a bank account in the US to pay for bitcoin purchases in US exchanges. The buying spree in South Korea comes despite growing opposition from government officials — a long line of whom have warned about the danger of the digital currency that even school children are attempting to buy. “There are cases in which young people, including students, are jumping in to make quick money and virtual currencies are used in illegal activities like drug dealing or multi-level marketing,” Lee Nak-yon, South Korea’s prime minister, warned last month. Recommended The Big Read: Bitcoin — an investment mania for the fake news era What happens when bitcoin’s market cap overtakes world GDP? Opinion: Bitcoin is a faith-based asset for a populist era The comments followed a high-profile decision by Seoul in September to ban initial coin offerings, a popular mechanism for companies to raise cash by issuing coins in exchange for cryptocurrency. Those coins can later be used to buy products or services offered by the company. This week South Korea’s Financial Services Commission banned the trade of bitcoin futures just days after US regulators gave the green light to two of the world’s largest exchanges, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets. “This is basically like a Ponzi scheme — trading with no substance. Investors are basically passing the bomb. Still, its trading volume has surpassed the Kosdaq’s,” said one government official, referring to South Korea’s minor bourse. South Korea, the world’s third-largest bitcoin market, accounts for 12 per cent of global trade volume, trailing Japan and the US which take up 49 per cent and 27 per cent respectively, according to market tracker Coinhills. “There are two risks: first, you risk losing the underlying technology and second, you risk seeing a lot of investment victims. We have to care more about the second risk,” Mr Lee said. He added: “Everyone is looking at it as a hot investment item despite it not being widely used as an alternative currency. The market has become completely unpredictable.” Additional reporting by Kang Buseong Bitcoin’s existential crisis Play video Sign up to the weekly #fintechFT email One-Click Sign Up  to #fintechFT']"
12/08/2017,"['Bitcoin’s price has risen stratospherically, a fact that leaves many minor players in the market with massive gains and many bigger players millionaires. But is this a bubble? Are the gains real? And are the bitcoin whales in for a sad Christmas?\n\nFirst we must understand what drives bitcoin price and, in particular, this boom. The common understanding for current growth leads us back to institutional investors preparing for the forthcoming BTC futures exchanges.\n\nThe primary theory about the astonishing rally being put forward by investors on social media is that bitcoin will soon benefit from big institutional money injections via the introduction of the first BTC futures products. CBOE Global Markets and CME Group are launching new futures contracts on December 10 and December 17, allowing investors to go long or short on bitcoin. This ability makes bitcoin far more palatable to big investors who are currently flooding the market to make profits if and when the bitcoin price falls.\n\nThis move also legitimizes bitcoin in Wall Street’s eyes, an important point considering cryptocurrencies are still suspect.\n\nFurther growth comes from the “bitcoin as a store of value” crowd. This group of enthusiasts bought and held bitcoin and will not sell it at any current price. More and more bitcoin fans are entering into this group and they are driving up demand increases. In a world where people expect bitcoin to be worth $1 million soon this sort of activity – whether rational or irrational – is quite popular.\n\nWe see a common thread between these points: hype and news. All cryptocurrency movements are based on domain specific media and conversations between traders. Bitcoin traders, it can be said, are now akin to the jolly colonists selling stocks under buttonwood tree. This small but influential market is prone to panics based on a single tweet and users work together to at least bolster themselves with cries of “HODL!” The market is so nascent that there are no dark pools, no popular algorithmic trading systems, and no real way to automate your buying and selling activities (although, without futures, there was never a need to). That is all coming and at that point the market will harden itself against panics and booms. Until then we enjoy rises and dips and volatility that puts most bitcoin dilettantes off their lunch.\n\nUltimately new and old users are testing the limits of a system that, for a decade, has been untested. The futures market will be a big driver in growth and bust over the next few months as institutional investors begin using the currency. CoinDesk writer Omkar Godbole notes that the price should remain stable but “a pullback to $11,000 cannot be ruled out, but dips below the upward sloping 10-day MA of $11,500 are likely to be short-lived.”\n\n“As of now, a significant correction is unlikely and could be seen only on confirmation of a bearish price-RSI divergence and/or if RSI and stochastic move lower from the overbought territory,” he wrote.\n\nIs this dangerous? Yes, to those who are betting big on BTC. Again, I cannot tell you whether to buy or sell but the common expectation is that bitcoin raises to a set point and then fluctuates between a high and a low until the next run up. Many expect foul play.\n\n“The current price isn’t truly driven by demand. When CME Group went live with Bitcoin futures we saw a sharp increase in demand and an increased number of users in the network,” said Matthew Unger, CEO and Founder of iComplyICO. “Now, some institutional major players are flooding the network with new cash and creating what appears to be market manipulation. Now that Bitcoin futures are available it is easy to buy into futures market first and then create a massive number of buys or sells of Bitcoin to ensure the price swings in favour of your futures contract.”\n\n“In many jurisdictions, Bitcoin has yet to become subject to regulations, leaving an investor with no recourse or protection from fraud or market manipulation,” said Unger.\n\nIs this a bubble? Many are disappointed in the moves, believing the rise is happening because of market manipulation. But we must remember that the real value of a cryptocurrency is not driven by price but instead is driven by utility. While bitcoin may always be the proverbial hidden pot of gold for early buyers the future of all cryptocurrencies is still being written. Just as, in 1994, no one could have predicted the prevalence and value of open source projects like Linux and Apache, no one can currently predict what bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will do for us in the future. Until we know, it’s best to buckle up and enjoy the ride.', '', 'Cboe Global Markets\' bitcoin futures product launches Sunday.\n\nCboe is basing its bitcoin futures contract on pricing on Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins.\n\nBitcoin futures will allow investors to bet on the future price of the red-hot cryptocurrency.\n\nBut a number of concerns hang over Gemini including low volumes on the exchange and system outages.\n\n\n\nAll eyes will be on Cboe Global Markets on Sunday when it launches futures contracts for bitcoin.\n\nThe Chicago-based derivatives market is the first established exchange to roll-out futures for the red-hot digital currency. Futures are contracts that will let investors bet on the coin\'s future price.\n\nWhile bitcoin enthusiasts are excited about the attention — and big money — a new futures market could bring to the digital coin, concerns hang over Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange Cboe is working with to launch the contracts.\n\nFounded in 2015 by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who reportedly own a billion dollars of bitcoin, Gemini is one of the best-connected firms in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n\n\nBut Gemini is still small, and trading in its price-setting auction is thin enough that it could be manipulated, according to critics. Cboe will be basing the price of its futures on this auction, which means any sudden shift in the set price could make the difference between a contract that is a money maker or a money loser.\n\nThen there\'s the fact that Gemini has suffered outages when demand for bitcoin skyrockets.\n\nGemini tracks the overall market pretty closely with an average difference of just 0.1%, according to Gemini data. The product was designed with one exchange to make it easier for traders to hedge their holdings of the underlying asset. And Cboe would rely on a backup index based on data from six exchanges if Gemini were to crash.\n\nGemini did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nSmallest among rivals\n\nGemini is much smaller than many of its rivals in the bitcoin-trading space. Ranked fourteenth globally by 24-hour trading volumes, the exchange sees only 1.4% of trading in the entire bitcoin market, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nIts size is concerning to some trading firms which don\'t like the idea of an entire market for futures being based on data from one exchange with thin volumes. The logic is, since Gemini is so small, its activity can\'t paint an accurate picture of the broader crypto-market.\n\nCboe\'s futures will be based on the auction price of bitcoin on the Gemini exchange. Settlements for the contracts, the payout a trader either receives or pays out for their bet, will be determined each day at 4:00 p.m. The first settlement is not set to occur until January.\n\n""I\'m concerned that the Gemini auctions often have very low volume and the lack of liquidity may lead to the futures settling at a price that is not indicative of where bitcoin is trading on other venues, due to the localized supply/demand imbalance in the auction,"" Garrett See, the CEO of DV Chain, the cryptocurrency trading arm of Chicago-based DV Trading, told Business Insider.\n\n\n\nMarket manipulation\n\nJohn Spallanzani, the chief macro strategist at GFI Group, told Business Insider Gemini\'s low volumes could be a problem because it could lead to market manipulation.\n\n""The lower the volumes, the easier to manipulate,"" he said. ""Since the volume is low and [bitcoin] is unregulated it is conceivable.""\n\n""The last thing we want is another Libor-type scandal,"" he added, referring to a scandal in which banks rigged the price of the London Interbank Offered Rate to benefit their positions in the derivatives market. Banks have been fined billions of dollars for manipulating the rate, which provided the base for a loan market worth a $300 billion.\n\n""This is one exchange which comprises a relatively small amount of bitcoin dollar traded volumes globally,"" Greg Dwyer, the head of business development at BitMEX, a bitcoin derivatives exchange based in Hong Kong, said, referring to Gemini. ""So there are concerns that there could be adverse price movements due to this illiquidity or some bad actors in the space trying to move the price at settlement.""\n\nSuch market manipulation would not easily get past regulators at the CFTC, the body that oversees futures in the US, according to Dwyer. It also wouldn\'t get by Cboe, which has information sharing in place and would watch for irregularities during the auction. As for Gemini, the exchange is required to know exactly the entities trading on the exchange during the auction because of Know-your-customer requirements by New York law.\n\nCrypto-insiders are also concerned about Cboe\'s futures product. I Am Nomad, a popular crypto-trader who declined to share his true identity for fear of reprisal from his employer, shared his criticism of Cboe\'s futures contracts in a recent Medium post.\n\n""The Gemini Exchange, while being a solid US-based exchange, makes up a very small percentage of the global volume,"" he wrote in a blog post. ""More importantly, the auction itself sometimes has days where it has low volume or doesn’t complete at all.""\n\nDave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes, told Business Insider Gemini\'s size is irrelevant. He said the design of Cboe\'s futures contracts embeds more certainty into the market. Here\'s Weisberger in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\n\n""Using a single point in time auction to create the settlement price at expiration, has advantages. It is more deterministic (investors long bitcoin and short futures can precisely manage their exposure at expiration), and harder to manipulate.""\n\nStill, exchange clients appear to be concerned about Gemini\'s small command of the market. A person familiar with Nasdaq\'s futures contracts, which could launch as early as the second quarter of next year, told Business Insider clients of the exchange voiced their concerns about a product based on too few indexes. Nasdaq\'s bitcoin futures contract will track 50 indexes, whereas CME Group, Cboe\'s cross-town rival, is set to track four.\n\nOutages\n\nWhen volumes have increased on Gemini, the firm has faced challenges staying online.\n\nEarlier this month, the firm showed many users a ""504 Gateway Time-out"" message, which means its servers were not responding to requests. The company posted on its status page that ""systems are currently experiencing degraded performance.""\n\nThe exchange also experienced outages lasting as long as 10 hours in August, according to reporting by Quartz.\n\n“This is not the first scaling challenge we’ve encountered, and it won’t be the last,” Gemini said in a blog post. “We’re continuing to improve our performance and infrastructure monitoring so we can anticipate potential problems more quickly in the future.”\n\nOutages in the crypto-world are commonplace, and Gemini is far from the only exchange dealing with such issues. See told Business Insider crypto-exchanges in a sense are still ""websites"" that lack ""the industrial scale"" of traditional exchanges. And with cryptocurrency volumes topping as much as $26 billion in a single trading day, exchanges and trading firms are under pressure to enhance their technology.\n\nRead more about blockchain, the technology powering bitcoin, here.', 'Image copyright Alessandra Sollberger\n\nIn its early days, Bitcoin might have been dismissed as a quirky tech sector fad.\n\nBut it is rapidly evolving into the mainstream and has already made some people rich.\n\nIf once Bitcoin was seen as a tool for money launderers and drug dealers, it has recently become as commonplace a topic at middle-class dinner parties as house prices.\n\nThere are advertisements on the London Underground proposing ways to invest.

This isn’t really fair to bitcoin. The reality is bitcoin is secure, and ordinary people can protect it without much effort. The real problem is not everyone understands how bitcoin works, which leads them to make choices that expose them to theft.\n\nThis will become clear in the examples below, which describe five common ways that thieves make off with other people’s bitcoin. But first there’s a short explanation of how bitcoin works and why it’s secure (skip this if you’re already familiar).\n\nHow Bitcoin’s Technology Protects Your Funds\n\nYou can think of bitcoin as money that comes wrapped in a safety deposit box. The question then becomes whether you want to operate that box yourself, or entrust a third party to do it for you.\n\nMost ordinary investors choose the latter option, buying, and storing their bitcoin with a service like Coinbase. This is a sensible option since those services rely on the security features built into bitcoin—just like you would do if you hold the bitcoin yourself.\n\nThe other option is to acquire a bitcoin wallet for yourself. This entails keeping track of two strings of keyboard characters—known as a “public key” and a “private key.” You can think of the public key like a deposit slot for your safety deposit box where anyone can give you bitcoin, while the private key is a secret way to open the box that only you should know.\n\nBitcoin is designed so that it’s basically impossible to guess the private key, which means no one can hack or force themselves into your wallet/safety deposit box. (You can read about the math behind it here.)\n\nAll of this means that the only way bitcoin can be stolen is for a thief to trick you—or a third party you rely on—into giving access to it, or for the third party to get compromised. Here are the examples on how this happens, and advice on how to prevent it.\n\nA Thief Obtains the Password for Your Account at a Storage Service\n\nHow it happens: If you use a service like Coinbase, you don’t have to go through the hassle of remembering a public and private key. Instead, it’s more like online banking where you use a user name (typically an email address) and a basic password.\n\nThis also makes it possible for thieves to rob you by obtaining your password. The most common way they do this is by breaking into customers’ email accounts, and then asking Coinbase (or whatever service you’re using) to reset their password. The password reset request is then sent to the compromised email account, allowing the thief access to the bitcoin funds.\n\nHow to prevent it: First, lock down your email account with two-factor authentication to keep the hackers out in the first place. You should also do the same with your bitcoin storage service. In the case of Coinbase, the company already requires a two-factor log-in process that consists of a password and an SMS text. But because texts can be intercepted, you should avail yourself of an app-based verification option such as Google Authenticator. (This may sound complicated, but it’s not. This is they same basic cyber hygiene you should use for any password-protected online service.)\n\nYou Expose Your Private Key\n\nHow it happens: Once again, this risk only exists if you’re not using a service like Coinbase but managing your own wallet. In this situation, someone else might obtain your private key by getting into your email (if that’s where you keep it) or even seeing the private key in the physical world. In one famous example, someone showed their private key on a TV show—and hackers promptly copied it and emptied the person’s wallet.\n\nHow to prevent it: Store your private key off-line on a piece of paper or on a USB stick, and put it somewhere safe—like a real world safety deposit box.\n\nA Hacker Impersonates a Bitcoin Recipient\n\nHow it Happens: Some of the more notorious bitcoin-related hacking stories this year occurred when companies held so-called “initial coin offerings” (a form of fundraising) and asked investors to send them bitcoins. In certain cases, clever hackers impersonated the companies with a fake website and persuaded the investors to send millions of dollars worth of funds to a different bitcoin wallet. Once the bitcoin was sent, there was no recovering it, and both the companies and investors lost their bitcoin.\n\nHow to prevent it: When you go to transfer bitcoin funds to someone, confirm the wallet address is genuine.\n\nYou Rely on an Insecure Third Party\n\nHow it happens: This week’s $64 million theft at the bitcoin mining service, known as NiceHash, appears to have occurred because hackers compromised an employee’s laptop and got access to the company’s payment services. Once the hackers were inside, they gained access to one of the company’s bitcoin wallets—which included funds belonging to NiceHash customers—and emptied it.\n\nThese sort of incidents are a little bit like when hackers compromised Target’s payment system, and stole customers’ credit card information. In the case of bitcoin owners, they are doing business with companies that don’t have proper cybersecurity measures in place—and worse, unlike the Target breach, no one is likely to refund their money.\n\nHow to prevent it: Be careful of the bitcoin companies with which you choose to do business.\n\nThe Exit Scam\n\nHow it happens: A company offers a bitcoin-related service such as an exchange or a market where customers maintain an account in bitcoin. All of a sudden the company vanishes, often after claiming to have been hacked. In reality, the owners pulled an exit scam—vanishing from the Internet with their clients’ bitcoin.\n\nHow to prevent it: Exit scams are often associated with the darker corners of the web or with fly-by-night crypto investment ventures. If these are the sort of places you like to roll with you bitcoin, well, the only advice is “buyer beware.”\n\nThis is part of Fortune’s new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance.

Despite Bitcoin\'s boom, the digital currency just doesn\'t seem to have any impact on the important financial issues of the day, whether that\'s saving, borrowing, or conducting everyday transactions.\n\nIf Bitcoin doesn\'t influence how you save, how you borrow, or how you transact, then maybe there\'s no point paying attention to its staggering rise in 2017. Now might be a good time to push against fears of missing out (FOMO) on the rally, with good reason.\n\nDoes Bitcoin really impact your portfolio or your financial plans? When it comes to retirement there are two major, trillion-dollar themes for savers. Nearly a decade after the financial crisis, Americans are returning to the stock market in droves, having been generally underinvested since the 2008 carnage and the market\'s bottoming a year later. As people return to the market, they\'re doing so using low-cost index mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, instead of high-priced managers. Broadly speaking, this a big positive.\n\nAfter all, the stock market\'s 10%-plus annualized total return over the past 100-years, and a less impressive 7% annual return since December 1997, is the growing bedrock of America\'s retirement system. Big-data tools now show savers how they can plan their finances to meet retirement and other financial goals with a few mouse clicks. Innovations like target-date funds and ETFs are creating new levels of precision when building these plans. All the while, fees are falling fast and Wall Street\'s take is mired a steep decline. These trends are being driven by the BlackRocks, Vanguards and Fidelitys of the world, in addition to robo advisors such as Betterment and Wealthfront.\n\nTo all of this, Bitcoin is utterly non existent: It has no influence on stock market returns, it isn\'t part of the fee-disruption equation, 401k plans tracking the S&P 500 are doing just fine this year despite missing on ""crypto.""\n\nThere\'s talk of a stock market bubble with each new record high, but some of the fastest-rising companies on the S&P 500, from Apple to Facebook and Amazon, are luring the most careful investors like Warren Buffett to Glen Kacher (read our exclusive profile) and Stanley Druckenmiller due to their fundamentals. We\'ll hear from time-to-time about some hedge fund guy buying Bitcoin, and I\'ve even written a story or two about the newest Bitcoin bull, but generally the smart money remains in non-crypto assets.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at a price of 25-times earnings and it carries a dividend yield of about 2%; it\'s not cheap by historical standards but anyone who entered the market in the early 1960s at a similarly expensive valuation and stuck with their plans through good and bad times would likely be enjoying a bountiful retirement. At Forbes\' 100th birthday party, Buffett predicted the Dow will exceed $1,000,000 by the time we turn 200, and that\'s possibly the safest prediction he\'s ever offered.\n\nThe same theme emerges in the big-short and long-term financial moves people have to make in their lives, for instance borrowing to buy a home, finance an education, or in making slightly smaller auto and big-ticket consumer purchases.\n\nThese can be major decisions and the current landscape is marked by plenty of ""disruption."" Virtually all of it is coming from fintech startups, not crypto currencies and their attendant networks. Digital-first companies are becoming mainstays in America\'s largest lending markets; competition is increasing, risk assessments are improving, transparency and seamlessness is rising, consumer costs are broadly plunging.\n\nAfter all, it\'s a new crop of companies like Quicken Loans , SoFi, GreenSky, Credit Karma, LendingClub that are transforming the way everything from a home loan to a college education or pile of credit card debt is handled. Improving credit access is still one of the big non partisan topics of discussion in America and waves of novel solutions are emerging. Entire financing markets, from clean software interfaces originating loans all the way to new securitization markets to distribute debt to institutional investors have emerged in recent years. Bitcoin is nowhere to be found.\n\nEven in payments and other basic transactions, there\'s a growing menu of digital-first options that casts into question whether crypto currencies and their associated networks are actually that relevant.\n\nWhen it comes to electronic payments, it is still Visa and MasterCard who are winning on a dollar basis. Payment volumes at Visa increased 41% in 2017 to $7.3 trillion, at MasterCard volumes rose 10% to $1.4 trillion last quarter. Crypto currencies seek to disrupt these networks, offering no-cost transactions, but the day-to-day flow of money seems to be falling to the incumbents and it is disrupting the use of cash.\n\nMeanwhile, the market isn\'t static. PayPal\'s Venmo has made person-to-person payments cost free and utterly seamless, like a social network of money. Small businesses are gaining new options; Square recently reported a 31% quarterly increase in payment volumes as it offers merchant sellers access to better and lower cost transaction networks. The world\'s most valuable private financial technology company is Stripe , another distruptor in e-commerce and payments.\n\nBehind all of this, it must be said, is the rule of law.\n\nIf you get screwed you may have your day in court. Some entities are bound by investor protections and fiduciary standards. Depending on what\'s being done, there\'s also careful assessments of credit risk, identity, and the like. Yes these entrenched systems are the establishment, but that\'s a major advantage.\n\nOf course, crypto currencies like Bitcoin and their associated networks promise to disrupt it all. It is presented as potentially a new way to raise capital (goodbye Goldman bankers), a new peer-to-peer sharing tool for everything from data to real estate deals, a cheap alternative to transactions (sorry, greedy MasterCard), and even a novel take on the concept of currency itself. Some view Bitcoin as a store of value like gold, or a slightly damaged and possibly fake Leonardo Da Vinci painting. Others view it as part a sort of new world order liberated from tax authorities, governments, and money-printing central banks. Maybe it is the 2017 fear and volatility trade since the Cboe VIX index remains in single digits despite a profusion of global risk?\n\nEveryday, price graphs that resemble the textbook definition of every bubble ever in history are bandied about as evidence of Bitcoin\'s validity. Judging by the relentless and inexplicable gains, there are likely new converts to Bitcoin by the minute, or hour. The price rise may also cause skeptics to dig their heels further, increasing their bubble talk.\n\nThere\'s another, possibly better option: You can simply stick to your plans and ignore Bitcoin.', 'It took nearly five years for the price of bitcoin to finally cross the first $1,000 mark. Comparatively, the next $1,000 increase was a relatively swift three-and-a-half year journey. In the past few months, though, bitcoin has broken through $1,000 thresholds every few weeks. In the past few days, it has taken mere hours.\n\nOvernight, the price of bitcoin briefly climbed above $17,000, just eight hours after it first reached $16,000.\n\nSome of the surge is explained by basic math: Going from $10 to $1,000 is a 9,900% increase, but the latest jump from $16,000 to $17,000 is only a 6% price increase.\n\nAnd, of course, these are just symbolic price barriers and don’t imply that these gains will keep up. This is clear from the cryptocurrency’s extreme volatility. Already today, the bitcoin price has climbed 2% from the open but also dropped by as much as 14%. At the time of writing the price was back down to around $15,000, a fall of 10% on the day, according to CoinDesk.\n\nBitcoin price range Time taken $0-$1,000 4 years, 10 months, 4 weeks $1,000-$2,000 3 years, 5 months, 2 weeks, 5 days $2,000 to $3,000 3 weeks, 1 day $3,000 to $4,000 2 months, 1 day $4,000 to $5,000 3 weeks $5,000 to $6,000 1 month, 2 weeks, 4 days $6,000 to $7,000 1 week, 6 days $7,000 to $8,000 2 weeks, 3 days $8,000 to $9,000 1 week $9,000 to $10,000 3 days $10,000 to $11,000 12 hours $11,000 to $12,000 1 week $12,000 to $13,000 18 hours $13,000 to $14,000 5 hours $14,000 to $15,000 10 hours $15,000 to $16,000 5 hours $16,000 to $17,000 8 hours\n\nAs bitcoin soars higher and new users jump into the market, the larger exchanges where the cryptocurrency is traded are coming under strain. The platforms are reporting outages and other issues more frequently. The prices quoted on different exchanges can be thousands of dollars apart. Meanwhile, suspicions have been raised about “tether”, the digital tokens that allow people to cash in and out of bitcoin quickly, which are supposedly backed by US dollar deposits.\n\nAll this is happening as major derivatives exchanges in Chicago prepare to open up bitcoin trading to Wall Street bigwigs via futures (which allow traders to speculate on the future price of the cryptocurrency) this weekend, and Goldman Sachs said it is preparing to facilitate trades for some of its well-heeled clients.\n\nRead this next: This is the trading firm that could bring bitcoin into the mainstream', 'Bitcoin’s rollercoaster ride continued today, with the price of the digital currency dropping $2,500 in less than 12 hours – only to rise again later in the day.\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin hit a record $17,400 late yesterday but fell to below $15,000 this morning. It is currently trading at around $15,200.\n\nBitcoin’s value has risen by 50 per cent since last Friday, when a single coin was worth around $10,400. The currency started the year with a value of $1,000.\n\nThe surge has been fueled by new people buying into the volatile currency in the hope the price will continue to rise. A speculator does not have to buy a whole bitcoin – they can choose to buy a fraction for as little as a few pounds.\n\nBitcoin was given a further boost earlier this week after two exchanges said they had been granted regulatory approval to begin bitcoin futures trading. Coindesk, a news website dedicated to cryptocurrencies, said this effectively opens the doors to institutional and retail investors.\n\nDaniele Bianchi, an associate professor of finance at Warwick Business School, added it is a “significant step” in treating cryptocurrencies as investment products.\n\nHe said: “This is going to generate increasing pressure on the demand side of the cryptocurrency market. That is, prices are likely to increase further in the short to medium-term.”\n\nTrading on futures exchanges means people are able to line up transactions at a certain point in the future at an agreed price.\n\n‘Tulip mania’ warnings\n\nMany financial commentators view bitcoin as a bubble doomed to pop in the near future. The currency’s spectacular rise in just a few months has been compared to the “tulip mania” in the 17th century and the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital, said: “It’s a bubble for sure in its dynamic, we just don’t know when or how it will collapse.”\n\nBubble about to pop? Bitcoin, which is priced in US dollars, was worth less than 10 cents in October 2010. If you’d bought $30 worth at launch, you’d be a millionaire today. But there are concerns the value will crash as governments and central banks begin to regulate digital currencies. Critics compare bitcoin to the Dutch tulip craze of the 1630s – when investors began to buy tulip bulbs, and exchange them for goods and land. Others say there are similarities to the dotcom bubble, when investors had no clue how to value the wave of new internet companies that were springing up. Despite the warnings of history, advocates believe bitcoin could soar to $100,000.\n\nBitcoin was launched in 2010 and is the largest of all cryptocurrencies. Others include Ether, Ripple and Monero. There is also bitcoin cash, which was spun out of bitcoin earlier this year following a network upgrade.\n\nCryptocurrency has no physical shape or form. The coins are created and stored electronically and transactions are made between individual users, bypassing banks. Advocates say this is the future of money – but others are concerned about security and the fact that it makes money laundering easier.\n\nMost people store their “coins” in online wallets. Those with a large amount prefer to use wallets stored on external hard drives for extra security, as digital currencies are frequently targeted by hackers.', 'The first time I wrote about Bitcoin (BTC) -- the electronic currency used to buy and sell illegal drugs (think Silk Road) and other products through an anonymous public electronic ledger -- was in June 2011, a few days after its price dropped from $17.50 to ""a few pennies"" after its Tokyo-based currency exchanger Mt. Gox was hacked. By February 2014, the last time I wrote about BTC, the price had risen to $556 -- valuing the 12.34 million BTC at $6.9 billion.\n\nBut these days, you have to pay $17,000 or $16,000 per BTC -- making the so-called cryptocurrency worth a mere $268 billion. With the imminent launch of a BTC futures exchange on the CBOE, is there any logic on which to base BTC\'s value in dollars?\n\nAs someone who wrote a book, Net Profit, about investing in Internet stocks before the dot-com bubble burst, I have thought about whether it is possible for anything real to emerge from speculative bubbles.\n\nAnd that experience leads me to two theories that can justify setting a price for BTC anywhere between $0 and infinity.\n\nTheory 1. BTC is pure emotion punctuated by periodic theft\n\nIn this theory, people buy or sell BTC in a wave of fear. Specifically, they are afraid of missing out on further appreciation in BTC\'s price. For those suffering from such fear, there is plenty of evidence to support their belief.\n\nFor example, the compound annual growth of BTC between early June 2011\'s $17.50 and December 7, 2017 (when many prices including $17,000 were quoted) was 182.5%. Since the beginning of 2017, BTC has risen some 17-fold. And not surprisingly, on December 6, $70 million worth of BTC was stolen.\n\nWith such price increases, more and more people are concluding that the biggest risk is not to invest in BTC. What would be helpful now is to be able to see real-time fund flows for each BTC transaction to see how much of the money flowing into BTC now is from institutional investors and individuals as well as who is selling.\n\nOf course, buying BTC can be easier than selling it when its value plunges. That\'s because most institutions accept dollars, not BTC, to conduct business. Therefore, the viability of BTC exchanges is crucial.\n\nSo when BTC exchanges are hacked -- which seems to happen with alarming frequency -- the fear of missing out on further appreciation is replaced with fear of losing investors\' BTC funds.\n\nCrowding at the exits can be bad for those investors -- especially since BTC exchanges are unregulated, are operated by individuals who may or may not be particularly ethical, with an uncertain amount of liquid funds available in the event of a BTC redemption panic.\n\nThe dot-com bubble certainly featured such parabolic swings between greed and terror. Just consider what happened to the price of a share of analytics software maker MicroStrategy -- between April 1999 and February 2000, its stock rose from $86 to $1,387 -- a compound annual rate of 1,891%. By May 2000, MicroStrategy stock had lost 86% of that amount -- tumbling to $190 -- which is considerably above its current value of $134.\n\nOf course, unlike BTC, MicroStrategy is a real company with over $500 million in sales and $108 million in free cash flow.\n\nTheory 2. BTC will make the world run more efficiently\n\nImagine a spectrum of publicly-traded companies. On one end are companies like Ford that make physical objects that generate real revenue and on the other extreme you have companies that have no revenue and a good chance of never getting any.\n\nIn the latter category, you have many publicly-traded biotechnology companies -- which are bets on the ability of scientists and others to turn tiny molecules into drugs that people will buy to cure their illnesses. Along that path there are many risks that could derail the quest -- but investors are happy to assign in some cases billions of dollars in value to these firms\' shares because of the chance that they will succeed.']"
12/09/2017,"['The intersection of digital money and traditional finance is at 400 South LaSalle Street in Chicago this weekend. That’s where trading in bitcoin futures opens Sunday evening, as the first major U.S. exchange offers a product pegged to the wildly fluctuating cryptocurrency.\n\nThe currency has risen more than 1,500 percent this year, and about 85 percent just in the past two weeks, driven largely by demand from individual investors. But even as bitcoin — launched in 2009 as an alternative to banks — divides Wall Street executives and central bankers worldwide, those kinds of gains are a powerful magnet.\n\nThe futures offered by Cboe Global Markets Inc., and similar contracts that start trading in a week at at another Chicago-based exchange, CME Group Inc., may open the door to greater inflows of institutional money, while also making it easier to bet on bitcoin’s decline. Either way, it’s likely trading will start slowly, said Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Investment Partners, which is raising a crypto hedge fund targeted at $500 million.\n\n“If people have expectations that it’s going to have huge liquidity on day one, they’re just wrong,” Novogratz said Thursday in Toronto. “It’s going to take a while to build liquidity. People need to go through at least one cycle to figure out how it settles.”\n\nDerivatives trading is the culmination of a wild year for bitcoin, which captured imaginations and investment around the world, propelled by its stratospheric gains, and its anti-establishment mission as a currency without the backing of a government or a central bank, and a payment system without a reliance on banks. The derivatives contracts should thrust bitcoin more squarely into the realm of regulators, banks and institutional investors. In addition to the contracts at Cboe and CME, which will start trading Dec. 18, Cantor Fitzgerald LP won approval from regulators to trade binary options, and LedgerX, a startup exchange, already trades bitcoin options.\n\n“There will be a ramp-up time,” said Ari Paul, chief investment officer of Blocktower Capital Advisors LP. “There just isn’t a rush. The professional traders will mostly be looking to do arbitrage, between the futures and bitcoin itself. I don’t expect massive money flows right away but then I expect gradual buying from people who want passive exposure” without buying bitcoin directly.\n\nThe two exchanges on Dec. 1 got permission to offer the contracts after pledging to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the products don’t run afoul of the law, in a process called self-certification.\n\n“Derivatives should have the effect of bringing a deeper liquidity to the market which should reduce volatility,” said Alistair Milne, chief investment officer and co-founder of Altana Digital Currency Fund that is based in Monaco. “As the whole cryptocurrency economy gets bigger the volatility should reduce.”\n\nBut not everyone is convinced it’s a good idea. On Dec. 6, the Futures Industry Association — a group of major banks, brokers and traders — said the contracts were rushed without enough consideration of the risks. Last month, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman of Interactive Brokers Group Inc., wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that bitcoin’s large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn’t be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives.\n\nStill, Interactive Brokers will offer its customers access to the futures, though with greater restrictions. They won’t be able to go short — betting that prices will decline — and Interactive’s margin requirement, or how much investors have to set aside as collateral, will be at least 50 percent. That’s higher than either Cboe’s or CME’s margin requirements.\n\nCboe’s futures are cash-settled and based on the Gemini auction price for bitcoin in U.S. dollars. The exchange plans to impose trading limits to curb volatility, halting trading for two minutes if prices rise or fall 10 percent, and a five-minute halt kicks in at 20 percent. Margins for Cboe bitcoin futures, which will be cleared by Options Clearing Corp., will be at 40 percent or higher.\n\nCboe’s futures market is a niche player in derivatives trading, which could limit how many contracts change hands in the initial days. Fueled by contracts on the VIX, the Cboe Futures Exchange handled 56 million contracts during the first three quarters of 2017, according to data compiled by the Futures Industry Association, the industry’s trade and lobbying group. CME traded 3.1 billion contracts in the same period.\n\nSome traders also will prefer CME contracts over Cboe’s because they’re based off four exchanges, instead of just one, reducing risk of disruptions because of outages, attacks or price manipulations.\n\nThe smaller Cboe does have an advantage over CME Group, however, because it’s a major player in stock and equity options trading, giving it access to broker-dealers and investors who may not trade on CME.', 'Gemini, the crypto exchange, extended a scheduled maintenance Saturday after a bitcoin sell-off.\n\nThe exchange appeared to be down for some users for much of the morning.\n\nBitcoin, the red-hot cryptocurrency, shed more than $1,500 during the downtime.\n\n\n\nThe exchange will provide data for Cboe Global Markets\' bitcoin futures contracts, which will go live Sunday.\n\n\n\nGemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the famous Winklevoss twins, has extended a scheduled maintenance of its site after a massive bitcoin sell-off.\n\nThe company said Friday night that its site would undergo maintenance from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. ET Saturday, adding that users shouldn\'t expect ""downtime."" Still, the site appeared to be down for some users during the period, preventing folks from accessing their cryptocurrency accounts.\n\nAt around 1:00 p.m. ET the company said the maintenance would continue:\n\nThe outage coincided with a massive bitcoin sell-off, which shaved more than $1,500 of its price, according to Markets Insider data. By 1:22 p.m. ET, bitcoin was trading down 11% against the US dollar at $14,305 a coin. The outage infuriated some users who were unable to move their coins around as bitcoin\'s price slid.

The company posted on its status page that ""systems are currently experiencing degraded performance.""\n\nThe exchange also experienced outages lasting as long as 10 hours in August, according to reporting by Quartz.\n\n“This is not the first scaling challenge we’ve encountered, and it won’t be the last,” Gemini said in a blog post. “We’re continuing to improve our performance and infrastructure monitoring so we can anticipate potential problems more quickly in the future.”\n\nGemini did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe first bitcoin futures depend on trading at the Winklevoss twins\' tiny exchange — and that\'s a problem', 'NiceHash Hack Raises Questions About Bitcoin Mining\n\nA company in Slovenia that mines bitcoin says it has been hacked, for a potential loss of tens of millions of dollars. The company, NiceHash, gives customers the ability to mine for bitcoins. As the price of the world\'s most popular virtual currency keeps surging -- to a record $15,000 on Thursday -- here\'s a look at what it is and how it is ""mined.""\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that\'s not tied to any bank or government. Like cash, it lets users spend or receive money anonymously, or mostly so; like other online payment services, it also lets them do so over the internet. There are several other virtual currencies, such as ethereum, but bitcoin is the most popular.\n\nBitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators -- and criminals.\n\nHow Is a Bitcoin Mined?\n\nTech-savvy users called ""miners"" use their computers to make complex calculations that verify transactions in bitcoins. This so-called blockchain is a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction. The miners receive bitcoins in exchange according to a set of established rules. In this way, the bitcoin network harnesses individuals\' greed for the collective good.\n\nNiceHash, the company that got hacked, made a business from matching people with spare computing power to those wanting to mine bitcoin.\n\nHow Are Bitcoins Kept Secure?\n\nBecause the tally of bitcoin transactions, or blockchain, is verified constantly by a network of miners, rogues cannot spend the same bitcoin twice. As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn\'t be an issue.\n\nHow Did Bitcoin Come To Be?\n\nIt\'s a mystery. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was then adopted by a small clutch of enthusiasts. Nakamoto dropped off the map as bitcoin began to attract widespread attention. But proponents say that doesn\'t matter: The currency obeys its own internal logic.\n\n© 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Yet Bitcoin, the world’s craziest currency, is supposedly worth nearly £200 billion, which is significantly more than Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC.\n\nIn the past few days, the price of a Bitcoin soared to a dizzy new height of nearly $20,000 before dropping to about $15,000, making multi-millionaires of some early investors as well as a reported $15 billion fortune for its mystery creator.\n\nTo its fans, it is a brilliant invention that will free mankind from the tyranny of corrupt banks. To its critics, it’s a huge hype on a par with 17th Century Tulip Mania that poses a terrifying threat to the financial system.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nIn the past few days, the price of a Bitcoin soared to a dizzy new height of nearly $20,000 before dropping to about $15,000\n\nTo most of us, it’s just baffling – so here is everything you wanted to know about the Bitcoin Bonanza but were too afraid to ask.\n\nWhisper it quietly but I’m not even sure what a Bitcoin is\n\nIt’s a virtual currency, so there are no actual notes and coins – instead, you are given a credit entry for your Bitcoins in a vast online computer ledger, which has an address that is identified by a string of digits and letters.\n\nIn practice, most Bitcoin holders have an online wallet, which functions like a real one, in that you can open it on your PC or smartphone and see how much of the currency you have. These wallets are protected by passwords and authentication codes.\n\nI see... I think. But who creates the Bitcoins and how?\n\nThey’re produced by ‘miners’. It sounds like a strange term but it’s not a bad analogy, because the current Bitcoin fever is a bit like the California gold rush of 1849.\n\nRather than brawny miners with picks and shovels looking for nuggets, Bitcoin miners are brainboxes hoping to strike virtual gold. When setting up Bitcoin, its creator decreed that only 21 million of them can ever be unearthed. The miners do this by using their computers to solve fiendishly difficult maths puzzles. Each time their computers come up with a correct answer, the prize is a Bitcoin.There are more than 16 million in existence now and the puzzles are getting harder and harder.\n\nI got an A in my maths O-level. Can I become a Bitcoin miner?\n\nNot unless you’ve morphed into a computer wizard, no.\n\nI haven’t. Can I buy some?\n\nYes. If you can’t afford a whole one, you can buy fractions (just like a penny is a fraction of a pound).\n\nYou can go to a specialist broker or Bitcoin exchange having set up a virtual wallet which you connect to your phone and email. You will be sent a text message and an email to confirm it’s you, then you link it to your bank account.\n\nAmong the high profile backers are lingerie mogul Michelle Mone and football star Lionel Messi\n\nIn theory it’s simple, but users say in practice there can be annoying glitches and high charges: just like when you buy foreign currency, you will have to pay commission of between two and five per cent.\n\nThere are also Bitcoin ‘cashpoints’ in some local corner shops, though reports this weekend suggested many were not functioning due to high demand. To use these, you have to create a digital wallet, which will have a QR code – a type of barcode – that shows up on your smartphone. At the Bitcoin ‘cashpoint’, there is a touchscreen with the option to buy the currency. You hold your QR code up to the screen, which scans it to find your account.\n\nYou can then feed notes into the slot, just as if you were making a deposit at a cashpoint, and your digital wallet app should register when the payment has been received.\n\nCan I spend Bitcoin in shops and restaurants?\n\nIn theory, yes, though many mainstream retailers don’t accept them.\n\nSteam, the world’s biggest video game store, stopped accepting it as a payment method a couple of days ago, due to ‘high fees’ and volatility.\n\nIs it very volatile then?\n\nI’ll say. Earlier this month, the value of a Bitcoin hit $10,000, which most people thought was astoundingly high – only to nearly double this week at one point to almost $20,000, before lurching down again. If the dollar or the pound behaved like that, there would be utter chaos on world financial markets.\n\nI’m still tempted to buy Bitcoin but do I have any comeback if something goes wrong?\n\nNo. With ‘real money’ in banks there is some consumer protection. If a lender goes bust, up to £85,000 of customers’ money is protected and you might get some back if there has been a fraud, depending on the circumstances. But there is no safety net with Bitcoin.\n\nWho’s the mastermind behind it?\n\nAh. That’s the $15 billion question. The identity of the supergeek who came up with the concept in 2008 remains a tantalising secret. Whoever it is, they are believed to have a holding of about a million Bitcoins theoretically worth more than $15 billion after this week’s surge. That would make our reclusive techie wealthier than virtually anyone in the UK, including the Duke of Westminster, who owns large tracts of London.\n\nBitcoin’s inventor goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and claims to be a 42-year-old Japanese male. He has lent his name to the smallest fraction of the currency – a hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin is known as a ‘Satoshi’. But Nakamoto’s true age and nationality are unknown – and it is perfectly possible that ‘he’ is a she, or even a group of individuals.\n\nThe stars cashing in on the craze As with all fashion crazes, Bitcoin has attracted a number of famous faces eager to cash in, writes Jamie Nimmo. Among British backers, lingerie mogul Michelle Mone was an early investor in the cyber-currency. Baroness Mone, right, told The Mail on Sunday she expected the price of Bitcoin to rocket to $100,000 – five times the value it hit at its peak last week. She is even marketing a £192 million property development in Dubai by allowing potential purchasers of the luxury apartments to pay in Bitcoin. Paris Hilton has tweeted her support for Bitcoin and boxer Floyd Mayweather has taken to social media to promote another cryptocurrency. Last week, football star Lionel Messi, left, became the latest celebrity to climb aboard the Bitcoin bandwagon. He was revealed as brand ambassador to Sirin Labs, which is launching a new smartphone that it says will allow users to send and receive digital currencies. It is hoping to raise $100 million of funding this week. And artist Lincoln Townley, described as the new Andy Warhol, is accepting Bitcoin for his latest collection, thought to be a first for the art world. Julian Assange, the controversial WikiLeaks founder, is another to have benefited from the Bitcoin boom. He claimed that after the US Government allegedly blocked credit card companies from making payments to WikiLeaks in 2010, it was forced to accept Bitcoin instead. Assange said in October that WikiLeaks was sitting on a 50,000 per cent profit, which will now have become even greater.\n\nSurely there’s an inkling who it is?\n\nThe latest name in the frame is Elon Musk, the billionaire tech investor behind electric car firm Tesla and a co-founder of PayPal. Mind you, there isn’t any evidence beyond the fact that Musk is fond of futuristic wheezes. Musk denies he is Satoshi and says he was given some Bitcoin but lost it.\n\nOthers named as possible Satoshis include an obscure US computer scientist called Nick Szabo.\n\nIn 2014, there was speculation about a 60-something Japanese-American computer engineer called Dorian Nakamoto who was living in California with his nonagenarian mother.\n\nBoth denied it and the inventor of Bitcoin remains as elusive as the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nYou said Musk lost his Bitcoin. Is that possible?\n\nYes. Ask Paul Bedford, 34, an IT consultant from Essex and a former Bitcoin miner. He excavated 41 Bitcoins, a cache that would be worth around £500,000, if only he hadn’t chucked out his computer and lost them all.\n\n‘At the time, they were so worthless it didn’t bother me too much,’ he said yesterday. ‘I got rid of that computer years ago so there’s no chance I’ll ever find them.’ James Howells, a Welsh IT worker, made a similar mistake, though in his case it was far more costly. He threw out his hard drive in 2013, forgetting there were Bitcoin then worth ‘a few hundred thousand pounds’ on it.\n\nThe price rise of the past few days pushed their value up to a theoretical £74 million, but his fortune is buried under thousands of tons of rubbish at a dump in Newport. Howells has even offered the council £7.4 million – a 10 per cent cut – if they can dig it up for him. The council says it is not possible.\n\nThat’s tough. But haven’t some ordinary people become Bitcoin millionaires?\n\nPrepare yourself for some serious Bitcoin envy.\n\nNow 19, Erik Finman from Idaho was only 12 when he spent a $1,000 cheque from his grandma on Bitcoin. He is now a teenage multi-millionaire, with a Bitcoin hoard worth around $6 million, living in San Francisco where he is working with Nasa to launch a time capsule into space as well as devising his own virtual currency.\n\nThe surging value of Bitcoin means that the haul of 213,519 is now worth a staggering $3.3billion - an increase of 600% (stock photo)\n\nHe assured The Mail on Sunday yesterday that his life is ‘not all yachts and Lamborghinis now’. Perish the thought.\n\nNot quite in that league, but still a big winner, is Alessandra Sollberger, a former Goldman Sachs banker based in London, who bought 400 Bitcoins in 2012.\n\nThe Oxford University graduate, now 29, missed out on the recent price surge by selling most of them in 2013 and 2014. But she still made an £80,000 profit and used it to launch her own business, a superfoods company called Evermore, in 2015.\n\nShe has held on to four Bitcoins, worth more than £45,000, and says she does not regret selling the rest, because she believes the Bitcoin bubble is about to burst.\n\nBut beating all these are Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the US twins who were at war with Mark Zuckerberg over who created Facebook. The pair spent $11 million of the $65 million payout from their lawsuit against Zuckerberg to invest in Bitcoin at a price of $120. Today, that stake is estimated to be worth over $1 billion.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Bitcoin wealth is concentrated in a few hands: about 40 per cent of Bitcoins in existence are owned by just 1,000 people, known as the ‘whales’ because of their huge investments.\n\nAre these whales all legitimate? I heard it’s a conduit for criminals\n\nIn its early days, the currency was certainly used liberally by fraudsters, drug dealers and their ilk – as well as people living in pariah states such as North Korea. Because owners are able to hide their identities – and the currency is entirely untraceable by conventional means – it was a magnet for ‘dirty money’.\n\nOfficers are said to have confiscated hundreds of thousands of units of the virtual currency worth $500million from an organised crime gang in May (stock photo)\n\nTo be fair, a number of mainstream banks have been fined millions for money laundering and dealing with rogue regimes too.\n\nYou still haven’t told me whether or not I should buy some...\n\nHermann Hauser, one of the UK’s foremost tech entrepreneurs, has this to say: ‘I would encourage people to approach Bitcoin exactly the same way as they would approach the Lottery. This is as good a roulette wheel as we’ve had in a while.’\n\nIn other words, if you want a flutter with money you can afford to lose, then why not? Otherwise, the simple answer is: No.\n\nHold on. Couldn’t other eggheads invent virtual currencies too?\n\nOf course – and they already have. Bitcoin has spawned many rivals, such as Ethereum. In fact, crypto-currency aficionados already say ‘Bitcoin is so over’.', 'The person atop one of cryptocurrency\'s most popular exchanges pleaded with people to invest responsibly.\n\nIn a blog post on his site, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong sought to ""remind customers of some of the risks associated with trading digital currency"" -- which include wild price swings.\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin soared this week from under $10,000 to more than $17,000 before slumping back down to around $15,000, according to data from CoinDesk, which values bitcoin based on data from four exchanges, including Coinbase.\n\nOn Coinbase\'s exchange the price soared past $18,000 at one point.\n\nArmstrong warned in his post on Thursday that the increased interest in cryptocurrencies, which was punctuated by a stunning bitcoin rally earlier this week, has led to ""extreme volatility and stress on our systems.""\n\nRelated: What\'s driving the bitcoin frenzy?\n\nDuring the frenzy, Coinbase\'s valuation was consistently higher than the CoinDesk index -- at one point by a $2,000 margin. Even Saturday afternoon, Coinbase listed the price of a bitcoin around $15,000, while the CoinDesk hovered around $14,700.\n\nBitcoin\'s rise is mind-boggling considering just one year ago it traded for less than $800. At one point in 2011, it traded for about three bucks, according to CoinDesk.\n\nIts stunning ascent was driven in large part by increasing attention from mainstream investors. And bitcoin\'s valuation has continued to balloon -- with a few sharp dips -- despite a smattering of warnings from top economists and business leaders.\n\nBeginning Sunday, investors will be able to trade bitcoin futures via the Chicago Board Options Exchange. And they\'ll debut on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange a week later.\n\n--CNNMoney\'s Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.', 'This Bitcoin Bubble Is Looking Like the Nasdaq Bubble of 1999-2000\n\nBubbles occur fairly often in individual stocks and small markets but it\'s rare when they occur in bigger markets. They most dramatic bubble I\'ve experienced was in the Nasdaq in 1999-2000. It was classic hysteria. While much money was made, much was eventually lost.\n\nThe current bubble in bitcoin has already surpassed the Nasdaq bubble in some ways and it has developed in much the same way. The interest among people that haven\'t previously invested much is intense and there is chatter about it in gatherings where investment portfolios are rarely discussed.\n\nThere are quite a few Bitcoin True Believers that snarl at the word ""bubble"" but this obviously is one. The emotions and volatility tell us that this is something unusual. Just because it\'s a bubble doesn\'t mean you should sell it, short it or avoid it. The nature of bubbles is to last far longer than people think is reasonable. Bitcoin may remain in a frenzy for months or years but eventually it will go through a very nasty correction.\n\nAll markets go through cycles. It\'s inevitable, which is why I can say with certainty that bitcoin will be cut in half, or more, at some point. I don\'t know when or from what level but it will happen.\n\nThe best way to trade bitcoin is to study other bubbles. Bitcoin is unique because it isn\'t readily shortable, it has limited supple, fundamentals are murky at best and the markets it trades in are unreliable and illiquid at times. It\'s intangible in much the same way many internet stocks were back in 2000.\n\nHere is a chart of the Nasdaq bubble back in 1999-2000.\n\nKey things to note:\n\nThe run-up was extremely consistent with low volatility. Intraday volatility steadily increased as the top formed. The first major dip was bought, and the highs were retested. The second major dip created a rush for the exits when support was breached. This is key. The technicians clearly had sell stops set at that key technical level. Once the uptrend was broken, the bounces were sold hard. Panic selling ensued well after the uptrend was broken.\n\nI suspect that bitcoin is in the phase now where intraday volatility is becoming extreme. That can continue for a while, but it suggests that a significant downward move is coming soon.\n\nBitcoin is unique, and I expect it to remain a very volatility trading vehicle for quite a while. Just make sure you appreciate that it trades in a bubble and that it\'s going to cause some tremendous losses at some point.', 'It is a long journey down the rabbit hole of Cryptocurrency to truly understand everything that is going on within the space (and how it is affecting other industries). But it is not an impossible task, and you have to start somewhere. With Coinbase officially adding over 100,000 new accounts per day, I have started to get a lot more questions about Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin in general. My goal with this post is to provide people with a starting point to best get up to speed on the space, fast!\n\nI first heard about Bitcoin in 2012 while writing daily Tech news for the Launch Ticker. I believe it was priced around $10, but I didn’t understand Bitcoin at the time, so I didn’t buy any. Then, in 2013, Bitcoin became what I would refer to as ""Silicon Valley / Venture Capital"" mainstream. Which in hindsight, I think we in the industry sometimes forget just how early to new ideas and industries we can be. Even still I did not buy any bitcoin. Even with everyone talking about something, it can be so easy to dismiss the things we don’t understand. And so, as Wayne Gretzky once famously said, ""You miss 100% of the shots you don\'t take.""\n\nSo two years later I took a deeper look at Bitcoin and I started to understand how it all works before buying some. I went down the rabbit hole; reading blog posts, sub-reddits, listening to podcasts, de-mystifying the blockchain, smart contracts, etc.\n\nWhich brings us to today. If 2016 and 2017 have taught us anything, it is that we are in a new era where awareness outpaces execution. In my opinion, social media and the connectivity of smartphones has no problem getting people talking about the hot topics of the day or week on the surface. But we are flooded with so much information that it has become harder to filter what is worth stopping, taking the time to learn more, and going deep on a subject.\n\nAnd so today, my advice is to take some time to understand Cryptocurrency and it\'s surrounding technologies. Whether or not you are a believer in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency, the technologies that have enabled this revolution, such as the blockchain, are almost certainly here to stay. I am going to lay out some information, which should help you gain a deeper understanding around the whole industry. I would recommend digesting them in the order I present them in, and remember to keep an open philosophical mind:', 'Cameron Winklevoss thinks the booming bitcoin market could reach much, much higher, saying the cryptocurrency’s current market value is still just a sliver of its potential.\n\n“We’ve always felt that bitcoin, given its properties, is gold 2.0,” he told CNBC on Friday. “Gold is scarce, bitcoin is actually fixed. Bitcoin is way more portable and way more divisible [than gold].”\n\nWinklevoss then compared bitcoin’s market cap, around $300 billion yesterday, with gold’s at $6 billion. “If bitcoin disrupting gold is true . . . then you can see 10 to 20 times appreciation because there is significant delta still.”\n\n“Long term, directionally,” Winklevoss continued, “[Bitcoin] is a multitrillion-dollar asset – I don’t know how long it takes to get there.”\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nCameron Winklevoss and his twin brother Tyler, who once argued they helped create Facebook, have turned $11 million invested in bitcoin in 2014 into more than $1 billion in value today. They have also worked to bring bitcoin into mainstream financial structures, including by working to put a bitcoin-linked security on U.S. stock exchanges, though that proposal was rejected by the SEC earlier this year. They also played a role in building a bitcoin futures product that goes live this weekend.\n\nCameron Winklevoss’s comparison of bitcoin to gold reflects a broad shift among cryptocurrency advocates. Bitcoin and other blockchain-based instruments, which are decentralized, were long championed as a way of disintermediating payment processors like Visa and banks. But rising fees have made transacting on the bitcoin network slower and more expensive, perhaps contributing to a pivot to emphasizing cryptocurrency as a gold-like store of value rather than a transaction tool.\n\nWinklevoss also pooh-poohed widespread concern of a bitcoin bubble, instead emphasizing the unique dynamics of networks like bitcoin. “Social networks grow in value exponentially based on the number of users and participants . . . as more people join it gains more value.”\n\nSince Winklevoss made his remarks, bitcoin has reminded markets of its huge volatility, dropping nearly 9% over 24 hours to around $14,300 – still a massive runup from the beginning of 2017, when one bitcoin was worth under $1,000.', 'With the daily trading volume of Bitcoin at an all-time high, at around $20 bln across major regions, the mempool of the Bitcoin Blockchain has started to expand again.\n\nBitcoin mempool size spikes, transaction fees increase\n\nIn Bitcoin, the mempool operates as a holding area for unconfirmed transactions. Payments made by users await in the mempool until miners arrive to confirm the transactions. The size of the Bitcoin mempool, which remains at around 79 mln bytes at the time of reporting, represents the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed.\n\nIf the size of the Bitcoin mempool is high, transaction fees recommended by wallet platforms such as Blockchain, Coinbase and Trezor surge and failing to attach high fees could result in a transaction being delayed for many days, if the Bitcoin mempool does not clear.\n\nOn Dec. 7, the size of the Bitcoin mempool reached 120 mln bytes, spiking by more than two-fold within a 24-hour span. As a consequence, transaction fees of Bitcoin recommended by wallets surged up to $30, depending on the size of the transaction and the number of inputs or outputs.\n\nBitcoin Fees, a Bitcoin fee predicting application on Earn.com, previously known as 21 Inc, currently recommends a fee of 450 satoshis per byte for median-size transactions, resulting in a fee of 101,700 satoshis. In US dollars, the recommended fee of Bitcoin Fees for median-size transactions is $16.\n\n“Suspicious behavior” in the Bitcoin mempool\n\nNic Carter, an experienced Bitcoin analyst and researcher, stated that the abrupt surge in the size of the Bitcoin mempool is suspicious, given that many one satoshi per byte transactions clogged up the mempool and the Bitcoin Blockchain network.\n\nCarter suggested that a spam attack of low-fee transactions is preventing the Bitcoin Blockchain network from clearing transactions and processing payments.\n\nSuspicious behavior in the Bitcoin mempool again. Be on your guard this weekendhttps://t.co/8MIPUW0Cxw pic.twitter.com/npMXjHP4Ma — Nic Carter (@nic__carter) December 9, 2017\n\nBut, others also claimed that it is possible the recent performance of Bitcoin price has led to a genuine increase in the Bitcoin network’s daily transaction volume, and that the size of the mempool has expanded drastically because of the rapid growth rate of Bitcoin.\n\nAre fees too high?\n\nFor small to medium-size transactions, the current Bitcoin transaction fees could be too high, especially for merchants. As such, Steam, one of the most popular game marketplaces, temporarily stopped accepting Bitcoin as a payment method due to increasing complaints from its users with Bitcoin’s high transaction fees.\n\nFor large-scale transactions worth at least a thousand dollars to millions of dollars, a transaction fee of over $10 is not relatively high compared to the global banking system. As Ari Paul, the co-founder of BlockTower explained in an interview with Business Insider, if Bitcoin’s current use case is a robust store of value and it is trying to compete against gold and the international offshore banking industry, high transaction fees could still be dealt with, considering the complexity and efficiency of banking services.\n\nStill, for Bitcoin merchants, specifically the tens of thousands of Bitcoin-accepting merchants in Japan, the current Bitcoin transaction fees could be difficult to handle.', ""About The Author\n\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

12/10/2017,"['Bitcoin futures jumped more than 20% in their eagerly anticipated U.S. debut, which backers hope will encourage wider use and legitimacy for the world’s largest cryptocurrency even as critics warn of the risk of a bubble and price collapse.\n\nThe launch on Sunday night may have caused an early outage of the Chicago-based CBOE Global Markets’ website. The exchange said that due to heavy traffic on the CBOE Global Markets website, the site “may be temporarily unavailable.”\n\nThe one-month bitcoin contract opened trade at 6 pm (2300 GMT) at $15,460, dipped briefly and then rose to a high of $18,700.\n\nAs of 0430 GMT, it was up 16% from the open at $17,940, with 2,211 contracts traded.\n\nOn the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, bitcoin prices surged 7% to $15,720. It is up more than 1,400% so far in 2017, and its gains in the past month have been rapid.\n\nExperts had worried that the risks associated with the currency’s Wild West-like nature could overshadow the futures debut, but so far the price action has been unlike the wild swings seen in the past few weeks. Bitcoin tumbled 20% in 10 hours on Friday.\n\n“Even if there is an institution or institutional-sized trader out there, they are going to want to make sure that the mechanics work first, just for the futures,” said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories.\n\n“I think the excitement will come when the futures market is established. That can take a few days,” Gottlieb added.\n\nThe futures are cash-settled contracts based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\n\nMarket participants said the launch of the futures contract wouldn’t necessarily reduce volatility in the cryptocurrency.\n\n“There are no ways to arbitrage between the market and other exchanges, CBOE cannot settle Bitcoin as far as I know,” said Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong.\n\n“Regular bitcoin traders don’t have access to it, and the trading desks that use the futures market don’t have access to bitcoin.”\n\nCRYPTIC CURRENCY\n\nWhile bitcoin’s price rise mystifies many, its origins have been the subject of much speculation.\n\nIt was set up in 2008 by someone or some group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.\n\nCentral bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over the surge in the price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.\n\n“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on a television program run on Sunday.\n\n“We’ve seen them in the past. Over the centuries we’ve seen bubbles and this appears to be a bit of a classic case,” he said.\n\nMany investors have stood on the sidelines watching its price rocket. However, it is possible to buy bitcoin without having to spend the full price of one coin. Bitcoin’s smallest unit is a Satoshi, named after the elusive creator of the cryptocurrency.\n\nSomebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 and had never sold any of it would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.\n\nHeightened excitement ahead of the launch of the futures has given an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.\n\nThe CME Group is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.\n\nCONTROVERSIAL MOVE\n\nBitcoin fans appear excited about the prospect of an exchange-listed and regulated product and the ability to bet on its price swings without having to sign up for a digital wallet.\n\nOthers, however, caution that risks remain for investors and possibly even the clearing organizations underpinning the trades.\n\n“You are going to open up the market to a whole lot of people who aren’t currently in bitcoin,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages, though.\n\nSeveral online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.\n\nBitcoin’s manic run-up this year has boosted volatility far in excess of other asset classes. The futures trading may help dampen some of the sharp moves, analysts said.\n\n“Hypothetically, volatility over the long run should drop after institutions get involved,” Gottlieb said. “But there may not be an immediate impact, say in the first month.”\n\nThis post has been updated.', 'The spot price of bitcoin pared losses after futures began trading in Chicago, ushering in a new era for the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin had fallen over the weekend after ending last week at $15,644, 43 percent higher over the five days. A month ago, it was less than $8,000.\n\nCboe Global Markets Inc., one of the world’s biggest regulated exchanges, began offering futures contracts at 6 p.m. in New York, capping a wild year for the digital currency that has captured imaginations and investment around the world, propelled by a 15-fold gain.\n\nThe futures contracts may open the door to greater inflows of institutional money, while also making it easier to bet on bitcoin’s decline. The entrance of regulated exchanges enables professional investors who have been unwilling to do business on the unregulated platforms where bitcoin currently trades to place bets on bitcoin’s price.\n\nThey’ll be watching for the wild swings that have become a hallmark of bitcoin trading in recent months, with four moves of at least 10 percent in the past two weeks alone. Such volatility could trigger trading limits in the futures, though many investors speculate the contracts will improve price discovery.\n\nBitcoin’s volatility was on full display Thursday. On Coinbase Inc.’s GDAX exchange, prices zoomed up to almost $20,000 from $16,000 in only about 90 minutes -- then crashed back down. Coinbase temporarily crashed and continued to suffer from service delays as prices fell. One of the largest U.S. online exchanges used by investors, Coinbase had prices $3,000 higher than on other exchanges at the height of the turmoil.\n\n— With assistance by Rob Urban, and Nick Baker', 'Bitcoin is bananas. The surge in Bitcoin pricing has been a subject of a lot of conversations. Essentially, if you bought a Bitcoin (BTC) on January 1st 2017 for $1,000; today that BTC would be worth approximately $15,000. That’s good reason for all the hype.\n\nIf you’ve been trying to get in on the action, there is only one problem, Wyoming doesn’t have friendly cryptocurrency regulation. Since 2015, no one in Wyoming has been able to acquire any form of cryptocurrency. That is when the Wyoming Division of Banking changed its interpretation of the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act (a 2003 Bill). This means that the state does not classify cryptocurrency as a currency, but as “permissible investments.” Bitcoin are still allowed in Wyoming, but they require the licensee to have a reserve of dollars equivalent to the amount invested. A company that wants to transact with bitcoin needs to have a cash reserve, 2 times the value of the investment.\n\nCoinbase is the most popular platform for buying and selling cryptocurrency. The company is valued at $1.6 billion. They allow users to transact with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. However, Coinbase suspended all Wyoming business in 2015 after this decision.\n\nThe Wyoming Blockchain Coalition is trying to fix this. They are devoted to educating Wyoming citizens about the power of this technology. The group is lobbying for blockchain cryptocurrency amendments to bring bitcoin back to Wyoming. The Coalition has some great ideas as to how blockchain can help Wyoming ranchers and coal producers.\n\nIt’s tough to understand. Below are points on the basics:\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? It is a digital cryptocurrency. It was the first decentralized cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009, as a response to the financial collapse.\n\nWho created Bitcoin? Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. No one has ever met him in person. That name is a pseudonym (or is it?)\n\nWhat does Decentralized mean? Decentralized means that there is no central banking system, like the US treasury department (a central bank). The US Treasury has the ability to issue more dollars into the economy through banks. Bitcoin has a finite amount of it’s currency. There are around 12 million Bitcoin now and there will only be 21 million in total existence in the year 2140. Much of this is the reason why the value of Bitcoin has surged, because no government treasury can add more bitcoin to the world.\n\nWhat does Blockchain mean? It’s a lot like a global spreadsheet. It is a database or ledger that maintains a continuously growing list of transactions or data records. Here is a video that can explain a bit more.\n\nMore Information from the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition Current Valuations (Sunday December 10, 2017 at 11 am): Gold: $40,220 per kilo ($1,251 per ounce) Bitcoin: $15,725\n\n\n\n(Images: Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, Alt Coin Mania, Coin Telegraph)', 'Never miss a great news story!\n\nGet instant notifications from Economic Times\n\nAllowNot now\n\nYou can switch off notifications anytime using browser settings.', 'Just a week ago I wrote an article exploring whether or not it was a good idea to invest in Bitcoin at that precise moment. Although, as I am not a financial advisor, I decided to stop short of offering a definitive answer either way, it turns out I should have given you a rather emphatic “yes”. In the short space of time since I wrote it, the price of a Bitcoin has close to doubled, from $9,000 to $17,000.\n\nFor me Bitcoin’s main point of interest has always been that it is the first practical application of blockchain technology – which is predicted to have revolutionary applications in many fields.\n\nAdobeStock\n\nHowever, in the almost 10 years it has existed, it can’t be denied that its feature which has caused the most excitement is its tendency to rapidly appreciate in value, to levels that now appear stratospheric.\n\nBitcoin’s first official valuation is generally accepted to have taken place in 2010 when 10,000 of them were swapped for two pizzas. With that in mind, assertions which have been made such Bitcoin being the fastest appreciating asset in the recorded history of the markets stop sounding like hyperbole.\n\nAccording to Ville Oehman, fund manager at Helvetic Investments, the Bitcoin market has matured to the point where it is now an attractive investment proposition for mainstream institutional investors. Importantly, the regulatory framework which needs to be in place before these institutions – and the serious money they look after – feel confident enough to get involved.\n\nThis is why his company this week announced their Cryptocurrency Balanced Large Cap Fund.\n\nOehman tells me “It’s really about timing – if you look back 12 months, the market cap of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency was $25 billion.\n\n“Now we are close to $400 billion and we are talking about a completely different picture. It’s really been a market where the products available haven’t been geared towards institutional investors, but now we are starting to move towards that.\n\n“They want to get involved with this somehow. The question I get all the time is ‘we are fine with allocating funds to this, but how do we do it?’\n\nOehman says that for a year or two now there has been a growing demand from institutional investors such as family offices representing high net worth individuals, for ways to invest in crypto currencies while still being covered by the same protections offered by more traditional markets.\n\nAnd who can blame them?\n\nIt’s not the only step that Bitcoin and crypto currency seem to have taken towards mainstream acceptance in recent days.', 'This story has been corrected.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, a single bitcoin cost about $973 and the popular bitcoin “wallet” app CoinBase didn’t even chart among the top iPhone apps. Now one bitcoin costs over $16,000, and CoinBase is the second-most popular free app on iOS.\n\nIt’s an asset price spike the likes of which the world has seldom seen, outpacing notorious stock market booms like the Roaring Twenties. But why is it spiking now? And how could this possibly last? VICE News has some answers to your questions about the matter.\n\nWhy is the price of bitcoin skyrocketing?\n\nWhile there’s no single answer to this, a lot of it has to do with increased activity — money transfers and investments — coming from Asia over the past few months, as well as traditional finance players.', 'Government is planning to set up a panel to decide on bitcoin policy, ETNow reported on Monday quoting agencies.The reports came after the cryptocurrency recently surpassed $19,000 last week and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) warned the public of the risks related to virtual currencies (VCs).The apex bank last week reiterated its stand that “it has not given any licence or authorisation to any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any VC.”""In the wake of significant spurt in the valuation of many VCs and rapid growth in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), RBI reiterates the concerns,"" the central bank said in a statement.With an astounding return given by the cryptocurrency, bitcoin clearly stole the show in the ongoing calendar year 2017. The currency has surged from nearly $1,000 in January 2017 to over $19,000 last week.The first-ever bitcoin futures began trading on Sunday as the increasingly popular virtual currency made its debut on a major US exchange.', 'Last Monday the New York Post reported that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss became the world’s first Bitcoin billionaires. After winning $65 million from Mark Zuckerberg in a dispute over who came up with the idea for Facebook, the twins subsequently purchased $11 million worth of Bitcoins with their lawsuit haul.\n\nThe twins began purchasing the cryptocurrency in 2013, and according to rough estimates arrived at by the Post, they bought 91,666 coins for around $120 each. Readers can do the math. With the mis-named“currency” having reached $11,400* as of last Monday, the Winklevoss brothers could lay claim to billionaire status.\n\nBut rather than discuss the twins’ prescience as investors, luck, or whatever, it’s best to turn their great fortune into a “teaching moment” as it were. The transformation of $11 million into a $1 billion with what is mistakenly described as a currency is a great way to explain inflation and deflation.\n\nImportantly, this explanation will have nothing to do with the modern definitions of inflation and deflation arrived at by Keynesians, monetarists, and even some Austrians. To be clear, inflation is not caused by booming economic growth whereby demand outstrips supply as Keynesians (including top economists at the Fed) commonly believe. More realistically, economic growth is the greatest enemy of rising prices simply because periods of booming prosperity are defined by investment in production advances that drive prices down. Also, there’s no such thing as demand outstripping supply given the basic truth that demand is a certain effect of supply. Conversely, deflation is not a function of slower economic growth. As the malaise-ridden 1970s and 2000s should remind readers, prices are most likely rising when the economy is weakest due to a lack of investment.\n\nAs for monetarists, they believe inflation is an effect of rising money supply, while deflation the opposite. Ok, but money is always and everywhere abundant wherever production is. That’s the case because we only pursue money in return for our production insofar as it’s exchangeable for goods and services. So just as the Keynesians get inflation backwards, so do the monetarists. They forget that surging “money supply” can’t be engineered as much as it’s an effect of production. At the same time, falling supply is a signal of reduced production.\n\nAnd then there are modern Austrians. They believe inflation is an effect of “excess credit” creation, usually by the Fed. Except that the latter is an impossibility too. To understand why, readers need only consider the teachings of Austrian eminence Ludwig von Mises. He was very clear that individuals only borrow “money” insofar as it’s exchangeable for other goods and resources. Mises was stating the obvious, but also something that those generally flummoxed by inflation and deflation don’t get. Mises’s observation was a reminder that credit is what we create. Plain and simple. A booming economy signals major production increases. And that’s why a booming economy is defined by mass borrowing. People are borrowing access to the resources produced in abundance. So while modern Austrians weirdly believe surging lending causes inflation, it’s more realistically an effect of growth; meaning an absence of inflation.\n\nSo what is inflation? It’s a decline in the value of the currency. It’s a dollar that is exchangeable for quite a bit less relative to what it was previously exchangeable for. Conversely, deflation is a rise in the value of the unit of account. In dollar terms, it signals exchangeability for more in the way of goods and services relative to the past. Both are economically harmful, and to see why, readers need only consider the floating value of Bitcoin.\n\nAs previously mentioned, a Bitcoin exchangeable for $120 in 2013 could command over $11,000 as of last Monday. That speaks to a massive deflation. Consider the latter in terms of a debtor/creditor relationship: you borrow 5 Bitcoin from me in 2013 based on a promise to pay me back with one coin per year, including 2013. You’ll be all paid up in 2017, but it’s fair to say that as the debtor you’ve been wiped out. While you borrowed roughly $600 from me, you’ve essentially returned to me $13,000. Deflation whacks debtors.', 'Is bitcoin in a bubble?\n\nThe price of bitcoin has been soaring this year, and last week alone it jumped from $11,000 to well over $17,000, according to Coindesk. It started the year below $1,000.\n\nThat rocketing level of appreciation smells a lot like an irrational investor mania to many economists and financial pros, the kind that sent prices for unprofitable startup internet companies soaring in the dot-com boom. Those prices eventually came crashing down.\n\n""We saw this in the 1990s,"" says Barry Ritholtz, chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management. ""Any of those things sound familiar? \'This is unique, this will change everything?\'""\n\nLike many others in finance, Ritholtz expects the bitcoin bubble to pop. The only question is when. ""Some people think it\'s early days, some people think it\'s late,"" Ritholtz said. ""We\'ll find out in the not-too-distant-future who is right.""\n\nRobert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz, two Nobel-prize winning economists who\'ve seen their share of speculative manias, recently have called bitcoin a bubble. Stiglitz went so far as to tell Bloomberg TV that bitcoin should be ""outlawed.""\n\nBitcoin was created in hopes it would become a new kind of currency that people could use outside of the traditional banking system, without backing from any country or central bank. It was also supposed to operate outside of government oversight, which has raised concerns that it will be a haven for criminals.\n\nUnlike traditional currencies, bitcoin doesn\'t have a country backing it, a central bank, interest rates, or a long history of exchange rates against other currencies, making it extremely difficult to place a value on. Its value is tied only to what people believe it\'s worth at any given time.\n\nDespite the growing interest, bitcoin still is not widely accepted in stores to buy merchandise, and you can\'t deposit it at a bank. One of the problems with using it as a currency is that its value keeps bouncing around, sometimes very suddenly.\n\n""We have seen bitcoin more as a speculative investment rather than an equivalent to cash,"" says J. Craig Shearman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation, the world\'s largest trade association of retailers. ""Even if it were a foreign currency, you need to dependably know what the exchange rate is, and bitcoin doesn\'t meet any of those tests.""\n\nBackers of bitcoin say it\'s about time for a new kind of currency that can be exchanged in private and secure ways. Its promoters include internet entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\n\nThis week mainstream financial markets are for the first time allowing investors to make future bets on the direction of bitcoin, but bitcoins themselves will continued to be traded only on private exchanges, which are mostly out of reach of regulators.\n\nMark Fratella, a teacher who lives in Elmhurst, Illinois, bought some bitcoin ""for the novelty of it"" back when it was worth $700 or $800.\n\nFratella is holding onto his bitcoin, and buying a little more from time to time. He\'s also buying other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Litecoin. He\'s heard the talk of a bitcoin bubble.\n\n""But I have also seen a few analysts talk about how, in the grand scheme of things, there are a relatively low amount of people into bitcoin and there is a huge potential for growth,"" he said. With the futures trade starting, Fratella thinks people who have been leery of its decentralized, deregulated nature will start buying into it too.\n\nThe futures also give investors the opportunity to ""short"" bitcoin — that is bet that its price will go down — which presently is very difficult to near impossible to do.\n\nWhile the value of bitcoin itself may be inflated, even some of its biggest critics say that the technology that\'s behind bitcoin has promise. That technology is called blockchain. It\'s a kind of digital ledger that securely records transactions and prevents the same bitcoin from being spent twice.\n\nJamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, has called bitcoin ""a fraud"" that will eventually ""blow up."" But Dimon also said he thought the blockchain technology was ""good"" and could be used to make transactions faster and easier.\n\nFor now, people keep buying bitcoin, even with all the talk of a bubble. To Ritholtz, the enthusiasm is a combination of the novelty of bitcoin, the built-in scarcity of it — only 21 million of them will ever be created — and the psychology of people being attracted to assets whose prices appear to keep going up.\n\n""One of the first rules of investing is, only invest in things you understand,"" Ritholtz said. ""If you want to speculate in a cryptocurrency and you don\'t understand it, you might get lucky for a while but those sorts of speculations don\'t work out well.""\n\n___\n\n__\n\nAP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this story.', 'Max Levchin helped introduce the masses to the concept of a digital wallet when he co-founded PayPal in the late 1990s.\n\nThese days, he\'s still trying to use online services to reshape the world of finance. He is currently CEO of Affirm, a San Francisco startup that offers fixed-payment loans through the internet. It\'s an alternative to traditional credit cards, which can get consumers into trouble because small minimum payments they make each month can keep them in debt for decades.\n\nLevchin, now 42, recently connected with The Associated Press to discuss the state of digital payments, computer security and bitcoin, a cryptocurrency whose value has ranged from about $1,000 to more than $19,000 this year as investors have bet on its future prospects. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n———\n\nQ: Are digital payments progressing as quickly as you hoped since you started PayPal?\n\nA: They are moving at a good pace, adjusted for just how large and complicated the market is. It\'s highly regulated and there are a lot of things to be careful about. The elephant in the room for the last seven or eight years has been cryptocurrency. A big ""what if"" and ""when if"" has been surrounding bitcoin and its ilk.\n\nQ: Why so?\n\nA: The asset generally appreciated at such a blistering pace. Any time you acquire it, why not hang on to it? Because you just don\'t want to spend it yet. On the whole, it\'s a kind of transaction tool that is locked into areas where credit and cash don\'t really service the purpose. So you wind up finding it in somewhat darker corners.\n\nQ: Do you invest in bitcoin?\n\nA: I wound up with a lot of bitcoin as an early investor in one of the early bitcoin startups. But it wasn\'t a conscious decision to go buy a bunch of bitcoin.\n\nI generally don\'t speculate. I am very old school in that sense. I try to understand how value is traded and what is going to happen to it in the very long term, not because I am a stranger to speculative investing. It\'s because I don\'t have time to time the market. So what I end up doing is committing to a stock or committing to a company.\n\nQ: What are some of the most interesting areas of digital payments?\n\nA: A good example is international remittances, where companies can pop up and do well. They\'re the guys who figured out how to do it much cheaper and much more transparently with much lower friction to both the recipient and the sender.\n\nQ: Should we be concerned about hackers wreaking havoc with our financial system?\n\nA: We should be worried broadly about our cybersecurity preparedness. I don\'t think it\'s specific to payments. It is just generally increasing the cost of doing business and reduces societal trust. And this is the first time in history where it\'s scary. Everything has got a chip. We are going to have to learn how to secure keys (secret codes for unlocking digital files and services).']"
12/11/2017,"['Bitcoin has made its hotly anticipated launch onto the futures market, but some analysts and central bankers are still urging caution', 'Bitcoin futures eased back from an initial surge of almost 22% to trade up 13% on Monday, in an eagerly awaited U.S. market debut that backers hope will confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and lead to its wider use.\n\nAlthough bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, the Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets’ launch marked the first time investors could get exposure to the market via a mainstream regulated exchange.\n\nThe debut on Sunday night may have caused an early outage of the Cboe website. The exchange said that due to heavy traffic, the site “may be temporarily unavailable.”\n\nThe one-month bitcoin contract opened trade at 6 pm local time (2300 GMT) at $15,460, dipped briefly before rising to a high of $18,700 and then slipping again.\n\nAs of 1112 GMT the one-month future was up 13% from the open at $17,450, around $1,000 higher than the “spot” bitcoin price – the price at which bitcoin is currently being bought and sold.\n\nThe two-month contract was trading at $18,880, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $19,040.\n\n“The premiums have so far been very high, demonstrating that few want to take the short side of the trade,” said Altana Digital Currency Fund manager Alistair Milne, whose fund has $35 million in assets under management.\n\nIn just over 12 hours after the launch, 2,780 contracts had been traded, meaning around $48.5 million had been notionally invested. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $20 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.\n\nJust 13 trades of the two-month contracts had been traded.\n\n“It will take time for derivative volumes to build up, but eventually if they prove to be a significant percentage of the global trade, they should in theory help stabilize things,” said Milne.\n\nMost fund managers at mainstream asset management firms and other institutional investors say they will not be lured into the market by the launch of the futures.\n\n“There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.\n\n“We’ve looked at it in the past but if you look at the number of times that you need to trade to keep your exposure at the same level, after one week you need to rebalance the portfolio already,” he added.\n\nOn the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin prices surged 12.5% on the day to $16,570, close to an all-time high of $16,666.66 hit on Friday.\n\nBitcoin is up more than 1,500% so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000, and its gains in the past month have been rapid.\n\nCASH-SETTLED\n\nExperts had worried that the risks associated with the currency’s Wild West-like nature could overshadow the futures debut. Bitcoin tumbled 20% in 10 hours on Friday.\n\n“Even if there is an institution or institutional-sized trader out there, they are going to want to make sure that the mechanics work first, just for the futures,” said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories.\n\n“I think the excitement will come when the futures market is established. That can take a few days,” Gottlieb added.\n\nThe futures are cash-settled contracts based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Bitcoin was quoted at $16,674 on the Gemini exchange.\n\nWhile bitcoin‘s price rise mystifies many, its origins have been the subject of much speculation.\n\nIt was set up in 2008 by someone or some group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.\n\nCentral bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over the surge in the price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.\n\n“It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on television on Sunday.\n\n“We’ve seen them in the past. Over the centuries we’ve seen bubbles and this appears to be a bit of a classic case.”\n\nMany investors have stood on the sidelines watching its price rocket. However, it is possible to buy bitcoin without having to spend the full price of one coin. Bitcoin‘s smallest unit is a Satoshi, named after the elusive creator of the cryptocurrency.\n\nSomebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 and had never sold any of it would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.\n\nHeightened excitement ahead of the launch of the futures has given an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.\n\nThe CME Group is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.\n\nCONTROVERSIAL MOVE\n\nBitcoin fans appear excited about the prospect of an exchange-listed and regulated product and the ability to bet on its price swings without having to sign up for a digital wallet.\n\nOthers, however, caution that risks remain for investors and possibly even the clearing organizations underpinning the trades.\n\n“You are going to open up the market to a whole lot of people who aren’t currently in bitcoin,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages, though.\n\nSeveral online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.\n\nBitcoin‘s manic run-up this year has boosted volatility far in excess of other asset classes. The futures trading may help dampen some of the sharp moves, analysts said.\n\n“Hypothetically, volatility over the long run should drop after institutions get involved,” Gottlieb said. “But there may not be an immediate impact, say in the first month.”', 'The initial price of bitcoin, set in 2010, was less than 1 cent. Now it’s crossed $16,000. Once seen as the province of nerds, libertarians and drug dealers, bitcoin these days draws millions of dollars from hedge funds. In its latest step toward widespread acceptance, futures trading in bitcoin has begun on one of the largest U.S. exchanges. The recent price surge may be a bubble. Or it could be a belated recognition by the broader financial community that so-called cryptocurrencies -- digital forms of money -- are going mainstream. It might be time to nail down what a bitcoin is, and why its price has been going through the roof.\n\n1. What exactly is bitcoin?\n\nIt’s a form of money that’s remarkable for what it’s not: It’s not currency you can hold in your hand. It’s not recognized by most Main Street stores. It’s not issued or backed by a national government. At their core, bitcoin and its imitators are sets of software protocols for generating digital tokens and for tracking transactions in a way that makes it hard to counterfeit or re-use tokens. A bitcoin has value only to the extent that its users agree that it does.\n\n2. Where did the bitcoin system come from?\n\nThe original software was laid out in a white paper in 2008 by a person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identify remains unknown, despite several efforts to assign or claim credit. Online fantasy games had long used virtual currencies. The key idea behind bitcoin was the blockchain -- a publicly visible, largely anonymous online ledger that records bitcoin transactions.\n\n3. How does that work?\n\nThink about what happens if you make an online transfer using a bank. It verifies that you have the funds, subtracts that amount from one spot in a giant database it maintains of accounts and balances, and credits it in another. You can see the result if you log on to your account but the transaction is under the bank’s control. You’re trusting the bank to remove the right amount of money, and the bank is also making sure you can’t spend that money again. The blockchain is a database that performs those tracking functions -- but without the bank or any other central authority.\n\n4. Who performs the bank function for bitcoin?\n\nIt’s done by consensus on a decentralized network. Bitcoin transactions can be made through sites offering electronic ""wallets” that upload the data to the network. New transactions are bundled together into a batch and broadcast to the network for verification by so-called bitcoin miners.\n\n5. Who gets to be a miner?\n\nAnybody, so long as you have really fast computers, a lot of electricity and a desire to solve puzzles. The transaction data in each batch is encrypted by a formula that can be unlocked only through trial-and-error guessing on a massive scale. The miners put large-scale computing power to work as they compete to be the first to solve it. If a miner’s answer is verified by others, the data is added to a linked chain of blocks of data and the miner is rewarded with newly issued bitcoin.\n\n6. How does the system prevent cheating?\n\nBecause every block contains data linking to earlier blocks, an attempt to spend the same bitcoin twice would mean revising many links in the chain. Plus, as miners compete, they verify each other’s work each step of the way.\n\nBitcoin and Blockchain\n\n7. Wasn’t bitcoin used by drug dealers?\n\nYes, back when its primary appeal was its relative anonymity. It was, and still is, used by websites peddling everything from arms to drugs to paid hits. One such $1.2 billion marketplace, Silk Road, was shut down by federal agents in 2013. But others soon took its place. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics, said recently that bitcoin ""ought to be outlawed” because it’s designed to evade regulation and ""doesn’t serve any socially useful function.""\n\n8. What changed?\n\nBitcoin’s reputation has improved, partly because there are fewer large-scale thefts like the one in 2014 in which bitcoins were stolen from a bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox. (Security has improved, but it’s still an issue.) And many technology and financial firms grew interested in blockchain as an idea separate from bitcoin.\n\n9. What is blockchain’s appeal?\n\nEnthusiasts see it as a new way of doing all sorts of business. Costs could be lower without a central middleman doing the work of keeping track of transactions, and charging for it. Banks and stock exchanges have invested heavily in developing blockchain technology, while retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are experimenting with using blockchain for ensuring food safety. Central banks are even speculating about issuing blockchain-based official currencies. And other forms of blockchain emerged, often using their own cryptocurrencies to facilitate transactions. The most prominent is the etherium blockchain, sometimes described as a platform for so-called smart contracts.\n\n10. Why hasn’t the competition hurt bitcoin?\n\nAs the number of cryptocurrencies and tokens multiply -- they now reach into the thousands -- bitcoin remains the best-known, time-tested and valuable. That’s led to it being viewed by some as the most predictable venue for people wanting to bet on blockchain’s exponential growth.\n\n11. What explains the surge in bitcoin’s price?\n\nNew investors, and expectations of many more to follow, has increased the price of a bitcoin more than 16-fold so far this year. The last spurt may have been driven by the news that futures trading was in the offing. Cboe Global Markets Inc. began trading futures contracts tied to bitcoin on Dec. 10, and CME Group Inc. and Nasdaq plan to follow suit. The ability to trade on bitcoin’s price without owning it -- and to bet that its price will fall -- is seen as expanding bitcoin’s appeal to investors. The fact that bitcoin’s software guarantees that there will be a finite supply has added to the fear of missing out for some investors. Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange, was overwhelmed by two to three times its normal traffic on Nov. 29, when bitcoin’s price soared past $11,000, making its service temporarily unavailable to some users. New crypto-focused hedge funds are opening up weekly, and already surpass 100. Most of them invest at least part of their funds in bitcoin.\n\n12. Is this a bubble?\n\nPossibly. Some people, most notably JPMorgan Chase & Co. Jamie Dimon, call bitcoin a “fraud.” Yet his own bank is considering offering bitcoin futures to clients. Fund manager Mike Novogratz calls cryptocurrencies “the biggest bubble of our lifetimes,” and yet he is starting a $500 million fund to invest in them. Depending on whom you talk to, bitcoin’s value could double again -- or it could go down to zero.\n\n13. How can I buy bitcoin or invest in it?\n\nThere are a bunch of ways, all with different risks. People can buy the coins directly from exchanges like Coinbase. Accredited investors can also invest in vehicles like the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which tracks bitcoin’s price. Now investors can buy or sell bitcoin futures, and soon may be able to buy bitcoin exchange-traded funds, once regulators feel comfortable with the idea. But be warned: Even plenty of people who believe in bitcoin’s future think some wild rides lie ahead. As if in proof, the Nov. 29 surge to over $11,000 was followed by a 20 percent drop. And yes, you can bet on a crash.\n\nThe Reference Shelf', ""Energy and tech stocks lifted the Dow and S&P 500 to touch new highs on Monday before falling back in afternoon trading.

It is said that it was started by an anonymous group with a Japanese name in 2007, who set the standards and computing algorithms for its “production”.\n\nI will leave the details about its founding and focus now on the question as to why has it emerged? Bitcoins came into existence because of it is a currency that is not controlled by any state or central bank. It mainly relies on an old economic standard called “artificial scarcity” which is used to protect it from unauthorized access or control over the system.\n\nALSO READ: Bitcoin makes muted stock exchange debut at $15,000\n\nTherefore, if a hacker is able to produce the currency in the millions its value would automatically come to nought, as there is only a fixed amount in which the currency is produced.

This also seems to be a safe haven for people involved in price manipulation and all kinds of speculative activities.\n\nMajor industrial countries could face a grave challenge in the future because of these crypto-currencies and the reality or illusion of such technological innovation will blow up soon?\n\nThis article is also available in Arabic.\n\n______________________\n\nRashid bin Mohammed Al-Fawzan is a Saudi Arabian writer and commentator.\n\nLast Update: Monday, 11 December 2017 KSA 17:23 - GMT 14:23', 'The Transaction Issue: All Bitcoin transactions are not equal. There is a low Transaction Per Second (TPS) limit. Unless considerable changes are made to block size, the currency of the future may not be scalable.\n\nBitcoin is seen by many as an innovative universal payment system that works without a central bank. It boasts its user anonymity, decentralized peer-to-peer network, as well as a number of other benefits. As intuitive as this may seem, there are a number of serious issues with the longevity and current structure of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has hit as high as $19,000 per coin in the past week. The total Market Capitalization of the digital currency is higher than massive corporations such as Bank of America, Walt Disney, and Coca Cola, to name a few. Now cryptocurrency exchanges are experiencing massive inflows and millions of dollars have been made in Bitcoin investments.\n\nWith that being said, there are a number of concerning issues with Bitcoin that need to be addressed.\n\nCapped Total Circulating Supply\n\nSome may see this as a benefit, but there are risks involved. With a limited circulating supply the currency can be seen as a safe haven similar to a precious metal. When there is economic uncertainty Investors historically run to gold. Gold, like Bitcoin, is limited in supply. People believe Gold has value because of this. FIAT currency can be printed many times over, while gold and bitcoin cannot. There is an important difference between Bitcoin and the US Dollar that is overlooked. When money is stored in a bank it is insured by the FDIC. When money is fraudulently used on your account you can be reimbursed by the institution you bank with. On the other hand, if Bitcoins are lost by a holder, there will not be an institution to reimburse you, there is not central authority to run to, and the coins will sit lost and uncirculated. The coins are removed from the economy because you can no longer use them. As you very well know, Bitcoin is not physical, it is entirely digital. It is incredibly important to backup your Bitcoin wallet to avoid losses.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees\n\nOne argument in the past to purchasing Bitcoin is ""low transaction fees"". This is simply not the case. Anyone who has purchased Bitcoin knows there are often times large transaction fees, even with smaller transactions.\n\nAll of these transactions are supported by the massive Bitcoin mining operations all around the world. Miners set up large warehouses filled with supercomputers tasked with solving problems. The incentive is being rewarded with Bitcoin and transaction fees associated with supporting the ledger. These machines are simultaneously tasked with supporting the entire distributed ledger system that supports Bitcoin. When Bitcoin reaches its 21 Million circulating supply cap, will transaction fees skyrocket? How will these miners maintain profitability when there are no longer bitcoin to be mined? Surely this question comes with a number of assumptions. The gradual growth in technology and processing power will undoubtedly make the process more efficient. However, my concern is if and when this cryptocurrency becomes accepted universally by Billions of people around the world, how will the network keep up with the thousands if not millions of transactions per second? If transaction fees are already beginning to increase significantly, how will it support itself when it becomes the currency of the future? Why would someone pay for a cup of coffee using Bitcoin if the transaction fee is as large as the purchase price? This leads to my next point.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nI am by no means a tree hugger, but the amount of electricity being used per year to support Bitcoin mining operations is currently higher than the country of Ireland!\n\nIf Bitcoin ever becomes a universally accepted form of payment with more transactions than a company like Visa, It could cause an energy crisis. Visa processes on average 2,000 Tps (Transactions Per Second), and at its maximum can handle over 25,000 Tps. Bitcoin, due to its 1MB chain, currently averages 3-4 Tps, and at absolute maximum can handle up to 7 Tps. At the current rate, Bitcoin operations uses enough energy to power 3,000,000 US households per year. By comparison, the processing of Visa transactions uses enough energy to power 50,000 U.S households.\n\nAt the rate Bitcoin is gaining popularity, as mining operations continue to require more processing power by design, the amount of energy used by Bitcoin could be enough to power the entire United States by 2019.\n\nThe Transaction Issue\n\nUnless significant changes are made to increase block size in the future, Bitcoin will continue to use more energy, and users will continue to experience sizable transaction fees and a low maximum transaction rate. In short, at its current design, Bitcoin is not scalable. If Bitcoin users want this to turn into a global payment system they must increase the block size to support higher Tps. Miners queue transactions and are incentivised by prioritizing transactions that pay higher fees before transactions with lower fees. They do this by including higher fee transactions to the block before those with lower fees. This is due to the size of the block and the recent volume spike in the past months. Unless changes are made to increase the size of the block, Bitcoin transaction fees will continue to increase and will discourage users from transacting Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Selling Limits\n\nThere are limits to how many Bitcoins you can sell and withdraw in a given week on Coinbase and similar exchanges. These limits vary depending on your account verification. Even if your account is fully verified there may still be limits to how much you can sell in a given period. This is similar to the limits when withdrawing money from an ATM. Bitcoin may be considered a currency but as of now it acts as an investment. There is tremendous liquidity in the Bitcoin market, but there are limits on how much bitcoin you can sell and withdraw in a given period on a number of exchanges. It is important to understand these limits when investing in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Futures, But No Bitcoin\n\nA number of exchanges have announced the introduction of Bitcoin futures that come out this month and during 2018. This announcement is great news for institutions who want exposure to Bitcoin, and Miners who can now hedge operations. Bitcoin holders are excited because institutional money will start pouring into the currency. The problem with this is, it won\'t.\n\nMoney will not pour into Bitcoin. Institutions buying the contract will not own any Bitcoin at expiration of the contract. These are cash-settled synthetic derivatives that do not have direct impact on the price of Bitcoin at all. It is a speculative derivative based on reference rates calculated by the price aggregate of major bitcoin exchanges. It is similar to Forex trading on any other currency. Funds may be more willing to purchase Bitcoin given that they are now able to hedge, but the contracts themselves are entirely speculative. This is in addition to the fact that fees and margins on the contracts are already massive.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nIt is important to understand the risks associated with this innovate digital currency. Understanding the mining process, Bitcoins block-chain, and exchanges is essential to forming a well rounded opinion on the currency. Bitcoin has the opportunity to become the currency of the world, however, important changes must be made regarding block size and a number of other concerns to ensure the longevity of the cryptocurrency.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

He urged investors to weigh those risks before making an investment.\n\n""As with any other type of potential investment, if a promoter guarantees returns, if an opportunity sounds too good to be true, or if you are pressured to act quickly, please exercise extreme caution and be aware of the risk that your investment may be lost,"" Clayton said in a lengthy statement.\n\nClayton\'s comments come amid a historic rise in the valuation of bitcoin, thanks to growing interest with currency traders. Bitcoin traded as high as $17,370 per coin on Monday before settling back to $16,718 as of this writing, an increase of more than 1,600 percent since the beginning of the year.\n\nStill, the cryptocurrency\'s lack of government backing and regulation has led to volatility. After crossing the $11,000 mark for the first time last month, the currency lost 20 percent of its value in one day.\n\nAs investor interest in cryptocurrencies has increased in recent months, so has SEC focus on stamping out scams aimed at bilking investors excited by the possibilities of cryptocurrency\'s financial and technological revolution. The SEC filed a lawsuit last week to freeze the assets of PlexCorps, a company that promised a 1,354 percent profit in just 29 days to those who participated in an ICO -- a sale of the digital assets central to the cryptocurrency technology.\n\nClayton cautioned investors that no ICOs have been registered with his agency and that it hasn\'t approved any listing and trading of exchange-traded products that hold cryptocurrency. ""If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary,"" Clayton suggested.\n\nThe chairman noted that his agency has issued investor alerts, bulletins and statements in ICOs and cryptocurrencies and urged investors to read them. In 2014, the SEC issued an advisory cautioning investors to be wary because the cryptocurrency is uninsured, unregulated and volatile.\n\n""If you choose to invest in these products, please ask questions and demand clear answers,"" Clayton wrote, including a list of suggested questions, including ""Who exactly am I contracting with?"" and ""Where is my money going and what will be it be used for?""\n\niHate: CNET looks at how intolerance is taking over the internet.\n\nSpecial Reports: CNET\'s in-depth features in one place.', '', 'The weekend launch of a U.S. futures contract for bitcoin reflects widespread acceptance of the virtual currency, especially among investors in Asia, though regulators are wary.\n\nJapan and South Korea are among the world\'s top five markets for bitcoin trading, according to sites that track trading volume by currency. Here\'s a glance at the digital currency\'s rise in some of the region\'s major markets:\n\n———\n\nJAPAN:\n\nJapan was home to one of the earliest bitcoin communities, but it was started by expatriate residents and kept a low profile. Until a few years ago, bitcoin and other virtual currencies were left alone by regulators.\n\nFollowing the failure of a bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox, new laws were enacted to regulate bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Japan is the only major advanced economy with a licensing regime for digital currency intermediaries such as exchanges and payment providers.\n\nThat has helped make Japan the world\'s biggest market for speculative virtual currency trading, said Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing for Gatecoin, a virtual currency exchange.\n\n""There was very little interest back than at all and now it\'s a complete 360,"" said Glucksmann. ""It\'s the biggest market, everybody\'s talking about it.""\n\nBig Japanese banks have gotten involved, investing in bitcoin exchanges or letting them open bank accounts while developing their own related services. Some retailers accept payment in bitcoin.\n\nMany Japanese are familiar with currency trading since Japan is the world\'s biggest retail foreign exchange market.\n\n""You have people like hairdressers and housewives, people like that investing in crypto, in addition to the bigger players in Japan,"" said Glucksmann, who used to work at a bitcoin exchange in Japan. ""So the regulations have helped to fuel a lot of the legitimacy in the Japanese market.""\n\n———\n\nSOUTH KOREA:\n\nAbout a year and half ago, South Korea emerged as a very large market for speculative trading activities thanks to investors\' high risk appetite and fears of missing out.\n\nNow, just as the government prepares to regulate virtual currencies, big financial institutions are starting to get in on the action. Shinhan Bank is planning to offer virtual currency services like a bitcoin wallet,\n\nWorried over risks of speculative trading, in September South Korea banned initial coin offerings, or raising money through bitcoin or other virtual currencies.\n\nSenior officials at South Korea\'s financial watchdog have compared speculative trading in bitcoin to a ""Ponzi scheme"" and say they are mulling a ban.\n\n""We will not let financial institutions handle transactions related to virtual currencies,"" said Kim Yongbeom, vice chairman at Financial Services Commission, according to a media pool report Monday. ""The price of virtual currencies rises because of the expectation that the next person will buy it at the desired price and this is quite like a Ponzi scheme.""\n\nChairman Choi Jong-gu said one option is a total ban on virtual currencies, which would require revising existing legislation or enacting new laws.\n\nStill, bitcoin sells for a 20-30 percent premium in South Korean compared to other places, and this has spurred offshore trading to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as South Koreans buy bitcoin overseas and sell them back home.\n\n———\n\nCHINA:\n\nFor a brief time, China dominated bitcoin trading, at one point reportedly accounting for as much as 90 percent of volume. That dried up after Beijing tightened controls.\n\nThe lively bitcoin market had been set up by bitcoin miners, who had set up data centers taking advantage of China\'s cheap electricity and hardware to handle the intensive computing processes needed to ""mine"" new bitcoin.\n\nChina started cracked down on such activities last year just as the price of bitcoin began to surge. In September, regulators ordered all exchanges to shut down, banning initial coin offerings.\n\nChina\'s bitcoin exchanges have since migrated overseas or shifted to over-the-counter trading where exchanges match buyers and sellers who then connect through chat apps like Telegram. Payment is made in cash or through bank transfers and the exchange collects a fee.\n\nSome mainland China exchanges have refocused their efforts on their Hong Kong operations, said Leo Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong. He estimates there are about 10,000 bitcoin users in the Asian financial hub, including 1,000-2,000 active investors who have significant holdings or work for bitcoin related companies.\n\nWeese estimates that bitcoin prices are 5-8 percent higher in mainland China than Hong Kong. Speculators who can get around China\'s strict capital controls to profit from the price difference are driving some trading activity in the city, Weese said.\n\n""For them it\'s a way to make money,"" he said. ""They can buy the bitcoin in Hong Kong cheaply and they can sell them at a premium in China.""\n\n———\n\nSOUTHEAST ASIA:\n\nBitcoin\'s rising popularity in Indonesia has alarmed the country\'s central bank, which said last week it would ban it as a payment method next year.\n\nBank Indonesia spokesman Agusman Zainal said more a ""assertive rule"" on virtual currencies is planned.\n\nHe said the bank is concerned bitcoin might be used for fraud or other illegal activities like terrorism, money laundering, prostitution, drug trafficking.\n\n""In the context of the payment system, bitcoin is not a valid means of payment,"" Zainal said. ""The reason for prohibiting is in order to implement prudential principles, safeguard business competition, risk control and consumer protection.""\n\n————\n\nAP Writers Niniek Karmini in Jakarta and Youkyung Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.']"
12/12/2017,"[""“The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking,” a team of Morgan Stanley economists wrote earlier this year.\n\nAs it turns out, while few people want to use Bitcoin as a currency, plenty want to treat it as an investable security, similar to gold or silver, especially while the price keeps rising.\n\nI assumed that the blockchain would eclipse Bitcoin itself.\n\nOne of the earliest predictions among Bitcoin skeptics and boosters alike was that Bitcoin itself would be just a predecessor technology to the real, lasting innovation: the blockchain — the peer-to-peer ledger system that records cryptocurrency transactions and allows them to operate without a central authority. I agreed, thinking that the blockchain had real promise, but that Bitcoin would ultimately fade away.\n\nFour years later, there has, in fact, been enormous hype around blockchain projects. (One British company added the word “blockchain” to its name and saw its shares immediately jump nearly 400 percent.) But that frenzy hasn’t detracted from investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin itself — in fact, it has amplified it. And the potential applicability of blockchain technology to all kinds of different industries, from auto manufacturing to insurance to groceries, has inspired lots of non-techies to learn about cryptocurrencies, and served as an intellectual on-ramp for new Bitcoin investors.\n\nI assumed that regulators would crack down faster.\n\nIn the frontier days of cryptocurrency, it seemed that every other story was about how criminals and tax-evaders were using Bitcoin to buy and sell illegal goods and services. A huge dark-net narcotics market, Silk Road, was broken up, and its owner was sentenced to life in prison. Several large cryptocurrency sites suffered hacks and thefts. It was easy to think that these problems would lead regulators to take swift action against Bitcoin.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut regulators have been late to the game. The I.R.S. didn’t issue official guidance on the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies until 2014, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has just recently started to look at whether initial coin offerings, a kind of public auction of new cryptocurrencies, should be more closely regulated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[ALSO READ: Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy]\n\nPartly, this is because some Trump-era regulators seem more interested in rolling back existing rules than making new ones. But it’s also a reflection of the way regulators tend to operate — many are reactive, and Bitcoin is still a relatively esoteric product that hasn’t claimed many real-world victims yet. There might well be a regulatory reckoning as Bitcoin moves closer to the mainstream, but for now, it’s still the Wild West.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Few thought digital currency had any chance of succeeding, and many shared the view of Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who has called Bitcoin a “fraud” that would only appeal to murderers and drug dealers.\n\nBut banks are ultimately service businesses, and I underestimated Wall Street’s philosophical flexibility when confronted with a new product that its clients really wanted to trade. Now, in the same way that the rise of junk bonds created an entirely new lucrative finance niche in the 1980s, Bitcoin’s rapid ascent has pulled even the most traditional financial institutions into the fray. There are now dozens of cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds, and even Goldman Sachs is clearing Bitcoin futures transactions for some clients. The arrival of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market has begun to make Bitcoin look less like a fringe technology project, and more like any other securities market.\n\nI assumed that Bitcoin’s extreme volatility would be a turnoff.\n\nWhen Bitcoin’s price was swinging wildly between $100 and $200, sometimes within a few days, I thought to myself, “Who would sign up for such a roller-coaster ride?” I naïvely thought that what people liked about money was its stability, and knowing that $100 today would still be worth $100 tomorrow.\n\nBut you know what’s more popular than stable monetary instruments? Casinos! People love to gamble, and the spectacular rise of Bitcoin — especially in the age of social media, which tends to hasten trends and encourage bandwagon behavior — has encouraged a set of thrill-seeking speculators to bet big on the currency, hoping to make a quick buck and get out before a crash.\n\nThis behavioral dynamic should have been clear to me earlier. In a low-interest-rate environment, when many of the fastest-growing companies are privately held and wages aren’t keeping pace with inflation, there aren’t many investments that can produce outsize returns for the average person. Many Bitcoin buyers aren’t bothered that their $100 could become $200 overnight, or crash to $10 — in fact, that’s part of the appeal.\n\nReal Bitcoin enthusiasts, of course, will say that I’m still missing the point, and that today’s trading mania is just a prelude to an even bigger, more transformational era of cryptocurrency. And while I still have my doubts, I can’t credibly predict that they’re wrong. After all, look what happened the first time."", '“To the moon!” The phrase is the battle cry of true believers in cryptocurrency bitcoin—and charts of its price in recent weeks point directly heavenward. Yet beyond a batch of newly minted crypto-millionaires, the digital asset’s recent bull run has also exposed long-standing weakness in the underlying technology that could crimp bitcoin’s long-term viability.\n\nBitcoin was a gift to the world from Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or persons who laid out the design in a 2008 white paper. The paper complained that conventional financial institutions create unnecessary friction: banks and other mediators pass on costs as transaction fees that make “small casual transactions” impractical. Nakamoto said bitcoin would change that, by employing a peer-to-peer network backed by unbreakable math to verify transactions, removing the need for centralized institutions. The paper doesn’t use the term, but it’s a clear reference to the concept of micropayments—the idea that very small digital payments could change the economics of the internet, or help people in the developing world.\n\nNine years later, Nakamoto’s invention has been immensely successful. A single bitcoin will set you back more than $17,500; the price has risen 17-fold since January. But the currency has not introduced a new era of economic enlightenment greased with tiny transactions. Why not? The currency Nakamoto invented to avoid transaction fees has a problem with transaction fees, among other things.\n\nParticipants in bitcoin transactions pay fees to assure that the global network of computers that manage the currency will process the transaction. Tuesday afternoon, Eastern time, it cost around $19 to have a transaction processed in 10 minutes. By one estimate, paying a smaller fee of $3 would leave your transaction taking an estimated 24 hours. Paying a friend for pizza? Stick to Venmo.\n\nVideogame marketplace Steam stopped accepting bitcoin last week, citing high fees. Erik Norland, senior economist at derivatives market company CME group, said early this month that high fees could be the thing that brings bitcoin’s current rally to a halt.\n\nBitcoin’s transaction fees are so high because the peer-to-peer network that powers the currency has very limited capacity by the standards of modern digital infrastructure. Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor who has studied bitcoin’s design, estimates that at best the bitcoin network could process seven transactions per second, but typically achieves 3.3. Visa reports processing 29.2 billion transactions in the three months through September, a rate of 317 million a day, or 3,674 a second.\n\nBlockchain entrepreneur Preethi Kasireddy, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, recently wrote a detailed post cautioning of the technical limitations of bitcoin and related systems. She says the underlying technology of what are dubbed blockchains is wholly unready for widespread use. “To make anything mainstream you have to make it scalable,” she says.\n\nBitcoin transactions are powered by people who set up shop as “miners,” running software originally designed by Nakamoto that creates the network that does the work of processing transactions. Bitcoin’s capacity is set by the frequency with which miners add new batches of confirmed transactions to bitcoin’s digital ledger, or blockchain—currently every 10 minutes—and the way the bitcoin protocol routes data through its network.\n\nThe bottleneck is deeply ingrained into the system’s current design. Sirer and one of his grad students have built software that takes the pulse of the bitcoin network distributed across the globe. During 2016, their measurements show that the physical infrastructure underlying the bitcoin network grew about 70 percent faster, thanks to upgraded computers and telecom networks. Yet the bitcoin network could process roughly the same number of transactions. “That’s a strange thing,” says Sirer. “The network underneath is getting faster, but the protocol is unable to make use of that.”\n\nScaling problems have also been dragging on the second-largest cryptocurrency system, Ethereum, recently. A trading game in which players buy and breed virtual cats called cryptokitties exploded in popularity this month. The rush of activity caused transaction fees on the platform, and the number of transactions waiting to process, to jump.\n\nCryptocurrency aficionados have ideas for making these networks more scalable. In August, a group of people worried about capacity split off a new currency, Bitcoin Cash. It’s up three times since its debut, at around $1,600, but still receives much less attention than the original bitcoin. Sirer and Cornell colleague Ittay Eyal devised a design called Bitcoin-NG in 2015. It has been adopted by a startup called Waves that says its system can handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nNone of those alternative currencies looks to seriously challenge bitcoin’s market share among the cryptocurrency curious any time soon. And some investors who got rich in the recent rally argue that it doesn’t need to scale up greatly anyway—they spin bitcoin as a “store of value” something like gold rather than a currency as Nakamoto described. Others, including Warren Buffett, have countered that a lack of underlying usefulness is a terminal problem. Goldman Sachs’ CEO recently said that bitcoin is too volatile to be a good store of value.\n\nSome bitcoin devotees who help maintain the currency’s network and code are thinking about ways to scale and achieve Nakamoto’s original vision. But Kasireddy cautions that there are no technically proven options implemented at scale. Even if there were, bitcoin lacks a clear mechanism for implementing upgrades, thanks to Nakamoto’s decentralized design. “There’s no real governance process,” she says. There’s a lot more to bitcoin than just the price.', 'I am confident that blockchain technology will thrive and survive, but unless Bitcoin improves, it will not emerge as the winning blockchain currency.\n\nUntil Bitcoin cures these technological issues, it will not be adopted as an actual currency and is merely a tool for speculators.\n\nBitcoin is technologically inferior to its peers as its transactions are both slow and up to 100x more costly than those of other coins.\n\nBitcoin is not an investment that can be valued on its cash flows, it is merely speculation based on what some future buyer might pay.\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nBitcoin (COIN, OTCQX:GBTC) is not an investment, but is instead just speculation, as defined by Seth Klarman. Because of this, its value is not tethered and will fluctuate wildly. As it is presently implemented, Bitcoin is also an inferior cryptocurrency (compared to other notable cryptocurrencies), with transaction fees over 100x higher. Further, these costly transactions do not benefit the consumer. Rather than being faster or offering other advantages, Bitcoin\'s network is near the limits of its growth, and transactions can be delayed for hours or days.\n\nBitcoin\'s value as a currency is dubious at best at a time when transactions cost an average of $22 each. This is far too much for it to see use as a currency, rather than just as a tool for speculators. Until technical issues with Bitcoin are fixed, it is inferior to other common cryptocurrencies and unlikely to retain its value or see increased use as a currency.\n\nI see a bright future for cryptocurrencies in general, but Bitcoin needs technical fixes or else other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash, will surpass it.\n\n1. Bitcoin Is Not An Investment, It Is Speculation\n\nFig. 1: Bitcoin price history\n\n^NYB data by YCharts\n\nI have owned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since November 2013, although I recently exited my Bitcoin position but continue to hold Bitcoin Cash. That said, I fully realize that this is just speculating, and not investing. Bitcoin is not an investment.\n\nIn Margin of Safety (yours for only $1,270), hedge fund manager Seth A. Klarman writes:\n\nJust as financial-market participants can be divided into two groups, investors and speculators, assets and securities can often be characterized as either investments or speculations. The distinction is not clear to most people. Both investments and speculations can be bought and sold. Both typically fluctuate in price and can thus appear to generate investment returns. But there is one critical difference: investments throw off cash flow for the benefit of the owners; speculations do not. They return to the owners of speculations depends exclusively on the vagaries of the resale market.""\n\n(Emphasis in the original)\n\nAs defined by Klarman, investments throw off cash flow for the benefit of the owners. Investments include stocks, bonds, certificates of deposits and interest-bearing savings accounts, REITs, rental properties, and more. Each of these assets has in common that they can be valued: You can add up the sum of the cash flows from those assets, discount them back to present values, and determine a value for those investments.\n\nIn contract, speculations do not put off cash flows. To use a washed-up example, tulip bulbs in 1637 were speculations: Tulips do not put off cash flows, although they may bloom. Other more relevant examples of speculation include fiat currencies, collectibles including fine art or sports cards, and precious metals such as gold (GLD, IAU). In each case, these items do not put off cash flows, and their own value is what they may later be exchanged for. Bitcoin falls solidly in the category of speculations, rather than investments.\n\nNYU Stern professor Aswath Damodaran distinguishes between two games which may be played by investors: The pricing game and the value game.\n\nFig. 2: The Pricing Game vs. The Value Game (Source: Aswath Damodaran)\n\nInvestments may be bought and sold based on either the pricing game, or the value game. For example, I might purchase Roku (ROKU), based on a belief that the present value of Roku\'s future cash flows will exceed the price that I pay for shares of the company today. This is the value game. In this game, tools such as DCF valuations may be used, or the use of ratio analysis, in order to determine whether a given investment is likely to rise or fall in the future, be it the short-term or long-term future.\n\nHowever, others may choose to buy or sell Roku based on their expectations of what the stock price will do in the future, most commonly in the short term. This is the pricing game. Common tools used in the pricing game may include analysis of investor sentiment on Roku, or analysis of the price chart for technical indicators that a stock may be reaching a ""support level"" or experiencing a ""break out."" It is probable that most of trades of volatile companies like Roku are based on the pricing game rather than the value game.\n\n2. Bitcoin Prices Are Untethered To Reality\n\nBitcoin and other speculations are different than investments. Investments like Roku can be bought and sold using either the pricing game or the value game. However, speculations like Bitcoin can be bought and sold only based on the pricing game. While I own Bitcoin, I know that it will never produce cash flows in any form. If I am to profit from Bitcoin, like gold or the Swiss franc, it will because I am able to sell my Bitcoin purchase for more than I bought it for. This is because Bitcoin is not an investment, it is just speculation: The value of Bitcoin is based solely on what others are willing to pay for it.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is just speculation, Bitcoin is not tethered to any sort of reality. When reviewing the stock price of Wal-Mart (WMT), there are real cash flow factors to keep in mind: revenue, margins, income, dividends, buybacks, and the like. These factors can be used to value Wal-Mart. Because of the relative consistency of many of these factors, if we asked a crowd of financial experts to value Wal-Mart, they are likely to come up with relatively similar valuations, and those valuations are likely to be near the market price.\n\nIn contrast, beliefs in the value of Bitcoin vary wildly. Valuations of the cryptocurrency vary from $0 up to $1,000,000. The prices at which Bitcoin trades are not based on any underlying value provided by the currency, but instead, based on market sentiment about what Bitcoin will be worth in the future. Because of this, Bitcoin has experienced wild fluctuations in price, and will continue to fluctuate.\n\n3. Other Cryptocurrencies Will Surpass Bitcoin\n\nFig. 3: The market cap of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies (Source: Coin Market Cap)\n\nToday, Bitcoin is the gorilla in the cryptocurrency room. Its $263 billion market caps the $43 billion of Ethereum, the closest challenger to the throne.\n\nThis strength is largely build on brand name and first-mover advantage. Bitcoin was the first decentralized digital currency, and gained a reputation prior to any other cryptocurrency. Because of this, when consumers think of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is their first thought. Thus, since these speculations are only subject to the pricing game, Bitcoin\'s price is significantly higher than that of its peers.\n\nThis name value advantage is unlikely to be permanent. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, Bitcoin is not backed by any nation or other strong entity that is likely to protect the currency in the future. While Coca-Cola (KO) has retained a strong brand name for decades, this is not an accident: the Coca-Cola brand is backed by the corporation itself, through advertising, quality control, and other active efforts to keep the brand in the public eye and to ensure that the public has a positive view of the brand. As a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin has no such billion-dollar entity likely to advertise and fight for the rights of Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies.\n\nFurther, unlike traditional currency, there are technological reasons why Bitcoin is unlikely to be able to retain its position as the top cryptocurrency.\n\n4. Bitcoin Transaction Fees Dwarf Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nFig. 4: Bitcoin\'s High Transaction Fees (Source: BitInfoCharts)\n\nBitcoin\'s transaction fees are significantly more expensive than those of its competitors. This is a major competitive disadvantage, since one of the primary benefits of a cryptocurrency is the ability to easily and inexpensively move money between parties and wallets without having to pay high costs. The value of ""decentralizing"" the currency is lost when the price for that decentralization results in fees nearing $22 for each purchase.\n\nIf you wanted to walk to the store and purchase a loaf of bread, would you be willing to stomach a $22 surcharge on that transaction? Of course not. Similarly, Bitcoin is simply not useful as a currency in and of itself with these fees. Admittedly, there are ways around these fees, such as off-chain transactions. However, these transactions lose many of the key advantages of Bitcoin itself, such as anonymity and decentralization. For example, if you use Coinbase off-chain transactions, by the Blockchain, those coins are Coinbase\'s and not yours. Thus, if Coinbase were to be seized by the US government or taken down by hackers, your coins could vanish.\n\nFig. 5: Comparison of transaction fees (Source: BitInfoCharts)\n\nCrypto Average Transaction Fee (USD) Median Transaction Fee (USD) Bitcoin $21.74 $14.17 Ethereum $0.86 $0.40 Bitcoin Cash $0.15 $0.27 Litecoin $0.27 $0.08 Dash $0.67 $0.04\n\nBitcoin\'s transaction costs dwarf those of other currencies, and are high enough that Bitcoin is not useful as a currency except for extremely large transactions. Such transactions are also less likely to occur in Bitcoin due to its high volatility: Why pay $22 for a Bitcoin transaction and risk gaining or losing 20+% on volatility when you can pay for and conduct transactions in a fiat currency?\n\nBitcoin fees are high right now for technical reasons. One change that was made in the Bitcoin Cash fork is the Bitcoin Cash has an 8MB block which clears over 37,000 transactions. In contrast, Bitcoin is having scalability issues due to its 1MB block size. These scalability issues are severe, and will limit Bitcoin\'s adoption as a currency:\n\nIn contrast to Visa\'s peak of 47,000 transactions per second, the bitcoin network\'s theoretical maximum capacity sits at under 7 transactions per second."" - Wikipedia\n\nAs a result, those wishing to conduct Bitcoin transactions must bid on a miner\'s fee, which is the transaction fee that is given as a ""reward"" to miners for confirming the transaction. This fee rises, as seen in Fig. 5, because of supply and demand: There is more demand for Bitcoin transactions than the network can handle.\n\nThere are efforts underway to reduce Bitcoin\'s transaction fees. However, those efforts have been a failure to date, given the transaction fees quoted above. For example, SegWit intended to reduce Bitcoin transaction fees. According to Crypto Coin News, ""Bitcoin Fees Are High, But They Will Decrease With SegWit Soon."" Disappointingly for users, that article is from August, and quotes fees in the $1 to $5 range.\n\nFees remain extremely high. Further, the unpredictability of fees has led to uncertainty in transaction processing times. An internet search for ""Bitcoin unconfirmed transaction"" results in numerous forum posts from users wondering why their transactions have not been processed after days or weeks. While these problems are both avoidable and solvable (by using higher fees and child pays for parent transactions), these problems present a steep learning curve for those wishing to use the currency.\n\n5. Bitcoin\'s Rocky Future\n\nIf Bitcoin is to gain widespread use as an actual currency used for transactions, rather than merely a tool for speculating, it must address these issues of transaction fees and transaction times. Widespread use as a currency is unlikely to occur in a world where transactions cost $22 on average, and where transactions can take hours, days, or weeks to confirm.\n\nBitcoin will also face additional challenges as new cryptocurrencies are launched. This will be especially so if and whether cryptocurrencies are launched that are back by sovereign nations, by large corporations, or even by assets. For a speculative asset like Bitcoin, with its short and volatile history, the entry of these types of assets into the space could spell doom for investor confidence in the currency, and therefore for the value of Bitcoins.\n\nBlockchain is a powerful technology. One potential use of blockchain technology would be to launch asset-backed currencies. For example, what if a unit of a cryptocurrency was readily exchangeable for, e.g., a portion of the S&P 500 (SPY) or by real estate? Startups are launching cryptocurrencies which intend to back their digital currency with real assets. For example, BrickCoin is an REIT-backed cryptocurrency, where the digital coins will mark ownership of real property. It will be interesting to watch BrickCoin and other asset-backed cryptocurrencies develop, and to see whether any may be able to garner enough support for actual use as a currency, rather than merely as a tool for speculation.\n\nI believe in blockchain technology, and I expect it to significantly alter the economy for years to come. However, Bitcoin, as currently implemented, is not the blockchain-based technology that is likely to take off and see actual use as a currency among consumers. Instead, Bitcoin is merely a tool for speculators at this stage. I am hopeful the Bitcoin\'s shortcomings will be remedied, and that transaction fees and times will be reduced to allow the cryptocurrency to bloom not just as a tool for speculators, but also as a currency that can be exchanged for goods and services.\n\nWe are not there yet.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long BCH, ROKU.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

""It is going to be the year when every friend and relative will want to know how much you have and how to purchase it. The topic of Bitcoin is going to be the ultimate water-cooler conversation,"" says Woodin.\n\nHere are some top expert\'s predictions for what will happen with Bitcoin in the coming year.\n\n1. Taxation will be a huge issue.\n\nit is important to be aware of the tax issues and how to report gains accurately to the Internal Revenue Service. Next year, we will see more on what Bitcoin millionaires (and billionaires) will have to report their gains due to the IRS clamping down.\n\n2. The number of cryptocurrency adopters will rise.\n\nNo doubt there will be a rise in the number of people using cryptocurrencies. Yonatan Sela, SVP business development of PROPS by YouNow, which uses blockchain to build a media ecosystem, estimates that by the end of 2018, we\'ll see over 50 million people worldwide holding at least one cryptocurrency. ""My hope is that Bitcoin will continue to maintain value as a form of digital gold, and the promise of digital cash will be fulfilled by Dash,"" says Node40\'s Woodin, referring to a popular crypto-currency.\n\n3. Bitcoin develops into a payment network.\n\nTrevor Koverko, CEO of Polymath which specializes in cryptocurrency technology believes we are going to see Bitcoin emerge as a full-fledged payment network. ""Currently Bitcoin is being used as a speculative asset and store of value. But as scaling solutions like the Lightning Network emerge, Bitcoin\'s utility dramatically increase along with its price. The real question is, will it be the bitcoin \'main chain\' that has the courage to adopt these upgrades, or will it be another chain like Bitcoin Cash?"" says Koverko.\n\n4. Investors will diversify their crypto assets.\n\nMost investors will become aware that besides Bitcoin, there is Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and IOTA. Mark Lurie, CEO of Biddable says that for investors, there is going to be a strong move toward diversifying crypto-assets and managing investments the same way that investors look at more traditional assets and investing.\n\n5. Interest from institutional investors will increase.\n\nMike Poutre, CEO of The Crypto Company, believes that 2018 will be the year that institutional investors enter the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n""Less volatility in Bitcoin will allow continued expansion in alternative cryptocurrencies. We will also see the rise of securities tokens in response to increased regulation. Conservatively, I predict the entire industry will reach a market cap of $5 trillion by the end"" of 2018,"" says Poutre.\n\n""There will be a lot more institutional capital that will all go to the highest quality projects. That\'s what happened during the financial crisis with venture capital and growth equity rounds, too. Most companies could not raise any funds, but those that could...did it at really high valuations. Even though it was in the middle of the financial crisis, there was a capital flight to quality,"" adds Lurie.\n\n6. Expect to see more regulation.\n\nAs Bitcoin booms, regulation will first come to ICOs before moving on to cryptocurrencies directly. However, it is difficult to now predict if regulation will have a positive or negative impact on the industry.\n\nDmitry Zhulin, co-founder of INS Ecosystem says, ""Bitcoin is expected to further [rise] to approximately $30,000-$40,000 in 2018 based on its convenience and further adoption as a means of payment and capital preservation. Despite an increase in regulation in the crypto space, I believe that blockchain as a technology will not be hindered by heavy regulation.""\n\nIt looks like 2018 could be another action-packed year for Bitcoin and crypto currencies.\n\nMore of What\'s Trending on TheStreet:', 'Love it or hate it, I bet you’ve been talking about it – Bitcoin is on everyone’s mind as the price surges and ebbs its way to towards the $20,000 mark.\n\nThis is a BizNews Premium article.

My background comes from the world of emerging tech and startups, hence my view and analysis tend to be outside the box.\n\nThis is a brief overview of some of the work I presented there, including my view of where the crypto asset markets are at in Q4 2017.\n\nIf you\'re new to the market, there\'s a lot to learn. Understanding cryptocurrencies is akin to learning about an alien species. Even our markets do not correlate to any other traditional asset class. (I published this ""3 cats and a moon"" fractal pattern that reliably traded for three years, and it ceased to work after publication).\n\nThis leads to the first point: the bitcoin market is changing and actively changes frequently.\n\nWhat we\'re seeing now appears to be a trend that began in Q4 2017 with the decision by U.S. regulators not to approve a bitcoin ETF. The publicity from the ETF buildup described bitcoin as a legitimate asset instead of the ""drug money"" rhetoric.\n\nMy theory is that Wall Street investor interest mounted during this phase and the money that was denied an opportunity to enter via a regulated ETF, came in anyway directly through the exchange markets around March.\n\nWe saw an uptick in price when it should have dropped lower according to existing models. Additionally, we saw bitcoin\'s long-term declining volatility trend break upwards as large volumes of money started trading the swings.\n\nBitcoin\'s price chart as of Q4 2017 started carving a new fractal pattern. Fractals reflect the market\'s psychological profile. By my reckoning, a new animal had arrived.\n\nThe price chart was now determined by a hybrid of traditional bitcoin traders and early Wall Street trader money.\n\nMarching toward M2\n\nBut new traders are entering a market with a not insignificant history.\n\nAttempts have already been made to attempt to value cryptocurrency networks, taking inspiration from other trading tools. NVT Ratio is another invention of mine. This works like bitcoin\'s PE Ratio, indicating when BTC price has outstripped fundamental value.\n\nLike PE Ratio in equities, fast-growth companies exhibit higher ratios, similarly, bitcoin exhibited higher NVT Ratio values in its early high-growth phase.\n\nBut, you may be asking, growth to what? The answer is becoming a significant part of the global money supply. In 2017, all the crypto asset markets combined equal half a percent of the world\'s M2 money supply, and we are at approximately 1 percent of the world\'s population as users. This is an equivalent adoption level as 1996 for the internet.\n\nBitcoin users double every 12 months in our current phase of the adoption S-curve. This was calculated with my work tracking Google Trends data on the assumption that users search BTC/USD price.\n\nIf this trend continues, we are nine years away from half the world using bitcoin.\n\nThat might seem like a lot to take in, but it\'s supported by data.\n\nHere’s another view of bitcoin\'s growth on a long-term chart where each altitude climb is a 10x increase. Though bitcoin\'s share of the 0.5% seems small, but we are actually 66% of the way on our journey to usurp M1 money.\n\nLet me reiterate something that sounds radical – bitcoin is four years out from exceeding the world reserve currency’s M1 supply.\n\nIf volatility continues it\'s on its 9-year downward trend, we should also see bitcoin price stability near fiat FOREX levels. This means grandma can have a USD savings account earning 1 percent per year, or she can have a BTC savings account earning 1 percent per week at similar risk profiles.\n\nThinking in trillions\n\nSo let me zoom out a bit and talk about where we are in the 10,000-year view.\n\nIn 2013, they called bitcoin drug money. In 2017, they called it a bubble. It’s not in a bubble. We\'re on the path of digitizing the world. We are seeing the final phase of the Post-Industrial Revolution which started in the 1960s-1990s with the invention of the microprocessor through to the expansion of the internet.\n\nBitcoin is not just money. It’s the invention of an internet-native digital scarcity. And with that breakthrough, software will eat the financial world.\n\nBlockchain assets will be bigger than the approximately $70 trillion in money, there’s another $80 trillion in equities, and I’m told well over $200 trillion in real estate. This will all be digitized.\n\n""Stealth,"" ""awareness,"" ""mania,"" and ""blow-off"" are the stages of the investment cycle.\n\nWith Bitcoin only the geek money invested in the stealth phase. Smart money was displaced to the ""awareness phase.""\n\nNormally institutional money arrives during the awareness phase, but due to regulatory bars institutions were not allowed to enter. Hence we are now seeing institutional money arrive late competing with retail money in the early mania phase.\n\nIt\'s my belief this could create a super bull season right now in Q4 2017 and into 2018.\n\nThe new frontier\n\nBut bitcoin\'s maturity is also likely to push newer investors toward higher yields, and as expected, we have seen bitcoin itself losing its dominance over the last five years.\n\nThis is a sign of the markets starting to mature. A fully digital economy should not be 95 percent money. All industries will eventually fill this economy.\n\nLet\'s look at the individual performance of the other coins. This is a chart of the top 125 coins by network value. As you can see there are plenty of investment opportunities that can outperform bitcoin. (Bitcoin can be seen as the longest and oldest price line above).\n\nThat last slide was the top 125 outliers, this chart shows essentially the entire market, with the darker colors moving to lighter represent the top 200, 400, 600, etc.\n\nNewer coins are outperforming older coins in general. Also buying the entire market tends to be neutral in performance.\n\nIn this environment, selection and filtering is key. I suggest selecting just as a venture capitalist would. Vet the team, call them up, are they competent? Check their tech, read their source code, is the tech stack useful? How big can the market grow to? What are the token dynamics, is the token designed for high velocity or low?\n\nSuccessful projects will follow what I call the ""Falcon 9 launch trajectory.""\n\nThe goal is to ride the early steep trajectory for two to three years, then roll the investment into new projects capable of climbing steeply. It\'s a venture capital model. Returns that bitcoin offered in 2011-2013 are still available today, but today there’s more work involved to find the gems.\n\nDisagree?

South Korea has simply banned ICOs, noting in September that “stern penalties” would be levied on anyone issuing one.\n\nUnder Clayton, who joined the SEC in January following a nomination from President Trump, the Commission has been cautiously expanding its enforcement of cryptocurrency regulation. On the same day as his statement, the organisation announced that it had successfully dissuaded a company from launching an ICO to raise funds for its “blockchain-based food review service”.\n\n“Munchee was seeking $15m in capital to improve an existing iPhone app centered on restaurant meal reviews and create an ‘ecosystem’ in which Munchee and others would buy and sell goods and services using the tokens,” the SEC said. “In the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasised that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens. The company also emphasised it would take steps to create and support a secondary market for the tokens.”\n\nThose actions, the SEC said, meant it was fair to conclude that Munchee was offering a security that fell under the regulator’s purview. “A token can be a security based on the long-standing facts and circumstances test that includes assessing whether investors’ profits are to be derived from the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of others,” it said. Munchee agreed to withdraw the offering, avoiding a penalty from the Commission.\n\nStephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said: “We will continue to scrutinise the market vigilantly for improper offerings that seek to sell securities to the general public without the required registration or exemption. In deciding not to impose a penalty, the Commission recognised that the company stopped the ICO quickly, immediately returned the proceeds before issuing tokens, and cooperated with the investigation.”"", 'As Americans are continuing to read and hear more and more about Bitcoin, some still do not know exactly what it is?\n\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute Vice President Jim Harper shared a little more about the phenomenon.\n\n""Bitcoin is best thought of as digital gold,"" Harper, who is also the former global policy counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation. ""That is, it\'s a rare item that you can trade online, [and] even though the online world makes lots of copies of things, it\'s the one thing that can\'t be copied because of the Bitcoin Blockchain – the ledger that tracks all the transactions.""\n\nThe first-ever Bitcoin future began trading Sunday, as the increasingly popular virtual currency made its debut on a major U.S. exchange.\n\nHarper sees its expansion as another step in the widespread adoption of bitcoin.\n\n""It\'s passed a lot of hurdles in recent years, and that\'s a new one,"" he elaborated. ""It\'s often thought of as a good investment because it\'s counter-cyclical. That is, it has nothing to do with much other in the way of investments, so if you want to broaden your portfolio holding some Bitcoin along with stocks and bonds – maybe precious metals and other things – it\'s a way to diversify.""\n\nFor those who have any concerns about a bubble, a simple web search finds opinions on the subject, which are mixed.\n\n""It\'s always wise to be watching out for a bubble when things go up in price a lot, and bitcoin has gone up in price a lot, but nobody knows exactly when it will stop,"" Harper pointed out. ""Bubbles are always easy to call in the rearview mirror, but right now, Bitcoin is on its way up – whether it\'s a bubble or whether it\'s not, will be something we find out later on.""\n\nThe wise thing to do, says Harper, is to invest cautiously.\n\n""If you\'re going to buy, just buy a little bit – enough that you\'re willing to lose,"" Harper advised. ""Already online, you see names that I\'ve never heard of, and I know a lot of people in the Bitcoin world who claim to be the expert – who made the right buy at the right time. Well, you should be as leery of those [who sell gold] as you are about those who sell everything else you see online.""']"
